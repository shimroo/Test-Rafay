james


#1 new york times bestseller - national book award winner - one of the new york times book review's 10 best books of the year - shortlisted for the booker prize - kirkus prize winner - a brilliant, action-packed reimagining of adventures of huckleberry finn, both harrowing and darkly humorous, told from the enslaved jim's point of viewin development as a feature film to be produced by steven spielberg - a best book of the year: the new york times book review, la times, the new yorker, the atlantic, the economist, time, and more."genius"--the atlantic - "a masterpiece that will help redefine one of the classics of american literature, while also being a major achievement on its own."--chicago tribune - "a provocative, enlightening literary work of art."--the boston globe - "everett's most thrilling novel, but also his most soulful."--the new york timeswhen the enslaved jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in new orleans, separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby jackson island until he can formulate a plan. meanwhile, huck finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. as all readers of american literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the mississippi river toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the free states and beyond.while many narrative set pieces of adventures of huckleberry finn remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river's banks, encountering the scam artists posing as the duke and dauphin...), jim's agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.brimming with the electrifying humor and lacerating observations that have made everett a "literary icon" (oprah daily), and one of the most decorated writers of our lifetime, james is destined to be a cornerstone of twenty-first century american literature.











kindred


selected by the atlantic as one of the great american novels. ("you have to read them.")from the new york times bestselling author of parable of the sower and macarthur “genius” grant, nebula, and hugo award winner the visionary time-travel classic whose black female hero is pulled through time to face the horrors of american slavery and explores the impacts of racism, sexism, and white supremacy then and now. “i lost an arm on my last trip home. my left arm.”dana’s torment begins when she suddenly vanishes on her 26th birthday from california, 1976, and is dragged through time to antebellum maryland to rescue a boy named rufus, heir to a slaveowner’s plantation. she soon realizes the purpose of her summons to the past: protect rufus to ensure his assault of her black ancestor so that she may one day be born. as she endures the traumas of slavery and the soul-crushing normalization of savagery, dana fights to keep her autonomy and return to the present.blazing the trail for neo-slavery narratives like colson whitehead’s the underground railroad and ta-nehisi coates’s the water dancer, butler takes one of speculative fiction’s oldest tropes and infuses it with lasting depth and power. dana not only experiences the cruelties of slavery on her skin but also grimly learns to accept it as a condition of her own existence in the present. “where stories about american slavery are often gratuitous, reducing its horror to explicit violence and brutality, kindred is controlled and precise” (new york times).“reading octavia butler taught me to dream big, and i think it’s absolutely necessary that everybody have that freedom and that willingness to dream.” —n. k. jemisin this book has been published with two different covers. customers will be shipped the cover available.











a little devil in america


national book award finalist • a sweeping, genre-bending “masterpiece” (minneapolis star tribune) exploring black art, music, and culture in all their glory and complexity—from soul train, aretha franklin, and james brown to the fresh prince of bel-air, whitney houston, and beyoncé one of the ten best books of the year: chicago tribune, the philadelphia inquirer, the dallas morning news, publishers weekly “gorgeous essays that reveal the resilience, heartbreak, and joy within black performance.”—brit bennett, #1 new york times bestselling author of the vanishing half “i was a devil in other countries, and i was a little devil in america, too.” inspired by these few words, spoken by josephine baker at the 1963 march on washington, macarthur “genius grant” fellow and bestselling author hanif abdurraqib has written a profound and lasting reflection on how black performance is inextricably woven into the fabric of american culture. each moment in every performance he examines—whether it’s the twenty-seven seconds in “gimme shelter” in which merry clayton wails the words “rape, murder,” a schoolyard fistfight, a dance marathon, or the instant in a game of spades right after the cards are dealt—has layers of resonance in black and white cultures, the politics of american empire, and abdurraqib’s own personal history of love, grief, and performance.touching on michael jackson, patti labelle, billy dee williams, the wu-tan clan, dave chappelle, and more, abdurraqib writes prose brimming with jubilation and pain. with care and generosity, he explains the poignancy of performances big and small, each one feeling intensely familiar and vital, both timeless and desperately urgent. filled with sharp insight, humor, and heart, a little devil in america exalts the black performance that unfolds in specific moments in time and space—from midcentury paris to the moon, and back down again to a cramped living room in columbus, ohio. winner of the andrew carnegie medal and the gordon burn prize • finalist for the national book critics circle award and the pen/diamonstein-spielvogel award one of the best books of the year: the new york times book review, time, the boston globe, npr, rolling stone, esquire, buzzfeed, thrillist, she reads, bookriot, bookpage, electric lit, the rumpus, lithub, library journal, booklist











the known world


henry townsend, a black farmer, bootmaker, and former slave, has a fondness for paradise lost and an unusual mentor -- william robbins, perhaps the most powerful man in antebellum virginia's manchester county. under robbins's tutelage, henry becomes proprietor of his own plantation -- as well as of his own slaves. when he dies, his widow, caldonia, succumbs to profound grief, and things begin to fall apart at their plantation: slaves take to escaping under the cover of night, and families who had once found love beneath the weight of slavery begin to betray one another. beyond the townsend estate, the known world also unravels: low-paid white patrollers stand watch as slave "speculators" sell free black people into slavery, and rumors of slave rebellions set white families against slaves who have served them for years.an ambitious, luminously written novel that ranges seamlessly between the past and future and back again to the present, the known world weaves together the lives of freed and enslaved blacks, whites, and indians -- and allows all of us a deeper understanding of the enduring multidimensional world created by the institution of slavery.











the underground railroad


#1 new york times bestseller • pulitzer prize winner • national book award winner • "an american masterpiece" (npr) that chronicles a young slave's adventures as she makes a desperate bid for freedom in the antebellum south.one of the new york times’s 10 best books of the 21st centurythe basis for the acclaimed original prime video series directed by barry jenkins.cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in georgia. an outcast even among her fellow africans, she is on the cusp of womanhood—where greater pain awaits. and so when caesar, a slave who has recently arrived from virginia, urges her to join him on the underground railroad, she seizes the opportunity and escapes with him.in colson whitehead's ingenious conception, the underground railroad is no mere metaphor: engineers and conductors operate a secret network of actual tracks and tunnels beneath the southern soil. cora embarks on a harrowing flight from one state to the next, encountering, like gulliver, strange yet familiar iterations of her own world at each stop. as whitehead brilliantly re-creates the terrors of the antebellum era, he weaves in the saga of our nation, from the brutal abduction of africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. the underground railroad is both the gripping tale of one woman's will to escape the horrors of bondage—and a powerful meditation on the history we all share.look for colson whitehead’s new novel, crook manifesto!

parable of the sower


this acclaimed post-apocalyptic novel of hope and terror from an award-winning author "pairs well with 1984 or the handmaid's tale" and includes a foreword by n. k. jemisin (john green, new york times).

when global climate change and economic crises lead to social chaos in the early 2020s, california becomes full of dangers, from pervasive water shortage to masses of vagabonds who will do anything to live to see another day. fifteen-year-old lauren olamina lives inside a gated community with her preacher father, family, and neighbors, sheltered from the surrounding anarchy. in a society where any vulnerability is a risk, she suffers from hyperempathy, a debilitating sensitivity to others' emotions.

precocious and clear-eyed, lauren must make her voice heard in order to protect her loved ones from the imminent disasters her small community stubbornly ignores. but what begins as a fight for survival soon leads to something much more: the birth of a new faith . . . and a startling vision of human destiny.
 











the immortal life of henrietta lacks


#1 new york times bestseller • “the story of modern medicine and bioethics—and, indeed, race relations—is refracted beautifully, and movingly.”—entertainment weekly

now a major motion picture from hbo® starring oprah winfrey and rose byrne • one of the “most influential” (cnn), “defining” (lithub), and “best” (the philadelphia inquirer) books of the decade • one of essence’s 50 most impactful black books of the past 50 years • winner of the chicago tribune heartland prize for nonfiction

named one of the best books of the year by the new york times book review • entertainment weekly • o: the oprah magazine • npr • financial times • new york • independent (u.k.) • times (u.k.) • publishers weekly • library journal • kirkus reviews • booklist • globe and mail

her name was henrietta lacks, but scientists know her as hela. she was a poor southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine: the first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. hela cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. 

yet henrietta lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.

henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating hela began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. and though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. as rebecca skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the lacks family—past and present—is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on african americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. 

over the decade it took to uncover this story, rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the lacks family—especially henrietta’s daughter deborah. deborah was consumed with questions: had scientists cloned her mother? had they killed her to harvest her cells? and if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance? 

intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, the immortal life of henrietta lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.

a new york times notable book of 2018

a revealing portrait of one of the most gifted and charismatic, yet least understood, black artists and intellectuals of the twentieth century.

lorraine hansberry, who died at thirty-four, was by all accounts a force of nature. although best-known for her work a raisin in the sun, her short life was full of extraordinary experiences and achievements, and she had an unflinching commitment to social justice, which brought her under fbi surveillance when she was barely in her twenties. while her close friends and contemporaries, like james baldwin and nina simone, have been rightly celebrated, her story has been diminished and relegated to one work—until now. in 2018, hansberry will get the recognition she deserves with the pbs american masters documentary “lorraine hansberry: sighted eyes/feeling heart” and imani perry’s multi-dimensional, illuminating biography, looking for lorraine.

after the success of a raisin in the sun, hansberry used her prominence in myriad ways: challenging president kennedy and his brother to take bolder stances on civil rights, supporting african anti-colonial leaders, and confronting the romantic racism of the beat poets and village hipsters. though she married a man, she identified as lesbian and, risking censure and the prospect of being outed, joined one of the nation’s first lesbian organizations. hansberry associated with many activists, writers, and musicians, including malcolm x, langston hughes, duke ellington, paul robeson, w.e.b. du bois, among others. looking for lorraine is a powerful insight into hansberry’s extraordinary life—a life that was tragically cut far too short.

--roxane gay, author of hunger
the critically acclaimed and whiting award-winning author of we love you, charlie freeman returns with libertie, an unforgettable story about one young black girl's attempt to find a place where she can be fully, and only, herself.
coming of age in a free black community in reconstruction-era brooklyn, libertie sampson is all too aware that her purposeful mother, a practicing physician, has a vision for their future together: libertie is to go to medical school and practice alongside her. but libertie, drawn more to music than science, feels stifled by her mother's choices and is hungry for something else--is there really only one way to have an autonomous life? and she is constantly reminded that, unlike her light-skinned mother, libertie will not be able to pass for white. when a young man from haiti proposes to libertie and promises she will be his equal on the island, she accepts, only to discover that she is still subordinate to him and all men. as she tries to parse what freedom actually means for a black woman, libertie struggles with where she might find it--for herself and for generations to come.
inspired by the life of one of the first black female doctors in the united states and rich with historical detail, kaitlyn greenidge's new and immersive novel will resonate with readers eager to understand our present through a deep, moving, and lyrical dive into our past.

nickel boys


"as the civil rights movement begins to reach the black enclave of frenchtown in segregated tallahassee, elwood curtis takes the words of dr. martin luther king to heart: he is "as good as anyone." abandoned by his parents, but kept on the straight and narrow by his grandmother, elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. but for a black boy in the jim crow south of the early 1960s, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy the future. elwood is sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called the nickel academy, whose mission statement says it provides "physical, intellectual and moral training" so the delinquent boys in their charge can become "honorable and honest men." in reality, the nickel academy is a grotesque chamber of horrors where the sadistic staff beats and sexually abuses the students, corrupt officials and locals steal food and supplies, and any boy who resists is likely to disappear "out back." stunned to find himself in such a vicious environment, elwood tries to hold onto dr. king's ringing assertion "throw us in jail and we will still love you." his friend turner thinks elwood is worse than naive, that the world is crooked, and that the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble. the tension between elwood's ideals and turner's skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. formed in the crucible of the evils jim crow wrought, the boys' fates will be determined by what they endured at the nickel academy."

the kidnapping club


winner of a 2020-2021 new york city book awardin a rapidly changing new york, two forces battled for the city's soul: the pro-slavery new yorkers who kept the illegal slave trade alive and well, and the abolitionists fighting for freedom.we often think of slavery as a southern phenomenon, far removed from the booming cities of the north. but even though slavery had been outlawed in gotham by the 1830s, black new yorkers were not safe. not only was the city built on the backs of slaves; it was essential in keeping slavery and the slave trade alive.in the kidnapping club, historian jonathan daniel wells tells the story of the powerful network of judges, lawyers, and police officers who circumvented anti-slavery laws by sanctioning the kidnapping of free and fugitive african americans. nicknamed "the new york kidnapping club," the group had the tacit support of institutions from wall street to tammany hall whose wealth depended on the southern slave and cotton trade. but a small cohort of abolitionists, including black journalist david ruggles, organized tirelessly for the rights of black new yorkers, often risking their lives in the process.taking readers into the bustling streets and ports of america's great northern metropolis, the kidnapping club is a dramatic account of the ties between slavery and capitalism, the deeply corrupt roots of policing, and the strength of black activism.











half american


"over one million black men and women served in world war ii. black troops were at normandy, iwo jima, and the battle of the bulge, serving in segregated units and performing unheralded but vital support jobs, only to be denied housing and educational opportunities on their return home. without their crucial contributions to the war effort, the united states could not have won the war. and yet the stories of these black veterans have long been ignored, cast aside in favor of the myth of the "good war" fought by the "greatest generation." half american is american history as you've likely never read it before. in these pages are stories of black heroes such as thurgood marshall, the chief lawyer for the naacp, who investigated and publicized violence against black troops and veterans; benjamin o. davis, jr., leader of the tuskegee airmen, who was at the forefront of the years-long fight to open the air force to black pilots; ella baker, the civil rights leader who advocated on the home front for black soldiers, veterans, and their families; james thompson, the 26-year-old whose letter to a newspaper laying bare the hypocrisy of fighting against fascism abroad when racism still reigned at home set in motion the double victory campaign; and poet langston hughes, who worked as a war correspondent for the black press. their bravery and patriotism in the face of unfathomable racism is both inspiring and galvanizing. in a time when the questions world war ii raised regarding race and democracy in america remain troublingly relevant and still unanswered, this meticulously researched retelling makes for urgently necessary reading"--
