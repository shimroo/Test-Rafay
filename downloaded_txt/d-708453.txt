about our parish





view fullsize










our parish is named after a modern saint, saint john the wonderworker, who was known for his great love for others, especially his love for orphaned children. st. john’s troparion says that he gave hope to the hopeless, and giving hope is close to the heart of our parish. all of us need the hope that can only come from our lord and savior jesus christ. through prayer and outreaches such as the loaves and fishes program which feeds the homeless, st. nicholas academy, our bookstore, our choir, and other ministries, we care for each other and the needy around us. our parish is a loving, growing, orthodox community where we strive together towards the greatest hope of all, christ.st. john's was the first parish  to be named after st. john the wonderworker, but has also been greatly impacted by our first priest, the archpriest jacob myers who reposed in january of 2013. under his leadership, saint john’s became a parish known for prayers, hospitality and ministry to others. the parish continued to grow under our church's pastor emeritus, father tom alessandroni and is currently overseen by fr gabe aldridge. our parish has many converts to the faith as well as members from a variety of international backgrounds.













over the years the parish has been able to gather several items that belonged to our beloved st john, including a thigh shield and two of his robes. more recently the church was given a bone relic from his foot, the only part of his body that was not found to be incorrupt. on this website you can find a great deal about the life of st. john. the parish is located in atlanta, georgia and joined the orthodox church in america (oca) as part of the diocese of the south under archbishop dmitri of dallas (now reposed) in september of 2000. we are under his eminence, the most reverend alexander, archbishop of dallas and the south.services are held in english. we welcome visitors to stay for lunch after liturgy on sundays.
