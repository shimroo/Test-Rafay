                           a lot of information for you on this website to help
                           you learn about one man or recreational portable sawmilling,
                           and sawmills, and i really do hope you take the time
                           to read the whole site especially the faq's. 



please see sitemap for
                       brief descriptions on all the pages on this web site.
i assume that you just want to cut lumber when it pleases
                     you, using your own timber. you do not want to tie up a
                     whole lot of money in a portable sawmill that will have
                     to produce lumber 8 hours a day, week after week, just to
                     recover the cost. you need a low cost solution so the sawmill
                     can sit for a week or two without operating, while you use
                     the lumber you have produced.
our sawmill plans are designed
                     for the novice to use with a step by step written text,
                     diagram & photo to match for each procedure. some customers
                     have built procut's portable lumber mill without even picking
                     up a hammer before. plans even include a manual for a novice
                     to learn to weld. over 5000 customers have easily built
                 procut portable sawmills in the last 15 years. 


 


hello and welcome. 
my name is allan cornes and i have worked in the forestry trade for over 35 years.
    i would like to make a brief mention of my experience in forestry and sawmills,
    so you may have some confidence in my ability to help you save a considerable
    amount of dollars in the purchase of a sawmill. 
 i have worked in all areas of the forestry
                       trade from shake roof production, all aspects of logging,
                       large sawmill operator, many different portable mill operations,
                       shingle sawyer, sawmill manager, woods management, and
                       sawmill designer - builder.


over the years of operating many different sawmills (large
                     and small - including portables), and constantly maintaining
                     them, i knew there was a low cost solution. that a sawmill
                     could be completely reliable, cut accurately, with very
                     low maintenance, and still be low cost.
over the years i have designed and operated just such
                       a sawmill. i have put into procut
                       portable chainsaw mill all the knowledge acquired in the many years
                       of operating portable sawmills.
                       procut, i believe fills the above criteria. procut will
                       cut precision lumber fast and accurately at a very low
                       cost. i also included in the design small items generally
                       overlooked by other sawmills, like minimum bending to
                       save your back, and for all of us that cut in the winter, ¼ " rails
                       were used for the track so sawdust would not collect and
                       freeze. you do not have to scrape procut tracks so you
                       can cut lumber.


 




 portable sawmills are easy to build

you will get a tremendous sense of pride out of building
                       a procut precision portable sawmill, plus the admiration
                       of the many people who see the finished mill. 

you only need a home type welder - hand grinder - hand
                     drill plus $900.00 or less in easily acquired materials.
                     no machining required. you build the whole mill yourself
                     - start to finish. approximate time to build is 70 hours
                     for a novice or 40 hours for someone with minimal welding
                     skills. the record so far is 18.5 hours.
