							“working with peak associates has been an absolute pleasure and the biggest turning point in my professional career. given the current landscape of the job market, finding and securing an opportunity in-line with your interests can often be challenging and stressful. this is where peak associates can add value. throughout the five interviews with my current employer, i was given valuable advice both before and after each interview. not only to prepare for the 
interview accordingly, but also to fully understand whether the opportunity was something i wanted to pursue. all in all, i highly recommend peak associates’ guidance and expertise.

i recently graduated from seneca college with a diploma in accounting. i started to apply for jobs on my own and registered with different employment agencies to help me find work. six months had gone by, i attended job fairs, interviews and workshops but still had not received any opportunities to work in my field. i was frustrated and slowly started to believe that i wouldn’t get a chance to in accounting. fortunately, i applied to one of peak associates’ jobs and had an interview with them. i met the president of peak associates during the interview. she is very friendly and supportive and understands how hard it is for a new graduate to find a job in canada. the rest of the peak team was also so nice and patient with me, and accommodated my needs. peak associates has been very helpful to me in finding a permanent job in my field so quickly. i am now working as an accounts receivable representative. i always refer my friends to peak associates for their own success stories, and i am very grateful to them for changing my career life.
