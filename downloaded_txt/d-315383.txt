established in 1915, fairview lake ymca camps has been providing sleep away summer camping for grades 2-11, environmental education for schools, family programs, and weekend retreats for individuals and groups. we develop programs for children, adults, and families to realize their potential by focusing on specific skill sets, building confidence, and creating a sense of belonging.
fairview lake ymca, an aca accredited camp, sits on mile-long fairview lake in stillwater, new jersey.  our 660 acres adjoin the delaware water gap national recreation area, providing access to the appalachian trail, delaware river, hiking, and breathtaking views. in the summer, jump into the refreshing waters of our beautiful lake. two waterfronts are complete with a fleet of canoes, rowboats, kayaks, sailboats, and windsurfers to offer a variety of activities and unlimited fun with ample trained lifeguards.
in 2022, we added lake in the woods ymca camps to our family of programs. offering both day camp and a unique 5-day-a-week sleepaway program, we utilized the beautiful campus of blair academy, in blairstown, new jersey. campers have the chance to explore their interests through a variety of specialized programs, such as arts and crafts, music, theater, archery, boating, and ceramics.
