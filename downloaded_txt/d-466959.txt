water bears were a big splash again at the 2025 nc academy of science booth for the nc museum of science’s astronomy days! the real story was the awesome group of volunteers. students from meredith college and unc pembroke, joined by a host of museum volunteers, warmly greeted the public. volunteers showed a lot of patience as they happily answered questions about creatures of extreme environments, explained how water bears (well okay, “tardigrades”) survive superhot conditions, adjusted microscopes for overly enthusiastic children, and taught visitors how to fashion pinwheel galaxy pinwheels and succulent planter necklaces. colorful alien drawings that were taped to tall cabinets looked like whimsical wallpaper. it was a lot of fun! the academy has operated a booth for astronomy days off and on since 2008, when the late charlie lytle (past president) recruited student academy volunteers and board members to meet and greet the public. the head count for the 2025 astronomy days was 11,628 people. student volunteers from meredith college were ellie butler, mariana hernandez, mun maisha, miriam morris and caitlyn russell, and students from uncp were brandy allen, alisia baskerville, aaron u hartman, hannah leviner, shannon lowry, stephon proctor and kiarah woods. kudos go to kari wouk (head of public science events, nc museum of natural sciences) for always providing great accommodations for the academy’s booth.

president's letter:dear fellow members and supporters of the north carolina academy of science, i hope this letter finds you well. i attended my first ncas annual meeting in 1996. over the years, i have served in a variety of positions on the board of directors and now i am honored to serve as your president. the last three years of the pandemic have produced difficult challenges for everyone and altered the “business as usual” pattern of our lives. in response to the covid19 crisis, the academy was forced to cancel its planned 2020 annual meeting for the first time since we began meeting in 1902. thanks to the tireless dedication and hard work of the local arrangements committee at lenoir rhyne university, the academy held its first online virtual annual meeting in 2021. last year, the academy restarted our in-person annual meeting at campbell university using a hybrid format so that poster and oral presentation sessions included remote participants who were unable to travel to buies creek. despite the hardships brought on by the pandemic, i am happy to report that the academy has successfully weathered the storm and that our future is secure. i am so grateful for the board of directors (bod), the previous and current local arrangements committees, the editorial board, the cancas officers, and all of our faithful members who have worked to keep the academy, and our flagship journal, operating through these uncertain times. i am happy to report that the financial state of the academy is on solid ground due to the responsible stewardship of the finance committee and the fundraising efforts of the local arrangements’ committees. with a renewed sense of our strength and unity, i look forward to a bright future as we continue our mission to "encourage the advancement of science within the state of north carolina by promotion of scientific research and by the fostering of education in the sciences." our 118th annual meeting is scheduled on march 31 and april 1, 2023 at east carolina university in greenville, nc. the friday evening poster session will be hosted in the new life sciences and biotechnology building. so, please invite your colleagues and students to join us in greenville for what will be a terrific annual meeting. if you are not yet a member of the academy, i would like to encourage you to peruse our website (https://www.ncacadsci.org/) to see all of the benefits that come with being a member. if you are a member, then please share your knowledge and experience of the academy with colleagues so that we can increase our membership.in addition, i would like to use this opportunity to invite our members who are interested in volunteering as committee members, editorial board members and peer reviewers to contact me about currently vacant positions as well as offices that will open in march 2023. i look forward to meeting you all at our next annual meeting at east carolina university on friday, april 24 and saturday, april 15, 2023.mike kingstonpresident 2022-2023                                                                                                     elon universitydepartment of biology                                                                                                 kingston@elon.edu
