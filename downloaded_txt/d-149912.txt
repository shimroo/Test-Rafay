superintendent message











january 2025 message

as we begin a new calendar year, it is an opportune time to remind ourselves of the sunnyvale school district promise and to reaffirm our strong commitment to our district’s goals.  foundational to all we do is an unwavering commitment to keep every student and staff member safe and secure.

december 2024 message

as we enter the holiday break, the sort-of “half time” of our school year, i reflect upon how grateful i am for the support the sunnyvale community shows for our children and their education. the most recent example of our community’s unwavering commitment to the education of our children was the overwhelming support for measure y on the november ballot. we are truly humbled and grateful that over 82% of voters chose to invest in the future of our students. this level of support for any measure is truly unheard of.
