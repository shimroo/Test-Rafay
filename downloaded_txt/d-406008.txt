synaxis of the most-holy theotokos

on the second day of  christ’s nativity, the church unites its joy over the newborn saviour of the  world with a fervent glorification of the mother of god. and throughout all the  days of the celebration of nativity, this joy is indivisible for us. in  venerating the lord, we venerate his mother. in worshipping the sun of truth in  the orient from on high, we glorify the one who, like the dawn, precedes this  sun. and not only precedes, but carries within herself and bears into the world  this divine life and light. heaven and earth gaze in awe upon the  incomprehensible honor of the virgin who is called the mother of god â the  mother of the one who created heaven and earth. “behold the handmaiden of the  lord,” â says the holy virgin, but god calls her his mother. she is the mother  and a handmaiden at the same time, always the mother and always a handmaiden,  just as her son â god and man â is always god and always man.
just as she attains her  majesty through humility, so she attains her motherhood through virginity. she  retains virginity and becomes a mother, uniting two mysteries of life that  never exist simultaneously. mankind stands before these two mysteries, unable  to comprehend them without her. in christ’s nativity her virginity is not only  preserved, but it is elevated, it is crowned, it blossoms through her  motherhood. and her motherhood is sacredly prepared, blessedly attained, and  divinely perfected by her virginity. all virgins and mothers participate to  some degree in this mystery â sacred motherhood is attained only through  chastity, while chastity is affirmed by motherhood, not to mention the fact  that true chastity is revealed in spiritual nativity and spiritual motherhood. it  is written: “more are the children of the desolate than the children of the  married wife” (isaiah 54:1).
today we celebrate the feast  of nativity in a world where motherhood is desecrated and virginity is derided,  where the routine killing of one’s own unborn children â a bethlehem-type  massacre of infants on a planetary scale, â and the everyday commonness of  depravity attest more clearly than the most terrible prophecies to the fact  that man without god cannot be man. there are many people who welcome the lord  and the holy virgin, beginning with the manger at bethlehem (where, as the  gospel tells us, one can see the infant and his mother) and ending with the  cross, from which the saviour of mankind says to his disciple: “behold thy  mother!” (john 19:27). and yet there are many people who pass by, trampling  upon everything! to be chosen as the mother of god signifies the bearing of a  cross. no one knows the mystery of birth, life, and death of each person as she  does. and no one can pray for mankind with such compassion and such love as  she, because she is the mother of all living persons and the mother of the  living god.
let us try today to ponder as  deeply as possible the mystery of the mother of god’s intercession. here, in  the manger of bethlehem, for her he is simultaneously the saviour of the world  and a growing infant. an infant similar to others, yet at the same time the  pre-eternal son â the one who, at the pre-eternal council, chose to take upon  himself the burden of the world. thus she carried her infant like any other  mother carries her firstborn. however, she had to be prepared by the holy  spirit for the burden of the world’s sins, which her son was due to carry.
through her faith she can  clearly understand what it all means. she, who never sinned even in her  thoughts, according to st. siluan the athonite, knows what sin means. she knows  exactly the degree of insult to god that sin represents, and from the moment  when she began to carry her son within her, sin became more than just an  outward manifestation for her, because he who will take upon his shoulders the  sins of all men is living inside her. it was as though she carried within  herself the penitence of the whole world. in every sin she comes across, she  sees and knows: for this he has come, this will be the cause of his suffering,  because of this he will die.
and on the day of christ’s  nativity, when in a gladsome light the power of divine forgiveness is revealed  to her, she stands before this ocean of grace in a totally different manner. up  to now she carried grace concealed within herself. although she was surrounded  by the breath of the spirit, she did not know him before as well as she does  now. she sees god with her own eyes and touches him with her own hands, and she  prays for everyone. and the satanic depths of sin are bared before her as never  before in the spiritual light of nativity, and her prayer becomes invincible  like the weapon of the cross, which even at this moment pierces her heart.
christian mothers, christian  maidens, and all orthodox christians! among the terrible temptations of the  world, when almost everyone cedes without any resistance to insolent and  shameless sin, the church repeats over and over again the words of st. john  chrysostome: “all tasks in life should retreat before the task of rearing  children,” and the words of the holy optina elders: “to preserve chastity in  our times is to preserve everything.” and when your hearts despair from the  hopelessness of doing something good, â turn to the mother of god. her prayer  truly performs the impossible. amen.

the adoration of the magi
 
nine months before the nativity of  christ, during the archangel gabriel’s annunciation to the holy virgin mary  concerning god’s incarnation within her, a new star of the east appeared in the  heavens. this was an extraordinary star indeed. according to the holy fathers  (sts. john chrysostome and theophilactus), this star was not one of the regular  celestial bodies, but a certain divine and angelic power which appeared in the  form of a star. all other stars have their own place in heaven, while this star  could also be seen in the air; all stars usually move from east to west, while  this star moved unusually from east to south, in the specific direction of  jerusalem; all stars shine only in the night, while this star shone like the  sun even during the day; all stars are in constant movement, while this star  sometimes moved and sometimes stopped, i.e. when the magi traveled, then the  star traveled with them, and when they rested, then the star stood, too.
this extraordinary star was  seen by three magi, or wise men, in three different countries â persia, arabia,  and ethiopia. being learned men, they knew astronomy and studied the stars, and  thus, seeing such an unusual phenomenon in the skies, they realized that  something supernatural had taken place in the world. then, inspired by god,  they remembered the ancient prophecy of another stargazer, valaam, who had  said: “a star will shine forth from jacob, and a man will arise from israel.” the  magi realized that the time had come for the lord and king of the universe to  be born, and that this was his star, foretold ages ago. then each one of them  left his own country and embarked upon travel to judea, in order to worship the  newborn god. during their travel they met one another and continued on their  way in unison.
traveling thus for several  months, the magi finally came to judea and reached its capital â jerusalem â on  the very day of christ’s nativity. however, when they approached jerusalem, the  star that was leading them suddenly disappeared from view. this happened so  that king herod and the envious jewish priests would not be able to find the  christ-child and kill him prematurely, and also because the jewish populace was  not worthy of seeing the wondrous star: the magi were pagans, and yet had come  from afar to worship christ, while the jews had him right beside them, and yet  disdained him.
upon entering jerusalem, the  magi began asking: “where is the newborn king of judea? we have seen his star  in the east and have come to worship him.” this news amazed the populace and  shook up king herod and all the jewish leaders. deciding to kill christ, in  whom he saw a future rival for himself, herod summoned the magi, questioned  them about the appearance of the new star, and cunningly sent them to discover  the location of the newborn child, in order to subsequently pass on the  information to herod.

when the magi left  jerusalem, the familiar star again appeared right away and went before them. it  led them all the way to bethlehem, to the cave, and stopped over the christ-child.  and then an extraordinary event took place: the star left the firmament and  came down to earth, and showed the magi the exact location of christ. here was  further indication that this was not an ordinary star, but a special divine  power.
finding christ in the cave,  the magi knelt down to the ground before him, worshipping him as god, and gave  him their gifts. what gifts did they bring? gold, incense, and myrrh: gold for  him as king, incense for him as god, myrrh for him as a mortal man. the first  magus â melchior, old and grey, with long hair and beard, â brought the gold. the  second magus â gaspar, young and beardless, with a rosy face, â brought the  incense. the third magus â balthazar, with a dark complexion and a long beard,  â brought the myrrh.
several church canticles  movingly describe this wondrous moment, depicting the virgin mary as though  speaking to her newborn son: “having recognized thee as a king just born, the  oriental kings have come, bringing gifts to thee, my son, â incense, myrrh, and  gold. and now they are standing at the entrance. bid them enter and look upon  thee, an infant in my arms, yet more ancient than adam.” “'come and enter  carefully, â said the virgin to the magi â and ye will see the unseen one, who  can now be seen as a child.’ and they entered assiduously and knelt down, and  presented their gifts, fulfilling the divine prophecy.”
afterwards, being instructed  by an angel not to return to herod, who was planning to kill christ, the magi  went another way and returned each to his own land, and there became teachers  and preachers of christ. they taught people to believe in christ as the son of  god, just as they believed in him themselves, and after their repose they  became numbered among the saints.

homily for the sunday of the prodigal son
 
the preparatory weeks for great lent have  now arrived, dear brethren. each one of them offers us some touching  instruction. today we are presented with the prodigal son. the gospel tells us  of how a certain son demanded his inheritance from his father. the father was  kind: he did not argue, nor did he object, but gave his son that part of the  estate to which he was entitled. 
the  son took the paternal inheritance, and very soon he departed for distant lands  in order to squander this inheritance. far away from the father, the son lived  quite willfully, did not work, did not labor. in this manner his inheritance  was soon spent, and he became poor, he went hungry, he became totally unwanted.  all his former friends, who had so assiduously helped him fritter away his  inheritance, now turned away from him, and he was barely able to find the  demeaning work of a swineherd.
and  at this point, dear brethren, this prodigal son â beggared, hungry, tattered,  unwanted â underwent a complete transformation. he came to his senses,  experienced an enlightenment of the soul. he recognized his mistake, he  realized how lost he was, he remembered his former pleasant and bright life in  the care of his affectionate father, and he felt a strong desire to return to  this kind and merciful father.

the  prodigal son underwent such a strong transformation that not only did he  recognize his mistake, but he recognized it precisely as being a sin, and this  realization brought him to the same remorseful state of humility that we saw in  the publican the previous week. the publican humbly asks god the father to  forgive him his sins; the prodigal son humbly asks his father to take him back  â no longer as a son, but as a lowliest servant.
thus,  as we see from these two parables, â humility and repentance are the royal way  directly to god. the publican left the temple justified and  spiritually-uplifted, while the returning prodigal son was met halfway by the  father, who lovingly embraced him and restored him to his former dignity to an  even greater degree.
well,  my dear brethren, as every parable recounted to us by the lord, this parable of  the prodigal son moves us and penetrates to the depth of our souls. but it also  bears a very direct relation to us: the prodigal son is each one of us, each  person who distances himself from the lord god. each time we sin â we abandon  god; like the prodigal son we take our inheritance, i.e. all that we have in  our lives, and we go away to squander our earthly lives, since we do not live  in accordance with our calling as orthodox christians. we, humans, are the sons  of god. we do not have anything of our own except sin. all that we have has  been given to us by god. but we forget that. we live very willfully, we do not  pray, we do not keep the fast, we give ourselves over to our passions. like the  prodigal son we fritter away our inheritance when we distance ourselves from  the orthodox church, when we pray together with heretics, when we disdain the  wealth of church sacraments, especially the sacraments of confession and  communion.
at  the same time, as we ourselves try to return to the heavenly father, we should  not condemn other lost people, but should pray for them daily. there is a very  simple and potent prayer: “remember, o lord, those who have broken away from  the orthodox faith and have been blinded by destructive heresy; enlighten them  with the light of knowing thee and add them to thy holy church.”
as  in the parable, our heavenly father does not impede our going away, because we  have been given free will. he only sorrows over us and waits for our return. the  prodigal son came to a realization of his sin before his father. thus we, too,  should constantly do the same: recognize our sins before god the father; for  this reason we are now given the special season of repentance known as great  lent.
however,  we must recognize our sins and repent of them sincerely. how many times the  priest hears the following words during confession: “well, i really have not  done anything terribleâ¦” no, dear brethren, that is precisely what is terrible  â not to recognize one’s sinfulness. this comes from extreme pride. and at this  precise point we must learn humility from the publican and the prodigal son. we  must say together with the publican: “lord, have mercy upon me, a sinner.” we  must say together with the prodigal son: “i have sinned, father, before heaven  and thee.”
the  lord allows us to go away and sin as we wish, but he waits for us to return to  him. and when we come back to him, he goes out to meet us halfway, showers us  with spiritual gifts, gives a spiritual feast for us. let us hurry, dear  brethren, to our most precious heavenly father, who is so generous and merciful  and long-suffering. let us recognize the entire sinfulness of our lives, let us  lave ourselves in the tears of repentance, let us unite with god in the  sacrament of communion. the lord himself has said that there is great joy in  heaven among the angels over even a single repentant sinner. amen.

spiritual life according to st.  seraphim of sarov
 
god is a spirit, and the life of the  divinity is spiritual. this spirituality is founded upon the essence of the  divine nature, in which unity is combined with diversity.
the lord wished to have man,  whom he had created, also live a spiritual life, and for this he gave him his  own likeness as the basis of godliness in spiritual life. the lord created for  man a body out of dust, but elevated it by life given through an act of  creation. this body is essentially similar to the body of animals, but differs  from it in its form and beauty, which are a symbol of perfection.
god gave man a soul, this  conscious force that is like unto the soul of animals, which guides the  instincts of nourishment and self-preservation, but is elevated above it by the  capabilities of its vital manifestations.
finally, the lord gave man a  spirit, one in essence with god’s spirit, but differing from it in its  dependence and limitations.
this simultaneous unity and  diversity of all parts permeated man’s entire nature. the body was subordinate  to the soul and was tended by it, the soul was subordinate to the spirit which  provided guidance for the soul, while the spirit was subordinate to the lord  god in his creative concern for all. despite the diversity of his parts, man  was nevertheless conscious of himself as a single entity. this unity in man’s  nature was the first condition of his spiritual life. the diversity of the  parts did not disturb this unity; on the contrary, it stimulated man to aspire  upward to perfection for the sake of such unity.
the body, experiencing  sweetness, found well-being and goodness in it, and thus aspired in its life to  soulfulness and united with it. the soul found a certain spirituality in the  pleasantness of life and thus elevated itself to the level of the spirit and  united with it. the spirit, in its divergence from god, aspired towards him and  in the divineness of sensations elevated itself to union with him. aspiration  towards perfection, founded upon diversity and motivated by a desire for unity,  was the second condition of man’s spiritual life.
this aspiration was  expressed in obedience to god. man constantly had to coordinate his will with  the will of god, which he knew directly from god and also from moral law. his  accord with the will of god was always confirmed to him by his clear  conscience. necessary obedience to god was the third condition of spiritual  life. 
finally, the lord breathed  into man the breath of life and animated him with the grace of the holy spirit.  the power of divine grace helped man maintain unity and accomplish this  aspiration towards perfection through constant obedience to god. the state  of being filled with the grace of the holy spirit was the last and major  condition of spiritual life.
but, unfortunately, this  spiritual life did not last long. man sinned and in his sinfulness was deprived  of the aid of the holy spirit, without which unity was destroyed, aspiration  towards perfection ceased, and obedience vanished. man fell, and in his fall he  distanced himself from god, forgot him, ceased to thank and glorify him. unity  and obedience in nature were destroyed by the fact that the body ceased to be  subordinate to the soul, the soul to the spirit, the spirit to god. aspiration  upwards, to perfection, was replaced by a pull downwards, to perdition. the  spirit descended to the level of the soul, and the soul to the level of the  body. instead of aspiring towards god, the spirit took upon itself the  functions of the soul and became worldly in its manifestations. the soul  weakened in its awareness of its difference from animals and descended to their  level. the body in its natural needs was reduced by a weakened spirit to a  state of senselessness and was punished for natural and unnatural sins by grave  illnesses.
obedience was replaced by  consistent defiance against god the holy spirit. spiritual life ceased to exist  and became replaced by spiritual distortion and physical depravity. godliness  also vanished, life became senseless and existence aimless. man no longer  wished for good, and even had he wished it, he did not do the good he wished,  but committed the evil he did not wish.
who could deliver him from  such misery? only the creator, who knew how much good was incorporated into  man’s nature and how perfect man can be in union with him. and thus this  creator, our lord jesus christ, comes down to earth, takes upon himself the  image of man, and becomes like unto him in all but sin. he â the god-man â  calls people to repentance and to union with god, in order to return them once  again to the kingdom of god. through personal example, miracle-working, and  divine teaching he enlightens their minds with the light of truth and fills  their hearts with belief in him as the redeemer and saviour. inspired by such  faith, people draw near to christ, and from god’s enemies they turn into his  children, brothers, and friends. christ’s compassionate love pene-rates their  hearts and evokes love for christ in response, uniting them with him in a  single community of believers.
christ passes through his  life’s path by combating evil and ends by vanquishing it, for he does not sin,  but ascends into heaven. together with him he elevates human nature, still pure  and unmarred by sin: the angels are amazed at such a transformation of humanity  and worship it in the person of the god-man â christ.
the people remaining on  earth do not sever their connection with christ. ardent faith elevates them  into heaven, too, while love unites them with christ in one unbroken whole â a  living organism â the one holy church headed by christ, in which they all are  members. this church is spiritualized by the grace of the holy spirit and  through its sacraments offers a holy and immortal life in constant unity with  god. by confessing his orthodox faith in christ and making use of these  sacraments, each member of the church becomes a participant in this  grace-filled life and is spiritually reborn.
thus, in cleansing himself  of the original sin through the sacrament of baptism, man restores his  spiritual purity, while in the sacrament of anointment with myrrh he receives  strength for a virtuous life and the attainment of perfection.
personal sinfulness on the  path to such perfection is cleansed by the grace of penitence, while in the  sacrament of holy communion man unites with christ and emerges a new creation. the  original desire for good is revived in him, and he gathers strength for the  realization of this desire in a virtuous life. man becomes christian, and  shining thoughts, pure feelings, and lofty desires reappear within him. a new  spiritual life is revived, and unity in his nature and in his attitude towards  god and others is restored. in his obedience he acknowledges the will of god,  while in fulfilling it he gradually draws near to him and spiritually improves.
his entire life revolves  around god; he lives for his sake and is constantly sanctified by the holy  spirit. this power of the grace of the holy spirit fills his entire being, and  makes him, while he is still here on earth, a participant in celestial joy and  spiritual bliss. such was the salvific spiritual life led by all our hierarchs  and ascetics, such was the life led by st. seraphim, and to such a life he  called all those who came to him for guidance.
st. seraphim believed that  every christian should maintain within himself this internal unity and  establish spiritual orderliness. this is best achieved by fasting. lent tames  the body’s sensuality, restrains the soul’s worldly busyness, and provides the  spirit with the freedom to pray. in this manner the subordination of the body  to the soul, the soul to the spirit, and the spirit to god, which had been  initially established by god, is restored and maintained in man’s nature.
unity with people is  maintained by manifesting love through deeds of charity. in each person we must  see a creation of god similar to ourselves, filled with grace through the gifts  of god’s love and mercy, and thus meriting also our own love and charity. such  commonality of god’s mercy should unite us with other people, while the only  difference we should find between us is that we are sinful, while they are more  virtuous. this will encourage us to be humble and meek, and will lead to unity  with others in following the example of their virtuousness.
unity with god, on st.  seraphim’s advice, is maintained through constant remembrance of him. we should  become used to having the lord in our thoughts, and then we will grow close to  him and will love him, and in loving him we will become capable of  self-sacrifice for him. constant remembrance of god is stimulated by prayer,  which encourages the growth of the fear of god in our hearts for the sake of  our love for him, so that sin does not separate us from the lord. sincere  prayer brings forth tears of repentance and remorse, and illuminates the heart  with the rays of christ’s truth. when encountering distraction in prayer, we  must humble ourselves and ask god for forgiveness. a prayerful mood also  comprises genuine christian hope, when a person seeks the kingdom of god and is  convinced that all that is needful for salvation in this earthly life will be  given to him; this differs from the hope of vanity, in which a person believes  in his own powers and turns to god only in case of failure.
aside from unity, spiritual  life also requires a striving for perfection. this striving, according to st.  seraphim, should be for the sake of christ, because only such a striving brings  us close to god and is salvific for us. perfection without christ is regarded  by god benevolently, but does not bring salvation; in order to be salvific it  should lead to belief in christ and perfection for his sake, just as it did in  the life of the centurion cornilius. in like manner good deeds without christ  are simply pleasing to god, while if done for the sake of christ â they bring  salvation, for they fill a person with the grace of god. it is to such  perfection that every person must aspire in his spiritual life. this aspiration  should be expressed in constant obedience to the will of god.
st. seraphim teaches us that  there are three wills: one is satanic â destrucâ â â â â â  â tive,  which encourages the doing of good for the sake of vanity and pride; the second  is human â neither salvific, nor destructive; and the third is the will of god  â salvific. we can know this will from reading the word of god. such reading  brings forth tears, warms the soul with tenderness, and fills the heart with  the gifts of a spiritual, grace-filled life. such a life finds its meaning only  in the acquisition of the holy spirit. the grace-filled power of the holy  spirit maintains within us internal unity and spiritual purity, gives us  strength for an unimpeded striving towards perfection through constant  obedience to the creator, fills the soul with the joy of being, and leads us to  god, in order to live an immortal life together with him. 
such is salvific spiritual  life according to the teaching of st. seraphim. if we were to ask ourselves â  do we live such a life? â we would find an answer in the following example. if  someone, standing and praying in church, is unable to overcome physical  weakness and goes out, as an obedient servant of his body, for a smoke or idle  talk, â such a one does not lead a spiritual life. if someone, getting up from  sleep, is unable to overcome the soul’s attraction for material concerns and  carelessly leaves his bed without the sign of a cross and a prayer to god, â  such a one does not lead a spiritual life. if someone does good only for the  sake of vanity and strives for perfection without christ, â such a one does not  lead a spiritual life. if someone has not acquired the habit of testing the  will of god in his actions and making sure they are pleasing to him, â such a  one has not yet stepped onto the path of spiritual life.
and finally, whoever lives  outside the true, holy, and orthodox church, without confession and communion,  without the grace-filled aid of the gifts of the holy spirit, â such a one  cannot lead a salvific spiritual life. a salvific spiritual life is possible  only within the church community and with the aid of the grace of the holy  spirit.
this is the kind of life  that our lord jesus christ has restored to us, and the kind of life to which we  are called by the glorified saint of god â st. seraphim.

lives of the saints
 
on january 15th  (the 2nd by the old calendar) the church commemorates the great  russian saint, the venerable seraphim, wonderworker of sarov.

st. seraphim was born in the  city of kursk. his father, isidor moshnin, owned a bricklaying plant and  accepted orders to build churches and houses. he and the saint’s mother agafiya  were very kind people, pious and loyal to god’s churches. on july 19, 1857 a  second son was born to isidor and agafiya moshnin. he was called prokhor. at  the age of three little prokhor became orphaned after the death of his father.
the widow moshnina did not  abandon her husband’s business and continued to build churches, including the  one that later became the kursk cathedral of our lady of kazan. st. seraphim’s  mother personally oversaw the construction of the church. once, when her second  son was 7 years old, she went up to the very top of the belfry to look at the  construction. little prokhor ran up to the edge and fell down to the ground  from a great height. great was the mother’s gratitude to god when she ran  downstairs and found her son standing unharmed on the ground.
there was another case of  god’s special benevolence towards little prokhor. several years later he became  very sick. his mother expected him to die, but fervently prayed to god to grant  health to her son. and a miracle occurred: in his dreams little prokhor saw the  mother of god, who promised that he would be well. several days later the  miraculous icon of the kursk mother of god (which is now the protectress of our  church abroad) was carried in a procession along the street where the moshnin  house stood. suddenly there was a downpour, and the people who were carrying  the icon took a shortcut through the moshnin estate. the mother carried out her  sick son to the icon. the icon passed over the sick boy, and from that moment  prokhor began to get well and was soon in good health. afterwards he embarked  upon school studies. he studied well, and the reading of the bible and church  books gave him the greatest pleasure. he liked to go to church and did not miss  a single service.
prokhor’s older brother  owned a store. they wanted to train young prokhor for the trade too, but he  begged his mother to let him go into a monastery. the pious mother agreed and,  when saying farewell to him, blessed him with a large copper cross which he  wore his entire life. prokhor was 18 years old at that time. he was a very  strong and healthy young man, quite tall, but meek and humble, had a straight  nose, very expressive and penetrating light blue eyes, bushy eyebrows, and  light blond hair.
taking leave of his mother,  prokhor went off to kiev to venerate the holy relics. here a certain  clairvoyant ascetic advised prokhor to go to the sarov hermitage and remain  there for good. that is what prokhor did. in 1770 prokhor came down with a very  grave illness. at that time he was already so respected for his ascetic life,  that the monks and the abbot himself took care of him. they offered prayers for  him in church, and he took holy communion. and after that he had a vision: the  most-holy theotokos appeared to him together with the apostles peter and john,  touched his feet with her staff, and placed her hand on his head. prokhor got  well.

in 1786 prokhor was tonsured  with the name of seraphim, which means “flaming,” and two months later he was  ordained a hierodeacon. st. seraphim’s spiritual feats of prayer were so great  that the lord visibly manifested his benevolence towards him. once, during the  first week of great lent, st. seraphim saw a vision in church: the lord jesus  christ entered the church with a host of angels, blessed all who were praying,  and then entered his icon on the iconostasis. the vision so astounded st.  seraphim that he became numb: he was rendered immobile and had to be led into  the altar, where he stood in a stupor for two hours.
in 1793 st. seraphim was  ordained a hieromonk and soon received blessing to live in solitude in a dense  forest located approximately six kilometers from sarov. the saint’s cell was a  small, simple hut surrounded by a vegetable garden. for many years he lived in  this desolate place, which was later called the outer hermitage. he wore the  same clothes in winter and summer: a white linen coverall, leather mittens,  bast sandals, an old kamelaukion (priest’s headgear) on his head, and his  mother’s blessing â the copper cross â on his chest. living in the forest, st.  seraphim prayed and labored continuously. often he made a thousand  prostrations. on sundays and holidays he went to the monastery to take  communion and sometimes conversed with the monks. his main instruction to them  was concerning the need for constant prayer, either the jesus prayer or the  theotokos prayer.
the saint’s life in the  forest was very difficult. he suffered terrible temptations from the demons. in  order to vanquish them, st. seraphim embarked upon the following endeavor for  one thousand days and nights: during the day he stood on his knees on a large  stone in his cell, while at night he stood on a large stone in the forest, and  continuously said the jesus prayer. such an extreme feat of prayer caused  severe suffering in his legs for the rest of his life. evil persons increased  the saint’s suffering even more. in 1804 he was attacked by three peasants who  demanded money from him. st. seraphim was very strong and could have easily  repulsed the attack, but he did not defend himself. the villains hit him over  the head with an axe, stomped on him with their feet, and beat him with a cudgel,  then wreaked havoc on his cell, searching for money, but did not find anything  except some icons and a few potatoes in the oven. st. seraphim, in a horrible  state, was barely able to reach the monastery. his head was broken and his body  was covered with terrible wounds. physicians were immediately called to his  side, but while they consulted over how to treat him, the saint had another  vision: once again the mother of god came to him with the apostles peter and  john. st. seraphim then refused all medical aid and soon got well, although he  remained forever hunchbacked. the villains who had beaten up the saint were  soon found, but he forgave them and asked that they not be punished; however,  the lord himself punished them: their huts and all their property burned down  in a fire.
some time later st. seraphim  returned to his deserted cell and took on a new spiritual labor â that of  silence. he lived thus for three years. but then the monastery’s council of  elders decided that the saint should come back to the monastery. st. seraphim  obeyed, but took on an even more difficult labor â that of total seclu sion,  never leaving his cell and never allowing anyone in. after the first five years  of seclusion st. seraphim began to open the doors of his cell, but did not  speak to anyone, and only after the second five years he began to reply to  questions and to talk to the monastery brethren.
in 1825 the mother of god  appeared to the saint in a vision and commanded him to leave his seclusion and  to receive everyone. at that time the saint was 66 years old. during the next 7  years st. seraphim received all who came to him and gave spiritual help to all,  healing many people of illness. the saint had a daily quota of 2000 visitors,  and on holidays there were 5000 and more. one can confidently say that during  the last 7 years of his life, all of believing russia visited st. seraphim. with  extra kindness the elder received those who wished to abandon their sinful  lives, and gave them miraculous help. all people â rich and poor, noble and  common â were received by the saint equally, while through his gift of  clairvoyance he revealed to many people right away why they had come to him and  what their need was. he greeted everyone with the words: “my joy, christ is  risen!”

shortly before his death the  saint once again saw a vision: the mother of god came to him together with st.  john the baptist, st. john the theologian, and several holy virgins. blessing  the elder, the theotokos said to him: “soon, my beloved one, you will be with  us.” on january 1, 1833, on new year’s day, the saint took communion and bid  farewell to all the monks, while early in the morning of january 2nd  the monks entered the saint’s cell and found him reposed. he was standing on  his knees in a prayerful position, in his usual place before his favorite icon  of the mother of god, with his hands folded in the form of a cross and an  expression of wondrous tranquility on his face.
remembrance  of the wondrous elder spread throughout russia. crowds of pilgrims thronged to  the sarov monastery to his grave, and many received miraculous aid through  prayers to st. seraphim. on july 19, 1903 the great saint seraphim was  glorified among the saints. the tsar-martyr nicholas ii and the royal family  attended the festivities in honor of the saint’s glorification, and the tsar  personally carried the saint’s honorable coffin.
 

 
the  calendar issue
 
against the background of  all the world events of the 16th and 17th centuries, when  byzantium collapsed, when the orthodox russian empire grew and became stronger,  when western europe underwent reformation, there occurred yet another event  that had extremely important consequences.
pope gregory xiii, having  been persuaded that the solar calendar was inaccurate and required correction,  decided to correct the calendar with the help of his two vatican astronomers. by  means of a narrow ray of sunlight, which fell across the floor of the so-called  “calendar room” in the vatican, it was proven to the pope that the real length  of the tropical solar year is not 365 and a quarter days, as it is counted in  the julian calendar, but slightly less. in reality, the tropical solar year is  equal to 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and approximately 46 seconds. in the  julian calendar it is counted as 365 days and precisely 6 hours.
impressed by such obvious  inaccuracy, the pope decided to correct a calendar that had been working  perfectly for over 1,200 years. in the julian calendar each fourth year is a  leap year, i.e. there are three consecutive years of 365 days each, while in  the fourth year an extra day is added at the end of february (february 29th).  in order to reduce the average length of the year and have it approximate the  tropical year, the pope decided to abolish some of the leap years.
in the gregorian reform the  leap year is abolished in those century years whose centuries are not exactly  divisible by 400, i.e. 1700, 1800, 2100, 2200, etc. in the century years that  are exactly divisible by 400, the leap years are not abolished, i.e. in 1600,  2000, 2400, etc. aside from this “correction,” nothing has changed in relation  to the julian calendar, i.e. every fourth year (besides those mentioned above)  is a leap year just as in the julian calendar.
why has this “correction”  been made and to what has it led? let us look at the explanation provided by  pope gregory xiii himself in his famous papal bull inter gravissimas,  issued on february 24, 1582. in it he says: “it has been our concern not only  to restore the equinox to its erstwhile appointed place, from which it has  moved approximately ten days from the time of the nicean council (a.d. 325),  and to return to the 14th moon its proper place, from which it  currently digresses by four or five days, but also to establish means and rules  by which it could be achieved that in the future the equinox and the 14th  moon would never move from their places.” it is hard to imagine that pope  gregory xiii did not know that what he had expressed in his bull was, firstly,  absolutely impossible, secondly â totally unnecessary, and thirdly â extremely  detrimental.
all the prominent scientists  of those times, including the great copernicus, decisively refused to  participate in preparing this gregorian reform. it was sufficiently clear to  everyone that the length of the day, the length of the year, and the length of  the month are magnitudes that do not divide among themselves exactly. that  is, the result of their mutual division, or their quotient, always produces an  irrational number. therefore, one cannot speak of absolute accuracy in the  matter of the calendar. and to secure something forever, to make sure, for  example, that the equinox and the 14th moon would never move from  their places, is mathematically absolutely impossible. even in the gregorian  calendar the equinox still moves a whole 24 hours in the course of every three  thousand years or so.
furthermore, no calendar has  an essential value per se. every calendar is valued only for the convenience of  its applicability. a calendar’s most important value lies in its practicality  and not in its abstract “accuracy.” no calendar can be “accurate,” and the  accuracy of all calendars is always only relative. fortunately, this  circumstance does not prevent a calendar from being useful and applicable. the  calendar which pope gregory decided to correct had been quite useful for more  than 1,200 years, while the pope’s “correction,” though it gave the solar  calendar an extra degree of relative accuracy, made it totally unfit for use in  the church.
the question arises: what  was that ancient calendar like and in what way was it useful? that calendar was  and is the church calendar. it is one of the greatest achievements of ancient  astronomy and one of the most glorious masterpieces of calendrical science. one  must note that the church calendar is not simply the julian calendar, and it  uses the julian solar calendar only partially in order to intertwine into a  single whole, firstly â the tropical solar year, secondly â the monthly course of  the moon, and thirdly â the weekly circle of days. this interweaving into a  single whole of three magnitudes that are indivisible among themselves is what  precisely constitutes the church calendar and is called the “paschalion” (or  paschal cycle).
in this church calendar one  cycle comprises 532 years and one such cycle is called the “concordant circle.”  in this brilliant concordant circle all errors in the interrelation between the  year, the month, and the day of the week are mutually canceled out in the  course of each cycle, so that at the end of one concordant circle and at the  beginning of the next one the year, the month, the lunar phase, and the day of  the week fall exactly on the same dates. in other words, every 532 years the  church calendar begins anew at the same point.
from this point, where the  dates of the year, the month, the lunar phase, and the day of the week  coincide, the calendar once again unrolls through the course of 532 years, in  order to return to the same exact point, only in a different time. this amazing  cyclicity describes a wonderful spiral through time and, from the point of view  of astronomy, leaves nothing better to be desired. this calendar is the only calendar that provides the opportunity for uninterrupted chronology both  into the past and into the future. for this reason astronomy could never accept  and will never be able to accept any other calendar, including, of course, the  gregorian one. it was, therefore, absolutely unnecessary and quite ludicrous to  “correct” a calendar of such a degree of perfection.

the  nativity of christ 
 



those  were indeed miraculous times,
the words  of prophets came to pass,
angels  descended from above,
the star  moved forward from the east,
the world  awaited its redemption â
and in  the humble bethlehem manger,
with  eden’s laudatory singing,
the  wondrous infant dazzled forthâ¦
