welcome to the current middle ages! 



comprising australia, new zealand and their antarctic territories, the kingdom of lochac is a regional branch of the society for creative anachronism (sca). the sca is an international non-profit volunteer educational organisation that is “devoted to the research and re-creation of pre-17th century skills, arts, combat, culture, and employing knowledge of history to enrich the lives of participants through events, demonstrations, and other educational presentations and activities.” (source: sca.org)
please use the menu at the top of the page. it links to more information on who we are, what we do, and how.
if you are new to the society, please visit our hospitaller’s newcomers page. we also encourage you to contact your local group. you can find events going on around the kingdom on our events calendar.
note: we offer many different experiences, it would be impossible to put it all in one website. as such, many of the links you will find here are to other sites. each of these sites focus on specific topics, although they all come under the sca umbrella. links with an arrow next to the name take you to another site that may, or may not, be part of lochac. all sites that are part of lochac.sca.org are lochac sites.
