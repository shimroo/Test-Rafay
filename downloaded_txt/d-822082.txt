the virginia property insurance association has provided dwelling and commercial property coverages since 1968 to individuals and businesses throughout the state who are unable to obtain coverage through the voluntary insurance market.





latest news:

please note dwelling and commercial rates increased with policies effective  on or after 8/1/24.
due to rising costs in material and labor, please be sure to review limits of insurance with your policyholders.
