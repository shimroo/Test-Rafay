our local travel leaders and kathy yarian are fantastic
 we have used their services for years.  the attention to detail has made our travels fantastic.  never a hiccup no matter how complicated our itinerary.  currently kathy is helping us navigate changing plans for spain and portugal in light of the pandemic.  she has taken the worry out of rescheduling plans.

olivia helped us plan a trip to munich to see the christmas markets in decemeber. the trip was planned on short notice and i appreciate that olivia was quick to respond to questions and make reservations quickly. the trip went smooth, good flight connections, nice hotel, and some additional tours to fill in our days. overall it was a great trip and it was a pleasure working with olivia.
