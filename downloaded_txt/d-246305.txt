having spent over 30 years working in coaching and sports development, at all levels, i wanted to create something to transform the communication of coaching knowledge.
                            
i am pleased to say over the years sportplan has helped over half a million coaches and teachers, and it makes me smile to think how many children and athletes that means we have helped. we continue to innovate both in technology
                                and coaching best practice, and now sportplan is fully mobile we look forward to helping even more people.

                                                    what a fantastic tool. the chalkboard and session tools make an unbelievable difference in making training plans in both time and organization. i will be instructing all of my assistant coaches that this tool must be used for all sessions during the season,
                                                    so that we may build a club coaching resource library.

                                                    what a fantastic tool. i 've found a few drills that are unfamiliar, but that's to be expected after playing for 27 years. however, the chalk board and session tools make an unbelievable difference in making training plans in both time and organization.
