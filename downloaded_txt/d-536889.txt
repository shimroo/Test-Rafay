simple sausage meatballs


september  1, 2017



now that we are fully immersed in our back to school routine i'm starting to crave fall comfort foods.  i don't have much free time in my work/school routine so i strive to simplify prep.  i also prefer to use lower fat ingredients and lighten up recipes where i can.  you'll love the ease of using ground chicken or turkey sausage to add flavor to lean ground poultry.

ranch house chili


november  1, 2016



our sons lovingly refer to our home as the ranch.  we don't actually live on a ranch, but we sure could use one.  our blended family consists of seven boys, many who have moved out and are starting their own families.  needless to say, gatherings at our house require a lot of food.
