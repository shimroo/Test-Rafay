dana rappaport, principal educating the whole child is the vision of ps 234.

 

ps 234, independence school, focuses on children working together in an interactive setting. children are viewed as individuals with specific strengths, needs and learning styles. we are committed to meeting our children where they are, and extending their learning as far as we can. our curriculum of interdisciplinary studies accommodates these differences so that all children can achieve their potential.




    mission statement

 at our “big umbrella congress”, older and younger students came together to think about and celebrate diversity, equity and inclusion in our world.  we are having proactive, ongoing conversations about these topics in our classrooms.
