we have the greatest customers
“family tradition treestands are by far some of the most comfortable and best built deer stands that i have ever used in my 35 years of deer hunting.  their stands make me a better hunter because i can spend more quality time in the stand.  more quality time in the stand greatly increases my chances of harvesting that trophy-of-a-lifetime!”blaine burley (inventor of the plotmaster)plotmaster systems, president“i have always known that family tradition made an incredible ladder stand, recently i found out they make the best lock-on’s on the market.  that’s coming from a guy that hangs an average of seventy stands a year!” glenn garnerland manager for jeff foxworthy“family tradition stands are simply the best made for people of any size, especially us big guys.  i’m 6’3” and over 250 pounds and feel more comfortable in the family tradition stands than any i have ever hunted in.  thank you all for making top quality products with hunters of all sizes in mind.  simply the best!” thanks!michael leeco-host, backwoods life tv
