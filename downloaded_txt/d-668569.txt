attention all athletes!!! wood offers the cross-country season in the fall and track  season in spring. this is a great way for students to meet new people, hang out with friends, and for many, participate in their first school sport. all ability levels are welcome! practices are right after school (monday-thursday). just a reminder that all athletes can sign up in the front office and must have a current physical on file. in addition to this, there is a $75 athletic fee (scholarship forms available) and an emergency information card that needs to be filled out. both are available online or in the front office. looking forward to another great season and go wolverines!!!

tech tip videos
posted by joey king on 9/29/2020 




here are a series of videos that demonstrate some helpful technology tips both for students and for parents/guardians.
 
how to access parentvue
studentvue tutorial
google classroom walkthrough
zoom audio check
zoom video option
split screen hack for chromebooks
 
troubleshooting tips
 
if you find that your student is having issues with sound during a zoom meeting, you may want to try these tips.

 have the student turn off their camera when speaking. 
make sure they don’t have too many tabs open while zooming.

if you notice that they are cutting in and out during a zoom, you may want to try these tips.

they can leave the meeting and try connecting again.
make sure they are near their modem or router for a stronger signal.
have them perform a reset on their chromebook.

to reset their chromebook they need to press the refresh key on the keyboard (above the 4 key) and the power button.
after it powers off, they can press the power button on the keyboard to turn it back on and sign back in.
 
if they are still experiencing issues, have them or their parents open up a tekmee ticket so that i can further troubleshoot with them.
 
here is the link to the tekmee ticket system for families.
