why does my basement smell musty? 
that infamous musty odor indicates the presence of mold in your basement, even of you can’t see mold spots yet. mold is a smelly fungus that loves damp and dark environments like a basement.  even in small concentrations it still releases spores and odors in the air.

is mold in the basement dangerous? 
only a few species of mold, such as black mold, produce hazardous mycotoxins that can trigger serious health problems. yet, every species of mold growing indoors releases spores which, in high concentrations, will negatively impact indoor air quality. this can trigger mild to sever allergy symptoms in sensitive people.

how to clean up mold in my basement?
if you have a visible mold infestation in your basement, start by getting rid of all the moldy items. cardboard, paper, fabrics, upholstery, wood, drywall, and insulation must be removed and properly discarded. you can then clean mold from the walls and other hard surfaces using these cdc guidelines.  https://www.cdc.gov/mold/mold-cleanup-bleach.html

how to get rid of basement mold? 
the most effective way to permanently kill mold and keep it from growing back is to always keep relative humidity levels in the basement below 60%. that can be accomplished by running a good basement dehumidifier that will constantly monitor rh levels and run as needed of the levels are too high. 

what are those stains in my basement wall?
stains in basement walls can have different causes. some stains are mold. others, like rusty-colored stains can indicate the presence of iron ochre in the groundwater, and a white, powdery substance covering the walls can be efflorescence. basement wall stains usually are  a sign of water seepage, and that your basement would benefit from drainage improvements.
