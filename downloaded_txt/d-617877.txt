 rear 148x12 shimano hg hub suitable for trials riding
by 


audunskilbtei · posted thursday at 08:22  pm

								i am looking for a hub that has a freewheel strong enough for trials riding. i currently have a hope pro 5 hub that i've sheared a couple of the pawls on. it's a relatively new hub so i suspect it's a manufacturing defect but maybe they don't make them like they used to? i'm hoping they will replace it on warranty but if they don't i need an alternative. 
	are the dt swiss hubs any good with their ratchet mecanism? i don't care too much about number of engagements. 30+ is fine. main thing is that it won't blow up on me.

								nothing wild and i can't remember if i have put this spot up here before, but this being a uk forum we see lots of the best/classic uk spots (though i wish i was better at remembering their names), but thought i would toss us a clip of what is one of in my opinion the coolest urban spots in the us, freeway park in seattle. a park right in the heart of downtown built over the freeway cutting through, a really neat use of space and no one else uses it except for us silly trials riders, maybe a few parkour folks and kids doing photography.
