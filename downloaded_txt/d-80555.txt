"designed as an informative site for 
				scouters.    the information / content is from 
				the volunteer perspective and not the council.   
				while originally designed for and used by the former viking council, 
				this is no longer a council site."

               













about this site







              this site started in 1996 as the viking council web site.  it 
			  is no longer actively maintained but still has some interesting 
			  information.  in its early days, the site was featured during 
			  the national bsa annual conference as an example of what was 
			  possible for councils to share on the internet.  it had the 
			  first (public) unit locator system in the country.
