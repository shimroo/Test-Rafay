what they’re saying…




“this place takes the phrase ‘hidden gem’ to a whole new level.”

— a happy traveler




“this place just sort of has my heart, as much as a restaurant can have your heart... we took six people to dinner there recently and everyone had such a good time, from the attentive bar service to the amazing waitstaff. food was fantastic. just go there.”

— a walpack lover




“love going here! been coming here for well over 40 years. the brown bread is the best. i always get french onion soup, prime rib and black raspberry ice cream pie. and the staff is always friendly. ”

— a longtime walpack fan




“this place is beyond unique. located in what seems to be the middle of nowhere, yet always is jam-packed; a testimony to just how good the food is at the walpack inn. the entire experience is 5-star, with the beautiful, “wild country” location and the deer feasting right outside the main window.”

— a walpack regular




“start with a drink at the bar by the fireplace where you feel right at home. the smell of fresh baked bread and steaks fills the air for instant comfort. anything on the menu will not disappoint — the rack of lamb is cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth.”

— a seasoned visitor




“unbelievable views. gorgeous mountains and wildlife right outside the windows.”

— a nature lover
