‘fixed interest investment isa bond’ scam
we have been made aware of recent fraudulent activity, intended to impersonate fidelity international and encourage people into making false investments. our fraud prevention team is working with the relevant authorities to address this as a priority.
this is based upon the fraudulent use of the fidelity international name and brand to promote a ‘fixed interest investment isa bond’ scam, which claims to offer returns of 2.75% - 5.75% with a minimum initial investment of £15,000. fidelity international does not offer these products.
important - if you think you may have been targeted and made an investment already then contact your bank and report the matter to action fraud.
