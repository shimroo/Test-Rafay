julianna chiomaby randi o'brienone aspect of the work stems from a collective lens of trauma, but the pendulum also swings in the direction of healing and vitality. it starts with me, but i'm just one smattering of molecules of the same experience we all partake in as humans. you're right; it’s probably too early to tell because my body is still in shock from the whole experience, or not even in shock, just like on autopilot survival. read more.
