september 21, 2005 

hello,

i would like to present 172 photos taken on september 18, 2005, of the 2005 alan ross texas freedom parade dallas.

if you intend to download every photo, it will take about 50
megabytes of storage, so be very selective of what you want.
each photo digital image takes an average of 206,000 bytes of storage.
they are very large, and will take a long time to download the full
sized image.

i am giving you permission to copy, transmit 
or otherwise store these images for your own personal viewing pleasure. these 
photographs may not be republished in any form as part of any collection, either 
paper, electronic, or otherwise, without my prior express written permission. 
even though i'm not asking anything for my time and work for these photographs, 
my copyright notice has been imbedded into each of the digital images.

if you intend to copy, transmit, or otherwise replicate any of these 
photos, do not remove or modify the copyright notice. i have performed 
photographic work for this event, and require that i receive due credit for my 
work. this is similar to what professional photographers do when placing a 
copyright notice, and their logos, onto the final print of their professionally 
made photographs.

thank you for your time, and i hope you enjoy the show.

sincerely,
richard horsfall
