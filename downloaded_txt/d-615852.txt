	 phillies 2006 non-roster invitees
    


phils 2006 nris with details: (my comments below the stats in italics)• peter bergeron, of - former major league outfielder bergeron spent most of last year with double-a bowie, where he hit .296 with five home runs and 33 rbi in 91 games, primarily playing center field. he also played in 10 games for nashua of the independent atlantic league (.341, 6 rbi). bergeron, 28, last appeared in the major leagues in 2004 with the expos.former highly regarded prospect with some speed and the ability to play cf.  could be a candidate for 5th of in case of an injury or trade. don't know where he fits in aaa with roberson/bourn needing cf time.• ryan cameron, rhp - with double-a reading in 2005, cameron went 6-5 with 19 saves and a 2.55 era in 58 games. the 28-year-old struck out 99 batters in 88.1 innings (10.01 so/9.0 ip), held opponents to a .216 batting average and only once all season did he allow more than two earned runs in an appearance.long time minor leaguer with high ks and low h/ip closed for the first time with reading last season.  probably slated for aaa• clay condrey, rhp - 2006 will be condrey's second spring training with the phillies. he spent the 2005 season with triple-a scranton/wilkes-barre, where he went 7-8 with a 4.15 era in 25 games (24 starts). condrey, 30, spent four days in the major leagues with the phillies, but did not appear in any games. he has a career major league record of 2-4 with a 5.49 era in 18 games (nine starts), all with san diego (2002-03).condrey is a career minor leaguer probably here for depth at aaa. from a performance standpoint (don't know that he isn't a great clubhouse guy) he's the kind of player who i wish we didn'thave in the organization--i'd rather take a chance on a younger guy with better peripheral numbers.• chris coste, 3b - after coming to the phillies' spring training camp in 2005, the 32-year-old coste spent last season with triple-a scranton/wilkes-barre. he hit .292 with 20 home runs and 89 rbi. his rbi total was third-best in the international league and tied for third-most in club history. coste led the team in games (134), at-bats (506), home runs and rbi.career minor leaguer who probably could have played in the bigs in some role 4-5 years ago, but never really got the chance.  think gene schall.  he'll help swb and could contribute if an injury arises.• jeremy cummings, rhp - cummings, 29, split the 2005 season between double-a springfield (5-3, 4.50 era) and triple-a memphis (7-1, 2.77 era) in the cardinals' organization. his combined numbers were 12-4 with a 3.76 era in 26 games (18 starts), allowing only 105 hits in 122.0 innings.a very interesting signing, a relatively young arm who posted great numbers in aaa last year.  his peripheral stats are solid but not spectacular.  could provide major-league starting pitching depth and almost surely will help swb.• shawn garrett, of - as an outfielder/first baseman with triple-a sacramento in 2005, garrett hit .295 with 27 doubles, 17 home runs and 82 rbi in 131 games.aa/aaa vet who doesn't hit with quite enough power or draw quite enough walks for a corner of job in the majors.• gio gonzalez, lhp - acquired as the player to be named later from the white sox in the jim thome trade, gonzalez split last season between single-a kannapolis and single-a winston-salem. the 20-year-old went a combined 13-6 with a 2.82 era in 24 starts. he allowed only 97 hits in 131.0 innings and struck out 163. he averaged 11.19 strikeouts per 9.0 innings. gonzalez was originally selected by chicago as a sandwich pick between the 1st and 2nd rounds of the 2004 draft (38th, overall).a significant part of the thome trade, slight lh has great k numbers and could be a mid-season call-up to the pen or rotation if he stays healthy.  only 19, so he probably is at least 2 years away unless he posts hamels-like numbers• tim gradoville, c - 2006 will be gradoville's second straight spring invitation to major league camp. gradoville, 25, split last season between double-a reading and triple-a scranton/wilkes-barre, appearing in games for both clubs in one day on may 24.good glove, no hit catcher to help in st.• cole hamels, lhp - limited to only six starts in 2005 due to injuries, hamels went a combined 4-0 with a 2.31 era for single-a clearwater and double-a reading. the 22-year-old was shut down after a july 19 start with back spasms.one of the best lh in the minors if healthy.  could help the big club sometime this season if he can control his behavior and remain injury-free.  personally, i think his wide variety of injuries, especially with the latest being a back problem, have short-circuited his career.• jason jaramillo, c - after being drafted by the phillies in the 2nd round of the 2004 draft, this will be jaramillo's first invitation to major league camp. the 23-year-old switch-hitter appeared in 119 games for single-a lakewood in 2005 and hit .304 with 28 doubles, eight home runs and 63 rbi.catching depth this year in st, but if he can continue to hit, he'll make the majors before the end of 2007.  moves well behind the plate and handles pitchers well.• aquilino lopez, rhp - lopez, 30, pitched for five different teams in 2005, including the phillies. in 11 major league appearances - 10 with the phillies - lopez went 0-1 with a 2.16 era. he struck out 22 batters in 16.2 innings (11.88 so/9.0 ip). lifetime in the big leagues, lopez is 2-5 with 14 saves and a 3.72 era in 101 games.slightly built rhp has great stuff but occasionally struggles with his control.  should be in the mix for a bullpen role, but off-season lack of comments from manuel and gillick have me thinking they don't like him for some reason, which means he'll be in aaa.• travis minix, rhp - minix shuttled between double-a reading and triple-a scranton/wilkes-barre throughout the 2005 season. he combined to go 2-1 with a 1.77 era in 53 games. in 76.1 innings, minix, 28, allowed only 53 hits and only five home runs. in his final 14 appearances with reading, he compiled a 0.43 era (1 er, 21.0 ip).career minor league reliever posted mind-boggling whips last year.  could surprise people and compete for a bullpen spot.• aaron myette, rhp - myette pitched in three games for the tohoku rakuten golden eagles of the pacific league in japan, where he went 0-0 with a 20.77 era.phils liked him when they had him for half a season 2 years ago in swb.  was injured last year, so it remains to be seen if he can bounce back.• brian sanches, rhp - as a reliever with triple-a scranton/wilkes-barre in 2005, sanches went 5-3 with a 3.69 era in 51 games (two starts). the 27-year-old held left-handed hitters to a .212 average. sanches was originally acquired in a trade with san diego on april 1, 2004.career minor leaguer who pitched well in relief for the barons last season.  probably not a contender for a big-league spot.• bobby scales, inf - with triple-a portland last year, scales hit .274 with 14 home runs and 61 rbi in 120 games, playing second base, third base and left field. a switch-hitter, scales, 28, was originally drafted by san diego in 1999.the latest incarnation of david doster or kevin sefcik.  ticketed for aaa.• joe thurston, inf - thurston, 26, split last season between two triple-a teams, las vegas and columbus. he hit a combined .272 with eight home runs and 42 rbi. at the major league level, thurston has appeared in 37 games, all with the dodgers. he is a career .275 hitter in the majors.see above.• dusty wathan, c - a veteran of 12 professional seasons, wathan has spent the last three seasons in the cleveland organization, hitting .262 with 14 home runs and 51 rbi for triple-a buffalo in 2005. the son of former royals catcher john wathan, dusty played three games with kansas city in 2003, going 3-for-5 with an rbi.minor league back-up catcher has played well in aaa for the last three years.  don't think he has any shot at a big legue job.• matt white, lhp - white, 28, went 8-6 with a 3.72 era in 35 games (16 starts) for triple-a new orleans of the nationals' organization. he finished the season with 15 consecutive starts. as a reliever, white struck out 33 batters in 29.1 innings (10.13 so/9.0 ip). he made one start in august for washington at the major league level and lost, allowing four runs in four innings.lefty had a nice year in hitter-friendly n.o., and southpaws are always in the mix for major-league loogy jobs.  probably headed to aaa.blurbs from mlb.com, stats from baseball cube

	 top 30 prospects list (list only, as of june 30th)
    


i'm starting this thread with my list (requested by a couple of people in pms) and i'll add write-ups to each player as time permits, at least those in the top ten. i've omitted minor league vets over 27 from the list (players like chris coste), i've omitted players with season-ending injuries (keil fisher, terry jones, nate cabrerra), and i've made the decision to include ryan howard and gavin floyd who have played some in the bigs already this year. i tend to base evaluations primarily on performance in pro ball, secondarily on performance in major college ball (if relevant), and additionally on scouting reports and first-hand observations (drafting position and signing bonus is part of the scouting-type information). first year players such as edgar garcia and michael costanzo are therefore somewhat discounted with respect to baseball america's ratings, which are heavily scouting-oriented. note: andrew woolley, the talented baseball photographer, was kind enough to offer me the use of his remarkable images, some of which are included in the individual write-ups below (those with the black frame are woolley's).(format=name, position, team, age) (ages are as of april 1, 2005) 1. ryan howard, 1b, swb, 25 2. michael bourn, cf, reading, 22 3. cole hamels, lhsp, clw, 21 4. gavin floyd, rhsp, swb, 22 5. greg golson, of, lakewood, 19 6. louis marson, c, batavia, 18 7. scott mathieson, rhsp, clw, 21 8. jason jaramillo, c, lakewood, 22 9. edgar garcia, rhsp, gcl, 17 10. carlos carrasco, rhsp, batavia, 18 11. jake blalock, lf, clw, 21 12. pedro liriano, rhsp, swb, 24 13. chris roberson, cf, reading, 25 14. scott mitchinson, rhsp, batavia, 20 15. tim moss, 2b, clw, 23 16. j.a. happ, lhsp, lakewood, 22 17. shane victorino, cf, swb, 24 18. derek griffith, lhsp, lakewood, 23 19. brad harman, 2b, lakewood, 19 20. yoel hernandez, rhrp, swb, 23 21. carlos ruiz, c, swb, 25 22. mike costanzo, 3b, batavia, 21 23. samuel orr, ss/3b, lakewood, 21 24. danny sandoval, ss, swb, 25 25. ryan frith, of, lakewood, 22 26. marc tugwell, c/3b, clw, 23 27. randy ruiz, 1b/of, reading, 27 28. keith bucktrot, rhsp, reading, 24 29. eude brito, lhp, swb, 26 30. francisco butto, rhrp, reading, 2231. jacob barrack, rhrp, lakewood, 22also receiving consideration (in no particular order): franklin perez, brian sanches, kevin hodge, erick burke, nathan johnson, andrew baldwin, maximino de la cruz, welinson baez, lenin gazo, kelvin pichardo, tim kennelly, curt miaso, julian williams, jermaine williams, michael durant, alberto cambero credits for quotes and pictures: comcast website, new york times website, reading phillies website (ralph trout's photos are great!), cnn.com, mlb.com, randy miller's wonderful "down on the pharm column, philliesfanpage.com, espn.com, je's excellent philliesdraftreport.com

	 prospect #1--ryan howard
    


1. ryan howard, 1b, swb, 25 how acquired: draft 2001, rd. 5 percentage chance of playing in the majors in the future: 100% ceiling and chances of reaching it: major league allstar, 40% career minor league ops: .901 6/30 minor league ops: 1.166 comparable major leaguers: paul konerko, mo vaughn, charlie m: willie stargell image(s):  my comments: there's not much to say about ryan howard that posters here don't know already. he is a large but fairly agile first baseman with prodigious power to all fields, a very high strikeout rate, decent patience, deceptive basepath speed, and a remarkably high batting average on balls in play. howard has never had trouble moving up levels in the minors, which bodes well for his transition to the big leagues. he's made adjustments to the pitching at each level quickly, and changed his game a bit as he advanced (he's much more selective now than last year, for instance, and he hits breaking balls better than he did in reading and clw). swb manager gene lamont: "i've managed in the minor leagues a long time, and ryan is the best power hitter i've ever had. there have been times this season when the expectations were such that he'd hit a home run every time he came up." arbuckle on howard being blocked in aaa: "i know this is tough for the player, but it's good for the club. i wish we had the same situation at four other positions. it's comforting to know ryan is sitting here. if you move a guy like him, you have to get a lot back. you probably want to send him to the other league so you don't face him all the time. and you probably want to get a player with a similar ceiling at a similar age, not a rent-a-player or a guy two years from free agency. there aren't many guys in that category." howard on his goals and mentality: "for me, it's all about getting up there. i want an opportunity. if it's with the phillies, that's great. if not, that's o.k., too. i am just trying to stay the course and not get distracted. someday, i think i'll look back on this as a time of patience."

	 prospect #2--michael bourn
    


2. michael bourn, cf, reading, 22 how acquired: draft 2003, rd. 4 percentage chance of playing in the majors in the future: 80% ceiling and chances of reaching it: major league allstar, 25% career minor league ops: .855 (.426 obp) 6/30 minor league ops: .751 (.367 obp)comparable major leaguers: juan pierre, brett butler image(s)(andrew woolley pic used by permission  (others below the same)):  my comments: bourn is playing well in reading after skipping a level--his power and eye seem to be returning in june after a couple of months of adjusting (his stolen base percentage, which has been low for him, has also improved recently). he's a prototypical leadoff hitter, with good speed, a good eye, and occasional gap power. he uses his speed well in the outfield, and has a better than average major league arm. if he finishes the year with an obp around .380 he's almost a lock to be in phily by 2007. bourn on the jump to aa: "i have seen a difference in the pitching, but i think it’s more me than the pitching. i gave the pitchers too much credit in the beginning, but after you see the pitching for a while it’s like i know i can play here. that’s how you have to approach it. the big difference is probably in the fastball. here, the fastball moves more. they know how to sink it and locate it. you just have to make adjustments. i have to do that here if i want to get to the big leagues.” reading hitting coach hal morris on bourn's makeup: “one of his greatest assets in his makeup. he has such a strong personality and a great presence about himself that the organization felt that if he did struggle up here he’d be able to withstand those challenges and compete. he’s a joy to work with. he comes out and works hard each day and does the extra work. he loves taking extra bunting. he throws well during infield practice, he has attention to detail, he takes the job very seriously, and at the same time he mingles well with the veteran players and he’s very personable in the clubhouse.”

	 prospect #3--cole hamels
    


3. cole hamels, lhsp, clw, 21 how acquired: draft 2002, rd. 1 (17 overall) percentage chance of playing in the majors in the future: 100% if healthy, all things considered 50% ceiling and chances of reaching it: ace rotation anchor, 35% career minor league era: 1.31; k/9: 13.15 6/30 minor league era: 0.00; k/9: 10.64 comparable major leaguers: ron guidry, sandy koufax (go ahead, rip me), tgo: randy jones (with more velocity) image(s):  my comments: hamels has the highest ceiling of any pitcher currently in the minors, but, of course, there are serious injury concerns. he throws a fastball that touches 96 and sits in the low 90s, a great change, and a curve (although his velocity is reportedly down a little right now, which is ok by me--let's stay within the body's physical limits). he's a bulldog competitor on the field, but, as most of you know, he has had some maturity issues off the field, possibly going back to his high-school arm injury. will kimmey of baseball america on hamels' strengths: "his best pitch might be his plus-plus changeup, which was neck-and-neck with ryan madson’s as the best in the organization and possibly the minors. hamels displays exceptional control of his changeup at such a young age, and it really fades away from hitters. hamels shows a very businesslike mentality on the mound, with no great highs or lows. he’s a great athlete, allowing him to repeat his delivery with ease, hold runners and field his position well." gordon heimuller, phils roving pitching coordinator on hamels' 2005 debut: “you don’t know how nice it was to see. cole was having fun out there and looking like the guy i saw a year and a half ago. i wouldn’t call it midseason form, but it was pretty good.” arbuckle on the chances hamels will go to reading: “if cole is dominating the league, i don’t want him sitting there bored. but let’s see what he does first.”

	 prospect #4--gavin floyd
    


4. gavin floyd, rhsp, swb, 22 how acquired: draft 2001, rd. 1 (4th overall) percentage chance of playing in the majors in the future: ~100% ceiling and chances of reaching it: mid-rotation starter, 60% career minor league era: 2.94; k/9: 7.28 6/30 minor league era: 6.40; k/9: 6.68 comparable major leaguers: don robinson, jim lonborg, brad penny image(s):  my comments: floyd is a bit over-hyped, in my opinion--he's good, but his minor league k-rates have never been close to one per inning, and his fastball is very hittable if it's not well-located. his best pitch is his outstanding curve, he's poised on the mound, and he appears to be pretty durable for a young pitcher. this year's struggles are not unusual for a pitcher his age, and his reaction to them will provide a nice window into his competitive makeup. arbuckle on floyd's struggles: "the problem is his delivery. he can’t get himself straightened out. we’re trying to get him back on course. until he gets his delivery straightened out, he’s going to have trouble throwing strikes. he’s thoroughly confused right now." floyd on his struggles: "i'm thinking way too much out there. i was struggling a little bit and i tried to play around with my mechanics and do some things with my delivery, instead of just letting my natural ability take its course. now i'm working to let things just happen and not try to force them." john sickles on floyd's strengths: "physically, floyd is close to being a perfect pitching prospect. he is tall and lanky, but not too thin. he has both a strong upper body and strong legs. his fastball can hit 95 mph, and is a consistent 92-93 mph offering, with movement. his curveball is one of the best breaking pitches in the minor leagues, and he can throw it for strikes. his changeup was mediocre when he first signed with the phillies, but he has worked hard to improve it, and it is now at least an average pitch. floyd's command is very impressive for a pitcher his age, and he is poised and confident on the mound. his biggest problems are his over-reliance on the curveball and occasional mechanical inconsistency, which sometimes hurts his command."

	 prospect #5--greg golson
    


5. greg golson, of, lakewood, 19 how acquired: draft 2004, rd. 1 (21 overall) percentage chance of playing in the majors in the future: 50% ceiling and chances of reaching it: major league allstar, 25% career minor league ops: .755 6/30 minor league ops: .744 comparable major leaguers: too soon to tell...maybe andruw jones if he reaches potential, or jesse barfield, larry rojas: frank robinson image(s): my comments: phils are very excited about golson, they think he's a potential all-star power/speed combo, but he's a long way away from the big leagues right now. he's held his own at a very young age in the gcl and now in the sally league while making significant changes in his swing, and anyone watching him can see he's a special athlete. next year he needs to post some numbers to validate his high prospect status. marti wolever, phils scouting director, on what they saw in golson: "his skills and tools are better than many of the players selected ahead of him. he is a top-of-the-scale runner and his makeup is outstanding. he has a chance to be a productive major league offensive center fielder. we had as much interest in greg as anyone else that went in the first round. we knew he had a legitimate chance to get to us and he was really high on our list. we love his tools and his athleticism, and are happy to have him. we spent a lot of time with him. we've seen him play about every game. i would say he's at least four years away (from the majors). you never know. some (high school) guys are quicker. vernon wells was pretty quick. that's where the makeup comes in to play because he has such solid makeup he's going to find a way to achieve and be what he should be... he brings a lot to the party--nothing ever gets in his way."

	 prospect #6--lou marson
    


6. louis marson, c, batavia, 18 how acquired: draft 2004, rd. 4 percentage chance of playing in the majors in the future: 40% ceiling and chances of reaching it: major league allstar, 25% career minor league ops: .722 (gcl only) 6/30 minor league ops: .744comparable major leaguers: too soon to tell...maybe elston howard if he reaches potential? or benito santiago? tgo: johnny bench image(s):  my comments: marson is hard to project from objective standards, but when i was in spring training talking to coaches, they all were extremely excited about his potential--you could tell it more in the manner in which they said things, rather than what they said. he's already a good defensive catcher with a very strong arm, and is hitting more balls hard than anyone else at batavia early in the season. steve noworyta, phils director of minor league operations, on watching marson inthe gcl: "he's fun to watch play. it will be fun to watch him grow older and mature." arbuckle, on marson vs. jaramillo: "marson may have the better ceiling of the two--the ball really jumps off his bat. he's a good-looking kid who can catch and throw, and he's going to have plus-power."

	 kyle kendrick
    


kyle has been batavia's most effective starter this year, which is an encouraging sign from a pitcher who has been a disappointment over the last two seasons.  kendrick, who has been compared by mike arbuckle to jason schmidt, features a low 90s fastball and a solid slider along with a change-up.  he's still only 20 years old (which is younger than the majority of players in the nypl) so his first two sub-par years have not put him in the dreaded too-old-for-league category.

	 carlos carrasco
    


here's a spring training picture of carlos carrasco who put in time at lakewood, batavia, and now is playing for the gcl phils (although he has yet to appear--perhaps throwing lots of side sessions to recapture his form).  he has a beautiful motion; smooth, long-striding, seemingly effortless.  his poor results this year were very surprising to me--i think he really struggled with location in the strikezone, and i've heard he lost some velocity with respect to last season.  still, at his age there's plenty of room for hope.  i'd like to see him get a really dominating outing or two in for the gcl team before the end of the year.

	 julian wiliams
    


julian wiliams is a speedy centerfielder with a cannon for an arm, the kind of "toolsy" athlete that scouts think may be able to develop some baseball skills.  he didn't seem to have great bat speed when i saw him in oneonta, but very few of the muckdogs actually hit the ball hard at all in those games.  williams played some in the gcl last year, and is struggling so far in the nypl season with the bat. he looked very good in cf defensively, getting good breaks on balls, hitting the cut-off man, and using his exceptional speed to cover lots of ground.

	 lou marson
    


here's lou marson, the 19-year-old catcher who most consider the top prospect at batavia this year.  marson projects to hit with power, and seems to have good strike-zone judgement.  his glovework behind the plate is good, but in the series in oneonta, he was not throwing the ball well (most scouting reports say he has an excellent arm, so i assume he was sore then).  marson is now the youngest person on the batavia team, with carlos carrasco sent down to gcl.

	 mike costanzo
    


here's a picture of phils second round draft pick (the first pick they made) mike costanzo in oneonta, waiting for the lights to come back on after one of two power failures during the three game series against the tigers.  costanzo seems to have picked up his hitting a bit lately, but is still under the mendoza line in the nypl as i post this.  costanzo plays every second of every game at 100%, and will need to employ that intense effort in the offseason learning how to adjust to the wood bat.  costanzo's glovework is not pretty, but he gets the job done, and his arm is strong but not yet reliable.

	 2004 prospects list (details)
    


1. cole hamels, lhsp, clw, age 20acquired in the first round (pick #17 overall) of the 2002 draft.evaluation: hamels sparkled in spring training, but apparently overthrew versus the yankees and has been suffering from elbow soreness since.  his performance is so dominant that one can overlook injuries to a certain extent, but one more major injury (he was also hurt last year, and broke his arm somewhat famously in hs) puts his future in jeopardy, and would force his downgrade as a prospect.  throws 95 mph heat, good curve, tremendous change-up.stats: note: stat formats float off the edge of the blog--sorry!career:2004:quotes:arbuckle after his first start this year--"cole just walked in like he hadn't missed a beat," said arbuckle, who took a very cautious approach with hamels after the 21-year-old experienced mild elbow soreness in early april. "if does that over the long haul, then we've got to think of [moving him to reading]," arbuckle said.gordon heimuller's (minor league pitching coordinator) 2003 scouting report--"cole signed late last year, then went to [florida] instructional league and came up a little tender, so we started him out in extended spring training. we decided to let him dictate where he'd go, and he's been good enough that now we need to challenge him a little bit. his last few starts have been very good. he's got a real good fastball that's 91, 92 [mph], a very, very good change and a very good curve. and he's a good kid who's receptive to teaching. we're trying to change his delivery a little bit, and he's been great about it."buddy biancalana (lakewood manager) in 2003--"cole would win some games in the big leagues right now," said blueclaws manager buddy biancalana, who played six seasons with the kansas city royals and the houston astros. "i'm not saying he belongs in the big leagues, but he'd win some games there in my opinion." arbuckle again--"he's not a kid you look at and say, 'well, we've got to change this and change that,' " he said. "with him, he just needs innings and experience. as long as we can just keep him on the same channel he's on and give him those innings, he'll be fine. if it ain't broke, don't fix it. that's kind of the way he is. there's not a lot there we need to alter. it's just a matter of the innings and continuing to develop command and things like that." 2. gavin floyd, rhsp, reading, age 21acquired in the first round (#4 pick overall) of the 2001 draft (below is his hs picture).evaluation: floyd is apparently healthy this year, and pitching effectively in reading (though without much run support from his otherwise potent teammates).  he's reportedly still working on spotting his fastball and throwing his nearly unhittable curveball for strikes.  in my opinion he projects as a #2/#3 starter because his k-rate is not what you'd like for  a #1 starter, but he's still a stud prospect, clearly in the top 50 in all the minor leagues.  throws 92-94 mph fastball, curve, developing change-up.stats:career:2004:quotes:arbuckle and heimuller in 2003, on floyd's early struggles--"gavin was trying to copy millwood and slowed down too much," arbuckle said. with a slower delivery, floyd was 1-3 with a 5.19 era over his first five starts. since, floyd is 5-2 with a 1.71 over nine outings. he's allowed two or fewer earned runs in each of his last six games and now is second in the league in strikeouts (77) and fifth in era. "we shortened his stride a little bit, and now gavin is coming over his head with his arms to get a little more rhythm," minor-league pitching coordinator gorman heimueller said. "he's made a lot of improvements. he's throwing more curveballs for strikes, too." rotoworld on floyd last year--"floyd, the fourth overall pick in the 2001 draft, came in at no. 17 in the preseason top 100 prospects and will move up further in the midseason update coming next week. after a slow start to his season, the 20-year-old right-hander is back putting up outstanding numbers, posting a 2.56 era for single-a clearwater. he's given up 91 hits and five homers and has an 89/35 k/bb ratio in 102 innings. floyd is rather similar to brett myers , who has emerged as a quality starter for the phillies this season. like myers, his fastball can be fired anywhere in the 90-95 mph range and he has a curve and a decent change. myers has the slightly better fastball and superior control. however, floyd's curve pretty much negates that advantage. it's one of the best breaking pitches found anywhere in the minors, maybe the best. he's capable of forcing his way to the majors, much like dontrelle willis has."arbuckle on floyd's track to the big leagues this year--"i think gavin can go from double-a to the big leagues as easily he could go from triple-a to the big leagues," arbuckle said. "hitters need to see those experienced triple-a pitchers who can change speeds and locate. but if a pitcher is changing speeds and locating in double-a, i think he can do it in triple-a or against big-league hitters." even after friday's outing, floyd has good numbers, allowing 26 hits in 33 innings while fanning 26 and walking 13. "gavin has just continued what we saw from him in spring training, which was very good," arbuckle said. "he came to camp a lot stronger and is more mature all around." 3. jake blalock, corner of, lakewood, age 21acquired in the fifth round (#174 pick overall) of the 2002 draftevaluation: after crushing the ball in minor-league spring training, jake (hank's brother, of course) is fashioning a break-out year for a player who had shown decent power but little else in short-season ball.  as of this writing blalock has posted a .920 ops in one of the most difficult offensive parks in all of minor league baseball.  his defensive play in lf is improved--he's tall, deceptively fast once he's underway, and has a strong arm.  rates ahead of ryan howard due to age-appropriate acomplishment--he's almost two years younger for his level than howard is.stats:career:2004:quotes:arbuckle--"jake certainly has a chance to be a good, big-league power hitter," arbuckle said. "the strength is there. you see it in batting practice when he hits balls as far as anybody." a high school teammate of hamels in suburban san diego, blalock was a fifth-round pick the same year (2002) due to his size (6-4, 215) and tremendous power potential. but over his first two pro seasons, he was slow to develop and hit just six homers in 97 games. this season, he equaled that in 40 games. "jake's still learning how to hit," arbuckle said, referring to blalock's 39 whiffs in 139 at-bats. "when he stays on the ball, he can hit balls as far as anybody. it's a learning process with a young hitter." arbuckle doubts blalock will move up to clearwater at any point this season. "i think jake needs a year in that league," he said.4. ryan howard, 1b (not of!--yet), reading, age 24acquired in the fifth round (#140 overall) of the 2001 draft.evaluation: howard is having the type of minor league season that's very hard to evaluate--posting historic numbers, but in a hitter's park at a year above the normal age-level limit for a prospect. the photo above shows him in his new charlie-manuel-inspired/jim-thome-like stance, which seems to have resulted in fewer k's and better production.  howard is a fit, well-conditioned athlete who probably could move to the of if pushed by the phils, but now appears blocked at first base by #25 in philly and a reluctance to experiment by the organization.  he's showing better strike-zone control and plate discipling lately, especially versus breaking pitches, and very few of his homeruns travel less than about 400 feet, so the small dimensions in  reading don't play too much of a role in his hr production.stats:career:2004:quotes:arbuckle on the howard/thome dilemma--i think something like this has to play out,” arbuckle said. “it can be a tough situation for a player, but it can be a very positive situation for the club. and i don’t think you’re a good, competitive organization until you start developing these types of situations.” arbuckle also is not alone in the organization in his assessment that the 6-4, 230-pound howard is best suited for first base. “no, we haven’t talked about him playing somewhere else because i think his skills lend themselves to first base,” he said. “if we had openings in the outfield i’d say we’d be more apt to try it. i look at our club and we’ve got (pat) burrell in left and (bobby) abreu in right, so i don’t know that we enhance his big-league opportunity by moving him.” greg legg (reading manager)--“he’s probably the best power-hitting prospect that i’ve ever got to manage,” said reading manager greg legg. “this park can’t hold him. now he’s close to hitting .300, and that makes it even spookier. “he’s getting much more quality at-bats (lately). he’s been laying off some breaking balls down, and he’s actually hit some breaking balls out of the park lately. he’s coming on as a hitter, and the biggest thing that i’ve seen is that the league adjusted to him early there for a stretch, and now he’s adjusted back to the league. hitting at the higher levels is about adjustments, and he’s doing it.” 5. anderson machado, ss, reading, age 23aquired as an undrafted free agent (international--venezuela)evaluation: in the time he's been with the phils, the only question about machado was whether he could produce offensively since he's been considered a spectacular defender from the time he was signed.  he had a nice season in reading in 2002, but regressed when plagued with family troubles in 2003.  now, in swb, as a 23-year-old, he's posting his best offensive numbers yet, despite still being asked to switch-hit by the phils and having very poor results right handed.  again, though, he's blocked by a productive major leaguer in philly.  imagine if rollins were not on the team how much hype his +800 ops season would be generating.  i think he's been around so long people are underrating him.  one of the best bunters in all of baseball and a great base-stealer, his production this year has been slowed by an appendectomy in march.stats:career:2004:quotes:arbuckle this spring--"defensively, he can make major league plays," arbuckle said. "he just needs to be more patient at the plate." arbuckle last spring--"machado had a good season last year at reading (.251, 12 hr, 77 rbis, 28 errors), but we’re keeping him there because we want him to adjust his swing," arbuckle said. "he hits too many fly balls. he’s not going to be a home run guy. he’s an excellent defensive player who has a chance to be a well-above average, major-league shortstop. he can really run and does a lot of things well."arbuckle again last spring--machado is a natural righthanded hitter, but he feels more comfortable from the left side. in fact, last year he tried to give up switch-hitting and bat lefthanded only. the organization wouldn't let him."i think it's an advantage for him to switch-hit," arbuckle said. "whenever a player struggles, there's a temptation to make a drastic change. but you've got to look long-range. sometimes we can do that better than the player. maybe down the line we'd make a change, but now [switch-hitting] is worth sticking with."while machado says he needs to improve his hitting from the right side of the plate, arbuckle would like to see more consistency lefthanded."his swing can get a little loopy from the left side," arbuckle said. "he lifts too many balls. he's got just enough power to hit some home runs in [reading's] park, but when he gets into bigger parks, they'll be routine fly balls."we want the arc of his bat moving downward. we want him to hit the ball on the ground and use his legs. his 60-yard dash time is 6.5 seconds, so he can fly."minor league director of operations steve noworyta--"he's a big-league defensive player," noworyta said. "and he's starting to hit. his stroke is noticeably shorter from both sides of the plate. i saw him three games and he was hitting bullets everywhere. he looks like he's having a lot of fun out there," noworyta said. "it's good to see." finally, bowa--"he's got all the tools - athleticism, instincts, speed, arm - to be a big-leaguer," said phils manager larry bowa, who watched machado closely in spring training. "he just needs consistency making routine plays."6. michael bourn, cf, lakewood, age 21acquired in the 4th round (#144 overall) of the 2003 draft (cape cod league photo below)evaluation: bourne is still relatively young for low a ball, is posting a +.400 obp, is slugging way higher than expected, and at one time (prior to hamstring woes) was stealing bases at an almost historic clip.  most teams would have bourn in high a ball by now, and he seems to be a weaker defender than moran, but those are small nits to pick about a very promising prospect. he's the very definition of a leadoff hitter.  good bunter, nice left-handed slapping-type swing.stats:career:2004:quotes (bourn and moran are invariably referred to together--that's a mistake, i think...):arbuckle on bourn and moran's speed--arbuckle says that bourn and moran have been rotating at cf and are getting used to all 3 of spots to possibly land a job as a 4th outfielder in the majors, and he says that "it would be fun to watch those kids in a 60-yard dash"arbuckle--"i like both bourn and moran. we see the speed, the potential with the bat and both can really play center."arbuckle on bourn, moran, and moss pre-season--"we're going to run like heck in lakewood," arbuckle said. "legs are a huge tool for all three guys. we want it to be part of the learning process from day 1 - taking the extra base, stealing. we want that mentality all the way through the system for these guys. bill dancy (minor league coordinator) regarding bourn, moss, and moran--"there's going to be some rabbits (in lakewood), guys who can do some damage on the basepaths," dancy said.arbuckle again--"time will tell whether [bourn has] an inclination to hit leadoff, to take pitches, have a feel for that part of it," said mike arbuckle.je game report--"watching these two bat back-to-back, it's pretty easy to compare the two hitting styles.  bourn definately has a plan when he goes to the plate.  he seems much more than willing to make the pitcher work and doesn't seem afraid to take a strike or two.  extremely patient hitter, he clearly favors hitting the ball to the opposite field and using his speed.  in one particularly impressive at-bat against a tough side-arming lefty, bourn hung in tough and drilled a double to left center.  moran, on the other hand, is much more aggressive and lacks bourn's patience.  i couldn't help to think of doug glanville when i saw moran bat.  he's stronger than bourn and drove the ball better.  he seems to be the better athlete and defensive player of the two, but bourn's better acceptance of the fact that his job is to get on base whichever way he can, i think, will allow him to make a more lasting impact as a leadoff hitter at the major league level.  i have no doubt that moran can play in the major leagues on his defense alone.  one thing for sure, it is really fun to watch these two guys run, especially when their both on base." 7. chris roberson, cf, clw, age 24acquired in the 9th round (#260 overall) in the 2001 draftevaluation:  chris has been progressing a level at a time (love those aggressive philly promotion policies) since being drafted out of feather river jc in 2001, posting good obp's and stealing lots of bases (59 last year).  this year he has begun to hit with some power, and has put together an impressive streak in may an june, hitting .355, posting a 25-game hitting streak, and slugging .550 over the two months (in the big fsl parks).  he was also named mvp of the fsl all-star game.  at age 24 (almost 25) he needs to be promoted to aa soon.  arbuckle has said he needs to work on his defense and fielding n clw, but seems akin to arbuckle's quote saying machado needs to show more patience.stats:career:2004:quotes:arbuckle on his play this year--"he's really taken off," arbuckle said. "he's making better contact and driving the ball. and he's a double-plus runner."arbuckle again-"he's made great strides making contact," assistant general manager mike arbuckle said. "he's right on everything." arbuckle on the phils reasons for drafting him--"he was one of those guys we like to take a stab at," arbuckle said of roberson. "he hadn't played a ton of baseball. he was slow to come around at first, but we assumed that would be the case when we signed him. since the second half of last year, he's really begun to put it together." noworyta about being old for the fsl--"he's fine in that league," noworyta said. "he's at the age in that league where you need to be moving in the right direction and making progress. there's no doubt he's doing that."8. elizardo ("easy") ramirez, rhsp, clw (now reading), age 21acquired as an undrafted free agent (international--dominican)evaluation: an unbelievably dominant pitcher at the lower levels despite his rail-thin frame, posting one of the best k/bb ratios ever in the minor leagues in gcl 2 years ago (73/2).  throws a fastball in the low 90's, a slider, a curve, and a change, and can obviously throw all of them for strikes.  has a smooth motion and knows what he's doing on the mound.  he got his baptism of fire this june spending three weeks in the big leagues while injured philly pitchers recovered.  his success will depend on mastering a real "out" pitch (his curve is the best candidate), adding velocity, or becoming the next greg maddux.stats:career:2004:quotes:chuck hixon (web author)--"ramirez can do the basics, with a fastball in the low 90s and the usual movement that scouts look for on the pitch. his bread and butter pitch is the curveball. ramirez would make some major league hitters look very foolish with his curve and it’s even getting better. while his curve ball has been getting better and better, many around the phillies believe that he’ll gain more velocity over time. the phillies have also been working slowly on getting ramirez to throw a change-up that they think he’ll need to keep higher level hitters honest. "mike schmidt, clw manager--"he's around the plate and has great command."arbuckle last spring--"he's wiry-strong," arbuckle said. "he pitches at 90 m.p.h. and hits 92-93 with his fastball. he's got a good curve and change-up and throws all three for strikes at any count. he's got great poise. he's very advanced for a young kid, more advanced than the typical 21-year-old we get out of college."ramirez went 7-1 with a 1.10 earned run average in his 11 starts with the gulf coast phils last summer. he struck out 73 and walked just two in 73 1/3 innings.  he came over here and put up ungodly numbers in the gulf coast league. this spring, he has continued on that path. i'm usually reluctant to skip kids over levels. he had to show me this spring, and he has."9. scott mathieson, rhsp, lakewood, age 20 acquired in the 17th round (#509 overall) of the 2002 draftevaluation: the two best things about scott mathieson are 1) he throws 96 mph and 2) he's young. he's still inconsistent due to his age and his relative lack of experience, and he still needs work on his secondary pitches.  has posted about a 2:1 k:bb ratio and about a k per ip this year.  reports indicate he's a very nice young man who works hard and listens to direction.stats:career:2004:quotes:langley blaze coach jason andrew (courtesy of je's philliesdraftreport.com)--"i know that in a year this kid will put on some pounds and velocity and will be only better, as some players seem to level out he will not. he is by far the hardest worker and most athletic kid i have coached. many compare him to ryan dempster or aaron myette (both from this area) who i have coached against but scott has more mound presence and potential as far as i see. he has the same slider as jeff zimmerman who is a local and has worked out in the winter with    our pitchers. we are of course biased but see good things for scott. he also is one of the leagues better hitters and recently hit two home runs in a game with one at least 420. he often dh's and plays a little first base."bba this spring--"94 mph fastball with room for added velocity, mechanics as smooth as any in the organization, showed up in spring with added strength, will start in lakewood"gordon heimuller last fall--"what i like about this kid is he's picked up 2-to-3 mph over a year, and his delivery is smoother," heimueller said. "in canada, you don't get the innings that california [high school pitchers] get, so he's still really raw. but, boy, if you'd have seen him a year ago." arbuckle last fall--"he's been sitting between 92 and 94 and his 'pitchability' is getting better.  i'm always hesitant to throw out big-league names, but they [kendrick and mathieson] remind me of (san francisco giants' all-star) jason schmidt. because when we took jason schimdt when i was with atlanta, he was a northwest kid, but you had a great body, good delivery, all the ingredients that you said, 'if this comes together, this kid will be pretty good.' "mathieson on a start in lakewood coming off the dl--"it feels the best when i throw," mathieson said. "(missing time) was just frustrating. i always want to be out there on the mound, but they said it was just some bone spurs that would probably dissolve and they wanted to be cautious."10. keith bucktrot, rhsp, reading, age 23acquired in the 3rd round (#85 overall) of the 2000 draftevaluation: bucktrot throws pretty hard (94-5 mph fastball), but doesn't really have an out pitch, which keeps his k-rate down.  he's reportedly very competitive, and he authored a no-hitter and a 1-hitter in lakewood in 2001.  bucktrot has had trouble with command and with repeating his secondary pitches.  chosen as an fsl all-star in 2002 and fired 2 scoreless innings--also reportedly offered to pittsburgh in an effort to acquire jeff supan last year.stats:career:2004:quotes:arbuckle last may--"i feel real good with what keith has done," arbuckle said. "he's repeating his delivery, which has helped his command and control. stuff has never been an issue with him. he's a young power pitcher who has been slow to put together."arbuckle last july--"we obviously like him," arbuckle said. "we always thought he was a pretty solid prospect. it's kind of like i told somebody about ryan madson: 'a few years ago, we would have been raving about ryan madson.' but it's just the depth of the pitching that we have in the system now, and the ceiling that a couple of these guys have, that other guys get shoved to the side a little bit. in reality, they have some pretty good ceilings themselves. but we think we have a few guys that have a chance to be really special. but we've got some other guys like bucktrot, kids that have a chance to be quality big-league pitchers." reading pitching coach rod nichols last year--"his delivery has changed," nichols said. "it's awesome. it's slowed down. he understands it more. whatever work they've been doing in clearwater, it's been awesome. he's coming here with confidence and with that drive, as far as getting to the big leagues. that is his top priority. he's starting to smell it a little bit. he's been watching gavin floyd and cole hamels and elizardo ramirez. he's watching them. he doesn't want to be passed up."
