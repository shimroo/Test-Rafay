"i love the conversations i have with my children.  i love their love for history, for the world, for his word.  i love how they interact with strangers, for the kindness that they show, and for how they are learning to learn, learning to succeed, learning to fail, learning to be gracious.  i truly think that this model is the best of all worlds ."

"the end then of learning is to repair the ruins of our first parents by regaining to know god aright, and out of that knowledge to love him, to imitate him, to be like him, as we may the nearest by possessing our souls of true virtue, which being united to the heavenly grace of faith makes up the highest perfection." - john milton
