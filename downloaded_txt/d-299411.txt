alpha epsilon phi is a jewish sorority dedicated to helping women become the best they can be. we prize individuality, encouraging each member to discover and develop the talents and abilities that make her unique. we welcome exemplary women of all backgrounds who honor, respect, and appreciate our heritage.alpha epsilon phi sorority was founded on october 24, 1909 by seven jewish women at barnard college in new york city.  their goal was to foster lifelong friendship and sisterhood, academics, social involvement and community service while providing a home away from home for their members.  the dream that was born in a dorm room at barnard college in 1909 continues to succeed, prosper and thrive on over 50 college and university campuses in the us and canada.mission statementthe mission of alpha epsilon phi sorority is to inspire and support exemplary women dedicated to friendship and a lifelong commitment to alpha epsilon phi while building on the vision of our jewish founders.

interested in bringing aephi to your campus?during the last few years, we have established several new groups who began as local jewish interest groups or sororities who formed because jewish women on their campuses were looking for a comfortable home.  if you are a prospective member, member of an interest group, campus professional, panhellenic advisor or panhellenic officer, please refer to the national panhellenic conference’s website for details on the extension process.  for more information, you can also contact the aephi national office.
