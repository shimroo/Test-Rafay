    5510a usb modem review



 configuring 
    your dsl modem on the various dsl networks 

including the now famous no 
  wire home run page:
no wires to run and no dsl filters all over the house, the zoom 
  x3 and x 4 dsl modems have a dsl microfilter built into the modem eliminating 
  the need for any other filters in the house. 
 * this method also works for any 
  dsl modem using one dsl microfilter external to the modem.
* newer 
  models will no longer have the built-in filter

according to the latest itu data, we're now sixteenth. the 
      u.s. ranking is something itu and oecd researchers attribute to a lack of 
      a cohesive government infrastructure policy - but free-market fans and incumbent 
      supporters attribute to geography. the data indicates there are 11.4 broadband 
      subscribers per every 100 u.s. inhabitants.

      u.s. consumers must purchase voice service from the bell companies to get 
      dsl service. broadband

1-19-2004 
      u.s. drops to 11th in worldwide high speed internet deployment and falling 
      other 
      nations zip by usa in high-speed net race
labelle management fights a poky dial-up internet 
      connection every morning to see how 13 restaurants did the day before. the 
      company in mount pleasant, mich., can't get high-speed internet to all its 
      46 restaurants and hotels in michigan and indiana because it is either unavailable 
      or too expensive. "i dread dial-up," says tech chief michael reed. 
      far away in south korea, consulting-business owner james rooney surfs the 
      web 50 times faster than the best connections available to labelle. fast 
      internet in seoul is so cheap and widespread, he says, it's "like running 
      water."
despite its economic and political might, the 
      usa is falling behind other nations in arming consumers and small businesses 
      with a key economic tool: high-speed internet access, also known as broadband. 
      the usa ranks 11th worldwide in broadband use, according to a recent united 
      nations report, behind such places as south korea, hong kong and iceland.
spreading fast internet access in the usa is 
      so critical to long-term economic might that technet, a group of top u.s. 
      tech ceos, says it's the 21st-century equivalent of landing a man on the 
      moon. "i'm just amazed how far behind we are," says sung won sohn, 
      chief economist at wells fargo.
south korea's $50 billion program first linked 
      80 major cities and towns with superfast cable. then, the government launched 
      high-speed video services, such as telemedicine.
in the usa, broadband has been slowed by a 
      patchwork of federal and state regulations.
moreover, major phone companies didn't want 
      to invest in broadband because they feared the fcc would force them to lease 
      lines to high-speed rivals.
within two years, he hopes all of labelle's 
      properties have high-speed service.
by then, he can only imagine how cheap and 
      widespread it will be in places like south korea.

dave,

just thought i would fill you in on the x5 zoom 
  adsl. the unit is working like a champ. 
as you know i purchased this unit as a replacement 
  for an actiontech unit that was given to me as part of my qwest dsl hook up. 
  the actiontech unit was a supreme disappointment. the unit kept crashing and 
  was generally unreliable. 
the zoom adsl x5 modem is just the opposite. 
  it has been running non-stop since it has been installed. i have yet to re-set 
  it. this is how a product should work... 

i have several friends getting in on the dsl wagon here soon 
    and i will be telling them that the zoom modem is the way to go...

    thanks for you time and your assistance,

take care and the best to you and yours this 
  new year,

"big" john gonzales
