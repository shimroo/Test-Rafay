holistic means essentially in contemplation of the whole.  so when i'm putting together a plan for someone to address their symptoms, conditions or diseases, i have to consider their emotional health, their physical health, their nutritional health, their lifestyle, their stress level, what has happened to them in their life, and myriad other little things many of which have become rather intuitive over the 30 years i've done this.  in other words, natural healing takes a village...

can we escape from the womb






when patients sit down to tell me about their history, they never mention their parents, as though their personal experience is all that influences their health.  but in fact, our health history begins further back in time then we may even know.  jung had the right idea when he espoused the collective unconscious.  we truly are the sum total of our ancestry, not just our life experience.

are you depressed?  it may be a good thing!






our society and our medical community suggest anti-depressants for everything from digestive disorders to chronic skin conditions.  because we believe that what is a reaction to either external or internal forces is actually an aberrant unconnected emotion.  and if you feel better, then you are better.  next! this is a ludicrous conclusion.

don't let a little thing like a cliff scare you






how many people does it take to change a light bulb when they have a fear of heights?  always one more than you have on hand, which means you are all standing around the foot of a ladder looking up at the offending light bulb in sheer frustration.

are you too tired to sleep?






the true solution for insomnia lies with what is happening with your energy during the day.  if your adrenal glands are shot and you can barely crawl out of bed in the morning, then that has to be addressed before mr. sandman knocks on your door.

rediscovering the secret to preventing stiffness!  






a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away it was generally known that there was a specific fat-soluble nutrient that prevented stiffness and the accompanying arthritis, swelling and pain.  it was known as wulzen factor and it was found in raw milk, green vegetables, raw soybeans, unheated molasses and sugarcane juice.  aside from the green vegetables, we don’t really consume these foods and i know a few people that run away from green vegetables.
