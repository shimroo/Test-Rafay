	 home building market sluggish - buyers market
	 
    


with the home building market cooling off from the last few years of progress, there is no better time than now to buy a home. low interest rates and a heavy supply of homes in inventories makes for a prime buyer's market. the definition of a buyer's market is typically when more than six months of home inventory is on hand, or in inventory. the recent rash of foreclosures has flooded the market and sellers are looking to cash out, leaving home buyers with a serious advantage. unknown to many, the upcoming fall-winter season, which many think is a regular buyer's market, is actually a very good time to sell a home. while there might not be as many buyers, there are likewise not as many homes for sale, thus driving up the sale price of the few homes that are on the market. home ownership does come with such details as making your own home repairs and landscaping, but in the long run you will be investing in something that will shelter your family in more ways than one.labels: buy a home, buyers market, foreclosure, home building, home buying

	 cleaning out the garden shed
	 
    


i finished cleaning out the garden shed a few weeks ago. and suddenly i realized, why did i throw away so much stuff just to make more room in the shed. i'm a pack-rat, i must admit. but i still shouldn't have to throw away my stuff just to find more room to add more stuff in the future. so i was thinking, why not build another shed, only this time, bigger? so i came upon some shed plans and decided on the perfect size garden shed to build right next to the "old" shed. so my future plans are to start working on the garden shed when the weather cools a little. i'll post more about the garden shed and its progress when i get started on it.labels: build a shed, garden shed, shed, shed plans, storage shed

	 wooden garden arbors maintenance - diy
	 
    


maintaining wooden garden arbors is essential to ensure that they stay an aesthetically pleasing entrance to your garden. most arbors for the garden today are built to be maintenance free, but if you have built or are planning to build your own garden arbor out of wood, then you need to keep in mind that wooden arbors need annual maintenance. they will need to be cleaned and stained and also treated for insect and water damage prevention. make sure that water is draining freely away from the base of the arbor and inspect occasionally for insect intrusion throughout the months of each year. the better that you maintain your garden arbor, the longer you can expect to enjoy it in your garden.labels: arbors, garden, garden arbors
