mohjo, the missouri hunter jumper organization, is dedicated to the promotion of the hunter/jumper sport in missouri, as well as the metro east area of illinois.
we pursue the mission by promoting competitions, tracking points during the competition year and recognizing achievements at the organization’s end-of-year awards party; providing informational clinics to educate and support riders and trainers; by supporting local organizations involved in horse welfare; and by sponsoring events to foster camaraderie in the hunter jumper community.
established in 2002, our organization adheres to the principles and rules of the national governing bodies of our sport. we represent more than 200 riders and nearly 250 horses each year. jump on board and let your mohjo start working for you!
