we represent pest management companies of all different sizes from georgia and surrounding states.
cpcoofga was founded by twelve pcos, all with many years of experience in the pest control industry. they were discussing some of the problems our industry faces on a daily basis and what could be done to solve the dilemma. after much debate, they decided that the only way to relieve our industry of these problems was to do it themselves.
in may of 1998, the association was recognized by the department of agriculture. we are the certified pest control operators of georgia inc, (cpco).
