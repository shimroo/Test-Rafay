 an amazing sitka experience!! i did the land and sea tour on june 21st. we started out our day with the land portion and had a really great time. our guide was very knowledgeable! the amount of time at each of the stops was perfect, about 30 minutes at each. afterwords, we went on the water with capt. gary. he has an amazing network of people to know the best places to go to see whales. immediately after boarding the boat, he was informed of a large pod of whales bubble net feeding. we went right out to where they were being spotted even though it was a ways out. i have never seen anything so incredible in my life! we were surrounded by about 12-15 humbacks, and watch them come up to bubble net feed 3 times! i had 2 children and my grandmother with me, and i know all of us will remember this experience for the rest of our lives!! it's evident how much gary cares about what he does and the safety of the whales! he was so amazing with my children and it was like being out on the water with an old friend. i can't recommend this tour enough!read moreread less

 best excursion of our alaskan cruise. we had the most amazing time booking direct with gary for his best of land and sea excursion. 
gary went out of his way to call me when i made the initial enquiry and the amazing communication continued throughout.
we were lucky to see numerous whales, sea otters and a bear catching a salmon along the shore line.
garyâs boat was a maximum of 6 and his local knowledge and relationships with other boats owners ensured that we wasted no time and headed straight to the most recent sightings. 
garyâs interaction and attention to detail was absolutely perfect. 
you must book this trip as sitka was the very first port on our 11 night alaskan cruise and by far was the best excursion of our whole holiday.
in the afternoon we visited the raptor centre, fortress of the bears and totem pole centre and each of these stops were good to see but for me the whales and bear watching were the best.
many thanks

 when we come back, we are calling you! spending time with captain gary on his boat was well worth it! we were in port on a cruise but i booked our excursions on my own. cpt gary was recommended to me by another sitka vendor and i was very happy with the recommendation. on our boat ride, he took us over to the salmon hatchery. we weren't even there a minute and we saw a momma bear and her three cubs come out of the trees. we saw the momma bear dive in and catch a salmon to feed the cubs. as they were eating, another bear ventured down. she made it clear for the other bear to stay away. off the other bear went. the boat only had my family of 4, capt gary, and two other tourists - super nice ladies, so it was nice not to be in a crowd. we also saw bald eagles, sea lions on a buoy, and a sea otter randomly floating in the middle of the water.  captain gary - thank you for being a wonderful tour guide!read moreread less

				an excellent tour. not only did we see at least 20 whales, but the group does everything they can to make sure youâre excursion is top-notch and you get to hang out with the cutest little pup in the world if youâre lucky. his name is niko.  we went out with captain gary. iâve been on a few whale tours, and itâs rare a captain will go out of his way like captain gary did to make sure everyone had an opportunity to see and photograph the whales in the bay.  as a photographer, i highly recommend them the next time youâre spending a day or longer in sitka, alaska.read moreread less

				what an awesome experience!  my husband and i enjoyed this tour with captain gary very much.  from start to finish, it was fun and exciting.  we came from the cruise ship port by a free 10 minute shuttle. we boarded the boat which was new, clean and beautifully designed plus it had super comfortable seats.  before we even left the local bay we saw multiple whales and seals. we went to several areas to see more amazing whales, salmon jumping out of the water, otters and a waterfall! we were able to sit inside or go on the front or back decks for photos or to hang out a bit and observe the natural beauty around us.  as a fellow nature lover, it was fun that captain gary was excited to see the whales as well even after having grown up in sitka and seeing them many times before.  he was a wealth of knowledge about the wildlife and area, plus relaxed and easy going.  i appreciate the details about the whales names and that he recently found out how some were related.  this was our favorite tour of our entire cruise hands down.  we'll recommend captain gary's sitka adventures to everyone traveling to the area!read moreread less
