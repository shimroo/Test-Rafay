what our customers are saying about us



nellie k.always a great place to go for all your quality fitness needs. there’s no other place like teamsport. great prices great customer service and very knowledgeable. no need to try anywhere else you’ll only be disappointed.





josh c.amazing staff and prices. they are not overpricing people during this pandemic, which really shows you their character because they really can if they wanted to. this is my go-to spot for exercise equipment.





jenny m.fantastic tumbling training products. they were really helpful explaining what type of equipment would be best suited for our daughter’s training regime.





paul c.we were referred here by a trainer and live in northern california. they took care of our order as if we were family and followed up to keep us aware of every step. seamless and caring touches. i’d be happy to do business here again.
