foot-long cheeseburgers - finally?!





i didn't say much about the kfc "double down" "sandwich" when i saw it, because it's not a sandwich if no bread is involved, and i didn't think it would start a trend in americans eating worse than they already do. but then, i spotted this on the internets. it looks like carl's jr. has stepped up to the "let's make americans fatter" (dinner) plate and they're now offering foot-long cheeseburgers. this is no joke, looks like they're testing this concept out right now, but look forward a rash of massive coronaries hitting your town sometime soon.

machete trailer





i have to say, i enjoyed the 5 de mayo version of this movie's trailer better than this mainstream one, but that's not to say that the trailer doesn't make the movie look like a couple of hours worth of kick-ass. not to mention a terrific ensemble cast that's lead by the criminally marginally used danny trejo. finally, a starring role for the man that used to wash my father-in-law's laundry in the pen (true story). check out the video and make an appointment to cut into "machete" when it hits theaters later this year.

lindsay lohan sentenced to jail





yes, that's lindsay lohan, displaying emotions that she somehow doesn't know how to express while acting, but i guess they're warranted, since the california judicial system just sentenced her to 90 days in jail. and here i was losing hope in our judicial system, after my recent stint in jury duty. man would i have loved to serve on that jury. but, alas, the lohan drug fueled menace is off the streets and headed for lock-up. and why did the judge sentence her? aside from common sense, take a look at her probation report courtesy of radar online: lindsay lohan was taking a powerful cocktail of amphetamines and the powerful painkiller dilaudid during her probation period, radaronline.com has exclusively learned.the shocking list is contained in the 24-year-old’s probation report, which was given to a beverly hills court tuesday. it is expected to be released publicly wednesday.lohan, 24, who was sentenced to 90 days in jail for violating the terms of her probation, was also taking adderall – an amphetamine used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. the actress was also taking a combination of other drugs, including anti-depressants zoloft and trazodone. she also takes nexium, which is used to treat acid reflux.they were all legally prescribed to lohan, radaronline.com has been told. the drugs were detected in the mean girls star’s system after she began random drug testing on may 26.the combination had the potential to “kill her” when mixed with alcohol, said one source.and that's just prescriptions, who knows what else she was doing before she got on probation. while i don't feel sorry for lohan, i do hope she takes this time to reevaluate her life. she's got 90 days to realize she's hit rock-bottom.update: now, this post has video of the sentencing.

let me in trailer





"let me in" is the american remake of the superb swedish vampire movie "let the right one in", which in itself was adapted from a novel by john ajvide lindqvist (you should take a few days to check that out as well). now that you know all of that, let's just say that it looks pretty true to the original, but in ways, different than the original. mostly due to the casting and a spoiler i won't reveal from the original. but the casting will have a huge impact on that, so until i get to see the movie, i'll keep it pretty hush hush. unless you've seen the original yourself, you'll know what i'm talking about. check out the trailer. the movie is directed by the guy that brought us "cloverfield" and stars the hit-girl from "kick-ass".

rock band au natural





i have no problem with women playing videogames in the nude. in fact, i wouldn't mind seeing my wife playing "fairytale fights" totally naked. that would be thoroughly entertaining. and this video was enjoyable for the first couple of seconds until you realize that there are children in the background. most likely this naked woman's children. i don't want to tell anyone how to raise their kids, but this has got to be on the "don't do this" list.

predators international trailer





"predators" should be stalking your local cineplex pretty soon. i've seen a couple of trailers for it, but this international one is by far the best one of the bunch. i'm really liking the cast, even adrian brody looks tough as nails in this, specially when they drop him from low orbit straight into the jungle. that's some effective visuals right there. let's hope robert rodriguez knocks this one out of the park and it doesn't end up looking like one of his "spy kids" movies. oh, and danny trejo is in this one, so that automatically guarantees our ticket purchases. that is one bad ass mutha . . .
