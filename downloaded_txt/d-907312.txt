our services 










therapy

we provide individual therapy for children (5+), teens and adults. at some point, we all find ourselves having difficulty achieving our goals, which can result in feelings of anxiety or depression. using a holistic, strengths based approach, we can help you or your child explore factors that may have thwarted success.

psychological assessment

we are often aware we are having difficulties in life, but it is hard to pinpoint the cause of our distress. a comprehensive psychological or diagnostic assessment allows us to identify specific problems, how they developed, and how to address them.

neuropsychological assessment

neuropsychology refers to the relationship between behavior, emotion, and cognition or brain function. we conduct neuropsychological and cognitive assessment to assess various issues related to iq, brain injuries, memory deficits, psychiatric compromise (deficits due to psychiatric symptoms), etc.

forensic evaluations

forensic psychology refers to the intersection of psychology and the law. as such, forensic (psycholegal) evaluations are conducted to assist the trier-of-fact (judge) in their decision making process by addressing specific questions, either in criminal or civil cases.
