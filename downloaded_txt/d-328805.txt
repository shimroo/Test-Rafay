client testimonials 



what our clients say 





mr. edward zieleniewski 



michigan, usa 



"i have had a heart condition with congestive heart failure for 13 years. thirteen years ago i had a six-way bypass and a heart device implanted since then. two years ago i could hardly get out of bed due to weakness, shortness of breath and swelling. i was told there is no hope of improvement in my circumstances. i was referred to dr. goel by my cardiologist dr. thomas mathew for consideration of biventricular pacemaker and dr. goel suggested upgrading my device to a biventricular defibrillator. 





john r.
 



barcelona, spain
 



almost three years ago i experienced atrial fibrillation that put me into beaumont hospital for almost a week. at that time i was assigned the doctor on duty and ended up with a pacemaker and a list of drugs. the treatment and the drug regime did nothing to prevent atrial fibrillation or improve my general health. during the next year and many tests and procedures, my atrial fibrillation continued and got worse, as did my health and attitude.
