nzra the organisation for rheumatologists, 
healthcare professionals and scientists








who we arethe new zealand rheumatology association (nzra) is the organisation for new zealand rheumatologists, and other rheumatology healthcare professionals and scientists interested in arthritis and related conditions. the nzra is a non-profit organisation, registered with the charities commission and governed by the nzra executive.





why the willow?the willow tree you see above is the symbol of the nzra. the latin for the willow is salix, from which we get the word “salicylates”; a group of compounds that includes aspirin, the first non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent to be used to treat arthritis.
the willow logo was designed by the late dr moore tweed in the 1970s.
