about



about south walton community councilswcc history and purpose

the south walton community council is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving, protecting and enhancing the quality of life and unique natural environment in south walton county in the florida panhandle. founded in 1995, swcc is a nonprofit, nonpartisan coalition of residents, property owners, area employees, neighborhood associations, business owners and community leaders working together toward these goals. 

working toward a #sustainable walton since 1995!swcc developed when a core group of dedicated citizen leaders recognized a need for organized grassroots expression to make a difference in the community. the founding members of swcc recognized in 1995 how preserving and protecting the unique coastal environment would enhance the quality of life for all those who call south walton home.  become a member

 
swcc has continued to evolve as south walton has continued to grow!

our board forms a broad coalition of nonpartisan volunteers with great insight into an array of complex local topics while our executive director provides communications and management expertise. in recent years, we have evolved to include a professional executive director and administrative assistant to oversee daily operations such as communications, fund development, financial management and event planning. our dedicated volunteer board of directors, however, retains ultimate oversight over policy decisions and financial oversight. 


 


swcc pulls from a long history of community involvement and knowledge to provide our members and the community with an invaluable source of information and collaboration.
