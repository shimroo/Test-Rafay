come celebrate the 40th anniversary!
michigan womyn’s music festival - august 4-9,  2015.







community.this august we celebrate 40 magical years of womyn from around the globe gathering in intentional community - where the culture of feminism is the bedrock of our traditions and guides our way of living together.

celebration.held in a beautiful and remote forest, far away from michigan casinos, michfest is a full-on celebration of female art and culture filled music, words, dance, workshops, crafts, pageantry and play.

connection.join us as we celebrate our living legacy of badass females coming together for four decades - to build community, to recharge our energies, renew faded inspiration and to sit in the source of our collective power.
