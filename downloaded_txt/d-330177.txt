welcoming allthe indiana memorial union has been the heart of indiana university bloomington for more than 100 years. since its earliest days, the imu has served as the hub of the campus, providing a welcoming place for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and visitors to connect with each other and the campus as they eat, relax, study, play, or celebrate.today, over a century after its founding, the imu continues to be the lifeblood of iu bloomington—a home away from home for the iu community and a gateway for visitors to campus, greeting one and all with hoosier hospitality.learn the history of the imu indiana memorial union900 e. 7th street bloomington, in 47405hours: 7:00 a.m.–12:00 a.m.phone: 812-856-6381facebookinstagramyoutube  give nowupcoming events
