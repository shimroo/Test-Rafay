r2-d2 focused collecting news













2018 will be the last year for r2d2central.com


i started this website in 2003 as a place to just tinker with archiving my own collection and it grew into many other things.  i no longer have the time or money to focus on both the hobby and the website like i once did.  i pains me to say it but i do believe this upcoming year i will not be renewing the domain, and the site will go dead in the late fall of 2018.  thank you for visiting, may the force be with you...
