the linux users' group of davis
is a 501(c)(7) non-profit computer club serving the
sacramento region,
consisting of hundreds of people who share an
interested in the linux®
operating system, free
& open source software
and other related topics — both technical and non-technical.
our goals are to advocate the use of linux and open source,
to educate the community on these software alternatives, and
to support and provide a social network for local
linux users.
lugod holds regular meetings
twice a month.

on the first tuesday of each month, we hold a social gathering
at a local restaurant or café,

and on the third monday of each month we meet
at the davis public library to listen to informative
presentations by
guest speakers.
(day, time and location subject to change!)
we also hold other events and workshops
and maintain a number of active
mailing lists (some with over
200 subscribers), an irc channel
and discord server
for live chatting, and communities on
social networks (facebook and linkedin).
our meetings, events and membership, are
free and open to the general public. join us!

september 2021 update:

out of an abundance of caution, in-person lugod meetings have remained suspended, especially with the recent upswing in delta variant.
we plan on some online-only meetings to conduct neglected business, so please stay tuned for that soon. we miss you all, and hope that this
is over eventually. 

lugod still isn't going away - while we wait for the all-clear you can still chat with us on irc, on the mailing
lists, or find us on facebook. (see the sidebar for links.)  we also now have a discord server, available at
the following link: lugod discord!


until next time we meet,
-tim and the lugod officers
