 i cannot say enough about the exceptional service i received when purchasing my classic porsche 911 from martin godbey at vintage motors of sarasota. martin and his dedicated team went above and beyond what was required, making sure all my expectations were met. if you’re looking for a classic collectible car, call martin, you’ll be glad you did.

 blake and martin at vintage motors of sarasota were amazing and truly understood our needs. they were kind and patient with us while going through the meticulous process of valuating our late father’s car collection. vintage motors made true on their promise to market, and work diligently to get top dollar for all 24 cars, while keeping us informed each step of the way.

 i highly recommend vintage motors of sarasota if you’re looking for a secure place to store a valuable car collection. vintage motors is well lit, clean, air conditioned, and conveniently located on tamiami trail in sarasota. i shopped several other places in sarasota, but vintage motors was by far the nicest and they gave me the best rate.

 i am new to sarasota and learned about vintage motors of sarasota from a friend. the service and communication were excel- lent, and most importantly the work was done right and completed when promised. kudos to the amazing detail team who had my 1953 jaguar looking like new. i could not be happier.

 martin and blake godbey have helped me buy and sell eighteen cars too date. they are well connected in the industry, and have extensive knowledge on every classic car i have dealt with them on. it’s so refreshing to work with an honest and caring family owned local business. thank you vintage motors of sarasota, you’ve earned this high recommendation.
