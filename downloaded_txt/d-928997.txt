follow bipolar guy on twitter




http://twitter.com/bipolarguy





wow! i havent been here for a looong time! according to my feedburner stats there are still approx 200 of you subscribed to bipolar etcetera's rss feed.

despite all the intentions in the world i can't guarantee that i'll ever post to this blog again :(  if i do, it will be some kind of resurrection move which isn't on the radar yet. however i (bpg) am going strong on twitter. i certainly dont over-tweet and when i do its not really stuff about bipolar. mad stuff yes (as in tweeted by a bipolar guy) , but the product of rather than the topic of bipolar. 

if you want on topic bipolar stuff i'd recommend you get my book bipolar blogged - which consists of selected posts from this blog and was published a few years ago. the book hasn't done too badly as far as self published books go - no fireworks but a few 100 sales which still trickle in steadily.

its kind of sad to be "signing off" as it were (and in truth this blog will never officially close but always hang around in the online ether with the chance for me to fire it up again) - the days when this blog was peaking is nearly reaching its 10 year anniversary...

hope all you guys are well and hope we meet one day again. and rememeber:


"you're only given a little spark of madness. dont lose it" ~ robin williams

i'm still here...



yes, i haven't posted in a while. i guess its a case of "no news is good news". i'm doing pretty well. have slowly reduced my meds to about half of what they were 18 months ago. did it very slowly and it has worked wonders. my next goal is to ditch the prozac altogether. not gonna rush it tho, and i've gotta find a good sustainable positive patch to start the project in. 

as a result i'm not identifying so much with the "bipolarness" of bipolar guy. quite honestly right now "photographer guy" would probably be a better handle. but i'm actually getting tired of handles. i've got so many of the friggin things. maybe one day i will just be me - "proper name", and all my handles can have a great reunion at my propername.com place. it would be pretty cathartic.

but i'll always keep this blog going. there is a substantial body of musings, experiences and philosophisings in these pages and i'm not about to send them to the recycle bin.

one thing i must tell you about though is that for the past 12 months i have been inundated with spam comments. i used to wade through them diligently marking them off as spam and publishing the occasional comment from a reader. but i've kind of given up at the moment - there's just too many. so if you've commented in the past few months and it hasn't been published its not cos i don't like you. i will still get round to publishing it some time.in the meantime why not follow me on twitter. i'm still tweeting regularly as bipolar guy.

hope you guys are all well.
peace.

what is bipolar disorder?


"bipolar disorder 
(previously known as manic depression) is a psychiatric diagnostic category
describing a class of mood disorders in which the person experiences clinical
depression and/or mania, hypomania, and/or mixed states. the disorder can cause
great distress among those afflicted and those living with them. left untreated,
bipolar disorder can be a disabling condition, with a high
risk of death through suicide."


"the difference between bipolar disorder and unipolar disorder (also called major depression) is that bipolar disorder involves both elevated and depressive mood states. the duration and intensity of mood states varies widely among people with bipolar disorder. fluctuating from one mood state to the
next is called "cycling". mood swings can cause impairment or improved
functioning depending on their direction (up or down) and severity (mild to
severe). there can be changes in one's energy level, sleep pattern, activity
level, social rhythms and cognitive functioning. some people with bipolar
disorder may have difficulty functioning during these times."
