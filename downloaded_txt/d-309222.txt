	 day # 6 (days left)
	 
    


conferences went wonderfully! if you have missed your conference time, it will be dealt with in the same manner as a late paper - the conference will lose 10 points per day. conferences were on the class wiki, on the door of my office and discussed ahead of time: there is no exception.any rewrites that i asked for on the research proposal are due after class today. other rewrites will be due in class on monday. no exceptions will be made - the end of the semester is coming fast and i need them before we begin working on the drafts of the research project.today we will be discussing the presentation and the sign up schedule.also, i have an example of what you can do with the wiki for the presentation under joeschmo's wiki page. feel free to "edit the document" and see how images and url's were inserted.i will also go over what i will expect from your final paper which is due on may 4th in class.
