	 10 free gardening products
    



10 free gardening productslooking to buy some gardening accessories?  go to http://www.nursery-plants.info/garden-accessories/ by: linda grayone of the pleasurable spin-offs in organic gardening is finding alternative ways of coming up with the same, if not better, end result.....household throwaways can be valuable to the alternate enthusiast. here are ten recycleable ideas to make gardening a little less hard on the pocket!1. hedge clippings: instead of burning or direct composting, beg, borrow or even buy, if the quantity justifies the price, an electric garden muncher.branches up to an inch in diameter are posted into a slot and the machine munches them up into small chips. spread these chips thickly around shrubs or fruit trees to help keep moisture in, and control the temperature of the soil.2. food waste: all food waste must be composted.composting is becoming quite an art form, and special composting bins can be bought, or very simply made.there are many different theories and each gardener will find his or her preferred way. keeping the compost fairly warm is the overall key to a good result. or, if you're in no hurry, simply keep adding to a heap, and dig out the bottom when required. sieve before using and the compost will be ready for planting small plants and even seeds.3. old carpets, large damaged cardboard boxes; and similar materials can be laid over the vegetable plot in autumn to help prevent those early spring weeds appearing. spread over a whole patch and weigh down with stones or logs. lift off on a sunny day in early spring a few days before digging.4. paint trays: keep old roller painting trays and similar containers for seed trays. punch a few holes in the bottom for drainage. add a little fine gravel before filling with seed compost. seed trays shouldn't be deeper than 15cm.5. yogurt pots: all plastic yogurt or dessert pots can be washed and saved for re-potting seedlings. make a hole in the bottom of each and add a little fine gravel before filling with compost or soil..6. glass jars: glass jars with sealable lids are excellent for storing seeds, beans and peas for planting next year. (safe from mice as well) after washing the jars, dry in the oven to remove all traces of moisture before storing your seeds. collect dark glass jars, or wrap paper round clear jars to prevent seeds being damaged by light.7. ice lolly sticks: make perfect row markers in your seed trays or greenhouse beds. the wooden ones won't last for ever but you can at least write on them with pen, pencil or crayons!8. wire coat hangers: make mini-cloches with discarded or broken wire coat hangers. pull into a square shape. place the hook in the soil and push down gently until the natural bend in the wire rests on top of the soil. place another a short distance away in your seed bed to create two ends of a cloche. now throw over a sheet of plastic and hold down with logs or stones.note: this will work only when creating very small cloches.9. clear plastic: keep any clear plastic containers that could be placed upside down over a plant. cut a mineral water bottle in half to make two handy individual cloches. large sheets of clear plastic from packaged household items are fine for throwing over mini coat hanger cloches.10. aluminium bottle tops: keep aluminium tops from milk or juice bottles, and also coloured foil around beer or wine bottles. thread together to maka bird scarer. simply thread with thick cotton and hang on your fruit bushes before the birds find the new fruits.look out for other tools for the garden from kitchen throwaways such as: old kitchen spoons and forks for transplanting tiny plants in the greenhouse. leaky buckets for harvesting small quantities of potatoes, carrots etc; light wooden boxes for harvesting salads through the summer, and transporting pots etc;keep an eye on that rubbish bag and turn today's throwaways into tomorrow's tools!about the authorlinda gray is a freelance writer and, with her partner, has spent ten years renovating an acre of neglected woodland. with a growing family to feed 'off the land', frugal gardening has become second nature! drop in at http://www.flower-and-garden-tips.com for pots of gardening inspiration!  this article was posted on june 19, 2004looking to buy some gardening accessories?  go to http://www.nursery-plants.info/garden-accessories/index.html

	 growing nostalgic "old roses" in your garden
    



growing nostalgic "old roses" in your gardenby: simonetta jensenvisit http://nursery-plants.info/rose-bushes/rose-bushes.html for roses to buy for this spring"old roses" convey time honored tradition in the 18th century, the practice of tending rose bushes was popular and a handy source for young men to offer as gifts during courtship. these roses were not only beautiful to admire and richly fragrant but also highly symbolic of an unwritten and often unspoken language between admirers. in ancient times, some even believed that these roses contained medicinal properties.most of these "old roses" came from hardy shrubs that required moderate tending. today's "old rose" varieties are also for the most part hardy but require consistent attention before you'll achieve a seasoned gardener's level of perfection. the category of "old roses" is from a hardy stock of rose bushes and climbers that were popular in the victorian age. most of these victorian-age roses were imported from varieties that were first grown in greece and persia during the 15th century. these aromatic roses are still highly popular in today's gardens since they grow well in several zones and don't require the same highly detailed attention as many hybrid roses. to select an "old rose" for your garden, begin by examining your garden area and figuring out what roses work in that area.for instance, some "old roses" bushes work best as hedges while others prefer to crawl low as bed covers. many climbers first look like small bushes but climb well up patios, sides of homes, and fences. some other factors to think about when picking and arranging "old roses" are drainage, sunlight, shading, and insects. most "old roses" must be watered very frequently on a daily basis. sunlight is needed for about five hours a day for most "old rose" shrubsabout the authorcopyright 2005 simonetta jensen. all rights reserved.simonetta jensen is the webmaster and operator of roses abc inc which is a principal resource for information on roses and other flowers on the internet. for more info visit her archive of articles: http://www.rosesabc.com/ this article was posted on august 16, 2005visit http://nursery-plants.info/rose-bushes/rose-bushes.html for roses to buy for this spring

	 scholarship opportunity for high school seniors - start a nursery business
    



this is a great incentive for the older generation to share the love of gardening with the younger generation... the $1,000 somebody you love college scholarshipstart a nursery business... get your teen a college scholarship for $1000! who is eligible?you must be:a high school senior residing in the united states who will graduate high school in 2006. planning to pursue a degree at an accredited post secondary institution in the u.s. carrying a minimum 3.00 gpa at the end of your junior year of high school. note: friends, or family of anybody associated with mcgroarty enterprises inc. are not eligible to apply. the application process is unique. 1. you must involve a parent, a grandparent, aunt, uncle, or other mature friend or family member in this project. the purpose of the somebody you love college scholarship is to pair the student with a mature adult they love, admire and respect. the idea is to allow the student and the adult to share some quality time together, while at the same time learn the art of plant propagation, share a laugh or two, and the joy of seeing roots on your first successful batch of propagated plants. 2. you have to build and successfully propagate a variety of plants using the "simple homemade plant propagation system". the system is very easy and affordable to build, click on the above link for detailed instructions. it should cost you less than $20.00, maybe as little as $5.00 if you have some second hand materials you can use.you and your chosen adult get to choose the plants you'd like to propagate. if you follow the links on the "simple homemade plant propagation system" page they will lead you to all of the plant propagation instructions you'll need to be successful.(hint) don't over complicate a simple thing. softwood cuttings done in late spring or early summer are the easiest to do. you can have rooted cuttings in just 2 to 4 weeks. but if you are currently a high school junior or even a sophomore and are planning to apply for this scholarship in the future, you are also welcome to try hardwood cuttings as well as any kind of seeds you can think of. (we can not guarantee that this scholarship will be offered after 2006, but we certainly hope to make it available each year.)3. take photos of the plants you propagate, as well as photos of you and your chosen adult enjoying the process. you can even send us some homemade video of you and your chosen adult enjoying this process. we'd love to see that, but please keep it short, no more than 15 minutes.4. if you send digital photos please send prints as well. do not send more than five photos.5. write an essay about what you successfully propagated, what you gained from the experience, and what your long term goals are. you should also share a few words of wisdom you garnered from your chosen adult. the essay should be 400 to 700 words.keep in mind, the somebody you love college scholarship is more about you spending time with your chosen adult than it is horticulture. it is my sincere hope that as you venture off to school, your chosen adult will have learned a fascinating and rewarding hobby they can enjoy for a long time, and of course cherish the time they spent with you on this project.the deadline to get your packet in is july 31, 2006. a recipient will be chosen before september 1, 2006.mail your entry to:the somebody you love college scholarshipmcgroarty enterprises inc.p.o. box 338perry, ohio 44081 be sure to mention that chris chandler recommended you!thank you, and enjoy the experience.-mike mcgroarty, presidentmcgroarty enterprises inc.for more information, click here!
