april meeting
mobile bay canoe & kayak club is saddened to announce that our first meeting of 2020, the april 7th meeting, has been canceled.  
at this time, 5 rivers has closed all buildings including the gift shop,
 and exhibits to help prevent the potential spread of covid-19. they 
plan to re-open on april 6th, but due to our scheduled guest speaker 
traveling from out of town, and due to the uncertain future status of covid-19 and the cdc's recommendations for 
social distancing, mbckc made the decision to cancel the meeting.  we 
hope to resume meeting in may.             until then, stay healthy, practice social distancing and paddle.on!

november meeting





join mobile bay canoe & kayak club (mbckc) on tuesday, november 5th, at 7:00pm for the last meeting of 2019.  the meeting takes place in the longleaf room at five rivers delta resource center.  arrive between 6:30 - 6:45pm for light refreshments / meet and greet.  our guest speaker is ryan gillikin, winning member of the tandem team in the great alabama 650, who will share her story of her experience  during the great alabama  650.  ryan grew up on the eastern shore sailing and windsurfing.  15 years ago, she moved to bay minette and was introduced to kayaking.  she loves to explore the delta.  when asked why she decided to do the great alabama 650, she said “i started racing three years ago.  the thing i like most about racing is seeing new places and meeting like-minded people.  last year, i completed the missouri river 340 and was looking for a new challenge.  when they introduced the great alabama 650, i knew this was the race for me”.    the first annual "great alabama 650" took place in september of this year. hailed as the toughest paddle race in the united states and a test of strength, endurance and mental fortitude, this epic adventure took racers along the core section of the alabama scenic river trail (asrt), the longest river trail in a single state. from rushing whitewater to the ambling river delta, the race challenged even the most experienced paddler.
