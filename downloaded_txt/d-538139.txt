eight people are dead after heavy rainstorms in kentucky flooded roads. that is according to gov. andy beshear.  hundreds of people had to be rescued by the sudden flooding. beshear said many of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. he warned residents to stay off roads. beshear said the storms have knocked out power to about 39,000 homes, but he warned that harsh winds in some areas could increase outages.
