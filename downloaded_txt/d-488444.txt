importantannouncement regarding electronic reportingfor abo/ncle certified users



						the abo/ncle now requires us to have your six-digit abo/ncle certificate number to report your ce activity electronically each month. 
						
if we do not have your correct abo/ncle certificate number at the time of test completion, your ce activity will not be electronically reported and you will need to submit your ce certificates to abo/ncle by manually uploading them to your profile on the abo/ncle website to receive ce credit!

						if your abo/ncle certificate number is missing or incorrect, update it now. you should also add or update any additional licenses in your quantum optical user profile at this time. 

the abo and/or ncle certificate number(s) you entered in your quantum optical profile are:
abo: 



ncle:
