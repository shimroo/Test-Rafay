two months?





wow, no one has posted here in a while!  hope everyone's projects are doing well.i thought i'd just share a few quick things about my current project and a couple new things too...my film "killing down" played at the cannes film market recently and the dvd should start popping up in europe and the middle east in the near future.  no domestic deal has been inked yet, but we have several offers.  still trying to find the best fit and honestly not in a huge hurry.my new feature is moving ahead nicely too.  hope to shoot it in the late fall or early spring next year.  can't reveal too many details just yet, but i did just get word today that a name actress is very interested in one of the lead roles.  so that is very good news!  i will be posting more info about this very soon at my blog and in the trades.last thing is i'm developing a new web series too, and we're going to shoot it in late july and plan to "premiere" it shortly after labor day.  pretty excited about this new project for many reasons, but mainly because it's so different.  we're producing 10 three-minute webisodes (the "pilot") with a very serialized/graphic novel feel to them.  got a couple recognizable actors for this show too, so i hope it helps build an audience.  one interesting side note is i'm using aftra on this show instead of sag.  seems a lot of web shows are going with an aftra contract.  i've been told they're easier to deal with and have better plans.  we'll see and i'll let folks know how the experience works out.  a new website dedicated to this project along with a myspace page will be up in the near future.  i'll definitely post info here too if anyone still read this. sujewa, you still out there? :)-blake

indiefilmpedia group blog set up





at lucas mcnelly's 100 films blog there is a quite a bit of enthusiasm by a handful of people, yours truly included, about starting a web based independent film encyclopedia - a wikipedia for indie films, if you will. as a very early step in harnessing this energy, the group blog indiefilmpedia has been set up. interested people at the 100 films blog have been invited to start organizing material for the wiki at the indiefilmpedia. maybe this will turn out to be something, maybe nothing, maybe a better working tool will be discovered, but, for the moment, here it is. we'll see what lucas & the 100 films commenters will want to do, i am certainly all for the project (as time permits).- sujewa

lucas @ 100 films wants to review your real indie film





read all about it here. and here is a bit of the post where lucas talks about his new project:" i've been trying to think of ways to make the no-budget filmmakers who, in my opinion, are an extremely important niche in the indie world, all that more viable to the larger film community. one method i've come up with is using the internet to write about them in much of the same way i'd write about the latest release from focus features. this serves two purposes: 1) it provides much needed exposure (even if it is only a little bit) for filmmakers who work very hard with little to no recognition, and 2) it's a critical voice by which they can get a sense of just how their film plays to someone who isn't inclined to dole out empty praise or criticize needlessly[1]. and being a no-budget filmmakers myself, i figure shining as much light on others as possible has to have some benefits, in terms of karma."and here again is the total post at 100 films.- sujewa

american messiah at afi dallas





(also posted at my blog):so -- the schedule is finally official, and i can now announce publicly that the proper care & feeding of an american messiah will screen at the afi dallas international film festival.the film will screen twice during the festival, at the magnolia theatre in dallas:screening #1: saturday, march 24th, at 4:30pmscreening #2: sunday, march 25th, at noonvery pleased to be screening at such a prestigious fest! scheduled to be in attendance: uber-indie filmmaker david lynch, sydney pollack, lauren bacall, laura dern, sarah polley, and jack valenti!schedule note: david lynch's new film, inland empire, will be screening directly after mine on saturday, march 24th. mr. lynch himself is supposed to be in attendance to receive an award from the festival. now, i ask you, wouldn't it be cool if he came just a little bit early to catch a little film about a guy who thinks he's a messiah?

updates on my '07 feature filmmaking for the poor





no site/page for this film yet.  but until the project is done & or until i set up a site for the film (& possibly even after that), updates on my new feature filmmaking for the poor, a comedy about low budget filmmaking, can be found here.  i am working on the script now and i expect to be able to shoot this movie starting in may - june.  most likely the movie will have several stories about low-budget filmmaking, including one inspired by making & self-distributing date number one.- sujewa

killing down in indie slate





there's a piece on my film killing down in the new issue of indie slate...http://www.indieslate.com/instead of focusing on the normal "how i made" the film, the article talks about my foreign distribution and delivery requirements, etc. i haven't seen the story yet, but hopefully it's got some good info in it for filmmakers.you can get a copy at most borders books or barnes & noble.also, just an fyi - we have two offers we're currently considering for our domestic rights. however, we might do a "service deal" to keep more control. can't decide. since we did well on our foreign sale we have more flexibility to choose on the domestic side.one way or another though the movie should be available pretty much everywhere later this spring and summer. :)-blake

so what do we think about self-distribution now?





in early '06 a few filmmakers, myself included, had a long discussion about the prospects & potential of self-distribution - the discussion was spread out over several blogs, most noticeably at david lowery's blog. 2006 proved to be a year that, in my opinion, offered an unprecedented amount of highly visible (possibly due to blogging) self-distribution activity in indie film. now i am interested in what interested people think about self-distro, post-'06. so at my main blog there is a post to get the conversation started. check it out, comment if you feel like sharing some opinions & observations. specially filmmakers who self-distributed a work in '06 or filmmakers who are thinking about doing so in '07. thanks! so go here to get started.

made a cool yellow t-shirt with black art (ad art from the '06 world premiere, pictured), a coffee mug, button & a couple of magnets & an '07 calendar. a fun effort to raise some cash for the many distribution expenses that will come due this year as i distribute date number one. check out the cafepress store & if ya wanna support the project, buy something please. the most important merch item of them all, the dvd, is on the way (definitely this winter/before march). here's the store link. thanks!
