           new series





evocation after keeping my analog photos from the first half of my life sealed in a box for over 15 years, the sudden loss of my brother gave me the courage to confront those memories. opening the box forced me to face a challenging upbringing, and it was from this moment that this series was born.this piece, ‘château de grace’ was selected for artfields 2025

  










           connection





the space withina response to our isolation and the challenges resulting from the pandemic as well as our longing for connection and intimacy. the series reflect on the space within our minds and thoughts as well as the space within the relationships.‘the space within becomes the reality of the building’ -frank lloyd wright

antoine de villierssouth african artist currently based in savannah, georgia, usa. antoine specialize in emotionally driven abstract and figurative art. she is a veteran of over 70 exhibitions and have lived on 4 continents.

 



   

”gorgeous, one of a kind artwork that is dense with emotion. i ordered an original nude painting and it captivates me. i wonder who the people on the canvas are and what their story is. there is so much painted between the lines. antoine is very kind and was clear in our communications. she shipped my parcel straight away after i ordered it and even kept an eye on the tracking for me to check that it had arrived. i would highly recommend her work to anyone. i feel very lucky to have come across antoine and her paintings.” jackie härdig
