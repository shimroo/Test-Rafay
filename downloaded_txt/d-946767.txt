machine knitters news  


















 







for our march 2025 workshop, susan is going to show us how to do aran knitting using a japanese knitting machine, including a double-bed primer (setting up the ribber), reading aran charts and strategic placement of aran motifs, using plating to enhance the patterns and ideas for doing a single-bed version which looks similar for folks without ribbers. 











the last day to get member discount pricing is february 22, 2025.   











philanthropy projects for this month 


















from barbie:  i sent a box of scarves, hats, gloves and a sweater to a church distributing items to hurricane milton victims.  i also donated a very big leaf bag of various yarn that had been donated over time to future farmers  of america, they will be having a  sectional conference where they will be teaching crocheting.  
168 items were collected at the holiday party. a total of 174 items were available for the holidays. our total for the year is over 200 items.  on dec. 9th,  5 organizations came to her house,  a nursing home, young mom’s and 3 assisted living homes.  they “shopped” for their clients in barbie’s “store”.   she also gave 3 hats to angel tree for kids with incarcerated parents. she also worked from 8:30 to 1 am to sew on 16 sets of wheelchair covers to surprise the residents when they got up in the morning. this brought a lot of cheer. they will be recycled as lap blankets when they come off the chairs for laundering. barbie has zero reserves and is ready to accept items. she knows all is truly appreciated due to her close interaction with the recipients.  all is welcome from squish balls to sweaters. i am extremely low on all items for donations.  please help me get stocked up again, 








please knit lots of hats.  
we need hats for premies, and chemo hats, and hats for veterans.
we also need baby clothes.
knit lots of socks.  adult socks should not be tight at the top.
don’t forget lap blankets and shawls and twiddle muffs.
knit hand puppets.  
all donations are welcome from squish balls to sweaters.

check out our philanthropy patterns and our free patterns.
barbie just made connections for more places to donate and anything you make is welcome and will find a home.
