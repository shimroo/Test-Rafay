colorado security threat intelligence network group (s.t.i.n.g.)
colorado security threat intelligence network group (co s.t.i.n.g.) is a state wide organization whose mission is to disseminate intelligence and monitor the activity of street gangs while they are on our streets, in our jails and in our prisons. 

the nature of the criminal activity conducted by these groups is increasingly becoming more visible.  s.t.i.n.g. was formed to meet the growing need for more pro-active law enforcement activity.
