missionwe are passionate about all phases of cartography in its broadest sense. we are fascinated by the potential of remote sensing, gis, and the tools for today’s digital mapmaking. we also love the art and history embodied in antique maps. understanding humanity's continuing change in perception of the environment and world is part of the fun of viewing old maps. we never fail to delight in the curious forms that maps have taken over the centuries.
when you’re ready to be part of a great group of map-loving people of varied backgrounds, please come to one of our meetings as our guest or join our society now.
