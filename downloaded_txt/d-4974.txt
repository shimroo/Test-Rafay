welcome


welcome to canteach! for over 25 years we’ve been providing free online resources to primary educators. we’ve recently redesigned the bulk of the website, eliminating dead links and re-formatting much of the site for consistency. if you notice anything out of place, be sure to let us know.
please choose a subject area from the menu above.
one of the most popular areas of the site is the songs & poems section.
