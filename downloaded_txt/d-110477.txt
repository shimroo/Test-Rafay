don't let the government con you into believing that the national ocean policy is good for the country. 
if you are a boater, fisherman, diver, either recreational or commercial or if you care about our energy resources and other natural resources that are available in or from the oceans then you should be very concerned over this 'national ocean policy".

our fishing rights are under attack like never before in the history of this nation! i urge everyone, saltwater and freshwater, boat or landside fishermen to get involved in the politics of fishing now! (see the two "warnings" below) there are so-called 'environmental' groups getting 'tough' with the politicians and pretending they are pro fishing, when in reality they want all uses of our waters to cease immediately. no more fishing, recreational or commercial, no water skiing, no boating, no houses on the shores, also no hunting, no hiking in the wild, no nothing!
if you sit back and continue to do nothing, you will soon have nothing!
here's an example of your government at work for you: public input period for federal fishery strategy has ended


fatally flawed science killing america's   number one outdoor pastime





september 28, 2009 - despite a congressional mandate   to fix the “serious flaws in design" and “inadequate analysis methods" that   renders mrfss obsolete, the national marine fisheries service continues using   this fatally flawed program to deny the public access to coastal fisheries like   red snapper, amberjack and black sea bass, crippling the recreational fishing   industry. click here to read mrfss position   paper.
                      
(note from ed.: this is what i told everyone about in june of '09. nmfs is now considering a total closure of the bottom fishery in the south atlantic and the gulf of mexico that could possibly close fishing for up to 35 years.)

ethanol-15
strong pro-ethanol advocates are pushing the obama   administration and the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) to   increase ethanol levels in gasoline to 15% (e15). as you may have read   in boatus magazine, ethanol at the currently allowed 10% (e10) level   has been shown to cause significant problems for some marine engines and boat   fuel systems. click here for more info
