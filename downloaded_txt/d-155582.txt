president's address 













i am the current president of the alpha delta phi - british columbia chapter, and am proud to say our chapter’s membership is full of accomplished and well-rounded ubc students involved not only in greek life operations, but as well as ubc student governing bodies, varsity athletics, and various ubc clubs. being the first and eldest fraternity on campus, our roots and literary origins are deeply connected and have created an outstanding alumni network through academic excellence and dedication to brotherhood. since pledging in 2022 with the continual support of my brothers, and against all the odds and hardships i have faced, the accomplishments and feats of the fraternity have been worth my full investment.if you have any questions, please contact myself atjhmuk1@icloud.com- james martin bc ‘24
