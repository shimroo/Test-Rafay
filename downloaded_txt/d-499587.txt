major links:

the german
          propaganda archive. this is a large collection of propaganda
          materials  produced during the nazi and east german periods. it
          includes hundreds of translations from the german, along with thousands
          of images. most  pages are hosted at the calvin university web site,
          but some are on this  site to allow for advertising. these pages
          of the german propaganda  archive are housed on this
            server. additions to the site are posted on the gpa blog.
