 "in 
        germany they came first for the communists and i didn't speak up
        because i wasn't a communist. 
then 
        they came for the jews and i didn't speak up
        because i wasn't a jew.
then 
        they came for the trade unionists and i didn't speak up
        because i wasn't a trade unionist.
then 
        they came for the catholics and i didn't speak up
        because i was a protestant.
then 
        they came for me -- and by that time, no was left to speak up."
