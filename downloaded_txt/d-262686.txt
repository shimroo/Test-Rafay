		contact me. i accept personal checks, money 
		orders, or paypal.

as a collector i am always 
		hoping to upgrade or add new "brewery gems" to my collection. for my 
		specific "heart's desire" - see my
breweriana wanted page. perhaps you have some brewery 
		items you wish to part with.





brewery histories



this 
		site contains over 95 western 
		brewery histories, beging with the olympia brewing co. and 
		its four branches: the bellingham bay brewery, the salem brewery 
		association, the acme brewing company, and the port townsend brewing 
		company.

		i've also included 29 profiles on notable brewers and brewmasters - 
		including emil sick and andrew hemrich, both of rainier fame; as well as 
		olympia's leopold schmidt.
an alphabetical listing can be found on the 
		
		site map.
