in 2019, iâ presented aâ webinar, math and colour science for colourists (aces). itâs aâ mathematical take. if youâre interested in experiencing that, drop aâ line.



iâm hoping to do aces seminars in prague and/or budapest.

digital video and hd algorithms and interfaces, second edition (burlington, mass.: elsevier/morgan kaufmann, 2012), is available at elsevier, amazon, and other book retailers.

iâ was, aâ decade ago, flummoxed concerning bt.709/bt.1886 eocf â¦
subject to my main gigs in olour and image science, if you have an interesting math problem maybe iâ can help, by offering consulting in mathematica.
