giving back is part of who laura gutierrez is and how she chooses to show up in the world. what began as a high school volunteer requirement soon became a deep commitment to philanthropy. the impact of those early volunteer experiences—whether at a soup kitchen, building homes with habitat for humanity, or helping to beautify a local school—left a lasting impression on her.  through her career focus, giving financially, volunteering, and board service; she has committed to making a meaningful difference in her community.

partnerships & initiatives
unity fund serves as a vehicle for addressing our region's urgent needs. contributions enable unity fund to pool resources and support frontline organizations that are providing critical services such as emergency food, clothing, housing, and legal aid. in 2023, unity fund made just over $1 million in grants, largely focused on preventing and ending homelessness for particularly vulnerable groups: youth, survivors of gender-based violence, and asylum seekers. your generosity ensures we can continue providing critical support.
