				how to decorate your kitchen like a pro using colorful themed 
				accessories



            looking at our favorite colors and themes makes us feel good. the kitchen is where the day begins and ends for most of us. 
           




  				but, did you know that when we feel good about our home decor it carries good feelings and self-esteem where ever we go? 
				
  				so kitchen ceramics we enjoy looking at actually impact our personality.

			when decorating with color, remember you are "coordinating," like 
			putting together a bouquet of flowers. other than by accident, you cannot expect to match colors precisely. 
			even when they're made in the same place, dye lots can vary by a tone.




what people don't understand about professional 
			decorating is that different light and different surroundings alter colors in 
			your room. one same allover beige pattern can lean from 
			pale off white outdoors to greenish to goldish. somecolors 
			look better in a different room. to get around this, a multi-color 
			pattern will camouflage the matching problem. 

			it tricks the eye and coordinates beautifully with surroundings.



			it is difficult to determine exact color online because 
			colors will vary by computer, browser, and monitor. as such, you should avoid buying anything with the intent 
			to make an exact match. think of putting together a bouquet of complimentary colors.

we offer a professional chef knife for every need...
                at wholesale prices!
                capco custom commissions and imports tough, molybdenum and vanadium reinforced japanese stainless steel knives. especially important when cutting near bones.

                forschner-victorinox uses stainless steel from solingen germany. (forschner is famous for the "original" swiss army knife). especially great for easy honing
				when slicing repeatedly commercially. german stainless steel is softer. the fine edge
                is incredibly sharp but gets dull frequently and is in danger of chipping if it hits bones. it hones right back with a couple of swipes on your steel.


                japanese stainless steel is the hardest. it holds its edge the longest and is less likely to chip if it hits a bone. it also requires longer honing time to re-sharpen.

                bent handles (knuckle-savers), curved blades, flexible blades, dual handle pizza / cheese knives, steak, kitchen cutlery, cleavers, carving, paring, fillet, boning, bread, bagels,
                butcher scimitars, ground edge, granton, serrated, and wave edge, sharpening steels, grapefruit, clam, and oyster knives.

                all capco commercial knives are japanese knives custom designed in usa by capco, reinforced with vanadium and molybdenum to stand up to commercial use.

                our capco for japanese stainless steel and forschner german steel professional chefs knives, kitchen knives are available with nsf polypropelene handles, or hardwood handles.

                rada knives have hefty cast aluminum handles. our low prices and superior quality will amaze you...professional chef knives, butchers, commercial kitchen knives, kitchen utensils, for
                restaurants, and caterers.

                for home use, you'll never be happier than when you cut with usa-made 420 surgical stainless steel, hollow ground razor edge, kitchen knives by rada manufacturing co.
