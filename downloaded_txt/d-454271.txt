suppliers collaborating to advance the structural building component industry

 









historyprior to founding of the truss plate institute in 1960, plate manufacturers had to work with federal housing administration (fha) and the many various local code jurisdictions in having their products and designs recognized. from 1950 through 1959, a plethora of truss design methodologies and testing procedures existed for plate connectors, nailed plywood or nail-glued plywood, bolts, split rings, and so on. generally, joint design criteria relied either on wood-to-steel-to-wood or wood-to-wood bearing for transmitting stresses. additionally, numerous plate manufacturers' proprietary design methodologies were the norm. the confusion this created with model codes, local code jurisdictions and fha raised persistent questions regarding structural adequacy.
