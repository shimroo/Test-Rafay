best italian ontaylor streetseasoned with love for generations 

 











 

located in the heart of little italy, pompei on taylor street has been serving authentic italian cuisine for over four generations.pompei was established by luigi davino back in 1909. he called it pompei because it was located near our lady of pompeii church. luigi married carmella, and they had four sons & a daughter. the family lived above the bakery and worked many long hours making only bread and cheese pizza.after returning home from world war ii, luigi’s sons helped run the business. his eldest son, alphonso, ran the bakery for 30 years with his brothers ralph, solly, and “uncle rogie.” when “uncle fonzie” retired in the 1980’s, his nephew ralph continued the family business with the support of his wife rosemarie, mother marie, sister carmela & his children, kim & tom.since then, our menu has expanded to what it is today. using only the freshest & finest ingredients, we will continue to carry on the family tradition that luigi instilled in 1909. pompei is proud to say we have been serving families for 4 generations.
