at soter, we farm our wine.our commitment to biodynamics means we work within a regenerative farming system focused on biodiversity, integration of plants and animals, and soil health. demeter usa is the only certifier for biodynamic farms and products in america. while all of the organic requirements for certification under the national organic program are required for biodynamic certification, the demeter standard is extensive, with more stringent requirements around imported fertility, greater emphasis on farming solutions for disease, pest, and weed control, and in-depth specifications around water conservation and biodiversity.biodynamics at msr ▸
