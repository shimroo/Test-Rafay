world kidney day









world kidney day is thursday march 10, 2022






national hurricane center
dialysis patients please note: if you think the hurricane is coming in a few days, optimally try to get out of its path - evacuate to another city.
immediately after a hurricane, many of the roads to dialysis units may be flooded, possibly preventing you from receiving your treatment. please restrict your fluids. avoid foods containing potassium or salt. call your dialysis unit hotlines for information regarding the status of your unit. do not attempt to drive into water on roads. turn around. make sure you have all the information about your dialysis, your doctor, your unit with you if you need to dialyze in a different unit.

wt removal with dialysis
soon at an app storeit has been shown that the maximum amount of fluid removal during dialysis should be less than 13 cc/kg/hr to avoid risk, but that even at 10cc/kg/hr heart failure symptoms start to develop. removing more than this is associated with increased mortality. therefore, dry weight should be accurately assessed and monitored frequently. patients should be counseled on salt intake, and the bath sodium should not be greater than 138 meq/l. patients should be advised to gain less than 2 kg between treatments. an alternative to fluid removal greater than 13/cc/kg/hr is to extend treatment time or to bring the patient back the following day for an additional treatment.
