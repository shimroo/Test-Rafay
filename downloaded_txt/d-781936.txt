guests reviews

my family and i stayed for memorial weekend and felt like family before we even arrived. the staff is very caring and attentive. they were genuinely interested in getting to know us and us getting to know them. we enjoyed meeting the other guests and the conversations with them and the staff over a home made breakfast in the morning and drinks in the evening. my 9yo was so excited to be able to help with the goats and chickens. and the black cat was a loving ambassador to all guests. 100% will go back and recommend to anyone who is looking for a beautiful location with amazing service. thank you so much to all of you for a memorable experience!!!!lisa quirk, june 2024while on my 7000 mile road trip around america, i had the pleasure of spending the night at full moon. what a great decision that was. the grounds are amazing, including the tiny chapel (best photographed at twilight). the hosts were awesome and made me feel right at home. i wish i could have stayed a week there.danny mcdeevaroom was clean and comfortable, hosts made you feel right at home. met great people every single morning at a delicious breakfast with eggs from the property and local meat. could not have been more happy with our stay.richie fordwent for my niece's wedding. we had a 2 story little place. very nice. the historic decor inside was not only great to see and read, it fit the atmosphere. the owners were very accommodating to my mother in law, who is handicap. after the wedding and it settled down, the owners came and talked a while on the porch. the breakfast the next morning was out of this world! gummia return to this fun and relaxed bed and breakfast. this time we stayed in the oil boom room. the owners did a great job finding relics for this room. the grounds of the bnb are well taken care of and follow with the theme of old texas. the other plus is how close this place is to fredericksburg, wineries and eateries. the owners are fun and seem to enjoy hosting a wide variety of guests.deborah rhinemy family and i stayed for memorial weekend and felt like family before we even arrived. the staff is very caring and attentive. they were genuinely interested in getting to know us and us getting to know them. we enjoyed meeting the other guests and the conversations with them and the staff over a home made breakfast in the morning and drinks in the evening. my 9yo was so excited to be able to help with the goats and chickens. and the black cat was a loving ambassador to all guests. 100% will go back and recommend to anyone who is looking for a beautiful location with amazing service. thank you so much to all of you for a memorable experience!!!!lisa quirk, june 2024while on my 7000 mile road trip around america, i had the pleasure of spending the night at full moon. what a great decision that was. the grounds are amazing, including the tiny chapel (best photographed at twilight). the hosts were awesome and made me feel right at home. i wish i could have stayed a week there.danny mcdeeva
