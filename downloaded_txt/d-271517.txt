buying granola and other foods from the bulk bins has many advantages over traditional packaged foods. here’s why:save money.bulk foods are often much cheaper than packaged foods due to savings on packaging, transportation, and merchandising costs that are passed along to the consumer.less packaging.bulk foods prevent a significant amount of packaging from entering landfills and bulk goods require less overall transportation to deliver to consumers. bulk foods do not require the packaging components that must be produced and transported prior to being filled. plus, the transportation of bulk product to retailers is efficient because it can be packed more densely on a truck.the perfect amount.food packaging can limit your ability to buy in quantities desired which can result in food surplus and ultimately waste. when buying from the bulk bins, you can purchase exactly how much you need- a pinch or a pound.seeing is believing.packaging often limits a consumer’s ability to actually see the product they are buying. with bulk foods, you can see right into the bins and so your visibility to the product is much better- you know exactly what you’re getting!
