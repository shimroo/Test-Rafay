magic: book - not
 way back at the turn of the century, when magicians were even more secretive than today, there were underground books published to reveal the secrets to magic tricks people saw in public, even though this was not considered fair and gentlemanly, i am sure. (you do know that magic tricks are illusions and not real, don't you?)one of those books is on line here:  herrmann's book of magic: black art fully exposed: "alexander herrmann"  and is one long page of easy to scan reading. the modern editor regrets that they have to make apologies like "kids don't try this at home." for things like hiding needles in one's mouth and such.also, a while ago i downloaded a pdf of some of david blaine's tricks that you might be interested in checking out. includes the levitating act..

joybubbles, phone hacker extraordinaire, dies at 58
 w. david gardner of   informationweek  reports that a 58 year old man born in richmond va, who along the way changed his legal name to joybubbles, died this month..  born blind, and much misunderstood his whole life, joybubbleswas most known for his perfect musical pitch.  he stumbled upon the ability to whistle into telephones and dial any number free of charge.  read this story and see if you can decide if he was an innocent retarded man, a mischievous hacker, or hog poo smeller.

tree-ring circus
 "if you're the skeptical type, you might raise an eyebrow when you hear that a particular viking ship was built in the year 819. how could anyone determine the age of such an aged object so precisely, especially when there are absolutely no records to verify the date?well, tree-ring dating, or dendrochronology, can be this precise, and even more so. dendrochronologists showed that an ancient wooden road uncovered in southwestern england not only was built in 3806 b.c., but that the trees used for the road were chopped down in the winter of that year (the winter of 3807-3806). the science can also reveal the origin of old pieces of wood. in one case, archeologists determined not only the age of a viking ship found in denmark, they also learned that it was built in ireland."the above quote from a nova page, this subject turns out to be much more complicated and detailed than just measuring the width of the rings, which is all i thought there was to it. see nova's treatment of it, and build your own tree ring right here.

china: mr. woo's robots

rube goldberg
 you probably know i have liked rube goldberg runs for many years.  here is a video recapping the '07 competition at perdue university. really doesn't show the actual machines in action, but  you can get the flavor of the competition.this link shows the winner of a japanese competition, the goal is to humorously and in-efficiently prepare ramen noodles for dinner.   this, though in japanese is more fun, since it shows the machine in action, right down to breaking a raw egg into the bowl.

the junk drawer project
 i have a couple of junk drawers (and junk bookshelves) that this guy could photograph. the genesis of the junk drawers project was a sudden pang of nostalgia for that place in the corner of my childhood kitchen where the detritus of our lives ended up -- objects often of marginal consequence, but sometimes great importance, somehow too special to throw away, seldom animal or vegetable, and always, by necessity, smaller than a breadbox.

house of  cards
 i enjoyed looking at the card houses built by this guy who holds the guiness book record for card house building.bryan berg, the acknowledged inventor of cardstacking on the grand scale, embarked on a month-long project with walt disney world in orlando, fl to create a new guinness world record category with the world's largest house of cards. a self-taught artist, berg uses no tape, glue, or other tricks in his work. with 3,000 decks of freestanding playing cards, some scaffolding, and a view of the real building, he worked for a month on the disney grounds to build the company a 450 pound card version of cinderella's castle. the structure was 14 feet tall and 14 feet square, detailing all the turrets and tunnels of the actual castle. even the artist was surprised at how strong his huge construction turned out to be when a renegade squirrel ran in the room, destroying most of the supporting grand entry while the rest of the castle's cards stood unaffected. now, berg- 13 year running record winner for tallest house of freestanding playing cards at over 25 feet high- is a double title holder.

custom background music (free)
 at pandora's, a front end of the music genome project, you can type in a song or a musician, and it  creates for you your own albums of similar music (by mystical musical traits).  then it plays them on auto-pilot. i am not as sophisticated consumer of tunes as most, so i'm not the best to judge how well it works, but it seems great to me!  hey, you could use it as a free dj for a party, actually.i have a few "albums"; a "roger miller" theme, an "m ward", a "tommy dorsey".  for  instance on the last one, it plays a selection of old and new big band things, really relevant and well chosen.

world's tallest man saves dolphin?
 i found this news item oddly fascinating... world's tallest man saves dolphin. you would think they would have some sort of grabber or instrument, rather than rely on the long arm of xi shun, the tall guy, but since it's a chinese story,  i assume it is not just a publicity stunt.

 i don't expect you to watch this whole video, as i am timid to admit that i did, but it is, i guess, an advertising campaign for some japanese company.  they have built some really pleasant, but not too flashy rube goldberg style slides that all end in the company jingle.  one after the other, they are sort of haunting after a bunch of them, and they are quite clever, after all.incredible machine - #sonic forever - google video

pluto; dwarf planet  (ice ball)
 i had just thought of changing the mnemonic now that pluto has been demoted, and wroteit used to be "my very educated mother just served us nine pies". now it might be:"my very educated mother just showed us nothing" .then i ran across this boing-boing posting which topped it:boing boing: : "post-pluto mnemonics for the planets jason kottke and meg hourihan held a competition to come up with a better mnemonic for the planets' names in the wake of yesterday's decision to demote pluto from planet-status. the winner, josh mishell's   my! very educated morons just screwed up numerous planetariums   is great, as are the runners-up: many very earnest men just snubbed unfortunate ninth planet (dave child) 'my vision, erased. mercy! just some underachiever now.'       (delia, as spoken by pluto discoverer clyde tombaugh)  most vexing experience, mother just served us nothing! (bart baxter)"
