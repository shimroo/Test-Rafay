rover sig an armored tesla for protecting diplomats is hq foolishness.  they are expensive and unable to carry the significant extra weight of the armor.  won't work well in extreme heat or cold.  why would you send them for use at our embassies in countries that don't have charging stations?  to be maintained by embassy garages that don't know anything fixing them, with no access to local parts outlets?  with a huge battery that burns at 3000+ degrees when breached with an air leak (e.g., like when hit by a bullet or damaged by a grenade or ied). 
rover sig 60,000 miles is when things start to fail - components that need grease or oil, that have bearings, motors, switches that go on and off a lot, etc.  i don't know why i love cars so much.
dannyb i’d like to congratulate all of us for doing such a bang up job of sticking to the issues presented by the actual ttac article. (i guess when there’s an active coup, it’s hard to stay on topic.)
jeff just researched the acura adx and it is made in mexico.  if trump goes ahead with the 25% tariffs on vehicles imported from mexico these might not be as cheap.  if they were made in the us there might not be much of a cost savings if honda uses imported steel from canada with a 25% tariff.  currently there is a 2.5 percent tariff on japanese cars, 2 percent on buses, and 25 percent on trucks, while japan currently imposes no auto tariffs of its own.  if the tariff remains the same it would be more advantageous for the japanese manufacturers to manufacture in japan and export to the us and the same would be true for south korean manufacturers.  as a consumer i would rather buy a vehicle made in japan than mexico or even the us.  subaru and mazda export about 50 percent and 70 percent of their vehicles sold in the u.s. market from japan, respectively, compared with over 20 percent for toyota and less than 1 percent for honda.  unless trump raises the tariff on imported japanese vehicles more people will buy vehicles made in japan which would hurt domestic manufacturing plants that have plants in mexico and canada and definitely hurt any of these manufacturers that make in the usa that use a large amount of imported steel and aluminum especially from canada.  not currently in the market for a new vehicle but if i were it would give me more of a reason to buy a vehicle made in japan.
sce to aux "drive impressions are embargoed until next week"that's strange, since these are already in the wild.
