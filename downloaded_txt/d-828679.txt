joan wink, ph. d.
professor emerita
professor, csu stanislaus
college of education

the purpose of my personal web pages is to share resources with teachers and learners.
in addition, i share news of my family and our life on the prairies. my life informs my learning, and my learning informs my life. here is what i know today

prairies: the greater the diversity, the healthier the environment.
perspectives: the greater the diversity, the broader the thought.
people: the greater the diversity the better the democracy (wink, 2005, p. 3).

enjoy, and help yourself to anything; a reference is always appreciated.
thanks,
joan
