care and rehabilitation of the equine foot 
					textbook


what does it take to grow the very 
					best hooves an individual horse can possibly grow? is it 
					some magical trim, a supplement, or some newfangled shoeing 
					package? the answers are much farther-reaching and involve 
					every aspect of the horseâs life. can laminitis and caudal 
					foot pain be cured? prevented? can a carefully cultivated 
					hoof form and internal foot development protect the horse 
					from injury throughout the body??

new research from auburn university
clinical outcome of 14 obese, 
					laminitic horses managed with the same rehabilitation 
					protocol abstract


a specific method of rehabilitation was used to 
					manage obese horses with laminitis, and clinical outcome was 
					evaluated after 5 to 20 months. clinical data from 14 
					similar laminitis cases were statistically analyzed to 
					evaluate response to rehabilitation. 
see results:



p3 and p2 
					development
while equine researchers continue to 
					laugh at the idea that increased movement may play a part in 
					development of the foot, bovine researchers are stepping up 
					to the task. in this study, the size of p3 and p2 was 
					increased by allowing more movement on rocky terrain for 
					four months. 
see results:

digital cushion development

once again, researchers in the dairy 
					industry have stepped up to the challenge of studying foot 
					development. the control group of calves was kept in a small 
					enclosure, while the treated group was walked two miles 
					daily. 
see results:

congratulations 
					matrix, akiko, sossity, mario and easyboot gloves! they 
					swept the prix st. georges and are national champions.

auburn study: caudal foot 
					evaluation  
predictive modeling of the equine 
					heelrecently it has been proposed that healthy 
					soft tissue structures of the equine heel play a primary 
					role in equine soundness. historically, little attention has 
					been given to the significance of the health of the equine 
					heel soft tissue structures, which are uniquely positioned 
					so as to provide support and protection to the 
					navicular 
					apparatus.
