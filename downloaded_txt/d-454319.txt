welcome to the 352nd infantry division
as a member of the california historical group and ww2 research and preservation society, we focus on portraying the common infantryman of the german army. more than 300 german infantry divisions fought during the war, forming the backbone of the german army in every theater, and every campaign.
the 352nd was formed in november 1943 and staffed with a cadre of survivors from the russian front. 5th kompanie of the 916th grenadier regiment was manning positions behind omaha beach when the u.s. 1st and 29th infantry divisions struck on june 6, 1944.
authenticity, first person impression, field discipline, and kameradschaft are our prime concerns. we can be seen frequently on tales of the gun, mail call, shootout!, and other television programs. if you would like to join the 352nd and get into a great hobby please contact us.
