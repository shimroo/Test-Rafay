as lecturer, i found the platform and music courses very easy to navigate and user friendly...i also liked that the platform included everything and more in terms of material needed to prepare for instruction. from worksheets to scores, to animations and audio examples and so much more. when i needed tech assistance i always got a quick response and quick resolution.

i have used connect 4 education online music courses for several years now and have stuck with them because of how quickly they address student or instructor questions. their rock 3rd edition is also very good.

i have had the opportunity to teach music fundamentals 4th edition course this past summer semester via the omc platform and it was perfect for me as my class was both online and face to face. at first, i was hesitant to teach a music class on such a platform as so many factors came into play. this platform is user friendly and is what i would call a “one stop shop, everything rolled into one”.
