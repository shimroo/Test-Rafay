welcome to lawforcops.com

  



lawforcops.com is a website devoted to educating police officers in missouri and 
kansas* on legal issues which every officer  must know to effectively do their 
job and most importantly, avoid lawsuits. 


officers ask me
everyday - "will i get sued if i do that?"  unfortunately the
answer most often is yes!  you cant always avoid a lawsuit.  after all, anyone can file a lawsuit.  the 
important thing for you and your family is making sure you win!  make no 
mistake about it  in todays lawsuit-happy world, you will have an edge if you 
know the law and apply it correctly.

 

when 
completely up and running, this website will provide information about legal 
issues facing the police and keep you up-to-date on the newest decisions from 
federal and state courts that affect the police in missouri and kansas.

 

*the focus 
on the website will initially be on missouri law, but we hope to expand our 
resources to include decisions by courts in kansas and the 10th 
circuit court of appeals.
