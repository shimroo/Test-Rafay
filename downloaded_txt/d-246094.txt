spam filtering for your email
we have now implemented a sophisticated spam email filtering system on our email servers.  each subscriber's email is analyzed 
    according to thousands of filtering algorithms, and if the email reaches a certain 'score', it is marked as "spam" in the email subject line.
the marked email is downloaded by your email program as usual, but is instantly and transparently diverted to your trash folder, 
    or to a special folder that you can review periodically. for example, our server-based spam filters transform


this:
 
subject: online pharmacy - buy drugs online


 
 
subject: blooooock spaaaaam from your inbooooox


 
 
 


to this:
 
subject: spam (31.4): online pharmacy - buy drugs online


 
 
subject: spam (25.6): blooooock spaaaaam from your inbooooox
