the best value in electrical contracting 
ibew local 7
the right choice! today, electrical construction costs are at unprecedented levels. project owners are finding themselves increasingly subjected to under performing contractors with questionable business practices. however, shoddy workmanship, costly change orders, completion delays, and a lack of professionalism by contractor representatives can be avoided.
today, more customers are realizing the value of using ibew labor. local 7 ibew, along with our neca contractors, have a longstanding commitment to ensuring our members are the most highly trained and productive wireman in western massachusetts. this distinction means a commitment to getting the job done on time, the first time, within budget, and with zero tolerance for substandard work. it means a professional attitude on the jobsite.
ibew local 7’s “code of excellence” standards will make your electrical construction needs a worry free experience. feel free to contact our office for more information at (413) 734-7137.
