less stress, more calm for your dogdogs should never be a source of anxiety, chaos, or stress. from basic manners to loose-leash walking to impulse control, we help our clients learn the fundamental building blocks of being a consistent leader and we teach dogs both what to expect and what is expected of them. our end goal is to create a balanced relationship between you and your dog with joy and fulfillment in the middle.get started nowdaycare & enrichmentdog daycare done differently! our daily enrichment program’s mission is to send your dog home fulfilled and calm every day. dropping your dog off with us is opening a new world for them where they learn a new way of life—how to be calm and part of a pack. more than that, our facility has just the right setting to allow dogs to play, walk, run and sniff. be sure to read about our add-ons.
more about daycaredog boardingwe take the boredom out of dog boarding. at blaine kennels, your dog doesn’t have to be sitting in a cage all day—they can be exercised, mentally stimulated, and engaged. our structured environment provides calm, peaceful energy that dogs immediately feel, helping them settle into their temporary home away from home. never a dull moment. we have plenty of activities to serve up plenty of fun. be sure to read about our add-ons.
more about dog boardingevaluation & private lessonsan evaluation is an essential part of getting to know you and your dog to help you meet your goals and learn what makes your dog unique. during your dog’s evaluation we develop a custom plan that will meet your specific needs. that information is then integrated into private lessons so to help you have the dynamic that you’ve always wanted with your pet.
more about private lessonsboard & trainno level of training is too big or too small for—we welcome dogs who have been deemed too difficult. our four to six week intensive doggy boot camp where your pet stays with us and is worked several times each day by different members of our training staff. the first step is an evaluation where we’ll get to know you and your dog and understand your goals and specifics of how we can help.
we’re happy to offer financing to make this an option for as many people as possible.

bettering the relationship between people and their pets.
whether you want your dog to have some fun while you’re at work all day, to feel at-ease while traveling without your pet, to get help with private training or to solve some harder behavioral challenges, we apply the same core principles and approach of dog psychology to each dog in our care. for dogs who are with us for training, we utilize a range of training techniques and tools—everything from treadmills to slip leads to e-collars—and we encourage pet owners to ask questions and get to know more about the benefits gained from all of the tools we use. as always, we’re happy to answer any questions you might have.
