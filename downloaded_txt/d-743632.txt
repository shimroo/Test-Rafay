 swsc guides and inspires student athletes to achieve their collective and individual potential through soccer. 







        our emphasis is on developing exceptional soccer players    



swsc is a youth competitive, select, and premier-level club that builds technical and tactical soccer skills in our 300+ boys and girls aged 5-18. we're a dynamic club of teams that compete in cdysl and edp fall, winter, and spring competition, and in local and regional tournaments.
each year, a number of swsc players try out for and are selected to participate in enyysa’s olympic development program.
in addition, a number of top swsc teams participate in cdysl empire cup kickoff classic, a high-level tournament run by cdysl.
swsc players compete on school teams in saratoga springs, ballston spa, mechanicville, luzerne, queensbury, and south glens falls.
our highly-competitive players go on to play at the next level in college soccer.
swsc - a 501(c)(3) - is headed by a board of directors comprised of parent volunteers who guide the direction of the club. your expertise and ideas are welcome.
