welcome to the ragen family website!
this website is a home-grown family website, designed and built on our 
free time. some of the pages on this website may be of interest to a broad community. other 
pages will likely be of interest to just members of our extended families. i 
post highlights every couple of months in our
bi-monthly newsletter -- new 
material on the site as well as other items of interest.





family history. 
	this section, which is what the website was launched around, includes pages on the 
  history of the ragen and
  munk families. among many other topics, this section includes the complete memoirs, my century 
 and my many lives, of my grandfather, frank munk.


in addition to 
three different trail diaries by our family of 
their trip to oregon via the oregon trail, we have recently been adding the full text of 

fifty years in oregon, a book by t.t. geer, a former governor of oregon, on the early history of oregon with 
	a focus on politics.
 





wildlife and nature photos: 
	we showcase pictures from the san juan islands and the pacific northwest. 
	our wildlife photos feature bald eagles, 
	killer 
  whales, red foxes, 
	black-tailed deer, and more. 
  we've also added an
  online 
  storefront  
    to purchase the best of our photos; a few of our photos have been converted 
	into
pen and ink drawings.






using 
	a new camera (canon 10d) with higher resolution and a stronger zoom 
	capability, we have steadily added more high-definition pictures to our 
	wildlife and nature photo albums. the most recent picture that we've posted 
	is a series of eighteen photographs from 
yellowstone 
	and grand tetons 
	national parks. the thumbnail at 
right shows a small eruption from steamboat geyser but we also have photographs 
	of buffalo, bighorn sheep, and other scenes from the parks.

some of our best pictures include:




"misty 
	mountain air" was named a photo of the day by the digital photo contest website 
	in december of 2004.



wildlife photography albums from san 
	juan island including american bald eagles, 
	killer 
  whale photos, red foxes, 
	black-tailed deer, and 
	images of other native wildlife.

	and the grand tetons



at the end of 2005, we added the end of 
year photography buying guides from 
pcphoto, 
popular imaging, and 
pc magazine as well as book of the month/year lists from 
outdoor photographer, 
outdoor photography 
and shutterbug 
magazines.  




recommended book lists 
  are
  largely based on our current book reading lists as well as other life-long interests such as 
  wine 
  tasting, mountain climbing and 
  outdoor adventures,
  science fiction, and more.
