continued problems with movie marketing madness





to my loyal mmm readers,
i apologize for the problems that have plagued mmm the last few weeks. it seems my host is continually being hit by a security breach that is infecting my site and others with malware, which means you can't read it and i can't publish it. i've switched the feed over to my blogger backup site to get this out to you and ask for your continued patience as things getting cleaned up and sorted out. believe me this is just as frustrating for me as it is for you and as soon as the dust clears i'll be looking to switch hosting companies since this is just unacceptable on many levels.

thanks for sticking around. i'll be back to regular publishing as soon as possible.

more or less gone





i decided, just because it felt like something i needed to do as part of a larger organization project, to delete just about everything on this blogger-hosted version of movie marketing madness. i didn't like having duplicate content out there and finally got around to just taking all this content down. now the only place to find stuff is at moviemarketingmadness.com, the home of mmm since august of 2006. i'm not deleting the blog entirely since i want to retain the url but all the posts have now been scrapped. sorry if this is upsetting to anyone. i love blogger and it served me well, but it's not like this was some sort of nostalgic shrine or anything. it was just duplicate, older content and i needed to clean it up a bit.
