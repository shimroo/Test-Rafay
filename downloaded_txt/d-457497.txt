december 31, 2014








after more than (3) decades of manufacturing concession trailers and vending carts, supreme products in august of 2014 permanently discontinued production of these product lines. 


the former employees of supreme products certainly appreciate the support our loyal customers gave us over all the years. these customers were the backbone of our company, and encouraged us by recognizing our unique design, quality construction and superior customer service, and by being willing to pay more for a supreme than for most other concession trailers.


moreover, we are proud that we built a product capable of being used in demanding commercial service and lasting over decades of time. while there will be no more 'new' supreme units manufactured, we are confident that the 'all steel - real deal' trailers built at our plant in waco, texas will be in use for years to come.


for that, we are grateful.


finally, demco trailers, inc., which operated for many years under the corporate assumed name 'supreme products inc.', was legally terminated as a business entity with the secretary of state of the state of texas as of december 31, 2014. all business operations ceased, and there is no business successor.


this page is neither maintained by demco trailers, inc., supreme products inc., nor by any successor to their interests. it is for legacy informational purposes only.
