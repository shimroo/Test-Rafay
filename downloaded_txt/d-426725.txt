broken back



jan 10, 2025




at age 76, i fell and broke my back in 2 places, plus a shoulder rotator cuff. the only help from several doctors was medication or surgery. neither appealed to me. i saw marjolein on tv and ordered the aeropilates machine, about one year ago. i try to perform the strong and lean program 3-5 times a week. i love it. it’s easy on my body. i’ve lost 18 pounds because of body awareness and feel good. i’ll celebrate my 78th birthday soon. excellent product.ps. people can’t believe how young i look.- cheryl h.

pelvic pain relief



feb 15, 2018




to say that the aeropilates reformer has changed my life is an understatement. it has given me the ability to be able to exercise everyday. it's allowed me to get into the shape i longed to be in, along with the changes i made to my diet. but more than this it’s given me a sense of my old self back.

one legged success



jun 26, 2017




as a recent leg amputee, i was searching for an exercise regimen to regain my strength and stamina while waiting for my prosthesis. having decided on the aero pilates machine, i'm beginning to feel the rewards after just one week.  i don't have to worry about losing my balance, or otherwise hurting myself. i love that a head-to-toe work out can be done with minimal positional change!- walter

zest for life!



jun 26, 2017




i have to thank you so much for this machine and the dvd’s - you have, quite literally, changed my life. i am 50 years old, disabled and largely housebound; making it impossible to exercise easily. when i first started i weighed 244 lbs and had a 47” waist! now, four months later, i weigh 178 lbs and have a 32” waist. i feel better than i have for twenty years or more and the improvements in my core strength are helping me to deal with the day to day issues of living with my disability. i find i have more energy and have even regained some of my zest for life!thanks!david

a big hug



jun 26, 2017




five years ago, i was hit by a high speeding motorbike and got very badly hurt. the accident resulted in loads of soft issue and broken bones all over my body, from head to toe i am in constant, extreme pain. when you are in this state, you are so scared to do any physiotherapy or anything that might cause you more pain and suffering.however! when i showed the exercise chart to my team of physiotherapist’s, they salivated over it. after incorporating pilates exercises in to my regime i saw my physio and he nearly fell off his chair.you can just zen out and focus on the exercises. it is, the most relaxing thing on the planet, and yet, you are giving your whole body a full workout. it is simply extraordinary. honestly, the best physical investment anybody who needs physio will ever make.- peter

inspired, energized and relaxed



jun 26, 2017




i purchased marjolein's manifestation cards and the heart locket with essential oil. the inspirational cards are a joy to read daily. i pick one out and read it throughout the day and it is a constant reminder of where i want to be in my life. the oil is, in my opinion, one of the best blended oils i have ever used. it smells incredible. it is so relaxing and soothing to smell.anyone looking to be inspired, energized, or relaxed will not be disappointed.  thank-you marjolein for this.  i can feel all the love you put into this wonderful gift.- cindy

pilates gave me great legs



jun 26, 2017




i am 77 years of age and had a hip replacement one year ago. after the surgery, i purchased the aeropilates reformer because the doctor said it would be o.k. to try out. i started in with the leg exercises in order to strengthen the muscles in my legs. at this point i have legs most 30 year old women would envy and their strength is amazing. before i started with pilates i had to take medication several times a day for arthritis. now i take absolutely no medication whatsoever. i have no pain at all and can walk with no difficulty. my hip replacement is working perfectly, principally because i have worked so hard on my legs.thank you!!!carmen

moving through back pain and staying fit and healthy



jun 26, 2017




i just recently bought the aeropilates reformer and i love it, i also love your story and way of life. i have always been fit and healthy, including exercise in my daily life. unfortunately, i have recently discovered that i have scoliosis, which was causing me severe back pain when exercising. i have had to give up zumba and aerobics as the high impact was causing me to much pain. i am over the moon to have discovered pilates and your website. it's early days yet but i am confident that pilates will take me well into the future and keep me fit and healthy.. thank you for sharing your knowledge with the world. i look forward to starting..regardslexie

just wanted to say thanks 



jun 26, 2017




i have had my performer for about 4 years now and i just want to say that it has changed my life completely.  i bought it originally as i liked the idea of exercising lying down and because you said that it can help to combat arthritis which runs in my family. my progress has been transformational. i am a thinner, stronger, calmer person for using this machine and as a result i'm a lot happier. i also have much more energy!!!!!thanks very much for bringing the pilates equipment to the uk and please visit us again soon.love,ruth
