forex currency trading market



the forex market which we are seeing today, has actually originated during early 1970s when the new floating currency shaped up in the economy. since then, there is a constant growth in the market along with the technological advancements such as computers and telephone dealings, which made trading process much easier. in addition, this facilitated more number of people to enter and take part in trading.

to define forex trading in simple words, it is the process where currencies of other or different nations are traded against each other. foreign exchange or simply forex trading normally takes place by way of brokers or market makers. it is almost the same as other markets where trading of goods takes place but through currencies with an objective to gain profits. certain dissimilarities exist between goods and forex market like in goods market, one has to first buy and sell the currencies whereas in forex market, currencies itself are considered as goods. 

forex is conducted worldwide thus allowing people from all across the world to take part in trading and make profit. forex trading is regarded as the biggest market among all others globally since the forex investors are over and above other markets. this trading is carried on the first five days of a week and it goes on continuously without leaving even a second. this indicates that one can trade in the forex market 24x7 on those five days. a majority of the investors in the forex market are none other than the international and multinational corporations, well known banks, popular and huge institutions and others. it is not a sole market but includes a large network of companies, financial institutions and other brokers. since, it has no particular or central location connected with it, a major portion of trade happens in certain important trading centres.

most of the big players in the economy, utilize the currency markets in order to carry out business dealings and investments. like the other markets, the forex market is also available and can be used by the small investors. some new forex trading regulations have been introduced that facilitated one to make dealings in forex market. these trading regulations are of great significance since they administer the accessible sizes of transaction dealings and any modifications to the regulations of finance based.

it is also possible to participate in forex trading online, which is based on the concept of free floating currencies. the currencies that hold no support of materials such as gold or silver or any other are called as free floating currencies. depending upon the currency value, the profit and loss in the forex market are determined.

in the previous days, the forex trading used to take place by way of telephone, but from past few years, this trading is performed online. the traders, who are totally new to the forex market, are not required to take suggestions of experts since most of the companies provide demo account that lets one know the process of trading. in addition, online customer support is also provided that enables the traders to contact the companies in case any problem arises as regards the forex trading.

fapturbo forex trading software robot review


i've been online forex trading on the various currency exchanges for almost a year and have barely broken even (probably down a little really)! my biggest problem has been finding the time to do enough forex signals research to know when to buy and sell a currency and so have been making financial decisions based on not enough research! when i'm able to do full research i tend to do well, but just don't have the time to do this daily (i have a full time job as well).early last month (march 2009) i purchased the forex trading robot software fapturbo : http://morearning.fapturbo.hop.clickbank.net/ after reading several positive reviews online and have been running real time online forex currency trading tests as though i was trading with real money (so not made a trade based on this program yet with real money).i started with a $1,000 pot since that's my maximum amount to invest at any one time in the forex markets. since this was testing i haven't put as much time into it as i would if this was real money, but still enough time to make the results more than worthwhile.i've traded $500 a forex trade and so no more than 2 trades at a time ($1,000). i've only traded when the automated signals are strong and here's the results.over 37 trades 22 trades were in reasonable profit (20%+), 7 trades no overall loss/profit (less than 20% profit/loss) and 8 trades in reasonable loss (20%+).i didn't get a loss for 11 trades so was well in profit all the way through so always was able to invest $500 per trade. if i'd have made losses early on i'd have reduced the size of trades. my worst forex loss was just under 50%, wouldn't have liked that one as my first trade!from my initial $1,000 starting point in this forex trading software test i would have ended with over $14,000 ($13,000 profit!) which is really impressive for just over a months trading with just $1,000 starting point.to achieve this took very little time, about 30 minutes a day.i started trading with the forex signals from the software with real money yesterday ($1,000 over 2 trades) and made a small loss overall ($955 left, which is typical!!), looking much better today on my third trade and already in profit by over $150 overall.the fapturbo forex trading robot software costs $149 with a 60 day money back guarantee. they sell through a company called clickbank which will give you your money back with no questions asked, so it's not one of those guarantees that are worthless.if like me you don't have the time to do forex signals research every day you want to trade (i want to trade daily) take a good look at the fapturbo software http://morearning.fapturbo.hop.clickbank.net/.james
