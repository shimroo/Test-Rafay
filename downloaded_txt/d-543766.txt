naples free-net 

 
an era has come to an end. the naples free-net, a 501c3 all volunteer organization,
that was founded in july 1995, has come to an end. when the naples free-net started no
one knew what www or the internet was, and one had to ask, “do you have an email address?”
the naples free-net at one time provided an internet connection and an email address to over
3,000 members. in fact, the naples free-net even provided a computer and internet connection
for the city of naples in the early internet years. the naples free-net, the last free-net,
of which there were many in the country, has shut down on june 30, 2023.
the naples free-net board of directors (bod) voted to close the nfn
doors as of june 30, 2023. we thank one and all for your generous
donations in the past.
nfn was established in 1995 and was one of the
last remaining free-nets in the nation.
as an all volunteer 501c(3), nfn provided to the local community
free and low cost internet access,
email, web hosting, and education for 28 years.
nfn membership renewals were not
processed as of 25 january 2023.
all membership accounts expiration date
were adjusted to the closing date of june 30, 2023.
all nfn hosted websites and most “@naples.net” email
addresses cease to be available after june 30, 2023
via a google workspace domain transfer some hosting
services for the “naples.net” domain
may be available to former
nfn subscribers contacting
nfn administration here
for additional information.
if connecting to your new “@naples.net” email with a client program such as
thunderbird or outlook
you will probably have to set your account as described at:
