  learning in language: advance your global career



            transcript

            




the middlebury institute differs from a lot of other institutions in that we’re required to study language here. but also we’re expected to put that language into practice. at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies, i work as a graduate research assistant. and in that role, a lot of my research that i do is conducted in chinese.
in the field, being able to access documents and media reports in a foreign language, firsthand, directly from sources, is something that’s really important.
we’re learning the language, not just to learn the language, but how to use it in conversations of what we would use in our professional careers.
i haven’t taken a spanish course since high school. it was intimidating at first, but i was able to catch up. remember what i needed, just like conversational phrases, and eased right back into it with the grammar and the vocabulary.
there are a lot of great things about being in monterey and being at the middlebury institute. while i’m in school, i’m able to build a portfolio of work using the target language to show to future employers, or if i wanna go to get a phd. these are real world skills that i’ve put into practice.
learning language is one step that students who wanna be leaders in this field in the future should take if they have the opportunity. and i definitely felt that going to the middlebury institute was my opportunity.
there are just so many benefits and advantages with having a second language, especially in this globalized world. things are changing, the world is changing. so the middlebury institute is taking us on to new approaches, to new methodologies and tools that we can use.
