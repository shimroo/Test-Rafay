to mohawk valley girl (and anyone else who is still around

as of today.

jim and melissa's two young boys are both in school.his grown kids are all here in merced and seem to be doing fine.  tim and juan were on top of mt palomar the last i heard but are probably back on ground level in anaheim by now.

elcie and rochelle are back with me.  rebecca is in junior college.  the older girls are working on decisions - in this economic climate, not simple.

ray (25 years married) has been in and out of hospital far too many times.  now he's in a medical rehab relearning walking and talking.  he's lost over 20 pounds, his speech is almost clear (but he fades quickly) and he is back walking with his walker.  the last time he was in hospital, he fell when we brought him home and the ambulance came and took him back and them in a few days to rehab which seems to be the answer.

i'm hanging in.  this morning elcie and i went with the friend who drives us and his son to see ray and then for our usual barnes & noble visit and a brief stop for milk, etc. at the store.  now they've watching season 3 of once upon a time" (again) and i'm keeping up with the giants on the net.

that's my exciting life so far.  100 degrees here in merced.  the rest of the blog is still intact and the history of my somewhat scattered life on the sidebar.

rebecca and rochelle have signed up at merced college.  how is it possible?  elcie is spending some time with me while she transitions to independent living.

i know most of you are on fb now and we've caught back up with each other but the other day i was reminiscing back through the bloc roll and wondering about some of my old friends.  i like fb but i miss the blog(s).

ray is doing okay - we putter along.  son jim moved his family to the seattle area (his adult kids are still here but he has the two little boys as well).  the army is still trying to figure out what can be done about his injuries.  meanwhile he waits. 

tim and juan are doing great in anaheim.  today was a banner day for them.  the state supreme court confirmed one more time that prop 8 is history.  they were married right before it went into effect but still it's reassuring that it no longer exists being unconstitutional and all that.

took elcie to church on sunday.  it's harder now that i'm not driving and i miss my friends.  we've become what is called a reconciling congregation (open to all)  eventually my united methodists will join the other progressives on the one remaining issue (which is ignored by many of us).

we have tomatoes again this year and we have the hottest summer i remember.  it goes hand in hand with the worst baseball season i remember.  how do we go from world series champs to chumps in the short space of one year?  oh well.  hey, they just scored two runs in the 8th.  now it's only 6-4 and they have a guy on second with one out. i should start paying attention.

much love to any of you who happen to stumble across this.
