a detailed guide to judging the boxer


this site was built with the intention of establishing a blueprint for aworldwide boxer a boxer that could compete successfully in any country around the world!




 



          let me introduce myself. my name is judy horton and i am an all breeds judge from melbourne, australia. 
	      i have been involved with this wonderful breed for over fifty years.  breeding under the intrends prefix, i have bred numerous champions, many being specialty and multi group winners. nine of my boxers have won best in show at "all breeds" shows. 
		 no longer breeding due to my judging commitments, i continue
		my efforts to improve the breed by travelling the world giving lectures, and encouraging other breeders to interpret the standard correctly. judging boxers around the world gives me the opportunity to see boxers from many countries and i hope my experiences are reflected on the following pages.
      



i'm glad you dropped by for a visit!




         the information contained in this site is based on an article i wrote a few years ago for the judges training scheme in australia.   if studied carefully it can be a valuable tool for anyone,   anywhere in the world, wishing to purchase a boxer, choosing a stud or even
		when evaluating their own dogs. on the following pages you will find  many photographs of excellent examples of boxers from australia, new zealand, europe, usa, canada, uk, south america, asia and south africa!
