preserving kutztown's cultural heritage



the kutztown area historical society (kahs) was established in 1974-75 in response to the american bicentennial and the need for a dedicated local history resource beyond the historical society of berks county. it was one of the first regional historical societies in berks county and served the northeastern districts of kutztown, brandywine heights, and fleetwood. the society was incorporated in 1976, and on february 27, 1979, kahs acquired the 1892 public school building from the kutztown area school district, which currently serves as the organization's headquarters.

































the society’s objectives


























collecting and preserving material culture artifacts that are representative of the area, including tools, textiles, photographs, folk art, advertising, and more. 















creating and maintaining a non-circulating library and archive of books, periodicals, manuscripts, and other materials that reflect the history, culture, and genealogy of the kutztown area.















restoring and preserving the historic 1892 public school building, which serves as a permanent repository for donated and loaned objects of historical interest.















encouraging the preservation of historically significant sites, structures, and material culture artifacts throughout the area.















extending its services and collections to local educational institutions and civic organizations through an outreach docent program to promote awareness of local historical issues.















promoting historical inquiry on all levels, from grass-roots curiosity to academic research, thus fostering widespread appreciation of a distinct, vital regional culture.
