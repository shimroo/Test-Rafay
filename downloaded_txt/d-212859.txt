minnesota bound
sharing stories of the great outdoors
ron schara, and his trusted
 black 
lab, raven, began sharing stories of the outdoor lifestyle back in 
1995.  
minnesota bound is the show that started it all for ron schara and he 
quickly found a passion for putting his words onto the television 
screen. today, it remains a trademark
 program and is now running over 600 episodes strong.  we seek characters that have a story to 
tell.  we seek out destinations and find out what makes them special.  
we share the love of outdoors and those that enjoy it.  yes, it's 
fishing 
and hunting, but it's also camping, hiking, canoeing, archery, bird 
watching, ice climbing and so much more.  minnesota bound is a fan 
favorite winning several hundred owaa awards during its lifespan, 
including 11 emmy awards.
