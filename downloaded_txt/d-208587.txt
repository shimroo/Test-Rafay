campaign for future generations
phase ii: planetarium & astronomy center underway



on the morning of may 23, 2023, the stamford museum & nature center officially broke ground on the phase ii planetarium & astronomy center. the 11,000-square-foot facility will reinvigorate a core pillar of the sm&nc’s mission and bring our organization’s planetarium and observatory programs under the same roof for the first time in our 90-year history. astronomy programming has long been a mission signature ever since our first astronomy classes were held in 1941. they continue to this day, and will abound in the years to come.
