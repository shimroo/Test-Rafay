	 n.o.’s fountain of youth ...
	 



from citybusiness, by deon roberts. disclosure: the last paragraph contains a quote by my wife, and she is now retired from the university of new orleans; we are living in cincinnati:new orleans became a magnet to young people from across of america after hurricane katrina. young adults flocked here eager to rebuild the city, and some have settled and found permanent work.but how does new orleans retain these young professionals over the long term? according to an august 2007 study by the kaiser family foundation, 18 percent of young adults (those ages 18-34) said they are planning on, or seriously considering, moving from the greater new orleans area, a statistic kaiser called “a finding of potential concern.” among adults 35 and older, only 8 percent said they were planning on, or seriously considering, moving out the area.some are trying to prevent young, talented adults from leaving new orleans. the idea village has launched a project it calls “504ward” to link young people with jobs and networking opportunities.“what drives economic growth is talent,” tim williamson, idea village president, said in a citybusiness story this week. “by engaging the business community to provide the connections or relationships, the ultimate beneficiaries will be the companies.”according to the citybusiness story, some young people have trouble making connections in new orleans.“new orleans is a provincial place. it can be inscrutable to someone who’s just moved here,” said jeffery schwartz, a 26-year-old ben franklin high school graduate who has an urban planning degree from the university of wisconsin and a master’s degree from the massachusetts institute of technology.being new to the new orleans area also plays a large role in young people’s decision to move from new orleans, the kaiser study said.“a young resident who is new to the area has a predicted probability of planning to move that is four times that of an older resident who lived in new orleans before katrina,” kaiser said.an aug. 21 article on philanthropy.com reports on the influx of young people to new orleans since katrina.“despite efforts to keep young nonprofit workers in the city, some people who moved to new orleans after katrina are starting to think about leaving — or have already gone,” the article said.since katrina, the media seem confused about whether new orleans is attracting or losing young people. for example, the philanthropy.com story highlights the influx of young people. but the associated press reported this in a grim story dec. 15, 2006:"new orleans is losing an alarming number of young professionals in katrina’s aftermath. many doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers and other highly educated people are gone. some left during the storm and never came back. others came back, but soon gave up and moved out altogether."whether a full-blown brain drain is under way is unclear. but some suspect so, and fear the exodus will only get worse.“they don’t see the career opportunities here that they see elsewhere,” said university of new orleans political science professor susan howell.

	 coming back, part 2
	 
    


continuing from a previous article:last year, tourism was at 70 percent of the pre-katrina level that generated $5 billion a year. but the city began this year with four major events -- college football's sugar bowl and national championship game, mardi gras, and the nba all-star game weekend -- plus major conventions. the momentum continued with the french quarter and jazz festivals, and more than 16 festivals are scheduled through the end of the year, including tales of the cocktail mixing it up this week and the new prospect 1 -- "the largest biennial of international contemporary art ever organized in the united states," planners say -- scheduled to start nov. 1.there's also a new attraction, the audubon insectarium, which opened last month on canal street, near the audubon aquarium of the americas, an imax theater, and the audubon zoo.still, some would-be tourists are staying away out of a sense of respect for everything the city's been through, says sandra shilstone, head of the new orleans tourism marketing corp. those people should remember the city's unofficial motto, the jazz festival's quint davis says: "we dance when we die."this year's official slogan is "come out and play," and that's what people were doing the weekend i was there. bourbon street was a little sleepy on thursday and friday afternoons, but it sprang to life on friday and saturday nights. a continuous stream of visitors of all ages strolled along the pedestrian-only street, many toting plastic "go cups," since open containers of alcohol are permitted.high school students in gowns and tuxedos dined at some of the fancier restaurants, bachelor and bachelorette parties club-hopped, and families rode horse-drawn carriages through the quarter and along jackson square.since the disaster, there have been some surprises in the city's regrowth, shilstone says."there's been a cultural renaissance. neighborhoods putting on arts festivals and cultural events," she says. "people lost art and are buying again."as she shows us the sections of the city hit hardest by the flooding -- west end, lakeview, gentilly, new orleans east, st. bernard, and the ninth ward -- stauder stresses that she doesn't care why people come, just that they come.

	 thoughts on another visit to new orleans …
	 
    


from our cincinnati base we visit new orleans 5 or 6 times a year, generally staying a week or so. our latest visit was an unscheduled one, when my mother had a heart attack. she is just fine as of this writing. one big difference on our latest visit is that we spent much of our time with mom, and were not looking at real estate. the previous three visits were totally dominated by looking at houses that we might live in, or lots on which we might build when we move back to new orleans. one visit was dedicated to looking at lots where we might build a version of a model home that we particularly liked.we are still talking to the builder of the model home, donny natal. he has a couple of lots available in lakeview, our current choice of neighborhood. we have previously also looked at houses in uptown new orleans, and in metairie. somehow we have never gotten sufficiently enthused to purchase any property. our real estate agent, eileen wallen, has been absolutely wonderful. she did so much homework, knew our preferences, scheduled appointments, and accompanied us on just about every viewing. use her if you need a realtor; call her at (504) 250-5656. this may assuage some of our guilt about working her so hard when we apparently could not make a move.perhaps the lack of enthusiasm is toward whether we really want to return to new orleans. we have some wonderful lifetime friends there, but our life in cincinnati is very good. we are making some good friends, and are pleasantly busy.one of our new orleans friends keeps asking us to assess a probability, in percent, that we might move back to the area. when our real estate search started, we were quoting 80%. now we are hopelessly stuck on 50%. we have a lot of soul-searching to do.

	 new orleans is worth rebuilding ...
	 
    


last sunday's blog on whether new orleans is worth rebuilding aroused a lot of comment. here is a stronger case for rebuilding offered by our good friends, janice and steve shull:beyond the intangible sense of place of new orleans is the historical fact of an old city, born of the french, nurtured by the spanish, and playing a major role in american history. its culture and vitality have been studied, romanticized, and mimicked, but never reproduced. strands of many other places, other languages, other stories are woven into new orleans' singular fabric.but there has always been an ugly underbelly to life in n.o. and katrina exposed it all. unfortunately, opportunities for a true revitalization of an impoverished city have been missed or cynically dismissed. still, new orleans survives and its resilience must inspire hope to anyone who suffers a disaster. just as the world trade center site has become a sacred place, new orleans' symbolic meaning is powerful.the historic heart of town is on high ground, but other parts of the city are so damaged that they should not be rebuilt. only a small fraction of properties have been rehabilitated in the lower 9th ward, and the west end of lakeview and new orleans east remain terribly vulnerable to another katrina-type storm.new orleans will never be the power-house city that it aspired to be in the 1970s-1980s. with astronomical insurance rates, exorbitant building costs, rents that are 50% higher than in 2005, and a job market offering primarily low-paying wages, there isn't much to attract people to live and work there. perhaps the answer lies in accepting new orleans' destiny as a tourist mecca on the order of savannah or key west. it doesn't have to be a disneyworld or williamsburg!mark abkowitz, a professor of civil engineering at vanderbilt university, has stated that only a long-term, systematic and strategic approach to hurricane protection will reduce the risk in the gulf coast. the patchwork, reactionary response to each and every hurricane is doomed to failure at some point.hurricane-strength building codes must be strictly enforced, and this scattershot rebuilding throughout greater new orleans should be stopped. but you know well that the political implications often outweigh common sense. remember, too, that it was not hurricane katrina that devastated new orleans, but rather a failure of government on all levels to provide the levee protection that had been promised and guaranteed at level 3 and then to coordinate a disaster plan effectively to ensure public safety after the storm. the hard lessons of katrina are paying off in better emergency management all over the u.s., whether from floods, tornadoes, earthquakes or what have you. the cost, while heavy (much less than iraq, however!), does benefit taxpayers. one academic source computed the cost at $98 a year in additional taxes per person to achieve the stronger hurricane protection needed. this opinion piece in the l.a. times argues that it is the right thing to do: http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-barry23apr23,0,5522292.storywe have visited the city many times since katrina and it continues to be a hard place to live. you just can't imagine what people have gone through in the last three years to keep the city alive. hard, hard work and great personal sacrifice are the words that describe life in new orleans. janice shull retired as a law librarian from the supreme court of louisiana, and now works as a volunteer at the venice archives and area historical collection. steve shull is an emeritus professor of political science with the university of new orleans. his specialty is the presidency, and he has written several books on the subject. the shulls miss new orleans but have learned to appreciate small-town life in venice fl.

	 clarifications by dr. cigler (monday edition)
	 
    


beverly cigler, a public policy professor at penn state university, took issue with our editing of sundays blog. she referred to her quote "my own personal opinion is that you shouldn't rebuild in areas unless you can make them safe," she said. "and nobody's had the willingness to confront these kinds of issues."her clarification: ""areas" refers to the most low lying, unsafe areas and i suggested making them safe before rebuilding. much of what i told the interviewer (lara jakes jordan) about "these kinds of issues" was omitted. specifically, i discussed trade-offs among and between economic development, private property rights, and wise environmental and land use policies (vs. solely structural solutions such as levees.)"professor cigler clarified another point from her interview with lara:"lara--i...some people think i said things i didn't say or infer, such as new orleans across the board should not be rebuilt. that's likely because of the title of the article and the way that interviewee comments were ordered. "readers aren't aware of my explanation of the pro's and con's of structural (levees) vs. non-structural (land use, etc.) options, concluding that the levees will be be fully strengthened across 350 miles of levees for the next 3 years. they miss the fact that parts of the city are at different elevations and that the tough decisions regarding areas of lowest elevation have not been well addressed. my comments on wetlands, building codes, and other land use measures were to say that structural options aren't the only concern; instead, a mix is needed in rebuilding and rebuilding in particular areas should not be done unless the areas are safe. "people are interpreting my comments to say simply that nola should not be rebuilt because it is a soup bowl. it is a soup bowl, but i made all kinds of comments regarding how to make it safe. my comments to you were focused on explaining the difficult trade-offs among and between economics, property rights, wise planning, and other choices for the areas of lowest elevation.my sending the material to you on congressional appropriations vs. how much has been spent was to further the argument that there's a long way to go to say that nola is safe. "i never said or implied that nola wasn't worth rebuilding. if anything, i've argued for a faster and more competent pace of rebuilding. i remember mentioning that 75 million people live in coastal areas in the u.s. i wouldn't suggest that they be moved or not allowed to live there, akin to arguing that nola shouldn't be rebuilt....i think it's time for a report on the tough decisions that need to be made along our coasts, along california's canyons, etc.”
