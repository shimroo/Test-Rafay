hey, i’m jared.
from creating a highly-rated chrome extension used daily by thousands of people, to a 750+ member potluck dinner community with a cult-like following, to long-form interviews with some of the world’s most successful people — i’ve worked on some interesting things.in everything that i do, i follow my instincts/curiosity to initiate new things, with the aim of making a meaningful impact.i really shine when i can be forward-facing: pitching, facilitating, networking, and/or being the face of something.i love curating ideas and connecting people in entirely new ways, and i seek out collaboration whenever possible.i deeply value working on things that move the needle and really matter.
