“i have used mekco sheds/buildings in the past and will continue to do so. quality product at a good price. service and customer support are strong. i would recommend them to others who are looking for this type of product.”

— honeywell




“as a busy business professional, free time is limited and, therefore, incredibly important to me. i not only love the functionality of my mekco outbuilding, but more so, the fact that it is maintenance-free. the building is beautifully designed and engineered, and installation took less than four hours. thank you, mekco!  i’ll be back again.”

— wisconsin land owner




“i appreciated the promptness [of the quoting and design process] and the way mekco responded when our customer needed a very quick delivery on very short notice. the attention we received from start to finish was very professional and very much appreciated.”

— gasvoda & associates inc




“the installation on digester 1 worked out great. there is room for the crews to get in and still do their work. thank you again. i look forward to receiving the next one.”

— madison metro sewerage district




“i stumbled onto mekco when asked by a client to price their product.  i knew nothing about mekco when i made the first call, everyone i dealt with was always very willing to help but better yet listen.  our buildings were produced on time, they actually held one for months due to jobsite conditions, they arrived promptly and i even got follow up communication to ensure that the buildings installed like they were supposed to.  nothing better!  quality, communication, care for their customers, it’s all top notch.  don’t hesitate, i can’t wait to do business with you again, thank you!!!!!”
