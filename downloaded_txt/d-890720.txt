van wyck presbyterian church is a small congregation welcoming all from every strand of the christian faith.
the church gathers in worship to glorify god who is present and active among us. we gather to grow our roots of faith through christian education opportunities for children, youth, and adults. we put our faith into action through local and global outreach ad mission activities. we share the gifts of our time, talents, and treasures to join god in building the kingdom.
disciples of our church strive to be active in the church and community and take pride in caring for the quaint, yet elegant church.
the 125-seat church was built in the rural community by a congregation of 27 people in 1911. at that time, the brick church with the bell tower stood alone on a dirt road with no electricity.
