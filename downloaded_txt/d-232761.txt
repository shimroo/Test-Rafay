powered by nature

watch our video and learn how our air curtain burners are good for the environment and your bottom line.


watch air burners impact






eliminate wood waste
our air curtain burners are a cost-efficient, environmentally-friendly solution to eliminate unwanted wood and vegetative waste 40x faster than an open burn.





generate power
the portable biocharger sends your power to our battery storage module so you can use it to recharge your battery operated machinery on remote sites.





produce biochar
our self-contained air curtain burners turn wood and vegetative waste into biochar, nutrient-rich carbon ash that amends and restores soil.




the quickest way to fight climate change: reduce particulate matter
we could have a positive impact on climate change in months, not decades. why aren't we doing it?

the power series

the pgfirebox is an easily movable system that connects with the local power grid to generate income and, if applicable, comply with requirements for landfill diversion credits. the biocharger is an off grid portable unit that includes a battery storage module (bsm). the bsm stores the energy created throughout the day and provides the charging station to recharge battery powered machines in the evening. neither machine requires any permanent facilities and can be disconnected and moved in about 1 day.

the firebox series

the firebox burns wood waste 40x faster than an open burn, and the well proven air pollution control technology significantly reduces smoke and particulate matter. the world's most proven wood waste burners require no permanent facilities, so relocation is easy. no grinding, hauling, or secondary fuel sources, either.

the boss series

the burnboss, charboss, and trackboss are fully-assembled, self-contained, above-ground air curtain burners that eliminate wood waste. our pollution control technology in all three machines reduces smoke to less than 10% opacity compared to open burning at 100% opacity. in the burnboss and the trackboss 98% of the vegetative waste is eliminated and 2% clean biochar and ash remain. in the charboss approximately 80% of the vegetative waste is eliminated and 20% is converted to biochar as measured in tests by the us forest service. no matter how remote or rugged the terrain, the boss series has three easy-to-maneuver, cost-efficient, environmentally-friendly machines that can save your business some green and make our planet much healthier.

what a waste

wood waste is choking out our planet, with more being generated than what we can recycle. there is little to no market for the recycled product and the recycling process consumes so much fuel, its environmental benefits are questionable. the only viable solution is to invest in an air curtain burner—like our air burners—that can burn wood waste in the most cost-effective and environmentally-friendly way possible. air burner's air curtain machines burn the wood naturally, no hydrocarbon fuels are used at all. all that remains after the burn is a nutrient rich soil amendment called biochar.

it's time to rethink wood waste recycling
because there is no market for the recycled wood product












hauling
whether the wood ends up in a landfill or in a conventional biomass burner, the first step typically involves hauling whole wood waste to a chipping mill. this hauling process consumes 10 to 15 gallons of fuel and emits carbon dioxide, methane and other harmful greenhouse gases in the process.









chipping
chipping wood waste has fewer and fewer places it can be used. this chipped wood can be used as mulch, but its production from vegetative debris is a fossil-fuel intensive exercise to the tune of 40 to 60 gallons of diesel per hour. this process also emits more greenhouse gases into the air and the dust particles are recognized as a cancer causing agent by the u.s. epa.









open burning
not all wood waste can be recycled. open burning is the most common method of disposing of such waste, but it is also the most detrimental. unexpected changes in wind direction can cause open fires to spread uncontrollably, while the smoke (black carbon) that lingers long after an open burn is a human health risk and is a major climate change forcer.









composting
wood chips are a common ingredient for compost. there is a dark side to such "black gold". the wood chips used from vegetative waste have to first be ground up and then all the waste materials go into a mixer. once the waste is spread into rows, the windrow turner comes through once a week to turn the mixture. these machines burn over 100 gallons of diesel fuel per hour; and the grinding, turning, and handling creates an enormous amount of dust. the composting of wood chips also releases methane, which traps heat 30 times more effectively compared to carbon dioxide.
