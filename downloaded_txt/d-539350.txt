what students are saying about kangan institute?



















fashion design & technology
"this course has impacted me immensely. before studying i didn’t really know where my career was headed. i had always wanted a career in fashion but this was never attainable. through studying this course many doors opened up."
 
michaela eddington - advanced diploma of applied fashion design and merchandising

foundations & pathways
“there is obviously a lot of demand for english teachers and the tesol course at kangan institute seems to be well regarded. i actually started doing some work as a relief teacher before finishing the course and that has continued since i finished. i thought i would be quite nervous going into a real classroom for the first time but i was fine. i think the multiple opportunities for practice teaching in the tesol course really helped prepare me.”
 
david bergman - certificate iv in english language teaching (tesol)

hairdressing
“starting at joey scandizzo salon, the institute of choice was kangan institute. my initial thoughts of studying at kangan institute, were just the friendly vibe and you get to interact with clients and everything that you have there is what you would see in the real world.”
 
melissa serepisos - certificate iii in hairdressing & apprentice of the year
