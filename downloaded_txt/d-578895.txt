    welcome to st. john the baptist catholic school


the first thing to know about st. john the baptist is that it's full of kids.sjb is an elementary school with boys and girls in preschool through 8th grade. we have one class per grade, 268 students in all. we are part of a catholic parish, and we are committed to living as jesus taught us. to us, this means welcoming non-catholic students and their families into our community, extending our inclusive attitude and compassion to the classroom, lunch table, and playground. at sjb, there's a feeling of belonging among our students and families. we are proud of our high academic standards and achievements, including our blue ribbon distinction. most of our 8th graders go to catholic high schools of their choice, and many receive academic scholarships. our students benefit from top-notch writing and spanish instruction, technology integration that prepares them for their future, traditions that link them with our past. we are proud of our students' growth and our trusting partnerships with our supportive families. sjb is where you feel you belong.-- brian blomquist, principal of st. john the baptist
