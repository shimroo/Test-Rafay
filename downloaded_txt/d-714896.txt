a few more photos of fascinating bugs

posted august 11, 2015  by  blogadmin 


bed bugs are the most notorious bugs in the world, they can hide very well and mostly nocturnal bugs, which make them a very hard subject of photography. also, if you want to take pictures of them it is not recommended to bring them at home since they multiply very quickly and can infest your house with a couple of months. we ask our friends from pest control markham to take a few photos for our website. i still found these bugs very fascinating and admire they ability to stay without food months. i would recommend everyone to read about them some articles that you can find online.

photos of different ants

posted january 24, 2015  by  blogadmin 



ants are observed all around the globe, from the greatest deserts. they can be found by us in our houses, in our backyards, as well as in our workplaces. ants live in colonies as well as one colony could have over a million ants. there are many distinct kinds of ants. a few of the varieties that are better known will be bulldog ants, and the army ants, driver ants, honeypot ants, weaver ants, leafcutter ants, fire ants, silver ants. all ant colonies are constituted of three kinds of the soldier ants, specifically the worker ants, ants, along with the only queen ant.
the behaviour of ants may differ based on their kind. the size of ants vary from two to 25 millimeters as well as their colour can vary from reddish to black or brown.
ants which make their nests in trees by attaching leaves together are known as weaver ants. the leaves are first pulled by these creatures together using a bridge and the leaves are sewn by them together by pressing silk creating larvae.
leafcutter ants feed entirely on fungus and reside just in their colony. these ants come in distinct castes that are sized to perform various functions that must be performed in the colony. another unique kind is the fire ant. these ants have a sac of toxin which is filled with piperidine alkaloids. the australian bulldog ants are such with only one chromosome and these are amongst the most archaic and greatest types of ants.
army ants and driver ants are highly developed ants. army ants are located in south america and driver ants are located in africa. contrary to other ants, these don’t have permanent nests. these colonies reproduce by two processes – nuptial flights or fission.
honeypot ants typically have enlarged abdomens. honeypot often live in hot, dry areas like australia, africa, north america and they are sometimes present in deserts at the same time. these ants can also be considered an excellent delicacy.
ants are among the very most familiar creatures on earth and are of various sorts. despite their modest size, they may present a danger to people along with creatures.

while termites look like ants, they are  not. termites are a different species that is distantly related to ants. they feed on wood and are known to cause excessive damage to houses and wooden structures in north america. they are an excellent species to photograph.  termites- white ants

while bed bugs are considered a pest and rightfully so, they are an excellent subject for photography. their physical and behavioural charactertics make them difficuly to find to take pictures off. we got these photos from bed bug control markham.  the image was from a bed bug inspection. image courtesy of exterminatormarkham.ca
