gulf shores   is 
              a vacation destination unlike any other, offering endless possibilities 
              for family fun. people come from all over to take advantage of the 
              thirty two miles of unspoiled beachfront, some of the nicest beaches 
            in the u.s. 
 
while it is the beaches that often attract visitors to our 
              fair shores, there are numerous attractions offering many unique experiences, 
              including a zoo, two historic civil war forts, a national wildlife preserve, 
              estuarium, wwii battleship, birding trail, water and amusement parks, 
              one of the region's largest outlet malls and an eclectic assortment 
              of shops and galleries. the restaurants offer seafood as fresh as 
              it gets and the area  offers amercia's best public golf course 
              bargains, including nearly 300 holes of golf designed by some of the 
              greatest names in golf - larry nelson, arnold palmer, jerry pate, 
              early stone, bruce devlin, etc. and some of the gulf coast's best 
              fishing. for a variety of reasons, it just doesn't get much better 
              than gulf shores alabama.
