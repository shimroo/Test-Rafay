finding the perfect flap hat for baby helps reduce the chance of burning on the neck and ears.  they are a wonderful solution to crawlers since necks are exposed.  a great way to cover the back of baby when slung over your shoulder, or in a back carrier for a day hike.  here is what to look for:drapemany manufactures skimp on the length of the flap of a hat.  be sure it covers the full neck and ears.  it should also angle down the sides of the face as not to obstruct a child's view. it needs to come far enough up that a child's ears are covered.technology of fabriclook for uv blocking fabrics that are light-weight.  wool can be considered uv blocking! you want to to know that your uv blocking fabric is light-weight and can handle the outdoors.long cap brimmake certain the brim is long enough to provide adequate shade.additional featuresthe solaroo swim hat is made of a uv blocking swim fabric, so it can be worn in and out of the water.  on hot days, it can even be wet down and squeezed to cool off a child's head!

	 is sun block irritating your  eczema?
	 



eczema, a skin condition identified by a scaly rash that often becomes sore for sufferers, can become irritated by certain ingredients found in sun block.  so what can you do to decrease the risk of further skin irration while still protecting from the sun?use a uv blocking shirt while in the sun.  a light-weight upf50+ long sleeved rash guard can provide better protection than sun block because it blocks the sun evenly and you know you haven't "missed a spot".  if chemicals cause a reaction, look for uv blocking shirts that do not contain chemical uv protection, but are uv blocking due to the tight inter-locking stitch, like solaroo uv blocking long sleeve swim shirts.  this will minimize the amount of sun block used on your skin, along with skin exposure.look for sun blocks that are chemical free formula or sensitive formulas.  test them on the skin by applying a coin sized amount the night before venturing out, to see how your skin reacts to the ingredients.  we recommend blue lizard sensitive formula.a combination of uv blocking clothing and chemical/fragrance free sun blocks are a great combination of maximizing skin protection while minimizing exposure to the elements!labels: does spf matter, eczema, eczema and the sun, spf50, sun block, sun block spf, sun eczema
