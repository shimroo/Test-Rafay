sailing qualifications



to skipper a bareboat charter or flotilla yacht, you need to hold a practical sailing certificate equivalent to rya day skipper practical qualification or rya international certificate of competence (icc). for charters in greece, you must now have the icc certificate. you must also be assisted by at least one competent crew member over the age of 18.
the port authorities in greece are now insisting on one of the following practical certificates: rya icc (international certificate of competence), rya coastal, rya yachtmaster, asa ipc (international proficiency certificate) or the iyt (international yacht training) passport. if you hold an rya day skipper or asa104 it will no longer be accepted and you need to obtain either an icc or ipc from the corresponding issuing body (rya or asa). if your rya coastal/yachtmaster or asa105/106 certificate is more than 12 years old and does not have a photo id, then we would also strongly advise applying for an icc or ipc. if you are a member of the rya or asa, you may qualify for a discount or free certificate, otherwise, you will have to pay. the approximate cost is Â£50. please use this link - rya application for the icc or asa application for the ipc.
for charters in croatia, malta and the canaries, at least one member of the crew or the skipper will also need a vhf licence.
rya qualifications can be obtained by rya sailing schools in the uk or alternatively choose from one of our overseas centres in gibraltar, greece or turkey.
forÂ seychelles,Â the local authorities require an icc for the skipper of a bareboat or flotilla yacht charter.
for caribbean and tropical charters, formal qualifications are not compulsory, however, you should be day skipper standard and be assisted by at least one competent crew. a brief sailing resume should be provided to outline your experience.
for thailand a day skipper qualification is required as a minimum and you must have at least 3 weeks of skippering experience prior to your charter. a vhf qualification is compulsory.
if you don't hold the relevant qualifications then why not add a skipper?
