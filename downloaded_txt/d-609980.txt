speed up your computer use and become more efficient by using our typing tutor software to learn to type without looking at the keyboard.
unless you learn to type faster without looking at the keyboard then you are the most inefficient part of your computer system and are wasting part of your life.
touch typing is a skill that individuals and companies should be seriously looking at learning before they waste more time, effort and money each time a computer keyboard is used.
companies often spend a fortune on hardware and training courses, but fail to realise that their employees are wasting hours per day because they have not been trained to use their keyboards properly.
typing without looking at the keyboard not only allows a user to type faster and more accurately but it also frees their mind to think only about the words, instead of where the keys are.
the solution to this problem is touch typist, a typing tutor which has been teaching people to type since 1985, longer than any other typing tutor on sale today.

 
how does touch typist work?
touch typist typing tutor first shows you the correct position for your hands and fingers before you start on the first of 201 lessons. the lessons, consisting initially of only two letters gradually introduce more keys and words using the keys covered so far, increasing in complexity until all the letters have been taught. once the keyboard has been covered, the rest of the lessons are designed to present you with word and letter combinations which ensure that learning takes place.
the idea behind touch typist was to produce a guaranteed way to learn good keyboard skills without being boring, gaving the user lots of feedback and at the same time, make the user want to progress through the course and learn this valuable skill.
this was done by making the lessons short, by giving the user lots of feedback after each lesson and encouraging you to have ‘just one more go’. the results of each lesson are used by touch typist to to set targets for the user, move them back a few lessons if they are struggling, and to produce the many graphs and charts in the software.
after completing all 201 lessons, the job of improving speed, and more important, accuracy, starts. the software directs the user to work on lessons which have caused the most problems until those problems are sorted out. you will learn without getting bored due to the large amount of feedback presented by the software.
in touch typist typing tutor, the user is given the ability to ‘own’ their progress through the many graphs which are used to inspire practice and development during the learning and skill building phases.
