  law.

an assurance by the seller of property that the goods or property are as 
    represented or will be as promised. 
    the insured's guarantee that the facts are as stated in reference to an 
    insurance risk or that specified conditions will be fulfilled to keep the

north french, from feminine past participle of warantir, to guarantee, 
from warant, 
warrant.]


investment 
dictionary: warranty
a type of guarantee that a manufacturer or similar party makes regarding the 
condition of its product. it also refers to the terms and situations in which 
repairs or exchanges will be made in the event that the product does not 
function as originally described or intended.
investopedia says:
warranties usually have exceptions that limit 
the conditions in which a manufacturer will be obligated to rectify a problem. 
for example, many warranties for common household items only cover the product 
for up to one year from the date of purchase and usually only if the product in 
question contains problems resulting from defective parts or 
workmanship.as a result of these limited manufacturer warranties, many 
vendors offer extended warranties. these extended warranties are essentially 
insurance policies for products that consumers pay for up front. coverage will 
usually last for a handful of years above and beyond the manufacturer's warranty 
and is often more lenient in terms of limited terms and conditions.
wikipedia:
extended warranty, i.e auto, truck, car, rv, 
motorcycle

an extended warranty, 
sometimes called a service agreement, a service contract, or a 
maintenance agreement, is a prolonged warranty offered to 
consumers. the extended warranty may be offered by the warranty administrator, 
the retailer or the manufacturer. these warranties extend the period of the 
manufacturer's standard warranty and are usually not "double coverage". for 
example, a refrigerator's extended warranty covers two years past 
the manufacturer's one year warranty. extended warranties cost extra and for a 
percentage of the item's retail price. in retail consumer electronics, extended 
warranties cost 20% to 30% of the price, and give sales associates up to 15% 
commission at some retailers.[1][2] occasionally, some extended warranties that 
are purchased for multiple years state in writing that during the first year, 
the consumer must still deal with the manufacturer in the occurrence of 
malfunction. what was often promoted as a 5 year extended guarantee thus becomes 
only a four year guarantee.

overview
an extended warranty is coverage for electrical or mechanical breakdown. 
it does not cover peripheral items, wear and tear, damage by computer viruses, 
re-gassing, normal maintenance, accidental damage, or any consequential loss. 
the indemnity is to cover the cost of repair and may include replacement if 
deemed uneconomic to repair. it is important for consumers to read and 
understand the terms and conditions offered at the point of sale.
the value of extended warranties lies behind the organization promoting 
and selling them. most of the major retailers employ specialist administrators 
to manage the claims and to ensure the product is priced on a sustainable basis. 
an essential part of this is to determine the appropriate provisions on the 
balance sheet to reserve for future claims. similarly, the income must be earned 
over the period of cover.[3] companies that have been around for several 
years will usually have the systems and data in place with which to do this. 
less reputable organizations may not adequately price their extended warranties 
and may therefore have insufficient funds to provide for future claims 
costs.
marketing dictionary:
guarantee given by a seller to a buyer that the goods or services purchased 
will perform as promised, or a refund will be given, an exchange made, or a 
repair done at no charge. warranties usually become effective when the 
manufacturer receives a warranty application from the buyer (not at the date of 
puchase) and are effective for a limited period of time. warranties usually 
include limitations that exclude defects not caused by the manufacturer.
the warranty application form typically contains requests for demographic and 
other marketing information about the buyer such as marital status, occupation, 
age, income, where and when the item was purchased, and why that brand was 
selected. direct marketers maintain lists of individuals who have completed 
warranty applications, and use the data for promotion list enhancement.

mini-faq
1) what is an extended auto warranty?
an extended warranty is an agreement between the car owner and warranty 
company, obligating the warranty company to pay for repairs covered by the 
contract for a specific period of time. 
with an extended auto warranty you are protecting yourself from the 
unexpected cost of mechanical failure. more...
2) what exactly does an extended warranty cover?
know what's covered -- and what's not covered -- by the extended auto 
warranty you're considering. does the contract cover breakdown as well as wear 
and tear? under a "breakdown" warranty, coverage is extended only to parts that 
break. more...
3) why do i need an extended auto warranty?
since common mechanical repairs can cost into the thousands and 
these costs are rising rapidly; protecting your automotive investment should not 
be taken lightly. more...
4) why should i purchase an extended warranty now?
since common mechanical repairs can cost into the thousands and these costs 
are rising rapidly; protecting your automotive investment should not be taken 
lightly. 
whether you own a new or older make/model, an extended auto warranty will 
provide you with peace-of-mind protection regarding costly mechanical repairs 
that can happen at any time during the life of your vehicle. more...
5) what about the deductible?
fully investigate a policy's deductible before signing on the dotted line. 
consider not only its amount, but also whether it's per visit or per repair. 
with a per-visit deductible, each visit to the shop will run you a fixed amount, 
regardless of how many parts are repaired; a per-repair deductible applies to 
each serviced part. what sounds like a minor difference may, under certain 
circumstances, have a major impact on your wallet. more...
6) what type of auto warranty can i buy?
power train warranty: covers the engine, transmission, and other parts 
of the drive train only, which is defined as the 29 parts of the vehicle through 
which oil flows. these are the parts least likely to fail. 
the average vehicle contains thousands of parts. as it does not cover the 
majority of the components of a vehicle, the power train warranty is truly not 
an extended warranty. more...
7) can i still obtain extended auto warranty coverage?
many consumers do not realize that even after the manufacturer's warranty has 
expired, their vehicle is still eligible for extended coverage. you can 
generally receive coverage on vehicles that have less than 100,000 miles on the 
odometer. a vehicle out of its original warranty is more apt to have mechanical 
failure compared to a newer vehicle. more...
8) how does the claims process work?
the top warranty companies work like this: if your vehicle breaks down or is 
in need of a repair, take it or have it towed to any licensed repair facility 
and present your service agreement to the service department. after they 
diagnose the problem with the vehicle, they will call the claims administrator 
toll-free and receive repair authorization for all your covered repairs less a 
deductible where applicable. more...
9) why do car dealers sell extended warranties? car dealers make a
profit on the extended warranty, sometimes as much as they make on the
car! buyers can negotiate the price of the warranty just as they did the
price of the car. the working assumption is that dealers pay about 50 percent less
than the asking price for the warranty. a buyer should not pay more than
two-thirds of the asking price. more...
10) how do i resist the pressure to buy right away? it is not necessary to
buy the extended warranty right away. buyers usually have 12 months
after a new car purchase to buy a warranty. get the time limit from the
company selling it. more...
11) what if i decide i do want an extended warranty? the warranty need not
be purchased from the dealer. check a credit union or auto insurance
dealer for a warranty program, sometimes known as mechanical breakdown
insurance. check out the service contract or vehicle warranty companies.
more...
12) extended warranty prices? shop around for the
best price and the best coverage. if the warranty has a $100 deductible
for each service or repair, why bother? more...
13) extended warranty dealers? buyers can even shop
different dealerships by calling the finance managers at the other
stores. a buyer can tell the dealer who sold the vehicle that he's going to
check with the competition to find the best price. more...
14) what is a double warranty? don't buy a double
warranty, which is coverage for items already covered by the
vehicle manufacturer's warranty. more...
15) how do extended warranties help resale? if the car won't be in
the driveway for longer than the manufacturer's warranty, typically
three years or 36,000 miles, why bother? beware of the sales pitch that
the service contract will help the resale value of the car. a buyer has
just paid three years for a service that might never be used. more...
16) what if i did get an extended warranty from the  dealer? if buying the warranty
from the dealer, make sure it's the car manufacturer's warranty, which
is to say a ford warranty for a taurus.
more...
17) when should i buy an extended warranty for my vehicle? the warranty begins the
day it is purchased, not on the date the car is purchased. so those who
buy it 11-and-a-half months after purchasing have a car covered for
seven years instead of six. more...
18) extended warranties on a used car? a used car's price
sticker should clearly state whether there is any initial dealer
warranty. as for an extended warranty, many companies won't sell one
unless the used car was bought from a dealer. more...
19) extended warranties on a leased car? never buy an extended
warranty when leasing a car. more...

after-market auto 
warranties
from matthew 
wright,
q. i have been trying to find a source that can give me information 
concerning after-market auto warranties. there is a great deal of information 
that anyone would need to make an informed decision about purchasing this 
product and no place to find it, can you help? specifically, i have a 94 
infiniti q-45 with 69,000 miles on it. i would like to locate providers that can 
offer up to 150,000 mile warranty protection. i have heard they are out there, 
but where? are any of these providers rates as to their performance and 
universal acceptability?
a. in the years i have been in the auto repair business, i have never 
seen an extended warranty plan that covers over 100,000 miles. i have searched 
out many companies offering extended warranties and have yet to find one that 
offers anything over the 100,000 mile mark. (look for links on extended warranty 
companies in the next week or two) 
not being in the extended warranty business, i would guess the most likely 
reason for this is most cars are designed with built in obsolesce. that is to 
say they will incur more frequent and more costly repairs as they get older. an 
extended warranty is an insurance policy. when you buy life insurance, most 
companies require you to take a physical before they will sell you a policy. the 
same holds true for your car. when you go to buy an extended warranty, most 
companies will require a "physical" on your car before they will sell you the 
warranty. if the car is in good shape with no history of serious problems, they 
will sell you a policy. on the other hand, if the car has been poorly maintained 
and/or has had serious problems in the past, they will most likely decline. when 
you go to buy an extended warranty there are some things to look for. 



what is covered? does it just cover power train or "bumper to bumper"? 
  before you sign, make sure you know exactly what is covered.

what is the deductible? a 50.00 deductible is common but as the deductible 
  rises, the cost of the warranty will go down. thus a warrant with a 100.00 
  deductible will be cheaper than one with a 50.00 deductible.

how does the company pay for a covered repair? do they pay the repair 
  facility directly or do you pay the bill and they reimburse you? a direct pay 
  is desirable because the repair facility will do all the required paper work 
  leaving you free to pick up the car and drive away. also, if there is a 
  problem with the repair not being done correctly or not lasting, the warranty 
  company will, most likely, take steps to help you resolve the problem.

how long has the extended warranty company been around? look for a company 
  that has been around for a while. that will give you a good indication that 
  they will not close up shop tomorrow and leave you with a worthless policy. 
  

compare prices and plans. look for reasonable rates, not the cheapest. as 
  with anything, if it's to good to be true, it probably isn't.
as with any car, the best insurance is preventative maintenance. and the best 
pm is changing the engine oil frequently. infinity recommends an oil and filter 
change every 7500 miles under normal driving conditions. nobody drives under 
"normal conditions" i would highly recommend changing the oil and filter every 
3000 miles. i have seen q45's, and many other makes of cars, go 150,000 - 
200,000 miles with no major problems with 3,000 mile oil changes. 
i hope this has been of some help to you. i am always doing research on this, 
and many other subjects and if i should come across a company that offers a 
150,000 mile plan, i will surely let you, and all my readers know.
update:
i have found a auto warranty broker, 
warranties 4 wheels and they seem to have a variety of programs that will take a 
vehicle way past the 150,000 mile mark. know remember, it is not going to be the 
same coverage while you were under the factory warranty, but it will help to 
indemnify you against major catastrophic repair costs down the road. you can 
contact them at 1-877-844-7283 or go to www.warranties4wheels.com and get a 
free, no obligation auto warranty quote from them.
 


















auto service contracts
buying a car? you also may be encouraged to buy an auto service contract to help protect against unexpected, costly repairs. while it may sound like a good idea, don't buy in until you understand both the terms of the contract and who is responsible for providing the coverage.
the auto service contract
a service contract is a promise to perform (or pay for) certain repairs or services. sometimes called an "extended warranty," a service contract is not a warranty as defined by federal law. a service contract may be arranged at any time and always costs extra; a warranty comes with a new car and is included in the original price.
the separate and additional cost distinguishes a service contract from a warranty.
the terms
before deciding whether to buy an auto service contract, ask these questions:
does the service contract duplicate any warranty coverage?
compare service contracts with the manufacturer's warranty before you buy. new cars come with a manufacturer's warranty, which usually offers coverage for at least one year or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first. even used cars may come with some type of coverage (see table below).
you may decide to buy a "demonstrator" model � a car that has never been sold to a retail customer but has been driven for purposes other than test drives. if so, ask when warranty coverage begins and ends. does it date from when you purchase the car or when the dealer first put the car into service?
who backs the service contract?
ask who performs or pays for repairs under the terms of the service contract. it may be the manufacturer, the dealer, or an independent company.
many service contracts sold by dealers are handled by independent companies called administrators. administrators act as claims adjusters, authorizing the payment of claims to any dealers under the contract. if you have a dispute over whether a claim should be paid, deal with the administrator.
if the administrator goes out of business, the dealership still may be obligated to perform under the contract. the reverse also may be true. if the dealer goes out of business, the administrator may be required to fulfill the terms of the contract. whether you have recourse depends on your contract's terms and/or your state's laws.
learn about the reputation of the dealer and the administrator. ask for references and check them out. you also can contact your local or state consumer protection office, state department of motor vehicles, local better business bureau, or local automobile dealers association to find out if they have public information on the firms. look for the phone numbers and addresses in your telephone directory.
find out how long the dealer or administrator has been in business, and try to determine whether they have the financial resources to meet their contractual obligations. individual car dealers or dealer associations may set aside funds or buy insurance to cover future claims. some independent companies are insured against a sudden rush of claims.
find out if the auto service contract is underwritten by an insurance company. in some states, this is required. if the contract is backed by an insurance company, contact your state insurance commission to ask about the solvency of the company and whether any complaints have been filed.
how much does the auto service contract cost?
usually, the price of the service contract is based on the car make, model, condition (new or used), coverage, and length of contract. the upfront cost can range from several hundred dollars to more than $1,000.
in addition to the initial charge, you may need to pay a deductible each time your car is serviced or repaired. under some service contracts, you pay one charge per visit for repairs � no matter how many. other contracts require a deductible for each unrelated repair.
you also may need to pay transfer or cancellation fees if you sell your car or end the contract. often, contracts limit the amount paid for towing or related rental car expenses.
what is covered and not covered?
few auto service contracts cover all repairs. indeed, common repairs for parts like brakes and clutches generally are not included in service contracts. if an item isn't listed, assume it's not covered.
watch out for absolute exclusions that deny coverage for any reason. for example:
    * if a covered part is damaged by a non-covered component, the claim may be denied.
    * if the contract specifies that only "mechanical breakdowns" will be covered, problems caused by "normal wear and tear" may be excluded.
    * if the engine must be taken apart to diagnose a problem and it is discovered that non-covered parts need to be repaired or replaced, you may have to pay for the labor involved in the tear-down and re-assembling of the engine. 
you may not have full protection even for parts that are covered in the contract. some companies use a "depreciation factor" in calculating coverage: the company may pay only partial repair or replacement costs if they consider your car's mileage.
how are claims handled?
when your car needs to be repaired or serviced, you may be able to choose among several service dealers or authorized repair centers. or, you may be required to return the vehicle to the selling dealer for service. that could be inconvenient if you bought the car from a dealership in another town.
find out if your car will be covered if it breaks down while you're using it on a trip or if you take it when you move out of town. some auto service contract companies and dealers offer service only in specific geographical areas.
find out if you need prior authorization from the contract provider for any repair work or towing services. be sure to ask:
    * how long it takes to get authorization.
    * whether you can get authorization outside of normal business hours.
    * whether the company has a toll-free number for authorization. test the toll-free number before you buy the contract to see if you can get through easily. 
you may have to pay for covered repairs and then wait for the service company to reimburse you. if the auto service contract doesn't specify how long reimbursement usually takes, ask. find out who settles claims in case you have a dispute with the service contract provider and need to use a dispute resolution program.
are new or reconditioned ("like") parts authorized for use in covered repairs?
if this concerns you, ask. some consumers are disappointed when they find out "reconditioned" engines are being used as replacement parts under some service contracts. also ask whether the authorized repair facility maintains an adequate stock of parts. repair delays may occur if authorized parts are not readily available and must be ordered.
what are your responsibilities?
under the contract, you may have to follow all the manufacturer's recommendations for routine maintenance, such as oil and spark plug changes. failure to do so could void the contract. to prove you have maintained the car properly, keep detailed records, including receipts.
find out if the contract prohibits you from taking the car to an independent station for routine maintenance or performing the work yourself. the contract may specify that the selling dealer is the only authorized facility for servicing the car.
what is the length of the service contract?
if the service contract lasts longer than you expect to own the car, find out if it can be transferred when you sell the car, whether there's a fee, or if a shorter contract is available.
used cars: warranty protection
when shopping for a used car, look for a buyer's guide sticker posted on the car's side window. this sticker is required by the ftc on all used cars sold by dealers. it tells whether a service contract is available. it also indicates whether the vehicle is being sold with a warranty, with implied warranties only, or "as is."
    * warranty. if the manufacturer's warranty is still in effect on the used car, you may have to pay a fee to obtain coverage, making it a service contract. however, if the dealer absorbs the cost of the manufacturer's fee, the coverage is considered a warranty.
    * implied warranties only. there are two common types of implied warranties. both are unspoken and unwritten and based on the principle that the seller stands behind the product. under a "warranty of merchantability," the seller promises the product will do what it is supposed to do. for example, a toaster will toast, a car will run. if the car doesn't run, implied-warranties law says that the dealer must fix it (unless it was sold "as is") so that the buyer gets a working car. a "warranty of fitness for a particular purpose" applies when you buy a vehicle on a dealer's advice that it is suitable for a certain use, like hauling a trailer. used cars usually are covered by implied warranties under state law.
    * as is - no warranty. if you buy a car "as is," you must pay for all repairs, even if the car breaks down on the way home from the dealership. however, if you buy a dealer-service contract within 90 days of buying the used car, state law "implied warranties" may give you additional rights.
      some states prohibit "as is" sales on most or all used cars. other states require the use of specific words to disclaim implied warranties. in addition, some states have used car "lemon laws" under which a consumer can receive a refund or replacement if the vehicle is seriously defective. to find out about your state laws, check with your local or state consumer protection office or attorney general. 
other tips
if you're told you must purchase an auto service contract to qualify for financing, contact the lender yourself to find out if this is true. some consumers have had trouble canceling their service contract after discovering the lender didn't require one.
if you decide to buy a service contract through a car dealership � and the contract is backed by an administrator and/or a third party � make sure the dealer forwards your payment and gives you written confirmation. some consumers have discovered too late that the dealer failed to forward their payment, leaving them with no coverage months after they signed a contract. contact your local or state consumer protection office if you have reason to believe that your contract wasn't put into effect as agreed.
in some states, service contract providers are subject to insurance regulations. find out if this is true in your state. insurance regulations generally require companies to: 
  * maintain an adequate financial reserve to pay claims.
  * base their contract fees on expected claims. some service providers have been known to make huge profits because the cost of their contracts far exceeds the cost of repairs or services they provide.
  * seek approval from the state insurance office for premiums or contract fees.
complaints
to report contract problems with a service provider, contact your local and state consumer protection agencies, including the state insurance commissioner and state attorney general.
if you need help resolving a dispute, contact the better business bureau, the state attorney general, or the consumer protection office in your area. also, contact law schools in your area and ask if they have dispute resolution programs.
the ftc works to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop and avoid them. to file a complaint or get free information on consumer issues, visit ftc.gov or call toll-free, 1-877-ftc-help (1-877-382-4357); tty: 1-866-653-4261. watch a new video, how to file a complaint, at ftc.gov/video to learn more. the ftc enters consumer complaints into the consumer sentinel network, a secure online database and investigative tool used by hundreds of civil and criminal law enforcement agencies in the u.s. and abroad.
