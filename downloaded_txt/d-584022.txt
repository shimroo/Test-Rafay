10:45 pm - it's been 33 weeks since my last entry...



so i guess it's been awhile......i don't really know why i thought to log in, i'm suprised i was able to......i guess life has hit another point of change and for some reason it feels good to send out my feelings and information to a whole bunch of people. lol...but not myspace of course, that is not meant for personal information, of course i guess this shouldn't be either....i just wanted to say that i am:uncertain,emotional,a little sad,a little scared,and a little aprehensive.......school starts again and my summer is over....this routine i've gotten into is quite comfortable and satisfying.......but we all have responsibilites don't we? lives to get back to because summer is just that, a season, a temporary time meant to be enjoyed and i knew it was coming, i knew the end would be here...i even knew it would be like this...but in the moment, it's completely different......it's not worse it's just up and down...i don't know how to feel...from one night of tequilla and friends to the next night of silent jogging, and an aquaintance/new friend being able to tell my listless, far off sadness distinctly enough to ask me how i'm doing... of course that switch from nicely buzzed happy to somewhat melancholy the next time they see me is a huge shift i guess...things are going to be okay, life will work out...my career, my friends, my lovelife, my love, my ideology for my life vs the reality of it......i guess i just needed to talk to the void that is the internet, even if no one is left on livejournal that i know anymore, to just transmit this attainable information out to the unknown is a sort of release, an expression that won't end in tears......i love you... that just popped into my head....not directed at anyone necessarily, but at the sametime to you, whoever that is that somehow finds and decides to read the rantings of a 20 going through a sort of withdrawl...i feel, contemplative, random, sad, appreciated, miserable, looking forward, loved, lethargic...a mix of emotions that are so conradictory...i have no idea what to do with them all... i just want to kiss them all away...or go jogging again...
current mood:  contemplative

i don't know why i still even log in here. it's kind of a waste of time i guess.but i kinda hate myspace still. i guess, people look at my myspace so i rather write on here...lol...someone might read it, unlike my other page where i have some regulars. lol. *damn it taryn is fucking annoying. i'm working at the desk and all i can here is her fucking loud, rude, obnoxious voice and i just want to fucking punch her face and duct tape her mouth shut forever...damn it, she's so fucking annoying...sooooo annoying.*so...yeah...i can't even hear my own thoughts with her voice screaming in my ear...damn it.okay...she left. damn it she is fucking loud...like...she makes me look quite...lol.so...lately i've been feeling kind of purposeless...like i'm not doing anything with my life...i mean i am...i'm going to school where i'll eventually be working towards something...i've got a job that makes a little bit of money...right now to pay off my credit card and school bills...so i guess i still don't have money...i've got a nice guy in my life...i dunno...sometimes i guess i just feel like i'm sitting on it...i look at martin luther king jr. and he did so much, yeah he had his own set of problems etc, but he still ended up changing the world...i dunno...i don't expect to change the world...i just want to be a possitive difference in the lives around me...i've been kind of depressed lately, for the past two weeks or so...i'll finally get in a good mood then something happens that sets me off...no matter how small it is...it's been kind of annoying...but i guess...i dunno...maybe i just need to find more of a passion, a purpose with my life...maybe finally find a direction...sometimes i just want to be selfish. not worry about anyone elses feelings. not in a mean way but in a "this is what i need to do for myself, to keep peace with myself." kind of deal.i've gotten held back each time i've tried to go to spain but other people in my life: "summer is the only time we get together"; "i don't like the idea of a bunch of dirty mexicans hitting on you"; "that's different then just being far away like across country its across the world." stuff like that. even with the "understanding" that i need to do it if i want to minor in spanish it still kept me from going each time...i understand their concern each time, but seriously...i'm too young to set my life on other people who i have/had an uncertain future with anyways...i dunno...it's just lame...i guess i feel like a pushover...and underachiever...i want to go on a year long mission trip but will i go??i fuck, i probably won't...another life experience down the drain because i don't put in enough fucking effort...cause i'm a damn pushover...fucking a.well, i've got homework to do and plans to make.is anyone out there satisfied with their life??? 100% satisfied? 75% satisfied?

1:10 am - just in case anyone reads this.



tonight i was going through my photos on my computer and i found some that i didn't delete...and looking at them was odd...uncomfortable...awkward even...partly because i have similar pictures with my current boyfriend who i am happily dating. the pictures aren't deep and meaningful, but at the same time help me realize once upon a time they did mean something and that no matter how things turned out or will turn out, i guess in the long run it was worth happening because along the way to catastrophy there was good. there was something meaningful...it just got messed up along the way...but i guess if it all didn't happen i wouldn't be where i am today...and today i am happy...to be honest if i think hard enough i still feel that kick in the stomach when i was verbally slapped in the face by other peoples actions.*similar to how tiffany slapped josh in the face after she broke up with himbut that's not the point. the point i guess i'm trying to make is a semi public, honest, open realization that it did hurt, i still don't like the way i felt but i hate the feeling i have of resentment and hate towards those people. not beacuse i carry a grudge, i don't hold those, i've tried my best to let it go, and forgive, which i think i have...but none the less the scars of those actions are still there...but i guess if we had no trials we'd never improve. would we?life is to short to regret things, to hold onto bad thoughts or decisions. live with what you've got. not using crutches like a bad family, or an abusive person in your life, or stress, or responsibilities...that is what makes people weak. their crutches. learn to use them as a tool to help you stand on your own, not to use for the rest of your life. "my dad beat me up so i can never trust anyone." does that mean you should push people away? cheat on someone you "love"? abuse someone else? no that doesn't give you a right to act like a bitch. it gives you the right to hurt, to feel betrayed and to have trust issuse, but not the right to use those fucking excuses in a relationship for horrible behavior. i've had my crutches, and i think that's why these attitudes piss me off. i've tried to loose my crutches. i don't blame my dad anymore for my "guy issues" or for my trust issues, or for my lack of self-esteem. instead i say, he made mistakes, no one is perfect, but i choose to not be like him, i choose to figure out what to do right when i'm put in a situation where i could do the same to someone else.making something work is a choice. if you truely both want to be in it, then it will work, but one person cannot hold a real relationship together. it's better to learn and move on. take the pain and step up to it like an adult, feel the pain but don't let it conrol you.i saw those pictures, and yeah they reminded me of a different time in my life when i was happy. when things were good. and it's true, because they were good. but then i kept scrolling, and i saw things in my life get worse...and then after a while through my 2000+ photos...things got better...i was happy again...things were better again. different, very different...but so was i, but i am happy.that doesn't mean i don't get sad, it just means that my life, my existance isn't mostly sadness. it just means that balance has been restored for the most part.and i hope that in the case that someone reads this they realize that their happier too. and if they're not...do something to change that...this really does go out to anyone who does read this...to anyone is has chains, and baggage and things that they do have in their lives but that weigh them down instead of get stored...the person with crutches instead of learning to walk with out them after they've had time to heal enough. you gotta start somewhere...take the first step.much love to everyone out there...it'll be okay...

9:16 pm - when it seeps in



loneliness......old photographs, old friends, old memories...damn it i hate myspace...i hate seeing people who used to be friends, and then i look at what our friendships have become...people move away, people grow apart, people change.it's just life, but i can't help but feel a sense of loneliness, i look back to different times, not better, not worse, just simply different...who was my best friend, who did i turn to in times of need, who did i do stupid shit with, who did i party with, who did do anything with...and now...where did they all go? where did i go?the worst thing is that there is no point in time where things really changed...they just...did...with some, yes there was a moment, a moment of betrayl, a moment of disappointment, but the majority of these old friendships just...disappeared.i guess that life though, our circumstaces change, we change, we become different people, it's not bad...change isn't bad...it's just change......but still...loneliness tends to seep in...seeping into the places where something once was...seeping into the gooves of the memories of those times...it is inevitable, it is necessary...and yet you can't help but hold onto it...hold onto those times...the good and the bad...and the regret as well...but we must press on...because things are good...because we should live in the present...because we should be happy with what we have, not dwell on what we've lost...because things change but hopefully with change there is growth and will growth there is success and with success there is happiness...we should be happy, no matter what...though i think it is okay to miss those moments in our past...i think it is okay to be lonely for different times sometimes.for everything under the sun there is a season.

so, i haven't been on here for a long time...crazy......here's the update...i've been with my current boyfriend for a little over 6 months, it's a good relationship, pretty chill, but because we're so "chill" i kinda wonder where we're really going...but he treats me well, takes care of me. but we're both independant enough that we don't have to spend every moment together like ex's of mine(too clingy).school this year is interesting, a few tough classes, and a few boring ones...glad i worked this summer at a dead end job so i knew what i don't want to be stuck in for the rest of my life! lol. but college is okay...i just need a direction......i have friends up here...slowly making more...but i do spend most of my time with the boyfriend and some of our mutual friends...so that means pretty much me and the guys. lol.but i've met some cool girls who i think will be fun to hang out with and get some feminine time, every girl needs their girl time(unless they're sluts that no one likes cause they have a]too much baggage b]too much drama c]they're just slutty d]all of the above, oh or their backstabbers too, and liars, and all of that but these girls seem cool so far) so yeah, i'm glad to be making more friends.my roommate is gone every weekend, so i get either the room to myself(like the last two weekends) or i sign out too and do my thing. me and her are friends, we get along, but she spends all her free time with her boyfriend, which is understandable i guess...i dunno, i just don't want her to wake up one day and realize she has no friends cause it's always just the two of them. another reason why i'm happy with daimian, we have our own friends, we can be apart from each other, anyways when we do hang out its usually not just the two of us.but yeah, things are good...last year was more exciting i guess, but this year is still good...just a little more lazy, like i haven't gone to the underground yet, or gone to the skatepark, or really done much of anything....just kinda hang out....i dunno. but yeah, it'll be a good year no matter what...just different...every year is different...peace out.

8:20 pm - more than i ever let on...



"tortures of the damned"-baysidei hate myself,more than i ever let on.i'm burned out at 22.i lived too fast and i loved too much and i'll die too young,but i chose this cup that i drank from.knew what i was getting into.but i couldn't let out what i had to keep in.i'm ashamed of myself and unspeakable sins,that i've committed and:[chorus]i've made mistakes,but i'll find my way.there's no explanation for,the things i've failed at before.they can't hold my hand.it just hurts to be a man,through the tortures of the damned. if i only had an axe,i'd sever the ties i've made with the world.maybe i can be a stranger,in a strange place.if i start now, maybe i can be saved.if i only had a mask,i'd cover these bleeding eyes.they're bloodshot now but they'll be black by dawn.if i wake up now,i can be pure again.[chorus] look at me now, i'm on the tracks with my back towards the last train leaving town. [x4][chorus x2]ugh..today has been mediocre...i fucking hate days like today...hate them...they make me hate me sometimes too...fuck...

2:03 pm - fuck me.



well, i'm just working and checking my fucking journals and myspace and email and i hate how i fucking can set myself off...just with these little things, like really "meaningless" things but they aren't to me...they bug me. not a lot i guess, buti hate not being open and out there, i feel like i'm protecting myself and while in a relationship that is the exact opposite of what you're supposed to be doing. it's stupid and rediculous and it fucking pisses me off. whatever...fuck it all. ahh!!!
current mood:  frustrated

i hate when i ahve those moments where something comes into my mind and goes directly to my stomach, like the thought/idea/feeling just makes you sick. makes your body hurt and your heart pound. it doesn't happen very often but recently i have been feeling emotional, like thinking about all sorts of things...i dunno...some of my friends have recently hit heartbreak and that hurts me, and that makes me think of ways and things that have done the same to me...heart break is tragic, every form of it...it is this empty vulnerablity and all that is left after that wave has passed is a sense of doubt...i dunno...i just feel...out of place...like my body and mind have separated...there has been so much stuff going on recently, plus the added stress of packing again and heading off back to school...all of this has brought me to this insanity.though i have to say that amind the insanity, last week i made a painting...it is not the greatest piece of are, nor the most beautiful, but it is powerful...in every disorganized, emotional scratch, smear, hand print, color, work, line, curve impression, is a piece of myself and my own disorganized control...i do control what i made but in the same way that i conrtrolled it by my insanity and fervor and frustration it has turned around and made it's self into something of it's own....if that all made any sense.looking at it makes me want to jump into the colors and cry and scream and laugh and be free...the freedom amongs the words and cut outs...the beauty in the miserable shreeking silence as it yells for more attention as it calls to me to pick up the brush, paint the world. paint myself. be free...it screams for that, some sort of solace, some sort of release from the pressure of every weight on it's shoulders, on my shoulders...for confidence, for pride for juststice, for peace and for self.expression, it is essencial to life, to living, to loving, to all aspects of what we call our existance. being trapped in this world is one thing, being trapt in our own bodies is another...if we can't get it out by choice, sooner or later everything that has built up inside of us will some how explode...it is a miracle, and a curse...a miracle if we learn to harness our passions and feelings and put it to something that helps us, and a curse to those who ignore it and from that make mistakes and destroy themselves and potentially others...to inner peace.
