living in mansfield


ranked among the top 10 best college dorms in america by niche, residential life doesn’t get much better than here. and boy do we have options! we’re talking four residence halls, each with accommodations in a variety of configurations between two-person and four-person set ups — all within steps of our dining options, student activities and recreation, as well as picturesque views of the tioga river valley.  an added perk, especially from higher points of campus, are those insta-worthy seasonal sunsets. a perfect way to end a productive and fulfilling day.

campus dining


as an active mountie, we know you'll be hungry! it all starts with our flagship all-you-care-to-eat dining facility, manser hall. here it begins with a full breakfast buffet. brunch is offered on the weekends, and of course, dinner is set throughout the week with specialty days — ahem, burrito mondays — along with full menus to serve dietary preferences. no time to sit and chat? then it's steps down to lower manser where your attention is split between the mu 1857 grill, the mansfield deli, and a slice of mu. on the go? no worries. we got the mountie market — a 24/7 location for snacks anytime of the day — and mountie coffee, your spot for all the starbucks favs.

student life


there’s a lot of forever moments at mansfield. that’s what college promises to offer, but it’s different here … it just is. generations of mounties relive and celebrate them all the time … at weddings, on vacations, crossing paths in the career field, and especially each fall “back home” during homecoming. it’s evident. it’s undeniable. it’s the mountie life. these moments resonate from all walks of the mountie experience — from residence halls to apartments, from classes to study lounges, from clubs to organizations, from first year to the graduation stage.


activities and organizations













mountie pride


you’ll find ample opportunities of fitness and athletics at mansfield, including playing on or cheering for one of 23 intercollegiate athletics programs. stay active at the kelchner fitness center — which we affectionally call kfc — where you’ll find an impressive array of strength and cardio equipment, fitness classes like yoga and zumba, rock-climbing walls, an indoor track, and even bike rentals that are fully equipped to take on the five neighboring biking trails. get in the game by testing your mettle during intramural competition or step up and square off against our rivals as a member of a club team, including bass fishing.


athletics and fitness
