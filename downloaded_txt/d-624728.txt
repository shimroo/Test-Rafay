we offer the ideal environment for children taking their first, tiny steps in the world.
our nursery welcomes children from a few months old to five years, after which many of them still come back to enjoy our out of school club.
we show children how to play together, learn together and grow up together, and we do it in an environment which is safe, secure and convenient, only a short distance from beverley town centre.








each room has the appropriate resources and equipment to help your child’s development.
from babies in arms to bouncing five-year-olds we use a touch of flower power to support the personal, social and emotional development of your children.
from the daffodil room to the sunflower room, the buttercup room and the bluebell room, the children will find each setting has the appropriate resources and equipment to meet their evolving needs and to help them progress.

out of school club
the need for high quality childcare isn’t confined to term time and why we’ve been operating an out of school club since 2012.
we can accommodate up to 20 children and we apply the same learning, caring and sharing principles as the rest of the nursery, not least because many of the out of school club members have graduated from our other rooms!

 open 7.15am until 6.30pm
