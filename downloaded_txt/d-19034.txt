what is magnetic resonance (mr)?






magnetic resonance is a physical phenomenon that is applied in nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectrometers to study matter at atomic level to return detailed information about molecular structure.
magnetic resonance spectroscopy has found application in chemistry, biology, and materials science, serving both research and industrial purposes. for instance, it plays a crucial role in structural chemistry by helping to elucidate molecular configurations and dynamics, which are paramount in drug development and materials science. additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (mri) – another application of magnetic resonance – is widely recognized in medical diagnostics and preclinical imaging (pci) for its non-invasive ability to provide detailed images of internal organs and tissues, significantly aiding in the early detection and management of diseases. bruker, a leading supplier of nmr spectrometers, epr spectrometers and preclinical mri instruments, has continually advanced these technologies. 
in the world of magnetic resonance, the constituents of atoms, when exposed to a magnetic field, become perturbed by an oscillating field and react by generating an electromagnetic signal. this process, when targeting atomic nuclei, is termed ‘nuclear magnetic resonance’ (nmr), while focusing on electrons leads to ‘electron spin resonance’ (esr) or ‘electron paramagnetic resonance’ (epr). esr was first observed by russian physicist yevgeny konstantinovich zavoisky in 1944, marking the beginning of many important discoveries in this field. two years later, nmr was independently observed in the united states by teams led by felix bloch and edward mills purcell, a milestone that earned them the 1952 nobel prize in physics, underscoring the profound impact of magnetic resonance on science and technology.


















the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy






in nmr spectroscopy, samples for analysis are brought into a strong magnetic field. the atomic nuclei in the sample must have a particular quantum mechanical property, called ‘non-zero nuclear spin,’ to interact with the magnetic field in the spectrometer. many important nuclei, most notably hydrogen, have this property and can be analyzed by nmr. when a sample substance is brought into the magnetic field of the nmr spectrometer, the nuclear spins in the sample align with the magnetic field. in an nmr spectrometer, the sample is surrounded by radiofrequency (rf) coils, which can then be used to apply one or more rf pulses to the sample. the rf pulses perturb the nuclear spins in the sample. the response to this perturbation is the production of an electromagnetic response in the rf coil, which contains information about the nuclei in the sample and their surroundings. this can be used to infer the structure of a molecule, for example. the resonance frequency of the nuclear spins depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field. 

with the field strengths that are typically used in nmr, protons resonate at frequencies of several hundred megahertz (mhz). excitingly, this allows researchers to determine not just the types of atoms present but also their positions in a molecule, leading to insights into its three-dimensional structure.
bruker has played a leading role in the development and commercialization of nmr spectrometry. bruker was founded in 1960 in karlsruhe, germany, by a group including german physicist and entrepreneur dr. günther laukien, who was one of the first to recognize the commercial potential of nmr technology. his vision propelled bruker to the forefront of nmr innovation, constantly evolving with technological advances. nmr spectroscopy experienced ongoing breakthroughs.
among the most notable technological achievements are the use of fourier-transform nmr (ft-nmr), the use of superconducting magnets with ever-increasing field strength, and multidimensional nmr. today, nmr continues to be an invaluable tool in various scientific disciplines, providing unmatched precision in molecular analysis.

fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance






in ft-nmr, the sample substance is exposed to a very short, relatively strong burst of rf energy, exciting all the spins in the sample simultaneously. this rapid excitation generates overlapping resonance signals which are recorded by the spectrometer. these signals are then subjected to a mathematical analysis called fourier transformation (ft), which converts time domain data into frequency domain data which can be displayed in an easily interpretable spectrum. ft-nmr can acquire a complete spectrum in a matter of seconds, making it a time-efficient technique for molecular structure elucidation. the method is distinguished by its ability to resolve complex molecular compositions quickly, significantly improving workflow efficiency in analytical laboratories. an ft-nmr spectrometer typically generates a spectrum as shown in figure 1, which can be used by scientists to infer the structure of molecules or detect impurities in mixtures. this capability is vital across numerous fields, including quality control, where it ensures product consistency, or drug development, where precise molecular analysis can lead to the creation of more effective pharmaceutical compounds. additionally, ft-nmr is extensively used in chemical research, materials research, particularly in energy storage, and biology, where understanding the three-dimensional structure of molecules is crucial. its versatility allows researchers to explore both static and dynamic chemical properties, immensely contributing to the advancement of fundamental sciences. 
ft-nmr was pioneered in the 1960s by swiss physicist richard ernst, who was awarded the 1991 nobel prize in chemistry for his groundbreaking contributions to the development of high-resolution nmr spectroscopy methodology. to this day, ft-nmr spectroscopy remains the most widely used method, owed largely to its ability to provide high-resolution data swiftly and reliably.

stronger magnetic fields for better resolution













using stronger magnetic fields improves nmr sensitivity and results in better spectral resolution. today, in most nmr spectrometers, helium-cooled superconducting magnets generate the required strong static magnetic fields. some of the strongest magnets in the world – with field strengths in the range of 30 tesla – can be found in nmr spectrometers. in small and compact benchtop nmr spectrometers, permanent magnets are often used.



multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance
multidimensional nmr is a set of nmr methods, which uses special pulse sequences to yield data defined by more than one frequency axis, which enhances the resolution and the information content of an nmr spectrum. multidimensional nmr spectroscopy forms the basis of determining the structure of biomolecules such as proteins, dna or rna. swiss physicist kurt wüthrich was awarded the 2002 nobel prize in chemistry for his development of nmr spectroscopy to determine the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules in solution.

electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectroscopy






electron paramagnetic resonance (epr), also called electron spin resonance (esr), is a form of spectroscopy used to study molecules or atoms with unpaired electron(s), including free radicals, transition metal ions, rare-earth ions, and defects in materials. versatile and non-destructive, it can be used in vivo in solids, liquids, and gases. 

free radicals are often short-lived, yet they play crucial roles in many essential biological and chemical processes such as photosynthesis, oxidation, catalysis, and polymerization reactions. despite their transience, these highly reactive molecules can have a damaging impact on their surroundings, contributing to a range of diseases including cancer, alzheimer’s, and cardiovascular disease, and are closely associated with aging processes. their influence extends to the degradation of polymers, highlighting their significant role in materials science. indeed, epr spectroscopy's ability to accurately detect and quantify free radicals provides essential insights into the mechanisms of these processes, offering researchers valuable information for developing new approaches to combat related health disorders. electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) is indispensable in fields like quantum computing and environmental monitoring, augmenting our understanding of complex phenomena on a molecular level. 

the only technique for the unambiguous detection and quantification of species with unpaired electrons, epr requires minimal sample preparation to provide data in seconds using bruker’s dedicated workflows and pre-defined experiments. epr's efficiency and precision make it an invaluable resource for both research and practical applications across a spectrum of scientific disciplines.


















epr spectrometer types






there are two primary types of electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectrometers: continuous wave (cw) and pulsed epr, each offering unique approaches to analyzing samples with unpaired electrons. 

in continuous wave epr, a sample is exposed to a constant frequency of microwaves while the magnetic field is varied. this allows for steady-state measurements of the sample's response, capturing the spectrum by observing changes in microwave reflection as the magnetic field fluctuates. this technique is valuable for identification of the source of unpaired electron spins in a sample and provides clues into the interaction of the electron spin with its environment, such as hyperfine couplings. 

by contrast, pulsed epr operates similarly to nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) techniques, where the sample is subjected to a series of microwave pulses that stimulate spin transitions. the electromagnetic responses to these pulses are then captured and analyzed either in the time domain or in the frequency domain using the fourier transform. the main advantages in pulse epr lie in the access to information not easily attainable by conventional epr, such as relaxation times, detailed hyperfine structure, and direct measurement of dipolar couplings. one can measure transient states in biomolecules that have spin labels to gain dynamical information or probe small molecule binding effects in protein sites. 

the choice between using cw and pulsed epr largely depends on specific research requirements, such as measurement precision and the type of information needed. the continuous advancement and innovation in epr spectrometer technology have enhanced the flexibility and precision of epr instruments, solidifying their role as indispensable tools in diverse fields like chemistry, materials science, and medicine, paving the way for further explorations and discoveries.


















the emergence of epr spectroscopy






discovered by yevgeny zavoisky in 1944, epr is similar to nmr but is based on exciting the spin of the electrons rather than the atomic nuclei. the frequencies of the electromagnetic signals in epr are considerably higher than in nmr, typically in the range of tens to hundreds of gigahertz (ghz), i.e. in the microwave band, therefore requiring microwave sources to excite the spins in the sample.
commercial epr instrumentation has evolved to keep pace with changing demands of new applications. bruker entered the high field epr market in the 1960s with the launch of the er420 epr spectrometer in collaboration with prof. weil, and quickly saw the need for a more intuitive, cost-effective and compact instrument – the first steps toward the significant development of an auto-tuning spectrometer for non-experts. in 1989 bruker introduced the world’s first fully computer-controlled epr spectrometer and, in 1992, the benchtop ems104 was launched to support industrial applications.
interest in developing a pulsed fourier transform (ft)-epr spectrometer was led by peter hoefer, developer of the hyscore experiment, who later went on to win the bruker prize at the royal society of chemistry in 2017.


latest developments in epr spectroscopy
the introduction of compact benchtop epr has led to its application in a wide range of applications in food, medical devices and pharma. bruker has also continued to innovate in high-end applications with introduction of the elexsys e780, the world's highest frequency commercial epr spectrometer at 263 ghz. bruker's technological advances also saw introduction of the rapid scan epr accessory, an innovation that provides excellent time resolution for epr (into the microsecond regime), improves signal-to noise, and decreases acquisition time.
a growing interest in materials and environmental science led to bruker’s development of high end epr instruments for environmental sample characterization, in which the high frequency helps resolve different species, and for application in energy storage applications of the future, including battery technology.


epr in application
epr is utilized by researchers worldwide across an extensive array of applications in biochemistry, biophysics, the development of new materials for electronics and energy storage, quantum information science, and environmental science.
in biochemistry, epr plays a pivotal role in elucidating the structure and quantification of small molecules by providing insights into free radical reactions and kinetics. on a broader molecular level, it assists in identifying metal centers, ligands, and substrate binding in macromolecules such as proteins, dna, and rna, while observing critical electron transfer pathways and amino acid-based radicals within proteins. in addition, through use of spin-labeling, pulse epr allows for probing inter-spin distances at separate sites in a biomolecule, providing insight into conformational changes and transient states in response to mechanistic events.
quantum information science has witnessed a resurgence in pulse epr technology due to the growing adoption of quantum mechanics by researchers in science and engineering. numerous types of materials are being explored as quantum bits, or qubits, which are the basic unit of information in qis. pulse epr has proven to be an essential technique in the study of molecular qubits based on electron spin due to direct access to spin properties, coherent control through microwave pulses, and even execution of quantum logic operations.
in the domain of electronics and energy storage, epr reveals valuable insights into material behaviors under electrochemical conditions. it is particularly vital in battery development for detecting free radicals that induce electrode material degradation during charge and discharge cycles, thus enabling the creation of more efficient electrode materials and enhancing battery stability and efficiency. defects in semiconductor materials have also
gained traction in the materials research landscape due to their application in areas such as optoelectronics, photovoltaics, quantum computing and sensing. identification of the defects, determination of the electronic
structure, monitoring catalytic processes, and more can be achieved using epr spectroscopy.
lastly, in environmental science, epr significantly contributes to sustainable energy development by characterizing systems with unpaired electrons, such as transition metal ions and radicals. this capability facilitates a deeper understanding of complex, multi-electron catalytic cycles, crucial for advancing future energy conversion technologies.
