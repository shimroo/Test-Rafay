efficiently reduces vibrationsvery reliable performancevery economicaleasy to manufacture and installcompact and light weightcan fit in small and narrow spacessuperior in energy dissipation among all damperscan easily be adjusted after use (in place)constant protection after repeated storms or seismic eventsa wide range of different design models & applicationsno maintenance, no fluids, no corrosive surfaces, no loss of friction over multiple earthquakes or storms.dampers are designed to have a lifetime that exceeds the life expectancy of the structure itself. for special harsh environments, dampers are protected by special paints, and galvanization and sometimes are made of stainless steel to meet the expected lifetime.damptech dampers are equally suited for new concrete, steel and timber frame structures as well as for retrofitting of existing structures.damptech a/s is a public limited company based in denmark with a number of international partners and distributors.for any inquiries please feel free to contact us either by mail or by phone.4j - rotational friction damper
