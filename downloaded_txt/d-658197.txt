for your question. â john 3:16 tells us,â "for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life." â the word "whosoever" sounds a little like our word, "whatever" that we say to mean anything or everything. â when the bible says "whosoever believeth" it means anybody or everybody that will believe. â god lets us choose if we want to believe in him or not. â first we need to understand that we all do wrong things, or sin, and that sin has to be punished or paid for. â jesus died on the cross to pay for our sin. â if we believe that he died for us we can tell him that we are sorry and ask him to forgive us of our sin. â when we choose to believe on him then he will live in our heart and give us a home in heaven. â please let me know if you have any more questions."do you mind sending me your devotions?" â anne"please send me the daily devotions. thank you and merry christmas" â brad peachey"please email me a daily devotion." â norma kerr"i just want to wish you a happy motherâs day. â your devotions are a blessing to me. â you are being used of our blessed lord!!! â again ..

for our sunday school students and came across your website. we decided to use the 'o come all ye faithful' and we managed to put a virtual version together. the kids loved taking part in the production and learning about the history of the various hymns. we had them memorize their lines, dress in costume, and recite their parts while their parents video taped them at home and then sent the tape into an organizer. it worked out splendidly. in between the different character parts, our church organist played and sang the carols and hymns. the entire production was sent out to members of our congregation and their families.thank you so much for posting your plays on your website and giving us a chance to organize a christmas pageant during the covid lockdown. we appreciate your kindness and generosity in making the plays available to anyone who needs them. everyone loved the concept and the history behind the various hymns, it was certainly an educational experience for the

â revonda q. skidmorethank you for sending me a message about our christmas plays. â i think the most simple one would be "go and tell". â it is the christmas story from luke 2. â when we did that one at church our young shepherds went down through the audience shaking hands and telling them about the christ child. â at the end some of our church members told about when they heard the gospel message. â it was a very special service. â it was a witness to the audience. â narrators read most of the lines so the actors and actresses don't have to remember many lines. â you could ask ahead of time to see if any would like to share their personal stories at the end. â it could be a very special time for them."christmas plays - i am interested in using material for our sunday school program.

â i would guess that we performed most of the plays in about 30 minutes. â it would depend on how many songs you used, and how quickly the characters moved on the scenes and said their lines. â you could sit and read through the play as it would be performed and maybe get an idea of how long it would take then add a few minutes for each song."daily devotional - please send" â ashley hyde"daily devotional - we have a friend? ? greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.? john 15:13" â coreyjesus christ is our friend! â we can't go to heaven or have eternal life if we have sin in our life, which we all do. â jesus is the son of god, and came down from heaven to give his life and die for our sins. â john 3:16 â for god so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 â for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.18 â he that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god.romans 3:23

enough people to perform the one i wrote last year, my son-in-law and daughter wrote another one with less people and did it last year. â i plan to retype those four and add them to my web site. â we

support.***some have requested emails but the devotions are not delivered. â if you don't receive the devotions, please send me another email with a corrected email address. â thanks!i have been reading in the book of exodus and i was drawn to the phrase, âwise heartedâ. i looked it up and those two words are used together seven times, beginning at exodus 28, and continuing through exodus 36. it is not used together like that anywhere else in the bible. it was used to describe men and women that were filled with the spirit of wisdom to do the work of the lord. during the month of february we often think of hearts as a sign of love. letâs look at some of the descriptions of hearts in the bible.âand thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom i have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.â (exodus 28:3)âand i, behold, i have given with him aholiab, the son of ahisamach, of the tribe of dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted i have put wisdom, that they may make all that i have commanded thee; â (exodus 31:6)âand every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the lord hath commanded;â (exodus 35:10)âand all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.â (exodus 35:25)âthen wrought bezaleel and aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the lord had commanded.â (exodus 36:1)âand moses called bezaleel and aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the lord had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:â (exodus 36:2)âand every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.â (exodus 36:8)are wewise hearted?
