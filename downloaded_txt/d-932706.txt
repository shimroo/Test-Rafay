fly fishing history documentary

				hey everyone, my name is diogo and i started a fly fishing documentary series!

the first episode introduces my friend peter and i, who will host colorful characters and fly fishing legends across the fly fishing landscape. for the second episode, we partnered with the catskill fly fishing center & museum to produce “streams of heritage” briefly goes over the history of the dry fly and fly fishing in the united states, which originated in the catskills. 

streams of heritage:  

we are just getting started! these subjects will be expanded upon and our next few episodes will focus on conservation, heritage and history. i’d be honored if you took 20 minutes to watch the latest episode. we will be bringing some exciting documentaries once a month starting in january, 2024!

hope you can tune in.

respectfully,

diogo

				isonychia bicolor is a species of mayfly commonly referred to as the "mahogany dun" or "slate drake" by anglers. here are some details and facts about this mayfly species:


habitat: they are found in many streams and rivers, especially in the eastern united states. these mayflies prefer clean, running water.
life cycle: like other mayflies, isonychia bicolor has a short adult lifespan, sometimes only lasting a few hours to a couple of days. the purpose of the adult stage is primarily reproduction. they undergo an incomplete metamorphosis, which includes the egg, nymph, subimago (dun), and imago (spinner) stages.
nymph stage: the nymphs are active swimmers and can be found in the fast currents of streams. they have a distinctive appearance with dark bodies and pale markings.
importance for anglers: this species is of particular interest to fly fishermen because trout and other fish often feed on the nymphs and emergers. as such, there are many fly patterns designed to imitate both...
			













great hi-res mayfly lifecycle video

				nice job with this one!
