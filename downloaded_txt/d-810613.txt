                from the hayloft
                
                    



by sarah roush
other than a short escape to attend college, sarah is a lifelong resident of pickaway county. a graduate of westfall high school and rio grande college, she often defends the legitimacy of those degrees while she is spouting off nonsense and pig-headed opinions. she advocates volunteerism and baking as a means to improving the world.
