weekend retreatswith victorian splendor



not just for paper craftersover the years, the focus of our scrapbooking retreat has evolved into more than just paper crafting.  we host all walks of women who create in many ways: digital design, card-making, beading, sewing, knit/crocheting, painting, board making, string art, and more! we’ve even had women who are part of a regular group, working on their master programs, join along and are able to get their work done while we take care of them! (a good massage goes a long way!) some gals come along to witness the crafting while simply getting their photos out of bags and boxes, and into photo albums!  “we at the paper doll house don’t prejudice against non paper crafters.” if you need a break and some craft therapy, come on over!!
