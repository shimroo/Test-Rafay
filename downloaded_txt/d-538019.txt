bail made simple faqs 







 
here is a list of popular questions asked by our customers - simply defined!

 











does everyone get a bond?once an individual is arrested and charged with a crime, chances are he or she will need a bail bondsman in order to gain freedom pending the outcome of the case. however, even with a bondsman on hand, not everyone can be released on bail. 







are bail bonds illegal in california?california's highest court has ruled that judges in the state will have to consider a suspect's ability to pay when they set bail, a major decision that essentially requires that those who can't afford bail be freed unless they are deemed to dangerous to be released awaiting trial. 











what are the 4 types of bail?
cash bail

collateral bail
or (own recognizance) bond
bail bondsman
 







what happens if you are not arraigned within 72 hours in california?if charges are not filed after the 72 hour period following your arrest, you will be released, but the state still reserves the right to file charges later, as long as they file charges within the statute of limitations. 











can you bail out a life sentence?the answer is no. once a person is in prison, that is it. there is no way to get out except by expiration of sentence, or by death. bail is used for staying out of jail while awaiting trial or sentencing for the crime. 







can a bondsman sue a cosigners / indemnitors?the bail bonds man can sue anyone who signed the documents and promised to pay if there is money due still. if you signed the documents, you agreed to whatever terms they stated.

i called amanda and she helped me find out about a friend. she helped answer my questions and gave me info i needed, even though she knew i was not going to use their services since the bail was too low. so helpful, i’m grateful this time i didn’t have to bail anyone. definitely look into acme & ask for amanda for all your business.. highly recommended. she’s so caring & kind & truly went out of her way for me. i haven’t had this response from any other bail bonds. thank you so much amanda if you happen to read this.

i hired acme bail two weeks ago to deal with a small misdemeanor charge on a friend. alfred and johnny were super helpful! they explained the whole process to me, charged part payment up front and remaining upon release, had me sign the documents online on docusign which was a lot more convenient that going in person, and were available the whole time. highly recommend them as they are very professional and polite.

a family member of mine got into a wrong time/wrong place situation. the whole ordeal was a mess but when it really comes down to it, this business knows what they’re doing. customer service was professional and very sincere. no one expects things like this to happen but acme is genuinely there for you.

a close friend of mine got arrested on the friday afternoon 2 weeks ago. having absolutely no clues of what i should do, i yelped and found acme trying to bail him out asap. acme was indeed a great help and i was glad i found this bail bond company. i contacted tom and he walked me through the whole process explaining what i didn’t understand. he was very enthusiastic and kept checking on the status. he sent sergio right away upon filling out the paperwork and processing my payment. my friend was released in a very short time. i truly recommend acme if you want the best result. thanks again.
