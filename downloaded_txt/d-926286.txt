welcome to americanos














americanos alumni
all alumni including members, staff, board member, and volunteers are welcome to join the americanos alumni.

my promise 
my promise and intent with this domain was to keep it open for all alumni.  i have been busy for the last six years with getting through college.  during that time the site has run into some maintenance issues that i will be fixing as i become aware of them.  my apologies for any problems in the past couple of years and send me a message to the webmaster if you read this.  i am interested in what has happened in the past five years.
