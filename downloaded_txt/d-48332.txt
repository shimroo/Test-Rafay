healing

bad teeth & gum disease is easy...
once you know how!





"in 30

years of

practicing dentistry, i've learned that there are some amazing

factors about getting cavities and having gum problems that the public

does not

know. 

suffering

cavities

and/or gum problems is a communicable disease... you catch it from

someone else by kissing, using contaminated eating or drinking

utensils, etc.

it

is as easy to

cure it as it is to catch it ...it's really

simple, you just

need to know what's happening and what to do about it.


the

real problem

was first identified and related to the public in a book published

in philadelphia in 1819... bacterial colonies being allowed to grow

out of hand, at the neck of the tooth.  it's like ring around

the collar... or "neck of the tooth disease".


when

people "get

with

it" by daily eliminating the cause... the

body heals

itself. 

the body regrows new

healthy gums, calcium and phosphorus are deposited in areas of soft

enamel and dentin, thus healing cavities. this is not so amazing to

the many folks who already know, that given the chance... the body

heals itself. this includes all tissues.

            cavities

can be made to heal, new bone

will grow around the necks of loose teeth, and brand new gums will

grow to replace diseased and receeded gums.


"someday,

hopefully

soon, the dental profession will become extinct... it will happen

as soon as the public learns about the cause and cure of cavities

and gum problems. no one i've ever known in over 30 years has not

wanted to solve their own problems... once

they know how."
