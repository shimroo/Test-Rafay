absolutely love sri lanka, fantastic variety of places visited. staff at every hotel have been polite, welcoming and attentive. having worked in travel for 15 years this is one of the best countries i have visited. 

maximum credit must go to kuruppu - he is a delight, polite, intelligent, knowledgeable, thoughtful & made our trip forgetful.
