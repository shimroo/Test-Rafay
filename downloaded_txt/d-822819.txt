unforgettable alaska glacier & wildlife tours | chugach adventures
anchorage – girdwood – portage – whittier
discover the best alaska adventure tours from girdwood, alaska’s premier mountain resort town, just 45 minutes from anchorage. our guided tours immerse you in the breathtaking landscapes of the chugach national forest—the second-largest national forest in the u.s.—and the kenai mountains–turnagain arm national heritage area, alaska’s only national heritage area celebrating the historic transportation corridor of the turnagain arm, chugach, and kenai mountains. we operate adventure tours via the alaska railroad from anchorage, girdwood, portage, and whittier.
chugach adventures was the original tour operator at spencer glacier, which partnered with the ak railroad’s glacier discovery train in 2001. before 2001, this train stayed in whittier for the day. chugach adventures has been the only guide team operating at spencer glacier over the past 5 years, from 2020-2024. owners ari & melanee stiassny and head guide illiya pekich have been adventuring with travelers worldwide at spencer glacier since 2006. spencer glacier is the largest remote & wild glacier seen from the alaska railroad, and joining a chugach adventures tour will highlight your alaska vacation.
get close to alaska’s iconic glaciers, wildlife, and scenic beauty through our exciting activities: rafting, kayaking, glacier treks, heli-hiking, and authentic salmon bakes. our most popular tours are at spencer glacier, accessible via the alaska railroad or by helicopter. spencer glacier lake offers a unique chance to kayak among icebergs and witness the glacier’s mesmerizing blue ice up close.
we pride ourselves on being locally owned and operated. we hire local guides to connect you with the authentic alaskan experience. whether you’re looking to explore alaska’s glaciated landscapes or planning a multi-day adventure, we’re here to make your trip memorable.

we are the only adventure company in alaska where all of our helicopter tours are private per booking party and we believe that this enables you to have your best day in the chugach!  lastly, none of our heli tours are short.  we believe that in order to connect to a place you need to spend time and adventure more, and all of our heli tours are full-day adventures.  we guarantee that you won’t have a more full heli adventure in all of alaska than with us in the chugach!  most of our guests tell us “it is their best adventure in alaska.”

the comet heli hiking & rafting trip is a classic.  i don’t know how any more kinds of adventure could be packed into a single day.  – greg brown  anchorage, alaska








what guests are saying


we went out for the 20 mile glacier heli camping trip. this was such an incredible experience. first we rode a helicopter into the glacier, an amazing hike at the glacier, then to sleep next to the glacier, and finally raft down the river the next morning. our guides sadie & robert were the best! they took care of everything and we had nothing to worry about. and our dinner at the glacier was one of the best experiences ever!
