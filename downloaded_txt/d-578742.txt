way down in the jungle room (2016)

by 1976, elvis presley's association with rca records had reached its 20-year mark. while this tenure resulted in some of the most important records in rock and roll history, presley now 40 years old and having spent much of his time working in recording studios was anxious for a change and eager for a less formal recording experience. 

seeking alternatives to maintain elvis' renewed showings on the country and adult contemporary charts, the decision was made to convert the "jungle room" a room in elvis' graceland estate, so named for its exotic décor into an informal studio. with the help of rca's mobile recording truck and longtime producer felton jarvis at the helm, presley would sporadically record in the "jungle room" throughout 1976.

elvis at stax: deluxe edition (3cd)(2013)

elvis at stax: deluxe editon chronicles the 40th anniversary of elvis' historic hometown studio sessions of july and december 1973. box set marks the first gathering of 28 masters and 27 outtakes in one comprehensive package.
