re-entry ♡august 2, 2022



hi i’m kay! you may know me from letters to cleo. or josie & the pussycats. if your kids watch doc mcstuffins or dc super hero girls or ada twist, scientist, maybe you hear my songs in your head all day.perhaps you know me from my advocacy work with songwriters of north america, hollering about songwriter rights and fair pay for music creators on streaming platforms.


whatever the reason that landed you on my website, i’m glad you’re here because i have news: my first solo record cherry marmalade turns 20 this year so i’m doing what any genx indie rocker would do: re-master that shit for a double album vinyl release and hitting the road!


xoxo – kay
