since 1927
connecting our community with the great outdoors.
our focus includes teaching members of the public how to competently, safely and responsibly go hiking, backpacking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, kayaking, bicycling and mountain climbing in the beautiful northwest mountains and forests and to encourage the citizens of the northwest to protect and preserve by all reasonable means the natural beauties of the mountains, forests, lakes, streams and other natural features of the northwest.
