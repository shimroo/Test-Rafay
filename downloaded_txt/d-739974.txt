best ever! as a berkeley resident for 50 years, i'm delighted to have ashkenaz as a cultural anchor through all our radical changes.  i count on them. the dancing just doesn't get any better and the music ... well, this place keeps the lifeblood music flowing.  brings people together like no place else.  i love this place!

francesca, ashkenaz community member





this place is just plain fun.  no more needs to be said.

doug m, ashkenaz community member





[ashkenaz] is space for everyday people to come together, express themselves, and dance in a non-competitive and positive environment. the community we have built here is like none other and the reason i am still teaching and performing.

i’ve been coming to ashkenaz since it opened, primarily to folk dance. my husband and i come to cajun and swing events. we actually met at ashkenaz at a cajun dance in 1994 and got engaged on the dance floor at a tom rigney christmas dance many years later! ashkenaz—a big part of my life

marilyn smith, ashkenaz community member





three years ago, if someone had told me that there is a place in berkeley where people aged 16 to 60 can party together without trouble i would never have believed it. then one saturday night a friend introduced me to ashkenaz...and lo and behold, here was a place where the rebellious youth could coexist with its elders and everyone could have a good time

ashkenaz community member





it truly is a gem of a place and so vital to the performing arts. there's no other place like it, and i am so grateful for it.
