cornell financial aid

















































































 financial aid










































a world-class, ivy league education within reach














ezra cornell’s founding vision — a university where “any person can find instruction in any study” — holds true today.








































more students than ever are able to graduate from cornell with little to no debt, and about half of all undergraduate students receive substantial financial aid in the form of cornell grants — this is free money that does not need to be repaid.
after factoring in funding awarded through grants and work-study programs, the cost of a cornell education may be less than you would expect. and, in many cases, families qualify for no or reduced loans, too.
we encourage you to explore all available aid options at cornell. our admissions and financial aid counselors are available to help you on your way to becoming part of the big red family.
