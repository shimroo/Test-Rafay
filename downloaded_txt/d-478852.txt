the food delivery market in japan was $3.8 billion in 2018. that’s not much compared to china or the u.s. because in japan, convenience stores and small restaurants are traditionally located within walking distance of home or work (only 1.3 percent of consumers order food delivery more than once a week). among the most frequently ordered dishes are pizza and pasta, sushi and ramen noodles. almost all chain restaurants have their own delivery service.
the vast majority of couriers deliver ordered food on motorcycles, often four-wheeled, with a removable rain cover and an order box on the trunk with the company logo. in addition, uber eats this year began creating a courier service of retirees – they walk, thus combining work and physical activity.
