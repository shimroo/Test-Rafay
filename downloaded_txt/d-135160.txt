traditio's fully traditional liturgical calendar (1950) for 2025 - 01/01/25
the liturgical calendar for the fully traditional roman rite (1950), from before the corruptions introduced in the 1950s that culminated in the new latin mess of 1962, follows the rubrics of pope pius x for the universal calendar of the church, and has been updated for 2024 by our traditional catholic volunteer scott, who kindly provides this service for the traditio network's readers.  this calendar is one of traditio's most popular features, as the fully traditional catholic calendar used by traditional catholic priests and laypeople is not available elsewhere on the internet.  for further information, click on the traditional liturgical calendar department.
liturgical calendar and ordo recommendations - 01/01/25
around this time of year people look for a printed traditional catholic calendar and ordo for the next year.  the calendar and ordo that the traditio fathers recommend are both based upon the most traditional form of the roman rite, before the untraditional "modernizations" of 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1962.  they are the ones that correspond to the fully traditional version of the missale romanum and the breviarium romanum.  immaculate heart of mary church publications produces the best and most complete full-color calendar, both in the calendar's daily boxes and in the religious art that accompanies each month.  it contains full information about all feasts, commemorations, votive masses, fasts and abstinence, ember days, and more.  in the back matter there is excellently-summarized information about indulgences, fast and abstinence, and other practical matters.  the st. lawrence press produces the best and most complete annual ordo available, the ordo recitandi officii divini sacrique peragendi [order of reciting the divine office and carrying out the sacred rite], entirely in latin and in the traditional form.  it contains detailed information about the mass and divine office that priests and the most advanced laypeople use, much more complete in its detail than any calendar can give.  additional pages give the rubrics for solemn votive masses, conventual masses, and private votive masses and the text for the movable feasts sung on epiphany.  for further information, click on the traditio network's traditional liturgical calendar department.

read today's daily commentaries from the traditio fathers
where every day the traditio fathers provide hard-hitting commentaries on church news and readers' questions from an independent traditional catholic perspective.  the fathers' unique, provocative, often bitingly satirical commentary (after the roman satirist juvenal, st. thomas more and other saints of the church) is based upon over half a century's personal observation of the church, both pre- and post-vatican ii.
