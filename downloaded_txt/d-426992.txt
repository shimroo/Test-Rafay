patient testimonials

my mammo technologist was outstanding, not just at her job but at putting me at ease.  she shows nothing but concern & compassion for patients.

very pleasant experience—the lady at check-in and the technician were great!–and to think i was apprehensive about coming!!!

thank you ladies for making me feel so comfortable! it’s very appreciated! such a friendly staff & technicians are always professional and kind.  i’ve been to delaney many times & always been a great experience, as far as x-ray & mammograms go :)

no one wants a ct scan but my tech made it a very positive experience.  she is competent, easy to talk to and did an amazing job!  thanks!!
