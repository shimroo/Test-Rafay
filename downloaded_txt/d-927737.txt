cascade effect





photo by peter k. kloeppel, ca 1977it started out as just digging around for a few snaps i could use as subject matter for my inktober sketches, which led to my being handed a stack of barn photos, followed by… the family albums [dramatic music, please] that pop had tucked away, all desperately in need of digital preservation. while not quite monumental, scanning pop's photos is a rather daunting task. his barn prints (just over 100 of them) are now digitized and available to view via flickr, here. now, on to the next album: the negatives. unsurprisingly, many have suffered fading and other deterioration due to their age, so it will take some time for me to make those presentable via photoshop elements.  as i go, i will share some of them here, from time to time, and will be making the bulk of the photos available for viewing in a new album, once again, at flickr. photo by peter k. kloeppel, ca 1977

the barn dance begins





i have been blessed with the task of scanning/editing/digitizing my parents' collections of snapshots. bearing in mind that they were both born amid the great depression, and that pop took more than just the usual "these are my kids on vacation" shots, this means they've amassed a rather substantial pile of images with which i will be working. and, because of the sheer number of photos he's handed me, my editing will initially be fairly basic (e.g., color correction, haze reduction, and contrast adjustment – i can leave scratches and flecks for later).for now, i'm going through the past 2 1/2 decades' worth of his interest in documenting the barns of our region. some of the structures he's photographed, being already roughly a century old and in disuse, no longer stand (thereby reinforcing his reasons for the visual archive).the majority of his photos were taken in warren county, illinois, with occasional jaunts into the surrounding counties. it's our own cozy corner of forgottonia, and worthy of sharing with anyone who enjoys a bit of 'murica, so i aim to post some of my favorites here, as i go through the stacks.we hope you appreciate it.if you'd like to see more of pop's pix (with whatever information pop included about location/camera settings, etc.), you can check out our album on flickr.

enjoy a moment of kitties and peanut butter…





 odin and idun get regular afternoon treats... usually a spoon dipped in peanut butter.they seem to have a strong preference for the unadulterated organic stuff from aldi. i can't blame them. stupid "organic" label or not, it's pretty good peanut butter. but then, most of what we get from aldi is darned tasty.(in case something goes wonky with the video, here's a direct link to it)

 words, words, words…





following up on my last post about what you can't play in the pch word find game, i have collected a further few verboten terms. again, i'm assuming that most of these are excluded because whoever created the game didn't have a full-sized dictionary on hand, and so only allowed "common use" terms. yeh, i know some of my choices are downright shakespearean in their age, but they're still included in ye olde merriam-webster (i didn't bother do dredge up my oed unabridged for the purpose. not yet, anyway). also, in most cases, they haven't been overly particular about whether one uses king's english or american english spelling for most. except for one example.that, and they won't permit anything which might make someone think of a double entendre.so, in addition to the previous list, here are a few more words which are not recognized as… well, you know… actual words:dreck, prod, terran, miso, oast, scum souse, henge, glom, potty, grail, teat, bonk, hemp, moolah, gesso, scat, nude, tung, soddy, muff, spook, lust, lusty, ratel, nonce, organ, orgy, ninny, grift, snog, fanny, widget, realise, strip, laic, hump, hussy, shoah, nock, stoma, tret, scry, yenta, vixen, yar, spooky, eden, kited, nerts, sperm, frow, dink, tatty, prig, toff, dyne, tatar, reseat, birdy, pika, gam(s), grue, ovine, cubby, orgasm, reave, grope, hinny, scaler, snitty, teddy, chad, kill, feal, luge, dinge, nitty, canner, conning, hooch, chink, monad, eggy, kiva.i'm going to keep hunting for more no-nos, because it's actually more fun to learn what you're not supposed to say than it is to accumulate points.

you can't play that!





 for a few weeks, now, i've opted to waste my time playing an online word-finding game comparable to boggle™. the general idea was to keep my vocabulary working for me, even when i was mostly vegging out at the end of hard work in a hot garden. well, that was the idea, anyway. it feels more like i'm making my vocabulary work against me. this game app (at the pch website) doesn't recognize a lot of words that are not only used regularly by me, but can be found in any basic dictionary. i mean, sure, i'll dig out the oxford unabridged for some crossword puzzles, but for a 60-second word search, the simpler the better. so imagine my surprise to discover that words like "dirty" and "pawn" were rejected. indeed, so many simple words weren't cleared for score that, after a week or so, i started writing down as many failures as i could recall, at the end of each game. so far, aside from the above terribly dirty words i mentioned above, my list includes these: loin, black tart, hoe, daw, wad, riant, god, hell, erect, dike (yes, the thing that holds back water, not the pejorative for a "masculine lesbian"), ousel, ait, weed, haj, ted, raj, gay, darn (my socks resent this rejection), bong, spline, thug, pot, holt, womb, croft, zen, kill, boob, linch, cock, toots, vail, crack, mage, gam, fanny, nard, wye, gash, ninny, queer, raree, naked, pansy, shag, rump, hump, barm, eft, reft, racy, spade, slag, shako, prod, nonce, nene, fava, chaw, prat, stoa, gest, slub, turd (okay it's gross, but it's still a word), bonk, simp, cavy, twee, rota, coir, scut, scud, snew, crabs (but the singular is accepted), kern, golemi acknowledge that some of these words might be viewed as somewhat archaic, and a few are – technically – variants of more commonly accepted spellings. nonetheless… seriously? i can't refer to the apple tart i ate after i used the weed eater to clear a crack in the sidewalk? or the crabs i chased across the shag rug when they cut their way through a coir-lined container, that then i caught and cooked in the big stock pot? if i had a proper desk, i'd be beating my head against it right now.

causing a stir in the garden: plant markers on a budget





 (cross-posted from our family blog, sketch stitch stretch)stick with me, kid. a week or so ago, my cousin posted a set of photos on her social media page, showing off her brilliant work on a packet of plant markers for a friend. she took paint stirring sticks, wrote on them with a wood burner, and then trimmed them with some nice beads and twine:my cousin is a lot more artisticallydetail-oriented than i am. and her handis steadier.naturally, i felt the need to steal her idea (albeit with my own variations, to meet my peculiar preferences). it took me a few tries before i settled on the format i liked, and now i'm better than halfway through the list of the perennial plants requiring identification. ours is a big garden.at any rate, some paint stores will give away a stirring stick or two, so if you shop around, you can do this on the super cheap, but i ordered a packet of 100 from one of those giant online retailers who shall remain nameless, and the sticks cost an average of 25¢. it also helps to already have a wood-burning tool on hand, but if you don't have one, and you think you might take the craft up as a hobby, these are not particularly expensive gadgets, and you don't need a lot of added doodads to make it a costly addiction... unless you decide you need to start working on specialty wood, or suddenly "need" a laser cutter/burner.a pencil and eraser, also, are useful for marking guide lines and text. don't bankrupt yourself on high-end toys. just grab what you have on hand and have some fun.color enhanced for clarity. really. it's just pencil markings.i admit it. i'm a nerd. i need to include basic linnaean taxonomy.and i did this on both sides of each stick.because.for the record, my wood burning tool is a multi-tool, for soldering, stencil-cutting, and wood-burning. i bought it several years ago at my all-time favorite place to shop, and this is the first time i've applied it to wood. it's a learning process for me, too. and i may also dig out an old can of spar varnish from the basement & give these puppies a coat of it, for durability out there in the elements. we'll see.

a higher purpose





 i know, it's a long quote to be stuck in as though it's a meme, 
but it's a topic i've discussed with others more than a few times, over 
the past few years (including just yesterday, with me muddah). i'm an outsider to religion in general, having been raised agnostic. still, over the years, i've begun to recognize there are logical benefits which come of those religions in widespread practice today. this is what i've gleaned, so far: most modern religions have been built on the idea that man can and must rise above his animal nature, and the structures of those faiths provide guidelines for doing this. a successful religion persuades entire societies to become forward-thinking and civilized (what shapiro and others will call "godly"), creating advantage for both the individual and the collective – be it family, church, community, tribe, or nation. the most powerful message in all of these religions is "control your impulses." acting without thinking can have dire consequences – whether it's the toddler grasping for something on a hot stove, or the man who seduces his friend's wife. the child risks deadly burns, and the man – at best – ends up with a woman he knows can not be trusted, and loses his friend in the process. at worst… we've all seen the headlines.  codes of conduct such as the ten commandments benefit individuals even more than they do the group, eliminating "blowback" or cascading risks for the person who chooses to live by the code, greasing the gears of society. but more importantly, they provide a means for learning to respect oneself. they are goalposts, exercises in self-improvement (toward enlightenment or godliness); with each goal met, strength deepens and confidence grows. spiritually strong individuals make strong societies. persons who live beyond the moment are able – and often eager – to lift up others who are less capable, who, in turn, help the weaker still and (as has often been said), a rising tide lifts all boats. any set of beliefs which fails to encourage thoughtfulness and restraint must therefore fail human civilization, and deserves to be relegated to the ash heap of history, lest humanity end up there instead.
