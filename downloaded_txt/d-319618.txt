                    after four long years, harrowing animal cruelty case ends
                    



bysteven martinez


after four years of litigation, michelle baldwin, a former west manheim township resident, was convicted on monday, december 9, for animal cruelty, neglect, and aggravated assault. her sentencing marks the end of a tragic case of abuse that left more than 20 animals in dire conditions—and offers a hopeful new beginning for their futures.

                    spay/neuter clinic updates pricing effective january 2025
                    



bykristen dempwolf


due to rising costs, we will be instituting price changes on our spay and neuter services for owned pets and community cats, effective january 1, 2025.
we have made every effort to keep our services low-cost and accessible to those who need them. affordable spay/neuter surgeries, microchipping, and vaccinations are critical community services that we want all york county animals to benefit from.
