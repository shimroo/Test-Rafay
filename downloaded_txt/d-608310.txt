like paper, plastics, and glass, biosolids (treated sewage sludge) and other organic residuals ("organics") were once considered "wastes" – too challenging to recycle.  yet they contain abundant nutrients and organic matter that benefit soils.  and they generate renewable energy.  properly treated, tested, and managed, biosolids and other organics enhance the environment, help farmers and other landowners, and serve the communities that generate and receive them.  today, they are in high demand as tools for sustainability!see…from our friends at the northeast recycling council:  funding opportunities for organic & compost related businesses from state and federal agencies in the northeast (february 2021)exciting recycling projects around north america.
