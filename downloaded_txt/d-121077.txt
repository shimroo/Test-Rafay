william h. turner and david h. turner, father and son, share a talent of capturing the beauty and motion of wildlife in bronze. their native land, the eastern shore of virginia, a peninsula surrounded by the chesapeake bay and atlantic ocean, is rich in wildlife and is a continuous source of inspiration for their work. 
established in 1983, turner sculpture, near onley, va serves as their studios, foundry and gallery, where most of their work is displayed. to date they have created more than 700 different limited edition bronzes and more than 100 large public commissions found throughout the united states. 
a large selection of their limited edition bronzes are available for purchase online. our gallery on the eastern shore of virginia is open monday through sunday from 9 am. to 5 pm., and you can reach us by phone or e-mail. 
located just south of onancock, the #6 coolest small town in america, according to budget travel magazine.
