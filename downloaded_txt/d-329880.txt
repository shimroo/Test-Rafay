canadian biodiversity information facility (cbif)










in support of the global biodiversity information facility (gbif), canada helped pioneer new ways to improve the organization, exchange, correlation, and availability of primary data on biological species of interest to canadians. by enhancing access to these data, the canadian biodiversity information facility (cbif) provided a valuable resource which supported a wide range of social and economic decisions including efforts to conserve our biodiversity in healthy ecosystems, use our biological resources in sustainable ways, and monitor and control pests and diseases.
cbif and its website (https://www.cbif.gc.ca) were decommissioned in 2021. similar resources can be found online from gbif which hosts the species access network datasets previously found on cbif as well as an itis (integrated taxonomic information system) taxonomy search tool available in french and english. the cbif species bank resources (butterflies of canada, brassicaceae of canada, canadian poisonous plants information system, diversity of oribatida in canada, ground beetles of canada and moths of canada) are not available at this time.
