wcc calls on president trump to follow international law for a just peace in gaza












 — feb. 5, 20255 févr. 2025
world council of churches (wcc) general secretary rev. prof. dr jerry pillay has described the proposal of us president trump as “tantamount to proposing full-scale ethnic cleansing and neo-colonization of the homeland of the 2 million palestinians of gaza.”
pillay noted that the proposal violates every applicable principle of international humanitarian and human rights law, flouts decades of efforts by the international community – including by the usa – for a just and sustainable peace for the peoples of the region, and would if implemented constitute multiple international crimes of the most serious kind. “the standing of the united states of america as a responsible member of the international community has been gravely diminished by the proposal itself, not to speak of any actual implementation thereof,” pillay said. 
in a joint press conference with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on 4 february, president trump said the united states “will take over” the gaza strip — possibly with the help of american troops — while the palestinians who live there should leave. “the us will take over the gaza strip and we will do a job with it too,” said president trump. “we’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings,” he said, describing his vision for the area as a new “riviera.” … read more » … lire la suite »





canada must withdraw from safe third country agreement with the united states












 — feb. 4, 20254 févr. 2025
canada must urgently withdraw from the safe third country agreement (stca) given the dire situation facing refugees in the united states, the canadian council for refugees and amnesty international canada said today.
the safe third country agreement between canada and the united states bars most people crossing into canada via the united states from seeking refugee protection in canada. under the agreement – which is premised on the notion that both countries reliably respect people’s right to seek asylum – people entering canada via the u.s. to make a refugee claim here are usually turned back at the border.
“president trump’s extreme anti-immigrant and anti-asylum orders are designed to instill fear and make the u.s dangerously more unsafe for those seeking protection,” said ketty nivyabandi, secretary general of amnesty international canada’s english-speaking section. “canada’s assertion that the united states remains a safe country for refugees under the trump administration is a cruel irony to those fleeing persecution today. it must be urgently rescinded, and tariffs threats must not blur the plight of those at immediate risk.” … read more » … lire la suite »





church leaders call for permanent ceasefire












 — feb. 4, 20254 févr. 2025
“a permanent ceasefire would cease hostilities, release all remaining hostages, liberate thousands of palestinian prisoners detained without cause or charge, ensure continuing and increasing humanitarian aid in all forms — medical, food and psychological — and result in the withdrawal of occupying forces,” write anglican, lutheran, presbyterian and united church leaders. … read more » … lire la suite »





de margerie series for christian reconciliation and unity continues












 — jan. 24, 202524 janv. 2025
the late fr. bernard de margerie was remembered during the 2025 de margerie series for christian reconciliation and unity — the 12th year of the series and the first to be held since his death in march 2024.
“we continue this series in his memory, and, with his encouragement, to continue to be agents of christian reconciliation and unity,” said nicholas jesson, who helped establish the series in 2012 while serving as ecumenical officer for the roman catholic diocese of saskatoon, and who now serves in ecumenical and interfaith relations for the archdiocese of regina.
“no doubt fr. bernard is listening tonight, and joining us in prayer that all may be one in christ so that the world may believe (john 17:21),” said jesson in a poignant introduction at the start of the 2025 series jan. 22 in saskatoon. … read more » … lire la suite »

 — jan. 24, 202524 janv. 2025
pope francis has named indian cardinal george j. koovakad to be the new prefect of the dicastery for interreligious dialogue.
the 51-year-old, who received his red hat from the pope in december, also will continue to be responsible for organizing papal trips abroad, vatican news reported jan. 24, the day his appointment was announced.
the dicastery is responsible for dialogue with muslims, buddhists, hindus, sikhs and members of other world religions.
“the dicastery works to ensure that dialogue with the followers of other religions takes place in an appropriate way, with an attitude of listening, esteem and respect,” according to the apostolic constitution governing the roman curia. … read more » … lire la suite »





prairie centre for ecumenism’s 40th anniversary












 — jan. 21, 202521 janv. 2025
fond memories of early-morning worship services at different saskatoon churches during the annual week of prayer for christian unity were shared at a recent 40th anniversary celebration for the prairie centre for ecumenism, founded in saskatoon in 1984.
at the 40th anniversary celebration nov. 22, 2024, prairie centre for ecumenism board chair mary nordick pointed to the early-morning gatherings on cold and dark prairie mornings in january as times filled with the warmth of fellowship and the joy of re-connecting with friends from other christian traditions.
rev. dr. sandra beardsall – a united church minister and professor emeritus of church history and ecumenics who has been involved in the prairie centre for ecumenism (pce) in various ways over the past 25 years — also shared memories of those early morning gatherings.
“i think those will stay with me all my life,” she said. “i would get up and say ‘what am i doing? it is minus 30!’ and then there would be this beautiful prayer service, and breakfast, and friends … there is something so precious about that praying together early, early in the morning.” … read more » … lire la suite »





bishop voices ‘sadness’ at continuing eucharistic separation












 — jan. 21, 202521 janv. 2025
the fact that anglicans and catholics are not able to receive the eucharist together yet is a matter of sadness,” the bishop of ossory niall coll said at the start of the week of prayer for christian unity.
in his homily at an anglican eucharist in st canice’s cathedral, kilkenny last weekend, bishop coll said the church of ireland liturgy, as well as his attendance at a meeting of the international anglican-roman catholic commission for unity and mission last year, were the “most moving experiences” of spiritual communion for him.
he told the congregation he hoped they would be “a further impetus to continue our ecumenical journey together so that we might one day break bread together around the same altar”. … read more » … lire la suite »





ecumenism’s new horizon












 — jan. 17, 202517 janv. 2025
while a new perspective in the goal of christian unity that embraces diversity has emerged in recent years, more work is needed to include the burgeoning non-denominational churches.
sceptics often ask whether a century of ecumenical activity has brought christians any closer to the goal of full visible unity. but in recent years the traditional goal of ecumenism has been reframed. what is now hoped for might be better described as “full communion in continuing real diversity”.
this new horizon has come about through multiple experiences of what the theologians involved in ecumenical work call “transformative ecclesial learning”. this is the modus operandi of “receptive ecumenism” – another technical term for an initiative conceived more than 20 years ago by paul d. murray of the university of durham and developed with colleagues around the world. its starting point for each tradition, institution and person is to ask, “what can we learn, or receive, with integrity from our various others in order to facilitate our own growth together into deepened communion?” focused initially on establishing a new approach for the roman catholic church in its ecumenical relationships, receptive ecumenism has evolved in a host of christian denominations as well as in various countries and cultures around the world. … read more » … lire la suite »





charitable status risks even with prorogation












 — jan. 17, 202517 janv. 2025
the resignation of prime minister justin trudeau as liberal party leader and the prorogation of parliament may have postponed a non-confidence vote and an immediate election, but has not averted the risk of certain organizations losing their charitable status on the basis of religious belief or disagreement with government policy, say experts speaking on behalf of stakeholders.
the finance committee of the house of commons has tabled a report which, if enshrined in law, could destabilize the entire charitable sector, according to legal experts of two major organizations.
the controversial recommendations from the committee are:

anti-abortion organizations should no longer be accorded charitable status;
the income tax act should be amended to provide a definition of a charity which would remove the privileged status of “advancement of religion” as a charitable purpose.

“the issue is an important one,” deina warren, director of legal affairs with the canadian centre for christian charities (cccc), told the catholic register. “the recommendation has been formally made by a house committee and ought to be officially retracted, and advancing of religion as a charitable purpose should be positively affirmed by the government.” … read more » … lire la suite »
