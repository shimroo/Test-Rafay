cape cod’s best ice cream since 1934



* please note: we are currently closed while we do maintenance on our building. we hope to be open on weekends again soon! follow our social media for the latest. thanks for your patience!*

four seas ice cream has been serving the best ice cream on cape cod since 1934. we’re not just the oldest ice cream shop on cape cod, we’re the oldest ice cream shop in massachusetts. if you’re looking for old cape cod, you’ll find it here, under our iconic neon sign.
come to four seas for old-fashioned, home-made ice cream. we’re especially known for our fruit flavors, including fresh strawberry and fresh peach (only made in season, of course) and for classic new england flavors like penuche pecan. what is penuche? it’s brown sugar fudge, made from a very old recipe, and it’s delicious. if you’re looking for something to do on cape cod with your family, a visit to four seas is a must. generations of locals and vacationers can’t be wrong.
