welcome!


hard to believe this is now one of the oldest sites on the web – – been here since august 1, 1996!
what follows on these pages is more than a half-century of television single dads – – every show from the earliest days of broadcasting to modern streaming services featuring the joys and tribulations of solo fatherhood. 
a big section of the original site had dozens of interviews with actors and showrunners from many series. i’m still converting those pages to this newer format. i appreciate your patience with the ongoing renovation.
thanks for surfing the site – – enjoy!
