community forum on neighborhood zoning issues - you will behave!





missive from the city:just a reminder, that the community residential zoning forum is scheduled for 6:00 – 8:00 pm on wednesday, march 7, in the atrium of the wellington webb municipal office building, at 201 west colfax avenue.  please note the forum is designed to address city-wide residential issues and will not be a forum on individual zoning applications.   sponsors of the forum include the zoning code task force, the denver board of realtors, the metro denver homebuilders association and inter-neighborhood cooperation.  the forum will begin with an introduction by cpd manager, peter park, and then proceed through 3 rounds of broadly based questions to a panel of representatives from the sponsoring groups.  the questions will address current zoning policy, the zoning process and its effects and next steps in the zoning code update.    we hope to see you there.methinks the message here is that you crazy-assed, wild-eyed neighborhood activists dare not disturb the scripted agenda. you will sit quietly and your questions will address what the city intends them to address. got it!

just askin' - community forum on neighborhood development in established neighborhoods





the community forum on neighborhood development in established neighborhoods is, as noted in prior posts, this wednesday, from 6p.m. to 8p.m. in the atrium (first floor) of the webb building at 201 w. colfax.interestingly, it appears the home page of the city's internet site, as well as the  mayor's page  contain no reference to this important forum. i note that councilman rick garcia's site (district 1, which includes west highlands and sloan's lake) finally made note of the event, both on his home page and in his march newsletter under "upcoming events." unfortunately, garcia's information does not provide the revised meeting location from the fourth floor to the atrium of the webb building.given the immense interest in this forum, why was it not showcased in the mayor's pages?just askin'.(methinks those pain-in-the-ass citizen activists who have a very personal stake in the maintenance of the "character" of their neighborhoods are, for the hickies, yes, a real pain-in-the-ass!)

community forum on residential development - location change





because of the enormous interest in the city's community forum on residential development (march 7th, 6-8 p.m.), the location necessarily had to be changed to a large space in the webb building, per a piece in the rocky mountain news:by rocky mountain newsmarch 1, 2007a community forum march 7 to discuss residential development in denver has been moved to the atrium of the wellington e. webb municipal office building to accommodate the large crowd.the move comes after residents were put on a waiting list and told they might not be able to attend because of a lack of space."what kind of public 'community forum' is it that cannot accommodate the public?" larry ambrose, president of the sloan's neighborhood association, wrote in an e-mail to the city obtained by the rocky mountain news.julius zsako, spokesman for the city's community planning and development department, said today that the atrium can hold "many hundreds of people."however, the city is still asking people who want to attend to rsvp by contacting valentina guereca at 720-865-3223 or via e-mail at valentina.guereca@ ci.denver.co.us by friday. the forum will be held from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the webb building, 201 w. colfax ave.
