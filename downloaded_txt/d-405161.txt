texas forest trail region




texas forest trail region

 it’s where history and culture come naturally. texas heritage is everywhere – from historic downtowns with unique shops, restored victorian buildings, museums, and monuments to state historic sites, railroads, sawmill towns, and oil boomtowns.






 







the forest trail region was the “gateway to texas” for caddo indians, spanish and french explorers, anglo pioneers, european immigrants, and enslaved and freed african americans.shadows of early caddo and spanish occupation linger, and the stories of texas’ emergence from a wilderness to a great state unfold in the region’s numerous towns, many among the state’s oldest.the region encompasses great stories of boom and bust in oil and timber, the early rebellion leading to the texas revolution, the el camino real de los tejas, and the mystery and manners you’d expect from the lush, sweet spot between the old south and the wild west.

within our 35 counties, we have hundreds of amazing sites to visit!
