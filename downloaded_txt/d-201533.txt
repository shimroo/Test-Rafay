the history of new zealand : 
              a brief overview of the pre-historic, colonial and modern periods.




n 
              ew zealand's colourful history commences from the time when the 
              rangitata land mass separates from the ancient super continent of 
              gondwana 
              80 million years ago, evolving over time to become modern new zealand. 
            
 




as polynesians 
              discover and settle new zealand, thought to be sometime between 
              950 and 1130 ad, the moriori 
              people are settling, possibly around the same time, the chatham 
              islands, or rekohu, a small group of islands off the coast of new 
              zealand.
in 1642 the first of the european 
              explorers, abel janszoon tasman from holland, sails into new 
              zealand waters. the first encounter between māori and european 
              is violent, leading to bloodshed. after partly charting the coastline, 
              tasman leaves new zealand without ever having had the occasion to 
              set foot ashore. 
 





one hundred years pass 
              by before the next europeans arrive. in 1769 james cook, british 
              explorer, and jean françois marie de surville, commander 
              of a french trading ship, both arrive by coincidence in new zealand 
              waters at the same time. neither ship ever sights the other.
from the late 1790's on, whalers, traders and missionaries 
              arrive, establishing settlements mainly along the far northern coast 
              of new zealand.
wars and conflicts between māori (indigenous 
              people of new zealand) tribes were always constant, and weapons 
              used until now were spears or clubs. the arrival of traders leads 
              to a flourishing musket trade with local māori, who rapidly 
              foresee the advantages of overcoming enemy tribes with this deadly 
              new weapon. the devastating period known as the inter tribal musket 
              wars commences. 
rumours of french 
              plans for the colonisation of the south island help hasten british 
              action to annexe, and then colonise new zealand. a number of māori 
              chiefs sign a treaty with the british on 6th february 1840, to be 
              known as the 
              treaty of waitangi. the subsequent influx of european settlers 
              leads to the turbulent period of the new 
              zealand wars, also known as the land wars, which last for over 
              twenty years. 
hostilities between māori and european commence 
              in 1845. by 1870 the british government withdraws the last of its 
              imperial troops from new zealand, not wishing to invest any further 
              in a costly overseas war which was likely to continue indefinitely. 
            
the māori, although inferior in number, proves 
              a formidable foe.
the battle of 
              gate pa is possibly the battle which made the greatest impact 
              in the history of the new zealand wars. 
 


hongi 
              hika, warrior chief of the nga puhi tribe; te 
              rauparaha, also known as "the napoleon of the south - warrior 
              chief of the ngati toa tribe; te 
              kooti, resistant, prophet, and founder of the ringatu church; 
              michael 
              joseph savage, early innovative prime minister are but a few, 
              māori and european, who have left their mark on the history 
              of new zealand.
new 
              zealand today is an independent nation within the british commonwealth. 
              the british monarch, although constitutional head of state, plays 
              no active role in the administration of new zealand's government. 
            
the capital city is wellington, although the beautiful 
              city of auckland is the largest on the north island.
