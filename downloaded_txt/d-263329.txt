testimonials










anne s.
"kasara literally changed my life. i had allergies so bad that i was getting shots 3 times a week, on 60 mil of benadryl daily and the allergist said all i could do was to take more benadryl. once i started seeking kasara's help, within 6 months, i was off the shots and benadryl. she had me take herbal antihistamines. soon i was off those also. she is knowledgeable and caring. when i refer someone to her, i know they will be in good hands.”






tara c.
"my son and i have been seeing kasara for three years and we are both off prescription drugs and healthier. i was able to go off antidepressants and thyroid medicines, and my son, who is add, was able to go off his medicine. kasara does a good job. we don’t get sick as often and when we do we recover more quickly.”






yolanda f.
“both my mom and i have been on an antifungal diet and herbal program for two years, we’ve lost about 30lbs each, our systems are cleansed and our energy is up. my mom's rosacea has cleared up and i don't have chronic strep throat infections anymore.”






anat b. - writer
“meeting kasara was transformative point in my life. she nailed my problem within a few seconds, which was a huge relief, coming after two years of searching for answers. many years after our initial meeting, i still use the knowledge she had taught me to maintain my wellbeing.”






susan s.
20 years ago, during my first conversation with kasara, she saw the imbalance in my body via my eyes and told me i was headed toward cancer. i hadn't told her i had recurrent melanoma. she empowered me to cleanse, rebuild and repair my body. my diet got an overhaul to replace missing nutrients, and the most important part was letting go of the emotional baggage i had been carrying for so many years. any time i feel yucky, i still call kasara!






paul k.
kasara is a brilliant herbalist! the number of prescriptions has decreased drastically. and now i rarely go to the doctor for any sickness. she taught me how to muscle test myself and educated me on the best herbs for my body to help keep my health on track. she has been a blessing in my life. she is a very wise woman.

"the truth about our childhood is stored up in our body, and although we can repress it, we can never alter it. our intellect can be deceived, our feelings manipulated, our perceptions confused, and our body tricked with medication. but some day the body will present its bill, for it is as incorruptible as a child who, still whole in spirit, it will accept no compromises or excuses, and it will not stop tormenting us until we stop evading the truth."~alice miller
