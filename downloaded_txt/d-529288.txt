	 cover of the week: matt nathanson does james
	 
    


matt nathanson has commented during performances on the interesting twist of fate that resulted in his cover of this james classic becoming his best-known "original". obviously, fans of nathanson's love his actual originals, but this tune does seem to generate a lot of crowd enthusiasm at live shows. some covers seem to suit an artist better than others, and this one fits easily in nathanson's oeuvre.matt nathanson - "laid"buy matt nathanson's music here.-------------------------------------------check out previous cover of the week posts by clicking the "cover of the week" label below and the link on the right side of the page under "return to oblivion".labels: cover of the week, matt nathanson

this ryan adams track was released in mp3 format as part of the elizabethtown - songs for the ride home (itunes exclusive) digital ep and on cd as part of the elizabethtown soundtrack vol 2. it's a short, contemplative acoustic track - definitely good stuff, especially if you're an adams fan.ryan adams - "words"buy ryan adams music here.-------------------------------------------check out the archived b-side of the week posts by clicking the label "b-side of the week" below and the link on the right side of the page under 'return to oblivion'.labels: b-side of the week, ryan adams

	 cover of the week: magnet & gemma hayes do dylan
	 
    


any recording that features gemma hayes will eventually find its way into my cd collection, and this cover of bob dylan's "lay lady lay" is no exception. the tune was featured in the remake of the film mr. and mrs. smith starring brad pitt and angelina jolie. magnet's arrangement and vocals are fine and all, but at 1:17 when ms. hayes' delicious voice kicks in the song really takes off.magnet & gemma hayes - "lay lady lay"buy the single here.-------------------------------------------check out previous cover of the week posts by clicking the "cover of the week" label below and the link on the right side of the page under "return to oblivion".labels: cover of the week, gemma hayes, magnet

	 b-side of the week: ash
	 
    


"burn baby burn" was one of ash's big hits off of 2001's free all angels. this acoustic rendition of the song appeared on a bonus disc included with the european tour edition of the record. it's loaded with sugary-sweet pop rockin' goodness. guitarist charlotte hatherley, who's since left the band to pursue solo ambitions, has a great little tremolo-picked guitar solo on the track too.ash - "burn baby burn (acoustic)"buy ash's music here.-------------------------------------------check out the archived b-side of the week posts by clicking the label "b-side of the week" below and the link on the right side of the page under 'return to oblivion'.labels: ash, b-side of the week

this non-album track from the soundtrack of the movie paris, je t'aime was composed by elizabeth anaïs and christophe montieux and performed by leslie feist. it immediately grabbed my attention when it played toward the end of the film, and i don't believe it appears on any other cd as of yet.feist - "we're all in the dance"buy feist's music here.-------------------------------------------check out the archived b-side of the week posts by clicking the label "b-side of the week" below and the link on the right side of the page under 'return to oblivion'.labels: b-side of the week, feist

a friend had this cover by dar williams on some random mix that she played for me, and i thought it was the perfect kind of track for this weekly post. floyd fans out there may cry foul at anyone covering one of their favorite band's tunes, but i don't hold the band in quite such a reverent place.dar williams - "comfortably numb"buy dar williams' music here.-------------------------------------------check out previous cover of the week posts by clicking the "cover of the week" label below and the link on the right side of the page under "return to oblivion".labels: cover of the week, dar williams

if you're a fan of u2 and haven't yet picked up the 2007 remastered re-release of the joshua tree you may need to seek professional help. this track is on the bonus disc of b-sides (btw - also included in the deluxe edition is a phenomenal dvd concert from 1987) and provides the listener with a deeper glimpse into the creative process of the band as they made this masterpiece.u2 - "luminous times (hold on to love)"buy u2's music here.-------------------------------------------check out the archived b-side of the week posts by clicking the label "b-side of the week" below and the link on the right side of the page under 'return to oblivion'.labels: b-side of the week, u2

	 b-side of the week: juliana hatfield
	 
    


this song was featured in the (now) old tv show my so-called life when juliana hatfield made a guest appearance as a homeless girl. the episode was a "christmas" episode, and this melancholy but uplifting tune just seems appropriate for this time of year. the acoustic guitar solo at the end lifts this song to a high level, but it's hatfield's haunting vocals that make the song extra special.juliana hatfield - "make it home"buy the soundtrack here and hatfield's music here.-------------------------------------------check out the archived b-side of the week posts by clicking the label "b-side of the week" below and the link on the right side of the page under 'return to oblivion'.labels: b-side of the week, juliana hatfield

	 best of 2007
	 
    


what a fantastic year for music! there were so many great releases from a slew of old and new friends, but without a doubt, the album of the year was the soundtrack to the movie once.glen hansard and marketa irglova, the "guy" and "girl" from the film, created one of the more moving, engaging collections of songs i've heard in a while. and it's hard for me to separate the way i feel about the music from the way i feel about the film itself because the two exist in beautiful symbiosis. the emotional ride i got from the movie will forever influence the way i hear the songs, and each time i see the film i enjoy the songs in a slightly different way. who can hear "falling slowly" without reliving the goosebump-inducing scene at the piano in the music store? when "if you want me" starts, it's impossible not to see marketa strolling the streets of dublin at night in her slippers. and the build up in "when your mind's made up" is like a tidal wave crashing to the shore - such sweet release, with visions of glen and the band making their record over the course of one triumphant weekend in the studio.i could go on and on, track by track, scene by scene. the film and its soundtrack somehow managed to capture the passion, heartache, indecision, frustration and joy that goes into making music, while telling an honest, genuinely touching love story along the way. i can't recommend once more highly to anyone who loves music.now that you've heard about the best of the best, here's the rest of the best, in the form of the requisite "best of" list that's every blogger's pseudo-obligation. like last year, i've included the annual mix that i make for friends and family at the end of the post. if you like some of the music i've posted on this blog then chances are you'll find something you like on the mix. and away we go...sweet oblivion's essential albums from 2007(alphabetical by artist)ryan adams - easy tigerthe prolific adams made a concise musical statement for once, and this may be his strongest album yet. all the good stuff we love in his songs without any wasted space. (oh, and by the way, he released an ep too. it was outstanding as well.) buy it here.black rebel motorcycle club - baby 81brmc put together a tour de force in baby 81, managing to combine the sounds of their first three records into something awesome and new. a cohesive musical statement with a plethora of single-worthy tunes to boot. buy it here.brandi carlile - the storylast year's "little singer that could" is now a full blown star, and her sophomore effort is simply stunning. i can't get enough of her voice, and if this record is any indication of the depth of talent this young woman has, then she's in for a long, impressive career. buy it here.the frames - the costirish rockers the frames produced a fantastic album in the cost, successfully riding the wave of singer glen hansard's current creative epoch. if you were taken by once's music, this album will treat you right. buy it here.matthew good - hospital musicit's a challenging listen, but it's emotional darkness and brutal honesty are right up this listener's alley. matthew good continues to make compelling music year after year, and it still amazes me that he's not as famous on this side of the us-candian border as he is in his home country. buy it here.glen hansard & marketa irglova - once (ost)i've said it all above, but in case you missed the memo - go buy this album and see this film!!!idlewild - make another worldthese scottish rockers continue to do what they do, and each time they do it it gets better and better. some of the most interesting music of the band's career. buy it here.jason isbell - sirens of the ditchisbell was always my favorite songwriter in the drive-by truckers, and now he's made the dbt album i've always wanted to hear. heartfelt, soulful southern rock. buy it here.matt nathanson - some mad hopei've been a longtime fan of matt nathanson's concerts, but his studio work has never been consistent enough for me to supersede his live show. with some mad hope he's made a great pop rock record that begs for repeated listens. finally! buy it here.soulsavers - it's not how far you fall...it's the way you landabsurdly long title aside, this is an awesome album. it may be unusual, dark and moody, but mark lanegan sings the songs. need i say more? it's a more fully realized "lanegan album" than 2004's bubblegum. buy it here.stereophonics - pull the pini couldn't put together a best-of list without including at least one import-only release. i'd all but written off the stereophonics, thinking they'd lost the plot after their third lp, 2001's stellar jeep. with pull the pin it feels like they've regained the form they had back in the good ol' days. it's worth the extra coin to order this one from overseas. buy it here.--------------------------------------------------noticeably absent (at least to me) from this list is radiohead's in rainbows. i've made an executive decision to claim that one for 2008, when it's been released to the masses on cd. however, i will say that the limited edition box set that i finally have in my grimy little hands is one of the sweetest packages a collector could hope for. grab one now before they're sold out.in terms of the other artists on the mix below, turin brakes are finally back on track with dark on fire, although the companion ep, something out of nothing, is a more concise and impressive piece of work. a few other old standbys like steve earle, wilco, centro-matic, foo fighters and son volt all made good albums. though chris cornell's second solo effort just doesn't sit that well with me as a whole, his live shows this year were simply unbelievable. buffalo tom came out of retirement to make a solid record with a few outstanding songs on it. feist's second record is good stuff too. eddie vedder's music for the film into the wild is really compelling - his voice seems the perfect complement to the visuals in the movie. charmparticles and dala are my "little secret discoveries", the former from a couple years ago and the latter from this year. and i've finally come around to the manic street preachers. their new one is a solid, rocking set of tunes.--------------------------------------------------sweet oblivion's best of 2007 mix(in multiple parts due to savefile's size restrictions)tracklist:volume ijason isbell - "brand new kind of actress"the frames - "when your mind's made up"brandi carlile - "the story"buffalo tom - "bottom of the rain"ryan adams - "two"chris cornell - "no such thing"son volt - "action"idlewild - "finished it remains"matthew good - "the boy come home"soulsavers - "paper money"eddie vedder - "hard sun"matt nathanson - "bulletproof weeks"brmc - "all you do is talk"volume iiglen hansard & marketa irglova - "falling slowly"manic street preachers - "your love alone is not enough"stereophonics - "it means nothing"turin brakes - "brave new world"feist - "1 2 3 4"charmparticles - "rarest numbers"ryan adams - "my love for you is real"dala - "marilyn monroe"wilco - "what light"centro-matic - "operation motorcide"foo fighers - "but, honestly"steve earle - "come home to me"bonus tracks:"missed in '06"8 songs that i didn't get into until 2006 had passed us by.download the mix here.labels: black rebel motorcycle club, brandi carlile, glen hansard, idlewild, jason isbell, marketa irglova, matt nathanson, matthew good, ryan adams, soulsavers, stereophonics, the frames
