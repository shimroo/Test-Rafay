what our customers are saying

atlantic self storage on alta drive was absolutely the best storage facility i have used. i travel all over the state for my work and i’ve used many storage facilities, but atlantic self storage really went above and beyond to accommodate my needs. very friendly and efficient. i had an enclosed storage unit that a semi truck was able to access to offload my materials, and i also rented some parking spaces for trailers. just all around good service and good prices. would highly recommend.
