there are several avenues a potential cna may have in order to be competency tested and added to the illinois department of public health (idph), health care worker registry (hcwr). most will attend an approved basic nursing assistant training program. the processes for recent graduates, fundamentals of nursing students, students who need to re-test to recertify after a dormant period of 24 months, and out-of-state cnas will be addressed by the siuc nurse aide testing program. military personnel and foreign-trained nurses should contact the health care worker registry directly at 1-844-789-3676.
