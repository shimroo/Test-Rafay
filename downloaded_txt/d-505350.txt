description

overview and history -
the bradenton runners club was established in 1989 to promote a healthy and enjoyable lifestyle through the sports of running and walking. based in bradenton, florida, we welcome all ages and abilities to our group walks, runs, and social activities. if you want to improve your current level of fitness and enjoy great conversation, try one of our group training runs and meet some of our members. there are certified coaches and experienced runners and walkers available to help you get started as well as competitive runners to provide a challenge to those more experienced. 
we are a non-profit organization providing running scholarships to manatee county students.
following are some highlights of our club:
weekly group runs - 
several group runs are held each week, including tuesday evenings, thursday mornings, saturday mornings, and sunday mornings. click here or on the menu item to the left for more detailed information on group runs.
club races - 
in addition to our weekly group runs, the brc hosts three races each year.  brc members receive a $5 discount to the de soto grand parade 5k and the manatee river run.
de soto grand parade 5k - this 5k race is held just before the desoto grand parade in late april.  the course starts on old main in downtown bradenton before going out and back on manatee avenue.  because it starts ahead of the grand parade, you're running in front of thousands of people along the route.
turkey trot - the turkey trot is our 'give to run' race.   this race asks participants for donations, which are then passed on to two local charities.  this is a well-attended event and the weather is usually beautiful that time of year.  register here.
manatee river run rrca-fl state championship 5 miler - this 5-mile race is a road runners club of america (rrca) state championship race held in emerson preserve on snead island in palmetto at the end of december.  it's a fun and popular race that includes both trail and road running.  register here.
scholarships -
the bradenton runners club college scholarship and running camp financial aid programs provide two additional ways that we invest in and give back to our local community. these programs recognize, reward, and encourage our local student runners who pursue not only athletic, but academic goals.
social events -
the brc holds several social events every year.  the fall beach picnic welcomes everyone back to the area and kicks off the running season with a picnic at coquina beach. the spring picnic wraps up the season and celebrates the achievements of our members during the previous year.  see the menu item to the left or click on the club calendar for more details.
members only facebook group - 
join our members only facebook group where you can share photos, stories, race reports, favorite post run meals/drinks, find a running buddy, or ask about upcoming group runs and races. it's a great way to interact with other members.
