north county serenity house


north county serenity house, now a proud member of the healthright 360 family since 2014, offers a gender-responsive, anti-stigmatizing, and trauma-informed environment tailored to the needs of women facing substance use disorders. in alignment with healthright 360’s mission to provide integrated, compassionate care for those struggling with addiction, mental health, and other life challenges, ncsh embraces a holistic, client-centered approach that supports women in achieving lasting recovery. 
founded in 1966 by six visionary women, north county serenity house has grown to include multiple residential facilities in escondido, ca, offering specialized programs for women, including perinatal and child development resources. the 114-bed comprehensive residential program includes 102 beds for women and children and 12 beds dedicated to withdrawal management. additional transitional housing is available at scattered sites, specifically for low-income families, as part of our commitment to fostering long-term stability and well-being. 
in line with healthright 360’s values of dignity, respect, and community empowerment, ncsh provides individualized care that addresses clients’ health, emotional, educational, vocational, and family needs. our multidisciplinary, evidence-based approach ensures that women receive comprehensive support, from managing substance use disorders to navigating mental health challenges. we partner with criminal justice stakeholders to help women manage legal concerns and move forward in their lives with confidence. 
our services include residential withdrawal management, medication-assisted treatment (mat), individual and group counseling, drug and alcohol education, recovery planning, case management, relapse prevention, and comprehensive exit planning. women participating in ncsh programs can reunite with their children, creating opportunities for family therapy, parenting education, and family activities that strengthen bonds and promote healthy growth. by creating a safe, supportive environment rooted in trauma-informed care, we help women develop the skills needed to manage triggers, resolve conflicts, and build resilience, setting them on a path to recovery and reintegration into the community.
