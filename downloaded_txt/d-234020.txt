psms inclusivity statement
for over fifty years, the puget sound mycological society (psms) has nurtured collaboration amongst its members for an understanding
						and appreciation of the wide diversity of mushroom species in the pacific northwest. we also depend on a diverse membership to support our mission to
						foster the understanding and appreciation of mycology as a hobby and a science. in recent months, as systematic inequality in u.s. society is revealed
						to a broader audience, it becomes clearer that inequality imposes barriers on marginalized groups to participation in a wide variety of activities. psms
						opposes all barriers that limit participation in mycology. psms and its board members support a more diverse, inclusive, and welcoming organization where all people,
						especially those who are underrepresented in our organization and society at large, can enjoy mushrooms and all of the activities associated with them.  we realize
						this will be an on-going conversation and are looking to our members for suggestions on ways to increase diversity, inclusivity, and welcoming. thank you as we join
						together to make this long-overdue journey toward systemic equality!

monthly meeting
 
ron hamill
click here to join this meeting virtually.
the warning signs are all around us, the lights are blinking red. climate change is real and it will adversely impact our lives in the coming years... the most recent fires in southern california are 
just a taste of what's to come.  

our next speaker (ron hamill) has spent the last 30 years studying, cataloging, and making observations concerning these environmental responses to climate change. our canary in the coal mine ron spends 
most days inventorying things that most persons never see. fungi, lichens, and bryophytes (mosses & liverworts) having this perspective, observing these changes year to year - ron gives us a unique view of 
what lies ahead of us. 

as a field mycologist / botanist, expert identfier, founding member of the cascade mycological society, and member of the pacific northwest key council - ron brings a deep and extensive knowledge and 
understanding to bear. his studies and journals cover california, the pacific northwest, canada, and alaska. 

please join us tuesday evening, february 11th- 7:30 pm at the center for urban horticulture / university of washington to hear what ron has to say. 

this meeting will be a "hybrid" meeting both in-person at the center for urban horticulture and virtual on zoom. doors open at 7:00 pm. the lecture will start around 7:30 pm.
