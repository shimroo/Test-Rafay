more about sunshine day camp ➜














we’ve had three children attend sunshine day camp over the years, and our family loves all the programs offered. the staff and the facilities promote a positive, fun, structured environment where fun and learning occurs. the emphasis on building character is one that’s crucial to me, and i love how my children do things with a “happy heart.” it’s the sunshine way!
