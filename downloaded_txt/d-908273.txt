renewing hope, rebuilding lives

 

“what kept me strong for sixteen months [at his mansion] was all the relationships god had placed in my life. they spoke truth to me, walked with me through my pain, fought for me, loved me through-and-through, challenged me, prayed for me, and they would not let me give up. i’m so grateful for all the accountability that was provided.” — vanessa, recovery program graduate



“i wasn’t treated like a screw-up or a lost cause like i felt i deserved. i was welcomed in with a fresh start. this allowed me to focus first and foremost on my relationship with god. he began opening my eyes to the truth of my circumstances…for the first time in my life i began to trust people to accept me as i am, void of masks or protective personalities, and they did. whole-heartedly and imperfectly, the men of this hill have loved me and i have, by the grace of god, been able to receive it.”—david, recovery program graduate
