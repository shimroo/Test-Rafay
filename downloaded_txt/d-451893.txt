the www.logwell.com homepage


















a well log consists of one or more 
curves providing a record of physical properties of the well bore as a function of depth, 
often generated from an electronic sonde lowered into the well on cable (wireline).  
the term "log" is borrowed from the old driller's log kept since the earliest days of well 
drilling, but some authorities believe the term earlier derives from the log kept by ship's 
captains.  this website is primarily intended as an information resource for 
independent well loggers, and others interested in the art and science of well logging 
(and of course for shameless self-promotion).  
analog services, inc. 
caters to the oil well, water well, mineral, and 
environmental logging / wireline industries.  we maintain the most complete repair and 
fabrication facility in the eastern united states, as well as an r&d laboratory.  
we can build, repair, modify, and calibrate most downhole tools and surface equipment.
