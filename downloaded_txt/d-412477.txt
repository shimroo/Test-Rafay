	 batman in london
	 
    


batman in londonoriginally uploaded by menlo. here's the story on this one.  walking through picadilly circus i spotted this guy dressed as batman and doing streetside promotion for the london hard rock cafe.  he'd pose for passersby and suggest they stop in for a souvenier or a bite to eat.  sizing up the situation i began to think about how to not make the shot so goofy.  because the weather was overcast i was also concerned about getting enough contrast in the shot.  by shooting from behind i could sillouette batman with the sky.  this presented another problem.  how to explain to the guy what i was doing without making it seem too odd.  i elected to shoot a couple shots of other people posing in order to sort of introduce myself.  i then hoped he'd ignore me enough to slip behind and shoot away.  unfortunately, there wasn't enough room to squat behind batman so i had to hold the camera low and hope for a good exposure. when he realized that i was shooting from that position i quickly tried to explain what i was up to, but by then more tourists were trying to get him to pose.  it was gloomy enough that i made an exposure at about a half a second with my modified holga.

	 fotofest without fotos
	 
    


when i received this from the purveyors of fine photography at fotofest i knew they've finally jumped the shark.  as i pointed out in this post, the thematic material around which the event is held has increasingly signalled that photography exists as a tool to promote political agendas.  in the past fotofest has organized around water, earth and this year it's violence.  generic violence--yeah sure--it was always about the war on terrorism.  now they've figured out that even photography is superflious when political diatribes with music and dance will do.

	 court case tests street photography sold in galleries.
	 
    


a story in the new york times discusses a lawsuit brought against photographer phillip-lorca dicorcia who photographed random people on the street.  one of the people he photographed was an orthodox jew who objected to having a 'graven image' made of him and having the image publicly sold.  courts have consistently ruled that such photography is permissible as long as it does not serve commercial interests.  sales of photographs in galleries was under consideration by the court who ruled in favor of the photographer.

	 lomo videos
	 
    


in 2003 the bbc produced a series of short videos dealing with lomography.    apparently, the producers  gave a random lomo photo to a variety people and videotaped their comments.  for the most part the various programs feature people trying to wrestle with the meanings of a particular photograph.   nothing wrong with that.   but it doesn't particularly advance the theme of lomography being somehow unique.have a look.

	 for the record
	 
    


just wondering if i should tell someone.  i got a look at the evite for the toy joy photography exhibit at the london hair company in houston.  it features one of my photographs and the description has a couple mistakes.  the credit line reads: robert holmgren - towering palms - gelatin silver photograph - taken with a holga.  most importantly my name is spelled correctly.  of secondary importance is the title and photographic method.  for the record, the real title is 'squire house palms' and it was printed on the wonderful epson 7800 printer.

	 krappy camera competition
	 
    


the annual juried krappy camera competion show is up at soho photo in new york.  grand prize winner this year is michael koerner of tucson, az, first place was won angela regas of oakland, ca, second place by megan green of astoria, ny and third place by meg birnbaum of sommerville, ma.  each of the winning photographs is excellent.  juror john reuter is to be congratulated.  reception is on march 7th from 6 - 8. i'm kind of confused about the actual name of the show.  the gallery website shows two different names.  the second name they give is the members annual krappy kamera show.  just when they were on a roll with alliteration they come up short.  however i think we all know why krappy kamera kompetition might present problems. also of interest at the gallery is the pinhole photography of nancy spencer and eric renner.
