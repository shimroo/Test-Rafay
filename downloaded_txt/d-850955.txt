"reassuring confidence."
when i got my dui i was in complete disarray. between my family, business, and future, i was having trouble sleeping due to constant anxiety. not only was i involved in an accident, but i had an extremely high bac. needless to say, i feared for the worst. after talking with 3 separate lawyers, i then met with scott, who after 1 meeting i knew he was the right attorney for me. not only did scott manage to keep me out of jail, but he was also able to reduce my alcohol program from 9 months to 6 months which is rare for bac as high as mine was. if you're having concerns, or questions about which attorney you should use, please meet with scott. i promise you that he'll definitely not disappoint!

- jarrod




"scott is a rock star – i highly recommend him"
through my company i have worked with thousands of attorneys over the last 19 years, and scott spindel stands out as one of the best. he cares about his clients, responds in a timely manner, is vigilant with his evaluation of evidence, is wildly smart, and is awesome in trial -- the jury loves him -- which is crucial for a successful defense attorney. with this amazing combination of skills and gifts, you will not find a better attorney to represent you.
