two people, a horse, and one tough race!ride and tie is a fun and challenging sport combining running, riding, endurance and strategy. teams consist of two runners and one horse who complete a 20-100 mile trail course by “leapfrogging” one another. partners do this for the entire distance and each team learns to maximize the different members’ strengths and weaknesses to their advantage.
