student showcase 







 







spring 2025 



preschool family teachers are exceptional in providing a play-based learning environment for children (3 months to 4 years old). in the parent education class, parents learn how to support their kids as they learn social-emotional skills. in class, the kids learn about communicating their wants/needs, solving conflicts, and identifying and expressing their emotions safely. it’s amazing to see the growth of the children. by the end of the program, it feels like you’re getting a degree in parenting too!miwa natsukipsf parent and student
