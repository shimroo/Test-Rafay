for over 65 years, florida tile has delivered the most innovative and beautiful tile in the industry. this commitment has taken them from being a small, ceramic trim producer in lakeland, florida to a leading manufacturer of porcelain floor and wall tile across the usa.










cotto d‚Äôeste‚Äôs mission is based on the values of italian beauty: taste, elegance, and style that bring the highest levels of excellence to our everyday lives. an innate passion for all that is art and culture is combined with a consolidated and deep-rooted tradition in ceramics.










high performance levels and refined aesthetic quality, have made lea ceramiche products greatly acknowledged by numerous industry experts in the international panorama.













since 1974, panaria has been an expression of the great ceramic tradition of panariagroup industrie ceramiche s.p.a., an italian multinational group and world leader in the manufacture and distribution of ceramic surfaces for flooring and cladding.










since 2007, arc has been the pioneer in structural, pre-formed, curb-less, level-entry showers. barrier free showers are an important advancement in shower design, eliminating the curb, which is a major tripping hazard and makes cleaning difficult. an arc design is easy and fast to install, and a perfect platform for covering with custom tile.










founded in paterson, new jersey in 1946, the century bathworks story is as much about quality as it is longevity. over the years, they were known as ‚Äúthe innovators‚Äù and it‚Äôs not hard to see why. high-end, framed shower and bath enclosures are their specialty, but they also excel with semi-frameless hinged shower enclosures and high-quality medicine cabinets.
