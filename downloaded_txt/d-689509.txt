 amplifying the voices of all animals in central virginia and beyond














founded in 1984, voices for animals is an all-volunteer 501c3 nonprofit organization that advocates through a vegan philosophy of nonviolence that works in alliance with all sentient beings. as our logo demonstrates, we aim to amplify the voices of the animals with whom we share this planet by joining our voices with theirs. 

 









 

while most vegan advocacy groups understandably start with food as their focus, we have taken a different approach, beginning with veganism as a way of thinking and being in the world that incorporates but exceeds dietary veganism.  our advocacy focuses on three spheres that deeply influence our relations with animals: education, the law, and religion.
