project info

season 1 - the dis-reality show starring b-rock
                a 15-18 year old bipolar rapper armed with a witty play on words
                and a head flooded with stories he cryptically tells through his
                haunting rhymes. b-rock aspires to become the world's next
                best rapper, and no doubt, he's got the talent to accomplish
                that. watch b-rock grow up as he creates his first cd
                appropriately titled “bipolar disorder” and his
                first hit ( i aint going by the rules) get placed in a major
                event wrestling fan fest .. watch as he travels across country
                to california to the cow palace where this song is to be
                featured in a wrestling fan fest event, meeting with some
                legends of the wresting world as well as up and coming stars of
                the mma.. only to be disappointed when the events starts to fall
                apart at the last minute, watch this young star as he fights off
                the disappointments of show biz and struggles to get trough the
                next few years of school, his mental illness as well as a
                laundry list of societal stigmas that go along with mental
                illness.
