what phones can i use with verizon prepaid service?

if you want to buy a new prepaid phone, go to our prepaid phones page to see all the prepaid phones available. otherwise, visit a verizon store or your local retailer.

check our bring your own device page to see if you can use a phone you already have (including apple® iphone®).

add a device to your existing prepaid account.





can i call international locations with my prepaid service?

yes, you can use your prepaid phone to make calls to international locations at your per-minute rate plus the per-minute charges found on the prepaid international calling page.

if you frequently call other countries, we offer:

global choice for our $70 unlimited plus prepaid plan. get unlimited calls to one country/month and discounted rates to 220+ countries
select prepaid smartphone plans that include calls to mexico, canada, puerto rico, guam, northern mariana islands and the us virgin islands
prepaid international calling plans that you can add to your prepaid plan for a set monthly fee

international networks change frequently, so certain locations may not be available at all times. pricing is subject to change without notice. unlimited night/weekend minutes don't apply to international calls.





how much data do i need with my prepaid plan?

how much data you need depends on what you do with your connected devices. here are some examples (not your actual usage):

how much data you need

recommended data amount per device
you mostly talk and text, but use social media occasionally
less than 5 gb/month
you stream music, upload photos on social media and browse the internet
5 - 10 gb/month
you stream video and are always online
10+ gb/month

if you already have a verizon prepaid plan, see your usage details for actual numbers.

you can change your plan or add data using my verizon.

note: data usage for mobile hotspot devices depends on how many devices are connected to it and what they're doing. usage could be 30 gbs or more if 3 devices are streaming music or video.

yes, you get 5g access with our current prepaid plans*.

5g ultra wideband* is only included with these prepaid plans:
