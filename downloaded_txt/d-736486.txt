i would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to a-z 
  to deafblindness, and to thank you for visiting my modest and humble little 
  web page. so come on in and make yourself at home, you will be made very welcome.
my name is james gallagher and i am deafblind myself. this 
  site is here to try and offer some help to blind or deaf people, and especially 
  deafblind people, and those who provide specialised services for those who are 
  deafblind. a-z to deafblindness is also here, to make people more aware about 
  deafblindness.
within this website you will be able to learn the deafblind 
  manual alphabet and, the two-handed manual alphabet used by sighted deaf people. 
  its up to you where you wish to go. if you wish to learn the deafblind manual 
  alphabet then there are pages on this website for you to do so.
there is the archives page, where i am trying to collect some 
  of the best documents about the condition of deafblindness that there is on 
  the net. there is also information about braille, moon, the cochlear implant, 
  retinal implant project, a full text description of the asl alphabet, the causes 
  of deafblindness, some very interesting articles about deafness and deafblindness, 
  and also the addresses of organszations for deafblind people throughout the 
  world as well as dates for conferences and courses about deafblindness throughout 
  this little world of ours.
also of course pages with links to some of the best web sites 
  on the net which have information about the above topics. i hope you find this 
  site interesting and knowledgeable. these pages will never be the best on the 
  net about deafblindness, but i try to provide good and clear information to 
  those who wish to find out more about deafblindness and those who have the condition.
i hope that you will enjoy your time browsing around in a-z 
  to deafblindness. if you know, or have, a website that you think should be included 
  within this web page then please just let me know, and i will be more than happy 
  to add a link to your pages.
if you have any trouble with these pages in any way then please 
  let me know. i will be happy to help you in any way that i can. remember i am 
  just an e-mail away. if you wish to get in touch with me my e-mail address is 
  below, and please feel free to do so.
