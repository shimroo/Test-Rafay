the mission of zorongo flamenco dance theatre and school is to enrich our community by drawing people of diverse backgrounds close to the power, passion and virtuosity of the flamenco dance and music tradition, and by expanding on that tradition, to create an innovative art form that explores the issues of contemporary life.
