l. ron hubbard - the tao of insanitybook is expected to be here mid to late february.  l. ron hubbard has evolved into one of the most controversial names of the new millennium. somewhere between the castigation from his critics and the fervent praise of his followers existed a real man with a real mission. what this mission was, however, is debated with as much vehemence as the praises and castigations. l. ron hubbard  the tao of insanity delves deeply into the occult underpinnings of this man and his mission to reveal deeper insights into the matrix that he operated in that put him at the center of so much intrigue that surrounded key players in the military industrial complex such as robert heinlein, jack parsons, and marjorie cameron. for over a half century, countless people have suffered severe misadventures after encountering the mysterious legacy of l. ron hubbard and his ever puzzling brainchild: scientology, a subject that continues to intrigue, baffle and perplex the general public as well as the many critics it has attracted. the only way something can remain so persistently mysterious and powerful is that the underlying occult factors beneath it are not understood. once they are understood, it will no longer be a puzzle.

l. ron hubbard  the tao of insanity imparts a major paradigm shift as it reveals a deep tapestry featuring an intertwining of famous scientists, politicians, religious leaders, mystical conjurers and the occult imprints that were placed upon them. it is an imprint, however, that if truly understood, conveys an unrelenting hope and promise that is a constituent part of all life.more details+price $22.95
