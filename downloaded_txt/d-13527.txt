welcome to cumberland


a community that provides opportunities for all
 






  
 
 















 






  
 



  
 














it is an honor to be given the opportunity to be the mayor of such a vibrant community. as mayor, i have the unique privilege to see so much of what makes this community special. it is why i have made my priorities clear to include all the elements that make cumberland not just livable, but a truly great place to live, work, and play.one of the greatest things about cumberland isn’t a thing at all, it is the people. i believe in cumberland, and i believe in cumberland’s future. by capturing the spirit and energy of this town and by working together, we can create a community that provides opportunities for all. together we can develop a state-of-the-art senior center, revitalize broad street, and bring diamond hill park to life for a new generation. this is all achievable. this is who we are.jeffrey muttermayor of cumberland
