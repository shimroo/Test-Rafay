broyde group projects







areas of interest:
  we are focused on delineating the molecular mechanisms underlying the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of environmental and endogenous carcinogens. these include polycyclic aromatic carcinogens, present in automobile exhaust, tobacco smoke and cooked foods as well as reactive oxygen species. these can react with dna to damage it. this damaged dna may initiate cancer by producing mutations during dna replication. 
our research centers on investigating replication and repair of the damaged dna, using computational approaches to study large macromolecular systems involving these protein-dna complexes. we employ computer modeling, molecular mechanics and dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical calculations for structural, dynamic and thermodynamic analyses to connect these properties with biological function.
