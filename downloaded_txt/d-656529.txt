welcome to cap'n john's boat lettering.


                naming a boat is a time-honored tradition. it's what makes your boat uniquely your own. 
                for more than 20 years we have 
				provided exceptional quality and service for thousands
				of boat 
				owners like you. here are a few reasons why cap'n john's is the right 
				choice:

•

 design your boat name online 
                ~ with our preview form 
				you can design and preview your lettering online. 
				simply type in a boat name, pick your 
				favorite font, color and effect, then see how your lettering will look, 
				instantly!



                "i chose to go with cap'n john's because they had
                
absolutely the best site for seeing the boat name, so there was no 
                guessing at what the final product was going to look like."
                - virginia linse (blue ginger) 


• 

				quality materials
                ~ we use high quality marine-grade vinyl, designed to withstand the harsh conditions that boats can 
				be exposed to. we are so confident of the quality of our products that we back them with an
				
				8 year guarantee.


why settle for inferior quality when you can have high 
				quality vinyl lettering at an affordable price?

				if you're comparing prices, make sure you compare apples
				to apples. not all vinyl lettering is created equal. inexpensive 
				vinyl can crack, peel or fade in as little as 6 months. you've 
				made a significant investment in your boat. you want it to look 
				good. we understand the long term benefits, for both you and us, that come from doing things right the first time.


						"i ordered my boat name from you almost 7 years ago and 
						it still looks great. now we have bought another boat 
				and need a new name for it."

						business.

						"thank you for the awesome lettering! we'll be sure to 
						refer you to our boating friends!"

                ~ we have specialized in boat lettering for more than 20 years. 
				this is one reason why central floridas largest boat dealers trust

				"every order receives the same care and attention to detail as 
				if it were going on my boat.
                i insist on 
                taking the time to make sure your lettering looks it's best."
