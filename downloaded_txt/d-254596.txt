the world news:- astronomers say that eight new planets around distant stars have been detected on a planet that is among them as "foreign planet most similar to earth" to your offers.



nasa's kepler space telescope has detected all the eight planets and thus the number of planets around other suns of the galaxy milky found by kepler past than 1,000.

the new planet is larger than earth, only 12% and the temperature of the outer planets ever found on earth. probably 40 percent of the sun's heat that the planet earth is over.



doug caldwell doctor institute seti (search for extraterrestrial intelligent beings) in california, said that the central star is cooler planet from the sun, so the sky of the sky of the planet earth looks qrmztr.



but the human eye never will happen to this planet 475 light years away and because we do not know what the ingredients are.



the researchers say that the new planets can only say that they are likely to be rocky and the amount of energy that the sun is the fall.



kepler in the space behind the move to measure the amount of light from the stars - and minimal in this light - can infer the existence of planets around them. when a planet passes in front of the star - from our point of view - light drops.



after the terrestrial planets with large telescopes observing and gathering more data about the analysis of a large team of researchers placed.



giant planets close to their stars will be measured.



however, intermittent loss of light due to the existence of planets around stars are always there.

in other news this week, a collection of more than 500 planets kepler scientists "potential" which was introduced by the observatory detected.



molale frgal kepler officials said that some of these will be rejected with further observations.

android 5.0 lollipop tablet version reviews

nexus 9 general public of google's next-generation mobile os began the beginning.below, i reviewed the summary.

design

the most noticeable point in android 5.0 lollipop it would be nice to say that's innovation of design. lollipop's first android was adopted across the board the ui platform called material design that features a bold color scheme and animation. google's android app although some exceptions are certain was fully migrated to the material design.

this design is a single element like a real-world material (material) is or moving or overlap the other elements. in addition to cast a shadow in the background, to expand from the icon, when minimizing the animation is added. overall impression are like a kind of picture book, but it is complicated, it can be intuitively understood. font also a elegant and variety was flat design the primary colors.



returning to the conventional android after using for a while the ui of lollipop, you can feel really old-fashioned. it would appear to the mobile environment of the previous era even in android 4.4.4 on nexus 7. ui of android 5.0 it would be said to have resulted in a dramatic innovation in mobile software.

i put a gif animation for opening and closing the drawer of apps under. previous android had a place reminiscent of the gory gui the menu on top of dos screen of windows previous personal computer as a whole has been fixed. android 5.0 is finally to dispel such heaviness, evolved into lightly experience to forget that such complex code is running in the background.



ui of android 5.0 will be welcome to most users. in particular, since that can multi-task switching is too well the card type, it's enough to became want to see and flip through occasionally meaning without pattering to.

feature

android of change of course in 5.0 is not the only ui. although likely important improvement will be a significant impact contains many future, one's encryption.

the android 5.0 device all the data is encrypted by default. and (if have enabled) and is protected by a user security code. because of this, is there to bypass the lock screen to theft or lost device, a third party that the read is very difficult in the case where it is accessed directly in memory.

in addition daily basis highly convenient new security feature's smart lock. lollipop device can be used to specify the other lollipop device as a "trusted device". then only the paired, automatically lock is released. although one by one become neglect the setting of tokaku path code in tablet because it is annoying to enter the passcode unlock, security without the input of tedious path code if you use a smart lock increases significantly.



i was set to pairing the nexus 9 in lg g smart u~otto and home of internet radio and bluetooth of android wear equipped. now as long as you are in the vicinity of these devices, nexus 9 is automatically unlocked. smart u~otto has a high safety because the loss of your it is much less than the other devices from a device that is worn on the body at all times while on the go. .

design of the keyboard in lollipop has also been redesigned. design in the impression of illustrations that are printed on paper, separator line that surrounds the key has been abolished. and using in place tried more of this design seems less mistouch.



gmail and calendar app has also been greatly improved. the new gmail app is approaching the inbox mail client that google has launched recently. however gmail app does not perform automatic sorting by software as inbox.



for calendar app another article i have learn more. .

a little disappointing points

that said, not is not the point, such as confused old and new android user. for example, how to display the settings menu in the notification tray is not know at a glance. when you click the icon of the user account toka open the settings page, the toka open the actual user account setting page when you double tap this icon, you will not notice if you do not know to do so. it is difficult to know whether that means anything of icon simple geometric shapes.

the good thing is the important apps like gmail and calendar has been redesigned, but some apps that leaked from innovation. it is a pity among the hangouts has not been upgraded.

also, thing is unavoidable in the major version up of the os, but still there remains a bug in here and there, it is necessary to occasionally restart. i as far as tested bug of 5.0 was not less serious.

conclusion

lollipop was completely redesigned the android environment. it became fun ui using elegant and nimble on behalf of the previous android it was somewhat ponderously pc gui manner.



although new ui to intensive paper craft metaphor is reminiscent of some sort of picture book, it is not given is never childish impression. future important challenge for google is for many third-party developers, wonder if you can persuade to develop a killer app that takes advantage of the features of lollipop.

china and its connection to israel and middle east



00:05
  
  1 comment




the world news:- historically, the middle east has had only
four major powers involved in it: france, britain, america, and russia. in the
early years, before and just after israel's creation it was france and england heavily
involved. it was not until the early 1960's, america replaced both as the major
player and weapons importer\exporter to israel. russia meddled in the region in
the 50's, with weapon exports to many arab countries.

since the 60's, the two major powers
influencing the area have been russia and america, however, this declined after
1992, when russia ended communist rule. they did continue to support syria,
egypt and others but were focused more on themselves. this left only america
until now.

today, russia is re-emerging in syria under
putin, iran is a new player and heavily involved and may be in cahoots with
russia to keep syria- syria under assad. america seems to be hesitant to do
much in the area unless a real provocative act occurs, and china, which up to
now has shown little interest in the region.

china's interest in keeping the middle east
and israel at peace is economic. since 1988, china has recognized the palestinians
in the gaza area as a "state" and has always supported its attempt to
upgrade its status in the un. on may 6th, it proposed its own peace plan for
the middle east dilemma that was really regurgitated points presented many
times before. recently, israel's pm visited china and found that china greatly
valued the israel state for economic reasons now and in the future.

china is israel’s third largest trade
partner after the us and eu, with trade set to grow from around $8 billion to
$10 billion in three years. besides russia and america, it is the third most
desired high tech area for innovative designs in weapon systems. china buys
israeli technology to improve upon just as they did with russian technology,
which then they sell to iran. ironically, israel and china signed five
agreements in cooperation and trade in aerospace, agricultural research,
financial cooperation, science and technology. in fact, in a disturbing
comment, israel's netanyahu suggested that if china serves as an “engine for
israeli economic growth . . . i propose that israel in many ways be the r&d
lab for china.”
what?

china is one of iran's largest purchasers
of its oil. the sanctions obama imposed on iran did little to china because
they were exempt! iran's weapons are chinese versions of russian ones, which
iran buys. but china wants to keep israel within its own influence for the two
natural gas fields off the israeli coast containing up to 19 trillion cubic
feet. china wants some of it and as the fields become developed, no doubt will
obtain some that benefits israel.

but, whose side would china be on should there
be another regional war? would china act like russia in sending military assets
to protect their interests they have invest in? would they back the palestinians
or israel? which side do they think provides more economic value?
one
can see how china, russia, iran and america are now the major influences in
this area of the world for economic and political reasons.
