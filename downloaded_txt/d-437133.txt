new to home brewing and wine making?
you are about to begin a wonderful hobby some call a passion even more call it an obsession.
 
by making your own beer and wine you are starting a hobby that is creative, honest, self reliant and most of all, fun. there is nothing better than sharing a mug of beer or a glass of wine with a friend and telling them you made it yourself. sure you have some bragging rights, but knowing exactly what went into that perfect glass of merlot, or pint of ale, is what it's all about.  

home brewing and wine making are lifetime hobbies. both young and old love the independence of the process and the constant search for knowledge. a great hobby to  bridge the generation gap bringing families together around the brew pot or crusher. 
 
getting started is easy. 
 
some basic equipment is needed to start home brewing or making wine at home. we have equipment packages containing all the specialized equipment you will need, and the instructions and support to get you off to the right start. and don't worry... we are just a phone call away to help with any questions you may have. 
 
we want to make sure your first batch comes out great. our kits include the best instructions around with lots of tips and tricks we have learned over our many years of brewing. our customers are always amazed at the ease and great taste of their first batch of home brew or bottle of wine.
