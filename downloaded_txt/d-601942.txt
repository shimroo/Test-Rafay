benefits of fha financing
fha loans are government (hud) insured mortgage loans.  borrowers pay for the mortgage insurance, but in return benefit from easier qualification guidelines including lower credit score requirements, higher debt ratios, and acceptance of alternative credit.  many home buyers that do not have a down payment of 20 percent or excellent credit find that fha loans enable them to purchase a home while not being able to qualify for conventional loan programs.
with increasing rents in california, it is now possible to have a mortgage payment less than a rent payment for a similar property within a similar area. california fha loans were created to make it easier to transition from renter to homeowner.
to find out if you qualify for an fha loan now, submit your information on the form above and one of our calfha counselors will contact you to discuss what programs might be available.

 


 


 
 
 



do you need down payment assistance?
it’s easier than ever to purchase a home with our ez qualify down payment assistance program.  home buyers who qualify may purchase a single family house, condo, or townhome and receive 3.5% down payment assistance.   to qualify, you must meet the following criteria:

credit score of 620 or above
no foreclosures, bankruptcies or short sales within the past 3 years
ability to prove income
ability to show tax returns for past 2 years
debt to income ratios within fha guidelines
underwriting approval

you will not be disqualified on this program if you make an income above the county average income, as this program was developed as a way to assist a greater number of home buyers.  sound exiting?  it is!   complete the information form on this page and get ready to learn more and begin the process.
