wahl engine turned designs on fountain pens guide 1919-1929

did you ever pick up a wahl metal fountain pen and wonder what the design was called, when it was made, and what pens it was used on?  this guide takes the available catalog and advertisement information and formats it into a table of engine turned and machine engraved designs that appeared on wahl and tempoint fountain pens from 1919 through 1929, a description of each, a table of when they were made, and a detailed year by year chronology of what was made and when.  there are quite a few gaps in the available data, which is called out in the article, but it's intended to help you figure out what is that wahl pen you are holding.read the story about these interesting pens here!

wahl eversharp hanlin design 1920-1925

the wahl eversharp hanlin design is a rare example of combining engine turned and hand engraving on the same writing instrument.  hanlin is a variation of the ribbon or colonial linear machine engraved design with panels of straight lines running the length of the cap and barrel divided with wide blank panels that are hand engraved with an ornate flower and foliage design.  design credit was given to john h. worthy and clarence w. lund in the april 25, 1921 design patent application which was awarded on september 13, 1921.  the patent only shows the design on a pencil but was obviously extended to fountain pens as well.  itâs not clear from the application or the few wahl documents i have how the pattern came to be named hanlin.  solid gold pencils with the hanlin design were already in production in 1920 before the award.read the story about these interesting pens here!

wahl eversharp air-lite 1939-1941

the wahl eversharp air-lite served as the entry level "back to school" pen with the eversharp name, making it's prom debut in 1939 and bopping along through about 1941. the pen was a notch down from the pacemaker, which was an attractive and less expensive alternative to the premium priced coronet. like the pacemaker, the air-lite was offered in striped celluloid and black and was fitted with a smooth writing 14 karat gold nib. the air-lite has a simpler clip with "silvery" trim, possibly rhodium or chrome plated, as on contemporary eversharp pencils.  it was the companyâs lowest price point pen, taking that spot from the previous yearâs junior model.read the story about these interesting pens here!

cascade hoodpoint fountain pen 1950-1952

this cascade fountain pen came along with several other cheapies as part of a âbag âo pensâ deal and has been sitting in a storage box waiting for a look.  having just last year dug into criterion pens and discovering they were a rexall brand, i thought, why not look up cascade and see what happens?  sure enough, every advertisement with these pens is by a rexall store or rexall itself.  cascade as a fountain pen brand is first seen in rexall retailer advertisements in 1934, but this pen shows up first in 1950.read the story about these interesting pens here!

moore fingertip 1946-1948

though the moore fingertip is an obvious a design response to the market leading parker 51 and sheaffer triumph, its design is different enough to be viewed on its own merits, copying very little from the design leaders, but taking obvious cues from them.  as is typical with moore pens up to that date, itâs generally a well-made lever fill pen with one unfortunate and deal killing problem. this stems from the most notable element, its namesake fingertip section, a bullet shaped nugget of solid stainless steel with the gold nib inset flush on top, like a fingernail.  there is literally no other pen quite like it.read the story about these interesting pens here!

an uncatalogued bexley tuck-away mardi gras fountain pen c. 2004-2008

the bexley tuck-away is a âlong-shortâ style pen that is only 4 1/4 inches long capped but with the cap threaded onto the end of the short barrel it becomes 7 1/2 inches long posted.  it was made in both fountain pen and rollerball pen versions and due to the compact size of the barrel the fountain pen can only accept short international cartridges.  no converter was provided even as an option.  this uncatalogued bexley tuck-away is made of a colorful version of the cracked ice acrylic resin called mardi gras, a mix of green, purple, and orange.read the story about this interesting pen here!

eberhard faber permapoint fountain pen 1941-1948

this story begins with a bent nib eberhard faber permapoint fountain pen in green brickwork celluloid c. 1941-1948 that was at best a parts pen.  i sold it and a black one thinking they were cheapies and not realizing they had a story.  the pen shown above is a 5 1/16 inch long lever fill pen with chrome or rhodium plated trim.  the clip is stamped permapoint.  the stainless steel nib is stamped e. faber over medium over iridium over tipped over made in over u. s. a.  the barrel is stamped permapoint over eberhard faber u. s. a. over u. s. pat. 124,266.  my later curiosity about it led me down a rabbit hole to find out more.read the story about these interesting pens here!

gallery of uncatalogued lady sheaffer fountain pens c. 1968â1971

as with the earliest lady sheafferâs from 1958â1966, sheaffer made a small number of uncatalogued versions of the 1968â1971 pens.  were these production, prototype, or short-run models?  the fit and finish on them suggests they may have been special order pens but lacking any sheaffer catalogs or price lists from that period, thereâs no way to be certain.  there are three known uncatalogued lady sheaffer models from this period.  it is possible there are more.  each follows the design of the 1966-1968 stylist, with a long, slender, tapered shape, and a long spring loaded clip.read the story about these interesting pens here!

lady sheaffer long clip white dot fountain pens c. 1968â1971

the sheaffer âsâ logo, introduced on the clips of sheaffer stylist pens in early 1966, had a short life, with sheaffer returning to the white dot in the fall of 1968. this would also affect the appearance of the sheaffer 's' logo clip lady sheaffer pen models introduced in the fall of 1967. in the fall of 1968, lady sheaffer pen clips would be adorned with the white dot in place of the âsâ logo and would have a short conical nib in place of the stylist type. in addition, sheaffer introduced three new finishes to the lady sheaffer line, described in advertisements as âsatin silver with wave band,â âscalloped,â and âgolden moirã©.â these new finishes introduced a change in model numbering from roman numerals to three digit numbers.read the story about these interesting pens here!

lady sheaffer âsâ logo long clip fountain pens c. 1967â1968

the original, clipless lady sheaffer fountain pen had a pretty good run, introduced march 20, 1958 with nineteen cartridge only fountain pen models in a wide variety of finishes priced from $10 to $110.  the launch was supported with a big advertising and promotional campaign.  over the next few years some of the original models were phased out and in 1962 sheaffer added two final new clipless models, each with an inset gold stylpoint nib section.  by 1966, the lady sheaffer line was due for a refresh  the lady sheaffer fountain pen was redesigned for release in 1967 and followed the look of the stylist in its cap and barrel shape, âsâ logo clip, and stylist nib.read the story about these interesting pens here!

wearever sterling silver overlay cartridge fountain pen 1969

this is a pen that is often described as the âwearever grail penâ and like many uncommon pens has a bit of folklore attached to it.  there are wearever collectors who have or hope to have one.  hopefully i can clear up some of the story, but there are things that are just lost to history.  iâll present the facts that i could find and try to fill in the rest with intelligent guesses.  based on the packaging, this was a specialty version of one of david kahn, inc.âs wearever cartridge fountain pens from the 1960s.  it resembles a black plastic cartridge version of the wearever supreme with a sterling silver overlay.  these were probably only made for the 90th anniversary woolworthâs stockholderâs meeting, making them a special order item that may not have been made before or since.  it was probably only made in black and probably had no matching pencil.read the story about these interesting pens here!

a. n. palmer anpaco fountain pen c. 1945-1949

another week and another pen mystery solved!  this is a specialty oem version of a late 1940s eagle fountain pen for the a. n. palmer company for use with the palmer method.  it was probably only made in black and likely had no matching pencil.  the emphasis on "hand ground" stamped on the nib indicates that it was likely a special nib grind which would account for the higher price over an ordinary eagle fountain pen with a stainless steel nib.read the story about these interesting pens here!

early arnold fountain pens c. 1935-1939

was remmie arnold the king of the cheapies?  did the arnold pen company make anything worth collecting?  the answers may surprise you!  if remmie arnold, founder and owner of the r. l. arnold pen manufacturing company, was to tell his own life story, it would sound a lot like his profile given in virginia newspapers when he was running for the democratic nomination for the 1949 virginia governorâs race.  each telling was like a âhoratio alger rags to riches story,â as if written by a new york agency.  from a lowly beginning, arnold started his career as a clerk at the edison pen company in petersburg, virginia.  after twenty years learning the pen manufacturing business, he rose to be the companyâs general manager and president.  he left edison in 1935 at the age of 41 and founded his own namesake pen company and launched a career of making and selling low price, low cost pens by the thousands to major retail chains and advertising companies.  by 1942, the arnold pen company was the second largest manufacturer of pens and pencils in the world, by volume.  but are there any collectible arnolds?read the story about remmie arnold and his early pens here!

wearever de luxe 1947-1949

this third version of the wearever de luxe will cause a double take as it looks so much like the pennant.  it's a lever-fill pen with an injection molded plastic barrel and inner cap.  the cap has a satin finish stainless steel sleeve, giving it the appearance of having a metal cap.  the cap top and section are black plastic.  the section is tapered similar to a late 1940s waterman taperite fountain pen and has a small unmarked stainless steel nib.  the clip and lever are gold plated.  itâs not known how many colors or nib sizes were made, but itâs likely they are the similar colors as the earliest pennant, in darker shades of maroon, green, navy, and gun metal.  the plastic used to make the pennant was described in david kahn, inc. advertisements as forticel, made by the celanese plastic corporation.read the story about this interesting pen here!

wearever pacemaker 1955-1959

the 1955-1959 wearever pacemaker has a similar look to the pennant but is a bit more ârefined.â  the barrels came in five colors, blue, maroon, green, grey, and black, and some examples have matching color sections.  it has an all metal, satin finish, silver color cap and a silver color metal cap top, clip, lever and trim piece on the section.  these may all be made of stainless steel, but itâs not stated as such in any advertisements.  i personally think they are.  there are six exchangeable âreplace-a-pointâ threaded nib units.  this feature was similar to esterbrookâs system, but the nibs are not interchangeable.  the pen alone sold for $1.95 and for $3.25 with a matching twist action pencil.read the story about this interesting pen here!

parker 61 jet flighter 1959-1962

inspired by the jet age, parker introduced the 61 jet flighter model in  1959 with its cap and barrel made of "lustraloy" brushed stainless steel, chrome plated trim, and fitted with a 14 karat gold hooded nib unit.  it was packaged in a special box with graphics of the jet flighter name with a douglas dc-8 silhouette.  the 61 jet flighter is more angular, more tapered, and narrower than its 51 flighter predecessor. both the cap top and barrel end of the 61 jet flighter are fitted with gray plastic "jewels."  the dc-8 was part of the new wave of american made jetliners and the association would tie the pen to high tech.  parker formally announced the new pen to retailers in the september 1959 parkergrams u.s.a.read the story about this interesting jet age pen here!

victor victapen standard size c. late 1930s

up to now, many might think the c. 1932â1949 convertible compact victapen purely as a small pen, sold with a matching pencil, where the two could be reconfigured into a 5 to 5 â½ inch long pen and pencil combo by removing the caps from the barrels of both the fountain pen and the pencil, putting the pencil point onto the end of the pen barrel, and replacing the pen cap back on.  this example appears to be identical to the smaller victapen except for size.  are there any more out there?read the story about this beautiful pen here!

sheaffer triumph masterpiece ii c. 1945-1947

sheaffer revised the triumph pen and pencil line in 1945, making it more rounded, changing to a new clip design, changing the section, and adding a spring loaded mechanism to the clip.  the update included a redesigned triumph masterpiece ii pen and pencil shown in the 1946 catalog and the masterpiece stratowriter ballpoint pen was added in the 1947 catalog.  the triumph masterpiece ii continued in this form until sheaffer began to install the white dot in the cap and/or the touchdown line was introduced.  the sheaffer triumph masterpiece ii is a little shorter and less ornate than its predecessor.  the cap is more rounded, complemented by a more rounded, spring loaded clip.read the story about this beautiful pen here!

sheaffer triumph masterpiece c. 1942-1944

what does the word "masterpiece" bring to mind? a dictionary definition would be, "a work of outstanding artistry, skill, or workmanship," and "an artist's or craftsman's best piece of work." a pen with that name would be expected to meet the very highest standards. it would have to represent the very best work of the pen company that offers it.  there is very limited original documentation specific to the sheaffer triumph masterpiece pen and pencil. most of the reference material points to the time before and after the pen was offered, with a couple of direct sheaffer documents confirming the pen existed in the triumph line from at least 1942 and dealer advertisements offering the pen and pencil set through 1945.read the story about this beautiful pen set here!

aikin lambert combination retracting pen holder and pencil c. 1880-90s

a very interesting find made in a new bern, north carolina antique store several years ago.  this is an aikin lambert combination retracting dip pen holder and retracting twist mechanical pencil c. 1880-90s, complete with the original box.  fully open, as shown, the instrument is 4 7/8 inches long.  closed, it's a tiny 2 11/16 inches long. the nib extends by pushing the knurled band on the barrel from the pencil end toward the open end where the nib is hidden. the nib slips onto a tab that holds it in place and is kept inside the barrel when not in use.  the very flexible gold nib is stamped aikin over lambert over & co over no 4 over m, a medium flexible nib.  the mechanical pencil extends by pulling it out from the barrel and the lead advances and retracts by twisting the knob near the tip where the lead comes out.  a beautiful and complex tiny writing instrument that is as much jewelry as it is functional.read the story about this interesting writing instrument here!

lambrou pens mirage prototype c. 2017

this is the lambrou pens mirage prototype fountain pen made c. 2017. the mirage name comes from the alternating stacked engraved bands, each a deeply cut reeded edge, sometimes called âcoin edgeâ that are cut at opposite 45 degree angles that create a strong contrast and emphasize each band.  the geometric pattern does not have a formal name.  andreas lambrou credited his assistant, monica c jimenez, for picking out this pattern for the prototype.  the engraving was done on a modern computerized machine using brass blanks for each of the cap and barrel parts by the r. murelli company, an independent, specialty guillocheur workshop located in domont, france.read the story about this interesting pen here!

lambrou pens zj2 gaia prototype 2012

this is the lambrou pens zj2 gaia prototype fountain pen made in 2012.  gaia or gaea, in greek, îî±î¯î±, is the ancient greek personification of the goddess the earth. gaia was the mother of the titans, the gigantes, the erinyes or furies, and the cyclopes.  the guilloche engraving uses deep vertical and horizontal cuts crossing and meeting at right angles to represent the terrain where the decisive battle of thermopylae, between the small army of spartan hoplites and other greeks against the huge persian army invading greece.  the battle took place in 480 bc.  the geometric pattern is otherwise unnamed.  there is no direct connection between gaia and thermopylae, so the chosen names may simply be to tie the pen and design to elements of greek mythology.read the story about this interesting pen here!

classic pens zj2 iliad diamond spirale prototype c. 2009

the zj2 iliad prototype is a 5 3/4 inch long cartridge/converter fountain pen based on the large size lambrou pens mythos model 878.  the diamond spirale design is intended to represent the strength, justice, and courage virtues of achilles, the great greek hero of the trojan war and homerâs iliad.  this zj2 iliad silver plated prototype fountain pen gets the iliad name because it is engraved with the same diamond spirale pattern as on the 1995 classic pens cp3 iliad.  this is the second in a series on zj2 prototype pens.read the story about this interesting pen here!

classic pens zj2 parisienne vannerie prototype 2009

this prototype is the classic pens zj2 parisienne vannerie, the follow-up to the zj1 mozaique.  like the zj1 mozaique, the design was intended to be engraved the entire length of the pen to the edges, taking advantage of the cylindrical shape with its flatter ends. this is very eye catching, as the design literally flows from end to end, as if running underneath the cap band, the clip washer and the barrel trim ring. the oversize cylindrical shape in this prototype also gives the cap top and barrel end cap a slight taper. it was also intended to fit an even larger nib size.read the story about this interesting pen here!

popura ink shut off eyedropper pen in chã´shitsu style c. 1930-1937

popura is a less known, possibly obscure japanese pen company that put a lot of effort into labeling their products with the brand name on clips, nibs and barrels. since this article about this single popura pen was published in 2017, more information has come available that fills in some of the missing parts of the story about the brand. this popura ink shut off eyedropper fountain pen dates from about 1930 to 1937 because of the balance design and that it has a 14 karat gold nib without jis markings. unlike many pens from early small japanese manufacturers that used rather generic hardware and trim pieces, this pen has branded metal parts. the gold plated clip is stamped with the brand name popura in a distinctive font. the nib is also stamped with the popura brand along with full details: 14kt. gold over popura over registered over 3 over tokyo over nippon. itâs not known if the company made their own nibs or, more likely, bought them with custom stamping.read the story about this interesting pen here!

pilot short s-150ss fountain pen with telescoping section c. 1966-1969

the pilot short is among the many 1960s to 1980s japanese pens that are short and compact when capped and  become long enough for comfortable writing when the cap is posted on the end of the barrel.  to make this work, the cap and section are both quite long for the size of the pen.  the pilot short has an added feature: the section can be extended by pulling on it, which increases the posted length from 5 1/16 to 5 5/8 inches, making it a very compact pen closed and still a comfortable pen to write with. because of this quirky feature, the pilot short pens are often called âshort telescopingâ or âlong-short.â the cap proportion to the barrel is less dramatic than on the pilot elite s and other similar pens, making the pilot short the one with the shorter cap.read the story about these interesting pens here!

lambrou pens ln2 harvest prototype 2020

the lambrou pens ln2 harvest artist proof shown here was made in july 2020.  itâs a 6 inch long lambrou pens oversize legend hand crafted by paul rossi from flame red diffusion bonded acrylic with a rossi made sterling silver floral design clip.  the artwork is by yoshitsugu nakama, and because nakama is allergic to urushi sap the decoration is made with an inert material he seals with epoxy resin. the harvest design is based on the an original watercolor by jenny lambrou that was used for the other classic pens / lambrou pens harvest models and represents harvest time on the island of cyprus. nakamaâs interpretation is painted the cap and barrel with grapevine leaves, bunches of grapes, wheat stalks, and morning glory flowers over a pale yellow-brown coating to highlight the wheat artwork.read the story about this interesting pen here!

lambrou pens rossi harvest prototype 2009

in 2009, paul rossi was asked to create a sterling silver overlay pen with a similar design as the 2001 classic pens lr2 harvest with a few notable changes.  this design is executed on 1.5 mm thick sterling silver tubes that allowed rossi to carve the high relief design and with the textures and details that enhance the individual components of the work.  the final design is a composition of intertwined morning glory flowers and wheat stalks on the cap and barrel overlays with a silhouette of the island of cyprus surrounded with the design on the barrel sleeve.  the island image pulls the design into the local scenery that inspired it.  other new design elements include olive branches engraved on the bands above and below the barrel sleeve and extending the cap sleeve to the edge of the cap lip, creating a sense that the overlay extends continuously from the cap to the barrel when the pen is closed.  the clip is hand crafted by rossi in sterling silver.  paul rossi placed his hallmark on the cap band and top barrel band.read the story about this interesting pen here!

lambrou pens psarã³varka prototype 2010

this prototype is the lambrou pens psarã³varka or ïî±ïïî²î±ïîºî± in greek.  it was made in 2010 using a brass legend 778l as the base for the guillochage work.  psarã³varka or ïî±ïïî²î±ïîºî± is a greek word used for small fishing boats, and the deep engraving, with its broad braided look, evokes the heavy corded nets and ropes used on them.  like the cp8, itâs a 6 inch long cartridge/converter fountain pen.  the r. murelli company used a modern circular engraver to complete the guillochage work.  the finished pen was then coated with 5 microns of silver plate to provide an example of how it would look in sterling silver.  like the cp8, the engraving extends past the clip and also to the round end of the barrel.  the clip is a hand crafted sterling silver piece by paul rossi.  the nib is a g-380, 18-karat gold nib unit with ebonite feed by peter bock and is rhodium plated to compliment the sterling silver clip and trim.read the story about this interesting pen here!

vogue streamlined fountain pens c. 1941-1948

parker 75 americana 1975

the parker 75 americana, often called the parker 75 bicentennial, is probably the least parker 75 pen there is.  the cap and barrel shape say 75, and with the cap off, the section and nib confirm it.  yet cap on, itâs quite visually different, starting with the clip.  instead of the expected parker arrow type found on every other 75, this clip is a tapered bar that ends in a ball and is possibly made from the same pewter as the rest of the pen.  perhaps since the pen is an homage to a much earlier period in american history, parker thought the clip should also reflect an earlier time, like the ball end 1916 patent clips of the early parker duofold and jack knife pens.  the cap top (crown) and barrel end tassies are also different, tapered and cup like, with the top one having a wood insert.read the story about this interesting pen here!

esterbrook classic m2 c. 1959-1962

esterbrookâs most popular and best-selling fountain pen has to be the j series.  they remain popular today and are the focus of many pen collectors.  less well known are the several esterbrook models that follow the j series, including this one, the classic m2, one of the few squeeze filler equipped esterbrook pens.  the 5 1/4 inch long classic m2 was designed by henry dreyfuss, the gist of which appears to be the crease in the cap top, like the crease in a fedora.  the cap is polished stainless steel and comes in two versions, one with a plain chrome plated clip and the company name stamped on the cap band and the other with esterbrook stamped down the chrome plated clip and with a plain cap band.  the best feature is the pen can use any of the 32 different screw in esterbrook re-new-point nibs.read the story about this interesting pen here!

eagle pencil company reversible nickel plated penholder c. 1870s-early 1900s

this simple, plain eagle pencil company reversible nickel plated penholder is similar to many other reversible pocket pen holders made in the late 1800s through the early 1900s.  it's a 4 5/16 inch dip pen holder (capped) designed to house the nib unit safely in the barrel when not in use and reversed and inserted into the barrel when needed, making the pen holder convenient for pockets and purses. the barrel is stamped eagle pencil co. ny.  it appears in the eagle pencil company c. 1900 catalog, but it's likely that these were made at least as early if not much earlier than 1887, when eagle introduced the arrow pen-holder, an improvement on this type.read the story about this interesting pen here!

yotubishi raden decorated pen c. 1957

this c. 1957 yotsubishi ink shut-off fountain pen is decorated using the raden technique with a variety of colored, crushed abalone shell pieces including various shades of purple, pink, green and gold, inlaid into the surface of the dark urushi coated lacquer cap, barrel and nib section.  the clip has the yotsubishi four diamond logo stamped at the clip top.  the cap band is rolled gold.  the gold nib is stamped warranted over 585 over 14karat over pen over iridosumin over the jis mark flanked with 4 and 0.  the jis number cannot be seen but the stamping is identical to a nib on another yotsubishi raden decorated pen, so it may be marked 4622.  a balance shaped yotsubishi pen with the same raden pearl chips inlay design is shown from a 1957 ishi-shoten catalog page in fountain pens of japan on page 112.  the caption says there were over twenty pearl inlay designs available in that catalog.read the story about this interesting pen here!

platinum clear fountain pen c. 1952-1955

this c. 1952-1955 platinum squeeze filler fountain pen has a clear plastic cap and barrel and a price band, indicating it was a production pen, not a sales demonstrator.  the paper band shows a price of 550 yen, about $5.00 in todayâs dollars.  it reads "gold plated platinum pen" over "platinum" over â¥550.  this 4 7/8 inch long model would date from at least 1951 when nibs were marked with the japanese industrial standards mark.  the clip is stamped r14 at the top, indicating 14 karat rolled gold, above the name platinum. the gold plated steel nib is stamped platinum over 10 year over iridium over the jis symbol.  the jis number is unreadable in the section.   this arrow clip style, with platinum stamped down the top, is seen on pens dated as early as 1950.  the cap and nib section are showing a lot of crazing, unfortunately.read the story about this interesting pen here!

yotubishi kawari-nuri sakura (cherry) bark pattern c. 1955-1959

this is a c. 1955-1959 yotsubishi fountain pen decorated with a kawari-nuri technique sakura (cherry) bark pattern.  the free form artwork recreates the pattern using contrasting yellow/gold elements in the red urushi lacquer base.  itâs 5 1/4 inches long with gold filled trim and uses a squeeze type filler, possibly aerometric (which would require a feed tube), that dates the pen to the 1950s, following the lead of the filler design in the parker 51 aerometric. the gold nib is stamped warranted over 14k over the jis mark over 3253 over 4.read the story about this interesting pen here!

criterion fountain pen c. 1923-1926

this is a criterion machine engraved gold plated lever fill pen and pencil set c. 1923-1926.  the engraving pattern is repeating panels of lines and boxes running the length of the cap and barrel. the clip on the pen is an interesting design where the clip appears to have three parts:  the flat, ball ended clip,  the part that crimps onto the cap, and a wide band that appears to hold the two pieces together.  the clip face and the band are stamped criterion down the face.  the lever is cleverly stamped filler, in case the user just might be confused as to what it's for, making those the only two markings on either writing instrument.  the nib is stamped warranted over 14k, a nice gold nib on an obviously inexpensively made pen.  itâs about 5 1/8" long capped, and the pencil is almost the same length.read the story about these interesting pens here!

yotubishi raden tanzaku decorated pen c. 1957

when i pulled this pen out of the box, i was immediately struck by the cool touch of the sterling silver, combined with the sharp edges of the deep engraving. the piece is heavy and cool, like a flighter, and warms up in the hand the same way, but no flighter has the feel of this pen!  this piece was made by sergio kullock, and is hallmarked "sterling silver" and "sk" on the back of the cap. the parker name is engraved on the cap front, as on the parker 51 aero-metric signet all gold-filled pen.  i've seen three examples of this engraved sterling silver pen, one of which had a chrome plated clip.read the story about this interesting pen here!

this is a yotubishi black hard rubber fountain pen with a design carved and then lacquered resembling a shakuhachi å°ºå« (japanese bamboo flute), c. 1955-1957.  the ishi-shoten yotsubishi pen company consistently marked their pens on the clip top or cap band with the companyâs four diamond logo.  in some cases, the clip may be stamped yotubisi.  those maker's marks are absent from this example.  a visually identical pen is shown on a page from the 1957 ishi-shoten catalog, appearing on page 113 of fountain pens of japan.  the caption says âchikoku (bamboo look), lacquered hard rubber,â though a literal meaning for chikoku éå» may be slow carving.read the story about this interesting pen here!

maruzen athena pens with sheaffer triumph style nibs c. 1950-1952

these maruzen pens were the first japanese pens i have seen with a direct copy of a sheaffer triumph nib, but they were not alone. there are navy brand and several unbranded pens with similar conical nibs. these post world war ii athena pens are examples of maruzenâs return to making quality pens.  one line is clearly inspired by mid 1940s sheaffer triumph fountain pens to the degree that they have a similar conical nib, ribbed nib section, and balance shape.  they look like japanese sheaffer pens in the same way that many other companies copied parker 51s.  the second athena line has a cap and barrel shape and style more like the 1940s parker duofold, though without the striped plastic.  removing the cap reveals the same sheaffer triumph style nib and section as on the balance shape pens.read the story about these interesting pens here!

sheaffer gold imperial, model as9g c. 1958-59

no sooner was the original 2015 article on the all plastic cap and barrel sheaffer imperial model as9 finished when more information became available on this very similar sheaffer pen.  at first, it looks like sheaffer took the imperial as9 and stuck a gold filled cap on it.  taking the cap off reveals itâs a pull off type, not a threaded type as on the imperial as9.  and then there is the palladium silver nib.  shouldn't it be a gold nib like on the imperial as9?  is this a touchdown skripsert?  another sleuthing adventure awaits!read the story about these interesting pens here!

sheaffer imperial, model as9 c. 1959-60

this is a mystery pen.  if this is an imperial, why is it nothing like the later imperials that look like junior size pfms? we need to work backwards from the introduction of the imperial iv, the first imperial that used an inlaid nib, first mentioned in the january, 1961 sheaffer's review. there is limited original documentation on this early and mostly overlooked imperial, but enough to identify and date it. the primary sources are a sheaffer england retail price list dated april 7, 1959, undated catalog pages from 1959 or 1960, and the sheaffer repair manual model description page.read the story about these interesting pens here!
