accommodating to our last-minute order by sending through via express post without extra charges. all cameras work and the custom design on the cameras were as good as it showed on their website.

they were great! they were able to provide everything for us last minute and were so easy to deal with. even though we had a professional photographer and a photo booth we still found that the disposable cameras were such a great hit and captured all of those candid moments. some of the photos are hilarious!

i’ve never ordered from here before and they went above and beyond what an online store normally would to make sure i got the right order and that it got to me in time for my sister’s wedding. very happy with the service and very happy in particular with an employee by the name of helen, i’ll definitely be coming back!

i purchased my save the date, invitations and disposable cameras. they were very helpful in the design and easy to deal with. everything arrived quickly and great quality.


amber c















 








 
we purchased 10 disposable cameras for our wedding ceremony. there were many designs and themes to choose from and they arrived express post within two days. their developing costs were very reasonable (cheaper than phto stores) and their inclusion at our reception added another photographic dimension to our big day.
