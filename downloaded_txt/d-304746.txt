turbo debate challenge goes publicby mark dipaola  newington  - a debate challenge for the 27th assembly district house race went public last week, with the campaign for democratic candidate gary turco putting out a press release urging republican incumbent gary byron to commit. 
byron says that he already has and that he's still working out a format proposal with his campaign team, but last week democratic town committee chair john kelly said that the press release was an effort to expedite a process that he feels has been less than encouraging. 
at this point, were nowhere with them, kelly said over the phone. they have responded, but more for the sake of responding than advancing the effort. 
turcos press release tuesday-sent to members of the media last tuesday-is calling for a series of one-on-one debates throughout the weeks leading up to the november 6 election. 
we need to have an honest exchange of views on how the state can make healthcare
services more affordable, how to create growth in our economy that truly helps middle
class families, and deliver property tax reform-just to name a few of the important
issues-so voters know exactly where each of us stands, turco wrote in the statement.

the conventional logic is that an incumbent has more to lose in such an arena than a challenger trying to gain exposure, but byron told the rare reminder last week that he's more than willing to take part in a debate, although due to his schedule as an elected official, he'd only have time for one.
we've had a discussion, and we've agreed to it in principle, byron said. i'm happy to do a debate-i think some of the details need to be worked out.

byron campaign manager mark pappa did not respond to requests for comment after the press release was put out, but he too, has indicated that their team is willing to hold a debate and is just mulling over the details. 

the problem, kelly says, is that they are running out of time, and the party chair has accused the byron team of implementing stall tactics he claims that they used two years ago, when democratic challenger josh shulman tried to set up a debate. 

â€œfrankly, we still have time for all three, but when you don't want to do it, you can just play down the clock,â€ kelly said. 

but back in 2016, the shulman campaign chose to negotiate the terms through the press, byron said. local news outlets-including this one-were asked to facilitate event logistics with nctv, which has traditionally broadcasted debates for municipal elections , but the byron campaign charged that their involvement in the planning process preempted both sides agreeing to do it in the first place. 

i only remember one debate in the whole history of that seat, and all of a sudden, it's an important thing, byron said. 

while mayoral debates-up until last year-have been a tradition of municipal elections, similar events for state races can be more of a rarity, says nctv host steve parker and longtime station volunteer scott allo. 

the only tape nctv has of a debate for the 27th house district is from 2010 when former democratic representative sandy nafis squared off with republican challenger meg casasanta. byron-a former nctv host, and parker moderated that one together.

but kelly, who stated that nafis was always willing to debate, says that the history shouldn't be relevant-that. it's about what the voters deserve here and now. 

forget the party chair stuff-as a citizen, i'd expect that every two years, my representative would want to have a discussion about the issues affecting the state, kelly said. 

when asked what those issues would be, both sides indicated a desire to discuss the state's economy/budgetary woes. kelly also listed â€œtypes of transportation funding. 

i owe that to the voters to discuss my stance on the issues and how i'd vote differently than my opponent, turco said. i'm available every day from now until election day.

what format the two sides will come to-if discussions continue-is yet to be seen, but parker, who says he'd be happy to get involved again, says he'd be in favor of a less structured approach that allows both candidates to field questions from the public, as opposed to the pre-negotiated issue categories characteristic of traditional debates. 

we have two very likable guys going against each other, parker said over the phone. i'd love to see that [town hall] auditorium filled with people throwing questions at them from both sides.
