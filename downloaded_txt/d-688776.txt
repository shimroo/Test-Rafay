seo is the answer





here is my next post about the steps to learn promoting your products using seo marketing.  i am a little delayed sending this because i am quite busy working on my art projects.

in this blog, i will be showing you my experience and results learning this marketing technique.  these blog posts that i will be writing will also be like a diary of my online marketing venture and you will see my artistic creations that i am working on.

during my experience learning this seo, i have done a few sites using this method and found that some of the sites that i have created did not actually show great results, some are still in the growing stage.  what i have learned to improve would be to optimize the ones that are showing results.

i know that some of you might be skeptical about this process especially to the ones that are just new to this.  i understand this because it also happened to me when i first started out.  based on my research and self-study i found the correct way to do this, which i will be happy to share with you.

the first step to do is to figure out how much money you want to earn monthly.  be realistic knowing that you are just a beginner in this seo venture.  next, choose which products you will be able to create for your website that will be popular for your niche or zazzle store.

once you have figured this out apply this step-by-step seo process that has been writtene below which i will be explaining more in detail in my next blog posts. 


apply the basics of seo marketing: 1)   keyword research / find the money keywords: 
outside the internet it is called market research.  money keywords are the targeted words being searched by people who are looking for your product online and ready to buy it.

2)   register & host your domain name:
create an exact match domain name for your site and get it hosted.
  
3)   build your site using wordpress:
create your site using wordpress theme 

4)   monetize your website: 
make your site earn money and increase profit    

5)   create content that are search engine optimize:
make articles,  videos,  podcast,  viral images, etc. optimized with seo

6)  traffic building:
optimize your site by applying the “on page” & “off page seo” creating backlinks to increase traffic.

7)   maintain your site: 
update and add new content

knowledge is power!   you can multiply your income by creating more sites using this seo strategy.  to be honest, getting results and beginning to see money generating from your websites cannot be accomplished in the next 24 hours after building your sites.  it will take time!  you will see results between three to six months or even a year.

some people get results early within a month.  it all depends on your learning process and most importantly by literally putting this seo marketing knowledge into action.  so be patient!  the best is that you already know the secret of seo marketing and the key to make it work is by applying this as early as you can.  this is the way to go to see results early in your business. so don’t delay but start now!

remember this seo marketing process is not only applicable to your zazzle products but also applicable to your fine art or commercial websites.  if you are not into art, this seo strategy can also be applied to any type of products or services.  you are free to expand your empire of physical or digital product websites online and earn the monthly income you desire.  it is limitless!

in my next blog post, i will explain to you in detail the different steps of seo marketing that i mentioned above and how to apply each of them.  let us learn to promote in the intelligent way.  join the ride!  do not forget to subscribe to my blog so that you will not miss this?

has this seo information helpful to you?  do you think this will be useful to sell your products online and help you in your art marketing plans?  i am working on applying this seo strategy to my zazzle products.  i truly believe this will be great!  what do you  think?  i would love to hear your thoughts and questions about this subject.  please don’t hesitate to contact me with any concerns or insights.

learn seo for art marketing





a few months ago, i became interested in learning about seo marketing, which i am applying now to my art marketing plans.   after learning it for the past couple of months, i came to realized that we could also use this in promoting our zazzle products, fine art and commercial art sites.   if you are not into art, this seo strategy is also applicable to any type of products or services which i will explain in my upcoming posts.   i encourage you to sign up to my blog and submit your email to follow my future posts so that you won't miss the seo strategy that i will be revealing to you. stay tuned!

before you begin reading this i would like to thank you for stopping by and giving me a chance to write this article and share with you the knowledge that i know about seo, which i am hoping will be a great help for you to apply in your online sales success. i will do my very best to share with you what i know.

perhaps most of you do not know yet what i am talking about with seo.   what is seo?  it is called “search engine optimization.”  it is a process to get traffic or visitors to your site in a natural or organic way to help search engine rank your site higher in search activities.  using this effectively to sell online is our goal.

i want to be an instrument to begin your road to online marketing success. this will be a great solution to most of our concerns in how to make money as an artist or how to make money online in general. 

what would you expect in this blog?

you will be able to follow my progress studying seo marketing and apply it in your online business as you learn.   you will begin promoting your products online in a new and effective way.   you will discover a better way on how to sell your art online.   your website’s income will improve as you apply this knowledge.   you will see case studies of sites using this seo marketing techniques.

having this knowledge about seo marketing,  i started creating a few websites.   one of my affiliate sites which is non-art site,  has started making revenues already.  i begin to see results coming in after the many hours i spent learning this.  you will see insights of some of my site’s progress in my upcoming posts.

get results

in months of learning this seo marketing techniques,  i have seen people who have this knowledge created sites and earned a great amount of money on autopilot.  they started their online business with low overhead and promoting their products or services by just using the internet and the computer at home.

i will give you an example to show you how this works.  let us say you created 10 mini websites ( 3 to 5 pages) where each of them promoting a specific product like; digital camera, shed plans, baby scooter, plasma tv, cell phone, shoes, etc.  each of these sites generating an average sale of about $100 to $500, or more each month.  if you will do the math for 10 sites with sales of $100 to $500 each, will generate a total amount of around $1,000 to $5,000 per month.  i will show you how this will translate to our zazzle products.  for those of you who don't know, zazzle.com is a great website where you can create different kinds of products with your art printed on it.

let us say you have chosen 10 product types; postage, iphone cases, cards, water bottle, business cards, etc. and you created a mini website to each of these using the seo strategy.  after applying this process, each of these generated an average sale of $50 to $300 or more each month.  so with 10 sites you will generate about $500 to $3,000 or more sales per month. we can even increase more our income by creating more than 10 sites selling other kinds of products with quality content.

after learning the secret, i found out that creating sites to sell our products is not just joining forums, commenting on blogs, or telling your friends and prospects about your business but it is more to that.  it all depends on applying seo in your website’s marketing activities.

in my upcoming posts i will reveal to you the secret knowledge of seo marketing that i have learned so that you can apply them to any product lines or services that you are thinking of selling online.  i created a few sites already applying this knowledge, however, i have not applied this yet to my zazzle product lines.  i am sure this will have a great improvement on our site’s income.  i am planning on working this and i will let you in this blog how it goes.

base on the examples that i mentioned above i can see that we can increase our zazzle sales by applying this seo techniques and not only useful for art related products but also to any products that are being sold online.  on my next post, i will show you how this will be effective in generating income to our sites.  do not forget to subscribe to my blog so that you will not miss this!

what's in your mind? 

is this seo information helpful to you?  do you think this will be useful to sell your products online and help you in your art marketing plans or any online business?  what do you  think?  i would love to hear your thoughts and questions about this subject, so share your words below and let us discuss this further!
