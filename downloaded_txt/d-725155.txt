cyber security solutions for a resilient future



in today's digital landscape, cyber security is not just a priority -it's a necessity. as cyber threats grow in sophistication, organisations must stay ahead of attackers by implementing robust, adaptive security strategies that protect critical assets, ensure compliance, and maintain operational resilience.
at a&o it group, we help financial institutions and enterprises build fortified cyber security defences that are proactive, resilient, and tailored to your specific business needs. our comprehensive cyber security services provide everything from assurance and real-time operations to incident management and disaster recovery, ensuring that your business stays secure 24/7.
with the global average cost of a data breach reaching €3.7 million in 2024, the importance of a strong cyber security framework cannot be overstated. organisations that fail to invest in robust security measures risk financial loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance penalties.

our core pillars of cyber security
we provide an integrated, multi-layered approach to cyber security, divided into three core pillars:








cyber consultancy
strengthening your security posture with expert guidance and strategic solutions by identifying vulnerabilities and advising on best practices to fortify your business.


                                    find out more
                                    










cyber assurance
ensuring that your security measures are aligned with industry standards and regulations, providing continuous compliance and robust risk management.


                                    find out more
                                    










cyber operations
24/7 threat detection and response ensure that your systems are monitored in real-time, and suspicious activity is mitigated before it causes harm.


                                    find out more
                                    






































why choose a&o it group for cyber security







 

proactive threat detection
our security operations center (soc) works around the clock, using al and machine learning to detect and neutralise threats before they impact your business. with 70% of large organisations experiencing at least one significant cyber attack in 2024, having proactive measures in place is critical.







 

compliance and governance
stay ahead of regulatory requirements with our tailored compliance solutions that ensure adherence to frameworks like gdpr, pci dss, and iso 27001. given that 83% of organisations are subject to at least one regulatory compliance framework, maintaining compliance is more vital than ever.







 

end-to-end incident response
be prepared for the unexpected. our incident response services are designed to minimise downtime, mitigate risks, and ensure fast recovery from any security breach. with average downtime costing businesses $300,000 per hour, having a robust incident response plan can save millions.







 

resilient business continuity
ensure your organisation is prepared for any disruption with our business continuity and disaster recovery (bcdr) solutions. a well- implemented bcdr strategy is crucial, as 93% of companies without a disaster recovery plan who suffer a major data loss are out of business within one year.
