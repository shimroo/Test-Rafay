we use cellica database for paperless form application internally, it is good for our users to capture
                                patient's complicated and detailed medical information. the favorite feature of cellica database is the synchronization
                                part which did a good job between db and ipad forms. i would recommend for all who want to have paperless forms. cellica
                                database is very simple to use and the respond time from sales and supports is very "short".
