one of these days i'll find the
  one that ticks all my boxes
  and you'll say you wish you were him.
  and i might laugh and tell you it could have been.

one  of these days
you'll tell me
  about your wife,
and how
  she's become the joy of your entire life.
one of
  these days you'll tell me about your children,
and that
  you never knew how you existed before them.

one of
  these days i'll tell you i never found someone,
  and
  that every time i think of us my heart swallows the sun.
  one of these days i'll say my final goodbyes,
  and wish i could have loved you for a lifetime.

quote











all you do is lead me on and
  disappoint me.
  i don't want to care about you anymore.
  do not disturb is on.

  hate that you say what we have is different.
  hate that you got me this way.

  i wanted you till the end but this won't ever work for
  me.

  hate that my room is filled with the things you've gifted
  me
  hate that my mind is filled with the memories you've given
  me.

  but this won't ever work.
  you don't know how to love me.
  you don't know how to hear me.

  you just don't know how to be a man for me.
  you just can't ever seem to understand me
  and it's frustrating.

  you just stress me out and waste my time.
