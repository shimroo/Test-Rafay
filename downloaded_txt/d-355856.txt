twin cities-based mila vocal ensemble nourishes the human spirit with songs and stories of everyday life, collected from the folk traditions of eastern europe and russia. with powerful voices, meticulous precision, and breathtaking harmonies, mila evokes a primal response that is at once transporting and relevant.
























"the seven women of mila pitched yelps and slides into the mix like handfuls of garlic and hot paprika. the bulgarian sound was thrilling...."









"we are enriched and inspired by the splendor of your art, reaching across time and space to transfix us with breath-catching beauty."









"unbelievably perfect harmony...what passion in your voices!"









"hearing mila on prairie home companion so reminded me of first hearing the bulgarian women's chorus in 1954 that i wept for the beauty for your singing and my memories."
