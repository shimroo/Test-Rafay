about the cr&t 



who we arein 1968, richard t. silver, md, a prominent hematologist-oncologist, founded the cancer research & treatment fund (cr&t) with the belief that investing in blood cancer research would lead to important breakthroughs, as well as a better understanding of the biology and treatment of all forms of cancer.  while the focus of the organization is the myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns), over the course of its 56-year history, cr&t has awarded more than $17 million in grants to research that has contributed to major advances in the fight against cancer.
