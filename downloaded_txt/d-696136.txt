campusesour two-campus advantage gives girls the edge.

laurel girls are in the right place at the right time.at our lyman campus in shaker heights, kindergarten, first and second graders begin their journey through primary school. • third, fourth and fifth graders complete the primary years just seven miles away at our 150-acre butler campus in russell township. • girls return to the lyman campus for middle and upper school to embark on sixth through twelfth grades.
while we benefit from being a two-campus school that provides flexible indoor and outdoor learning spaces, we are one school when it comes to our philosophical approach to our students.
