helping to craft thoughtful responses to pressing social issues

























capd's missioncapd’s mission is to help foundations, communities, organizations and public systems craft and execute thoughtful responses to pressing social issues. the central theme of our work is positive social change and our goal is to help those we work with develop their capacity to make change.capd’s work is national in scope and includes research and evaluation, strategic planning, and policy analysis. our work is characterized by a “theory of change” approach, focus on results and outcomes, and a racialized perspective.















please click here to support racial equity tools.org! we are excited about the upcoming possibilities this year to make continued and deep progress for racial equity. we want to continue to keep up with the evolving needs of the racial justice community. our current website platform is outdated, and due to the site’s add-ons, it is cost-prohibitive to update it on this platform. we have an imediate need to migrate ret to a new platform that is sustainable.  thank you for your support!















this presentation is tailored for groups and individuals who are interested in evaluating leadership efforts, and includes valuable tips for “thinking like an evaluator” and ways to incorporate power analysis and a mission-focused lens when designing and carrying out such evaluations. the accompanying worksheet is meant to help track strategies, evidence, outcomes and stories. we hope these are helpful resources. thanks to yoojin janice lee and the leadership development learning community of the robert sterling clark foundation, for whom we originally created these materials. 















we were pleased to present at the alliance for nonprofit management’s 2018 conference - please click here to see a copy of our presentation. in the session, stephanie shared some details the current state of the field for organizational assessment and racial equity, ways to make the case for why this work is important, and presented a range of resources for folks to deepen their knowledge on the topic. thanks to our colleagues mala and keith for co-creating and presenting with us, and to everyone who participated in the session! 















we are grateful to dr. kelly hannum and the luminaire group for sharing this thoughtful conversation with our president, sally leiderman. click here to read about sally’s path to evaluation, her understanding of the importance of an equity lens, and her thoughts about where the field is headed next.
