burman's size in terms of student body has helped me connect to teachers and fellow students more easily and helped me to create friendships and bonds which i believe will last forever. the smaller size also creates unity, as a family for me and any individuals. we come to burman and it helps us to get to know each other in all aspects academically, spiritually, and personally. the small class sizes have positively impacted my burman experience. i can easily address and get in touch with my professor and i feel a true connection with my teachers and fellow students.
