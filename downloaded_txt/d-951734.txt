city winds trio and city winds piano trio are distinguished classical music trios that have been  performing concerts throughout the east coast since 2001. both trios create a unique sound because of the unusual combination of instruments found within each group.
city winds trio formed in december 2001 playing for the new york lawyers association and we thought these instruments sounded great together. a couple weeks later in february of 2002 we auditioned for the prestigious chamber series at trinity church and st. paul’s chapel in new york city, over 90 ensembles auditioned and we were one of the few selected. we then perform in february of 2003 to the largest crowd in the history of the series for a wind group. that same year we performed at the notable cathedral st. john divine on their chapel series to a standing room only crowd. in january 2005 we performed on the prestigious united methodist of morristown new jersey noon day series and were featured in the daily record plus cover story. this series (2005) in which we participated on, won the 2005 award for outstanding arts organization presented by the arts council of the morris area. city winds trio has performed on over 100 notable chamber music series throughout the east coast including: trinity church, st. paul’s chapel, riverside church, cathedral st. john the divine, st. alban’s, bryant park, tudor city and more….. in the summer of 2009 city winds trio made their debut at the national music festival musikfest 2009 in bethlehem pa and returned august 2014. 2013 city winds trio made their debut at the newark united methodist church newark, delaware. each year the trio continues to perform on prestigious concert series throughout the east coast.
