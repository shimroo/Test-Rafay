welcome to aikido in fredericksburg
here at aikido in fredericksburg we have a thriving community of students young and old—some just beginning, others with decades of experience—who train together in the traditional, non-violent japanese martial art of aikido. we offer free trial classes for anyone interested in joining us, so please do!
what is aikido?
aikido is a martial art that focuses on harmonizing with your opponent to bring peaceful resolutions to situations involving conflict. aikido is non-competitive, taught in a cooperative manner, good exercise, and fun!
one’s goal in aikido is to redirect the opponent’s energy and neutralize an attack, preferably without harm.
why do aikido?
in addition to learning about self-defense, most people find that aikido can teach one how to deal with the stresses of daily living and to acquire a general sense of well-being. the ultimate goal in aikido is for the individual to develop mental, physical, and spiritual integration.
students of all ages have different reasons for learning and practicing aikido. we welcome them all.
you can learn a lot about aikido and our non-profit dojo on this website, or better yet, come and train with us to experience the benefits that aikido training has to offer you.

if you are looking for a place to immerse yourself in aikido, have the desire to partake in the uchideshi experience, or just happen to be seeking good aiki practice and community in a rural and beautiful location, come check out aikido in fredericksburg, virginia (usa).
there is a tremendous humanitarian investment here. aikido of fredericksburg promotes the beautiful art of aikido, enhances the mindset of environmental guardianship, and elevates the responsibility of service to others.
i have just completed a week of teaching in residence there and felt the need to bring this information forward for any of you who might have interest.
i highly recommend it.

training, especially with fellow aikidoka in different countries, gives me hope for humanity.

marc

our world today, needs so many people like you. that rise up and put into operation the ethic of the japanese culture and the richness it possesses.
just want you to know how precious you and  meaningful the dojo has been to us, our family and our new way of life in fxbg.
just wanted you to again know.  i  am and will continue to be eternally grateful for you and aikido in our lives.

paulette johnson

we are happy to support your dojo when we can.  you have taught me a lot, about aikido and also about marketing, running a business, etc. and i really appreciate it.


lisa

at the end of the seminar today, you asked for our personal experience, and in less than 30 seconds.
i thought that was brilliant of you. (i’ve been listening to harry potter books and my vocabulary has magically increased.)
here i can thank you, again, for providing the aikido experience that i value, even if i’m dragged in nervous and timid.
and for the experience you provide that all the others value too — to the uchi dechi (a good group) and to the seriously intimidating sensei-s (just kidding) from near and far, and to everyone in between.

gordon

i have to say that i am so thankful to have had this second opportunity to train at your dojo; your aikidoka are an amazing group of people and exceptionally gracious teachers to poor students like me.

looking to the future, i hope to be able to visit and uchideshi for a week or so during one of the dojo’s jo months–i have a lot of jo to learn from aikido in fredericksburg!

scott

tantastic seminar with wolfgang shihan last weekend! thank you to you, donna san and dojo for everything you all did to make it possible!

jim

thank you for keeping such a magnificent center of peace and training alive and flourishing

craig

james really enjoyed the classes

james sr.

my daughter fell out of a high tree today – and all the other parents in the park gasped as she naturally went into an aikido roll before standing up without a scratch on her. definitely a useful skill at all ages!

meg

learning how to fall and get back up help me a great deal in my life

mike

i like how the community comes together at the dojo.

chelsea

i am so thankful that i came accross your aikido studio. i have struggled with having a hobby to work on in my retirement that wont bankrupt me. i have always yearned for confidence if and when a stranger confronted me, and or my family in a do or die  situation. i truly feel that i am in the right place to train me to gain that confidence that i am looking for.

rodney

we all had a wonderful time yesterday and today.  thank-you for all the work you put into organizing and making this happen.

cezanne











i’m really enjoying it. it’s challenging, but in a good way. everyone has been very helpful and patient with me, which is very appreciated because it feels like it can take awhile for me to catch on sometimes. i feel like things are starting to stick a little bit now. i’m excited to keep learning and training with everyone.











carley

she is loving her classes and the complete experience…this has been gift for us to see her grow in aikido.  she was so touched by how everyone encouraged her and congratulated her…. just a wonderful experience!!
