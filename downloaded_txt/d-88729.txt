when offshore electrics was founded in 2000, its goal was was to make rc boating   a hobby that is accessible to a larger group of people. as an activity that   takes up large amounts of time, money, and effort, it has, in the past, been an   incredibly exclusive community. however, through new technology and facilitated   processes, fast electric rc boating has has evolved into something that anybody   can participate with in some capacity. near the center of this all is offshore   electrics. as one of the early retailers to specialize in fast electric rc   boats, ose brought in dozens of brand names such as aeromarine laminates,   aquacraft, etti marine, proboat, octura and speedmaster, and under one roof.   there was no longer a need to search across the internet and go to various hobby   shops to find every part need for the boat assembly. as time would go on, newer   brands such as leopard and hobbywing would be added along with an expanding line   of exclusive ose brand parts. along with having a vast stock, ose is geared   towards supporting a wide range of interest levels in the hobby. from those who   wish to be immersed in the experience of building a bare hull or kit to the   person who wants to enjoy a ready to run (rtr) boat that will need no assembly.   from the hobbyist that wants to run at the local pond or lake for fun, to the   racing enthusiasts ready to compete in racing his craft to become number one. we   are able to provide for each endeavor.


  the other half of   offshoreelectrics.com is the 100% free ose forum. this is the first and, almost   always, the last place you need to visit to answer any question pertaining to rc   boating. our massive community of rc boaters, many members which have extensive   experience in the field or even have raced professionally bring ample knowledge   to the table. whether you are a newcomer just learning the basics or a long-time   veteran seeking new tricks, the ose forum most certainly has something to help   you.


  as a whole offshore electrics is a company that can provide the about   whatever you need to further your rc boat hobby. be with physical parts or the   knowledge needed to improve your setup, we are determined to make your   experience with us a positive one.
