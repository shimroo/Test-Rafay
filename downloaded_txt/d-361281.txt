do you love reggae music?

 

if you answered yes to this question, chances are you are already familiar with baltimore’s own jah works . if you are new to the band, you are in for a musical treat of positive vibes and uncompromising roots rock reggae music.jah works is a true grassroots success story that emerged from baltimore’s reggae scene over 20 years ago. this is music made by and for lovers of real, authentic reggae music. consistently performing hundreds of shows a year worldwide, they have forged their sound in clubs, festivals and on the sun drenched beaches of negril. their sound is firmly planted in the roots of jamaican music and culture, encompassing rock steady, reggae, and elements of dancehall and dub. what jah works does best is introduce the novice music listener to the fullness of reggae music and culture.formed in 1993, the band found their identity while listening to the song “jah works” by the classic jamaican vocal group the gladiators. lyrics like “i’m a man of prayer, none of my doings, shall ever go wrong…” and “jah hear i when i cry” resonated with the members, and so jah works was moved to begin writing their own original reggae music. starting with “feast or famine” in 1994, the band has recorded and released 9 albums to date. they have sold over 100,000 copies independently, and with the upcoming release of “believe”, jah works is set to take their music to even higher heights.longtime fans know that the jah works sound consists of strong vocals over heavy duty original reggae riddims. after a brief hiatus, founding member and original front man, scotty p. has returned to lead the brothers forward into new musical territory. together with the rest of the group, they have come up with their best album to date, “believe” which will be released in 2016. the new album brings the group's evolution full circle, with lush, horn drenched roots reggae music. mixed by some of reggae music’s top producers, including jim fox (lion & fox) tippy i (i grade), jason “jocko” randall (jbb), nathan sabanayagam (chillhouse studios), and baltimore’s own steve wright (wrightway), jah works’ latest and greatest effort will cement their standing as one of the finest reggae bands to ever come out of the united states. kevin gorman - guitarmike hamilton - bassscott paynter - lead vocalsjon pang - drumsnatty roc - sax and vocalsbrian gorman - keys
