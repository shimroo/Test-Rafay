welcome to uc berkeley cognitive science
the main objective of cognitive science is to provide a framework for bringing all the many disciplines that study the mind together into a cohesive whole. students in our programs draw on psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology, among other fields, to illuminate how the human mind works, and why it works the way it does. 
the program draws on over forty affiliated faculty from a variety of departments to offer an undergraduate major and a graduate designated emphasis in cognitive science.
