no retirement home
life alertâ® helps you maintain your independent life and can replace or delay the move to a retirement home. a 2004 acnielsen study found that life alertâ® members enter a retirement home 6 years later than seniors of the same age who donât use life alertâ®.



our years of experience
life alertâ® pairs unique technology with experienced emergency dispatchers to save lives. life alertâ® has twice the number of dispatchers per member compared to alarm companies and each year our expert dispatchers handle over two million emergency calls.
