about us
built by a home builder

looking back over my 30+ years in the construction industry, it’s fun to see the path from 12-year-old summer roofer to business owner. as so many of us in this field, i learned by doing: from helping my uncle between school years, to starting a construction company, and finally branching out into construction management. as my roles changed and business picked up i learned that the labor in the field was much simpler than the management of a company. my eye for detail on the job site carried over to the estimating side and i noticed a big hole in the construction management space. i was wasting too much time behind the desk and i wanted the clients i was working with to have a better experience. i needed to do more in less time. after dealing with the frustrations of many “over promising software solutions,” i set out to find a better program. when i couldn’t find one, i created my own. estimator360 is a construction estimating solution that was designed specifically for the builder.

it’s my hope that as a user of our solution you’ll find the stress and guesswork of estimating eliminated. our program removes costly mistakes from outdated/redundant processes that so often sabotage your profits. but most importantly, estimator360 will allow you to spend more time enjoying life with your family and friends.
