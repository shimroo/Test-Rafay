imagine opening the heavy oak doors to a place where history reverberates in the sound of the wooden floors. after a few drinks, old friends and new ones catch up there, and the walls have heard many tales. we kindly encourage you to have a seat in the middle of our house, where worn-out leather chairs and vintage signs are illuminated by flickering gas lighting.

more than a place:
our walls may bring back memories of the past, but they might also become indistinguishable from current sounds. our live music events feature local musicians, creating the perfect ambiance for your evenings.
with foot-tapping rhythms and heart-stirring songs, we create a scene that is nothing short of extraordinary. our events calendar acts as a treasure map, directing you to themed gatherings, quiz nights, and other events that promise to be once-in-a-lifetime experiences.
we distinguish ourselves not only via the food and the decor but also by the warm environment we offer. we’re more than just a team of workers; we’re a close-knit family.
each visit should be enjoyable in addition to being memorable. instead of treating you as a customer in this enormous tapestry of life, we gladly welcome you as friends and fellow storytellers.
