season 28 shows 











 



the fifth longest-running play in broadway history, deathtrap melds gasp-out-loud suspense with laugh-out-loud laughs, and continues to be one of the most-performed stage plays, with thousands of productions since its 1978 premiere attesting to its lasting audience appeal. 







 



the third and final play in the “christmas at pemberley” trilogy sees the younger bennet and darcy siblings take center stage in this charming holiday tale filled with lovely music, romantic entanglements, female ambition, and unwavering sisterhood. 







 



the first of priestley’s “time plays” explores the winding road of time and the perilous twists and turns of circumstance as a group of friends discover that what they know to be true might not be so, and just when they seem to pass the point of no return, priestley flips the script to take them back to the moment when they first approached that dangerous corner and allows them to indulge that all-important question: what if? 











 



sometimes what happens after last call just might change your life.  this heartfelt romantic comedy about the costs of the choices we make, and the people who make them with us, allows us all a moment to indulge in the fantasy of turning back time and getting a second chance. 







 



in this “mid-century modernization” of this groundbreaking classic, ibsen proves once again how timeless and universal his take on social and institutional inequality truly is as we follow one woman’s journey of self-discovery as she challenges the constraints of a patriarchal culture and struggles to carve out an identity beyond typical gender roles. 







 



in this companion piece to season 27’s love’s labour’s lost, the soldiers returning from wwi find themselves smack dab in the middle of the roaring 20s and the scene is set for all these dapper daddies and bold young calicos engage in hilarious hijinks, starry-eyed romance, and foolish shenanigans in a tale filled with more star-crossed lovers, scheming villains, and uproarious giggles than any tortured poet but shakespeare could provide!
