historic 1776

the

our
            "springhouse tavern menu" is served from 11:30am to 9:00pm every day. we do not take
reservations for this menu, seating is first-come, first served. we recommend
arriving early during busy lunch and dinner hours.
our
            "alexander dobbin dining rooms menu" is served daily from 5:00pm to 9:00pm. we do accept
reservations for this menu (717-334-2100) and walk-ins are welcome. 
a
full array of cocktails, wine and beer is available in all dining rooms.






notice! please
try to make your dinner reservations for our alexander dobbin
dining rooms about a week in advance! due to the increased number of
visitors, the lack of staff availability, other area
restaurants being closed on certain days, the dobbin house is experiencing wait times for
reservations and seating. in our desire to maintain the same high
quality of
service that our loyal guests have come to expect in our 47 years as
a restaurant/tavern, we are compelled to limit the number of people we
serve each day. unfortunately, this means our reservations fill up
quickly. we truly regret that we cannot serve all
those who call for a reservation for our full-dinner menu on the same
or in a few days. the best way to make sure you get a reservation is to
call ahead.  the dobbin house staff thank you for your understanding, cooperation and patience!  

note:
our springhouse tavern menu, as always, does not take reservations for this wide selection of dinners,
sandwiches, salads and popular cocktails. seating here is first-come,
first-served. this menu is often busy and, like most other area
restaurants, is seeing wait times to be seated. we recommend that you
arrive early.

the gettystown inn bed and breakfast is also open daily and
            taking reservations.  

the
entire dobbin house "family" thank you for your continued support!
 


dine in
gettysburg pa's oldest, most historic home 
"...beautifully
and authentically restored" 
and open to the public as a colonial restaurant.

four score and seven years before the
civil war battle of gettysburg, (1776), 
reverend alexander dobbin built a house to
begin a new life in america for himself and 
his family. today his home, listed on the
national register of historic places, is a colonial 
restaurant where candlelit elegance,
superior food in abundance, and gracious service bring back 
the sights, sounds and tastes of two
centuries ago.  aaa rated. the friendly hospitality of the dobbin
house 
extends to the springhouse tavern, gettystown bed and breakfast, country
curiosity store, abigail adams ballroom, 
in-house bakery and secret "underground railroad"
slave hideout.
