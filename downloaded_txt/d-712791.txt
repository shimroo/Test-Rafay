scammers are impersonating the irs and texting taxpayers asking for sensitive information. they're making taxpayers think it's to get an economic impact payment. but it's a scam to steal their personal data.don’t take the bait. don't respond.
 
the irs states that no action is needed by eligible taxpayers to receive these payments. instead, the payments will go out automatically and taxpayers should receive them by the end of this month. the payments will be automatically direct deposited or sent by paper check.
 here are some helpful hints to spot a scam:

the irs will not request personal or financial information by text.
federal government website addresses end in ".gov". scammers often will make up an official sounding website address, but it has a ".com".

got it.
