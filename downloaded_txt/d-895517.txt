welcome to the vintage sailplane association 



the purpose of the vintage sailplane association (vsa) is to promote the acquisition, restoration and flying of vintage sailplanes by its members, and to assist the national soaring museum in the preservation of soaring history and the promotion of vintage sailplane activity.
a vintage sailplane is any glider of a type first flown prior to 1958, or a more recently built glider with appearance, performance and construction characteristics similar to gliders built before 1958. read more about vintage sailplanes
a classic sailplane is any glider of a type first flown prior to 1975, but not categorized as a vintage sailplane. read more about classic sailplanes
