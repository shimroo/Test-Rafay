this refined eatery is not just a restaurant but an experience that captures the essence of contemporary fine dining while maintaining a rustic elegance. 
from the sweeping views of lavish landscapes to the elegant, handmade meals, this location offers an unrivaled setting for memorable events.
upon entering stone house restaurants guests are immediately enveloped in a sophisticated yet inviting atmosphere. the warm, natural hues of the stone walls harmonize with the verdant surroundings, offering a tranquil environment for those seeking a unique retreat for their private gatherings or weddings.
this grass valley restaurant’s intimate, adeptly curated insides reflect the dedication to both design and comfort, making it a selection venue for diverse occasions ranging from company affairs to romantic events.
stone house’s culinary philosophy is rooted in the inclusion of locally sourced, seasonal ingredients, ensuring a menu that changes with the rhythm of nature’s bounty. 
the kitchen offers a refined take on northern california cuisine, where tradition meets innovation in a series of dishes that speak to the region’s rich agricultural heritage.

a hallmark of this dining experience is its selection of appetizers, each presented with finesse and elegance. the signature heirloom beet salad is an exceptional starting point, where earthy, sweet beets are delicately paired with whipped goat cheese and topped with microgreens, creating a perfect equilibrium of texture and flavor. 
the lightly charred octopus is another stellar choice, offering a fragile smokiness that pairs harmoniously with a rejuvenating citrus beurre blanc. the octopus, tender yet perfectly crisped on the edges, provides an enjoyable contrast to the creamy sauce, simultaneously the sprinkling of crushed olives brings an unexpected briny note that heightens the dish’s complexity.
the main courses at stone house restaurants demonstrate an unwavering commitment to finesse. their signature entrée, the pan-seared duck breast, is a masterclass in technique. the skin is crisped to perfection, while the meat retains a tender, succulent texture.
 accompanied by rich, deep cherry reduction and roasted root vegetables, this dish strikes a harmonious balance between the savory and the sweet, offering a memorable depth of flavor. 
alternatively, the braised short ribs slow-cooked to an enviable tenderness, are bathed in a robust red wine sauce and served with creamy mashed potatoes, creating a comforting yet refined dish that appeals to both the casual diner and the discerning gourmet.
for those with a preference for lighter fare, the roasted wild salmon is another standout. the fish is cooked with an accuracy that preserves its moist, flaky texture, while the lemon-basil beurre blanc provides a refreshing citrusy lift. 
a bed of tender, roasted vegetables adds an earthy foundation and a scattering of toasted pine nuts contributes a delightful crunch, elevating the dish to new heights of sophistication.
this sumptuous establishment also prides itself on its outstanding desserts, which serve as the ideal verdict to an indulgent meal. the chocolate fondant, with its decadently molten center, is a tribute to the art of pastry. 

served with a scoop of homemade vanilla bean ice cream and fresh berries, it strikes an impeccable balance of richness and lightness. for a more delicate finale, the lemon lavender panna cotta offers a sublime contrast of flavors. 
its smooth, creamy texture is offset by the zesty tang of lemon, while the subtle lavender essence provides an aromatic touch, producing a dessert that is both revitalizing and elegantly fragrant.
beyond the food, an impressive wine list features local wineries, enabling guests to enjoy expertly paired wines that enhance the flavors of each dish. 
the knowledgeable staff is on hand to provide thoughtful recommendations, whether it be a crisp chardonnay to complement the duck or a robust cabernet sauvignon to elevate the short ribs. 
the attention to detail extends to every element of the dining experience, ensuring that each guest feels pampered and indulged.
for those seeking an unforgettable setting for public nevada city events, or for those seeking a setting for their private event, stone house provides a venue that combines natural beauty with unparalleled service. 



the venue’s customizable spaces, paired with the superb cuisine, create a seamless experience for both intimate gatherings and grand celebrations. it is amongst the most popular places selected for nevada city weddings. 
whether dining under the stars in the open air or within the elegant interior, every aspect of the experience is carefully curated to create an atmosphere of sophistication and warmth.
in short, stone house is not merely a restaurant—it is a destination where exceptional food, stunning surroundings, and impeccable service converge to create an unforgettable experience. 
its ability to host both public events and intimate private affairs, including weddings, makes it a cornerstone of nevada city’s culinary scene. with its dedication to quality and elegance, this dinner experience is a testament to the fine art of dining.
