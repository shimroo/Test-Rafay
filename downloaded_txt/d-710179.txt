testimonials
thanks so much for one of the finest educational experiences of my 30-year career!  i did my first rct last thursday, on tooth #2. found the mb2 canal, instrumented all 4 canals with no problem (and no loss of stomach lining). thanks again!! - jim nichols, dds lafayette lai have been practicing general dentistry for 43 years. i have used all the popular nit's and nothing compares to this course nor the instrumentation. this is the most relaxing system i have ever used. everyone owes it to themselves to attend one of allan and barry's courses. the entire staff is simply amazing. best endo course i have ever attended! - dr. j william callaway katy, txbest course i ever took! - seung-wu chung
