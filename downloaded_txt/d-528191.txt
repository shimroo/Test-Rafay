what makes us different

habilitat is an alternative to the 12 step programs. put simply, our goal is to empower you. we have understood for many years that a long-term addiction treatment center alone is not enough to ensure long-term success. individualized treatment takes time to formulate. people also need marketable skills and work ethics if they are to be competitive in today’s workforce. our vocational training programs are second to none in the substance abuse treatment community. we motivate the unmotivated and often succeed where other programs have failed. habilitat graduates leave with a re-energized moral core rooted in honesty, integrity, hard work, and commitment.

changing lives since 1971
habilitat is located on a 1.5-acre oceanfront estate at the base of the ko`olau mountains, on the island of o`ahu. our facility sits at the waters edge of kane`ohe bay. the tranquil views and cool trade winds from kane`ohe bay create an ideal atmosphere for recovery. we offer a full range of exercise equipment, activities, training centers and entertainment. located in a quiet neighborhood on the windward side of oahu makes habilitat a safe and serene setting ideal for recovery. habilitat is much more than just a long term addiction treatment program. if you would like to tour our facility, please call and ask for our induction department to schedule a time.
