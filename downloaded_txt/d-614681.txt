women's workjanuary 30 to february 23, 2025opening reception: saturday, february 1, 4-6:00 pmgalentines* free printmaking workshop:thursday, february 13, 4-6:00 pmclosing reception: sunday, february 23, 2-4:00 pmi created a series of large-scale monoprints that explore the multifaceted experiences of “women’s work.” these visually abstract narratives address issues of societal expectations, liberation and the enduring strength of the female spirit. the monoprints are layers of marks that include hidden gestural portraits in reference to strong women who have influenced changes in our society. the monotype process allows for spontaneity and its singular nature speaks to the fluidity and individuality of women’s lives. fiber work is incorporated into the prints, a nod to unjust stereotypes, and often unrecognized contributions. sewing has long been a traditional activity linked to domesticity, feminine virtues, and rebellion. it can represent societal constraints, the pressure to conform, and the limitations imposed upon women historically. in the current environment i find it more and more important to recognize the efforts of “women’s work” in our world.* a date to celebrate female friendships and the bonds between women.
