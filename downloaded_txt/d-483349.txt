areas of study












acting, performance and musical theatre
each season of plays provides a wide variety of roles and production post experiences for theatre students.  high production values, current state of the art technologies, and a wide spectrum of very challenging styles and subject matter make the performance venues excellent laboratories for student exploration and growth.














directing and playwriting
few community colleges offer students opportunities to study directing and playwrighting in their first two years of undergraduate study.   students follow the classwork they successfully complete with opportunities to compete for assignments in the playwrights festival and the directors festival. 














general education
for both the non-major and the major alike, the theatre arts general education courses meet university transfer requirements and allow the student to build a strong foundation of introductory knowledge to the many facets of theatre-making and theatre-study. 














production and design
fullerton college offers an extensive array of courses in theatre production and design, professional training certificates, and access to the latest technologies and practices used in the entertainment industry.
