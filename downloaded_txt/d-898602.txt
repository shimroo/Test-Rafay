often referred to as one of the scariest films ever made, pulse tells the story of a group of young friends rocked by the sudden suicide of one of their own, and his subsequent, ghostly reappearance in grainy computer and video images. is he trying to contact them from beyond the grave or is there something more sinister afoot? the mysterious floppy disk they find in the dead man's apartment may provide a clue, but instead launches a program that seems to present odd, ethereal transmissions of people engaged in solitary activities in their apartments. but there is something not quite right in the appearance and behavior of these lonely souls. soon, there are more strange deaths and disappearances within the group, terrifying rooms sealed in red tape, and the appearance of more ghosts as the city of tokyo - and the world - is slowly drained of life.
