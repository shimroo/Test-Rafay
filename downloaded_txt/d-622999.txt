              2 months, everything that 
 was wrong on my credit report 
 was fixed,

cheryl wolfe-"...thank you very much
              for your extremely useful information!"
              
dear joe,
              
not too long ago, i decided to take a chance
              and spend $49.95 on your credit repair "kit"
              online. i must say that i would not have known
              how to go about doing the things i did if i had
              not read your e-book, "how to clean your credit in 60
              days!"
              about the laws, regulations and processes for repairing
              your credit.
              
in 2 months, everything that was wrong on my credit
              report was fixed, deleted or removed and most of it
              was because of actions i took from buying your information
              kit online. normally i would kick myself for spending
              money
              on something like that, but it was definitely worth it
              this time.
              
it makes me very happy that a gamble i took actually paid
              off! first time in my life i "fought the law"
              and won!
              
i thank you very much for your extremely useful
              information!
              
thanks!

you
          are going to learn:

how you can buy
            the home of your dreams with a low,  low down payment... with
            or without good credit.
how to  buy the
            car you've been needing... stop driving that dangerous piece
            of junk.
how to start getting
            visa and mastercard's sent to you nearly every week in the mail
            that say,  "pre-approved!"
you'll even learn how you can make money
            using your  excellent credit rating after you get it.

these aren't just pie-in-the-sky promises,
          but hard documented facts.

          just follow the simple step-by-step instructions in this new
          “tells all” credit repair guidebook and you will be
          on the road to a perfect credit score within the next few weeks.

pre-approved
credit cards can be yours!


we all know that trying to live without a
          visa or mastercard is extremely inconvenient, embarrassing and
          downright painful at times.
everywhere you turn today, the need for
          good credit exists. ever try shopping
          without a credit card? ...what a pain. carrying cash just isn't
          practical ...or safe these days. without a major credit card
          you can't rent a car, make hotel or airline reservations, or
          even rent a video!
would you like to have a major credit card,
          but get nothing but rejection notices when you apply? we'll show you how to repair your
          credit so that major banks and merchants will be sending you
          pre-approved credit cards. it's simple
          if you have the right information.

          if you don't have this valuable information, you'll be just
          as lost as the millions of other people in this country who have
          bad credit. just as looked down upon. just as despised. i'm not
          trying to be melodramatic here... but if you have bad credit,
          you know exactly how it feels. it's demoralizing.
my grandpa used to say to me, “it’s
          no shame to be poor...  it's just damned inconvenient!” well
          that goes double if you've got poor credit.

hi joe -
              
just a quick follow up to my situation.
              i've used the forms in your book to get
              them (the negative info) taken off my report...
				as you so rightly counseled! as a result of all this,

              hoops for me and i think it's a done deal.
              
anyway, thanks for your support!

buy a home with
          a low down payment!
want to buy a home? just try to call a real
          estate agent and ask them about a house they have listed for
          sale. the first question they ask you is, “do you have good
          credit?” if you answer "no," they won't waste
          another second with you.
they know that you can't get a loan... so
          why bother?
but now you can change all that...
with good credit, you will be able to purchase
          any home listed for sale that you choose... not just the dregs
          that are for sale on land contract or as a lease with option
          to buy.
i am a real estate agent in the "real
          world" and i originally wrote this book because so many
          of the prospective clients who called me and wanted to buy a
          home - just didn't qualify. their credit stunk...
and they didn't have a clue about how to fix
          it!

what they needed was an easy-to-follow,
          step-by-step plan that really works.
giving my clients an earlier version of this
          book helped me sell a lot of houses to good people who couldn't
          have bought them any other way.
since then, i've learned even more
          hard to find techniques (and developed some of my own) about
          effective credit repair and have expanded my manual to a full
          blown, comprehensive book on credit repair.


buy a new car...
            at last!

is that old clunker of a car just about ready
          to give up the ghost? maybe it's time to invest in a new car.
unfortunately, the new car dealership won't
          even talk to you. and if they do... it's to refer you to one
          of those “buy here, pay here” used car lots that charge
          you twice what the junk they sell you is worth and make
          you pay 18-21% interest on the loan... it's just not worth it.
we can show you how you can absolutely, positively,
          buy a new car within 60 days or less of receiving our amazing
          credit guidebook. i stand behind this 100% and if my techniques
          don't work,  i'll give you your money back.

but you may ask,
          "what 's the big deal? what happens if i don't get this
          important information?"
bad credit is extremely
          expensive
being embarrassed or inconvenienced
          by bad credit isn't the only reason to get this book. having
          bad credit is very expensive!
let me show you what i mean
          in dollars and cents. a very common example of this is when folks
          with bad credit buy a home. i see this everyday as a real estate
          agent selling my clients homes.
it is possible to buy a home
          with bad credit, but several issues must be dealt with if you
          do. for our example, we will use a $100,000 home because it's
          a nice round number. look at the table below that shows the added
          costs of buying a home with bad credit.
 
        



 


 bad credit
              buyer


 good credit
              buyer




 down payment
              required


20% - $20,000 


3% - $3,000




 closing
              costs


5-7% of loan
              amount. at 5% this costs $5,000


1.5-2% of loan
              amount. at 2% this costs $2,000




 interest
              rate


14% interest
              rate monthly payment on $100,000 = $1172


8% interest
              rate monthly payment on $100,000 = $735




ability
              to negotiate price with seller


add 1%
              to negotiated purchase price


average negotiation 





for the sake of simplicity,
          let's not even figure in the down payment. here are the extra
          costs for a bad credit buyer.
$ 3,000 for extra closing
          costs.
$36,708 for extra interest
          over the next 7 years (while you wait for your credit to get
          better on its own.) this figures out at $1172-$735=$437 per month.
$ 1,000 extra on the price
          because a seller is less willing to negotiate with a bad credit
          buyer. i run into this all the time. if a buyer has bad credit,
          sellers are concerned about taking their home off the market
          for 45-60 days only to have the financing fall through at the
          last minute (which it frequently does with bad credit mortgage
          loans).
so... add it all
          up
these numbers are downright
          spooky.
$40,708

hi joe,
              
i purchased your program and i think it's really
               going to help. i've already received the reports
              and sent my written reply today. i have three items
              that have been plaguing my report since '96 and since
              then i've been a perfect consumer, but i still can't get
              a break. i was fed up with these people and how they
              think they can control your life because of some bad
              times or ignorance.
              
thanks for your help and may god bless you and your
              family.

remember, these are the extra costs incurred by a bad credit buyer.
what could you do with an
          extra $40,708 over the next few years? of course, i haven't done
          the extra interest calculations on your autos, furniture,
          credit cards and on and on and on.
what would a system that could
          save you this kind of money be worth to you... even if was written
          on a 3x5 index card and not a full blown electronic software
          book that you can download
          instantly?
would it be worth $500 to
          save $40,000?
would it be worth more than
          that?
by the way, if you surf around
          the net awhile you will find companies that charge several thousand
          dollars to do this credit repair for you. it's not that it's
          hard for them to do... it's that they have specialized knowledge.
the big problem with credit
          repair companies is that 98% of them are scams. there are a few
          that are very good at what they do, but they charge through the
          nose.
it is not unusual for someone
          with moderately bad credit to pay a legitimate credit
          repair attorney $3500 to $5000. the cheap guys are a complete
          waste of money and can get you thrown in jail if you use their
          "file segregation" (creating a new credit file) methods.

hi
      joe -
      just a quick follow up to my situation. i've used the forms
      in your book to get them (the negative info) taken off my report... as you
      so rightly counseled! as a result of all this, my bank approved a line of
      credit for me (unsecured!) for $25,000! the bankers jumped through a few
      hoops for me and i think it's a done deal.

      anyway, thanks for your support!

      ron f.
 

 
hi
      joe,
      here is my feedback... i liked your book!
      keep up the great work, joe

      warmly,

      cooper
 

 
dear
      joe,
      my husband and i bought your book online. we are very aware of what
      someone with bad credit can run into. i want to thank you for giving me
      the tools to use in deleting what i have. i have told my friends all about
      your great help.

      i get down on my knees and kiss your feet for helping me get this mess
      cleared up. thanks!

      r. tate
 

 
hi
      joe,
      i purchased your program and i think it's really going to help. i've
      already received the reports and sent my written reply today. i have three
      items that have been plaguing my report since '96 and since then i've been
      a perfect consumer, but i still can't get a break. 
 
i
      was fed up with these people and how they think they can control your life
      because of some bad times or ignorance.

      thanks for your help and may god bless you and your family.

      r. mondro
 

 
      joe, 
thank
      you for sharing the benefit of your experience 
      with those who can really draw upon that experience and use it in a
      constructive, positive, meaningful way.

      best regards,
      steve s.
 

 
hi
      joe,
i
      was completely blown away with your book to repair/upgrade my credit! i
      purchased it so that i could start my adventure into real estate
      investing.

thank
      you.
      eldon t.
 

 
joe,
by
      using your information and the accompanying documentation, i was able to
      get two accounts, that had been reported negatively, completely removed
      from my report!

thank
      you.
      bobby 
 

 
joe,
      i recently purchased your program and have seen tremendous results based
      on the suggestions that you presented to me!
 
being
      only 23, my credit was not terrible, but definitely not aaa quality. 
      now it is well on its way back towards that level. 
 
thank
      you very much for helping me reshape my life!!

      sincerely,
      scott t.
 

 
dear
      joe,
      i loved your book which i downloaded as soon as i learned about it on the
      internet. i don't want to bore you with trivialities, but i am married to
      a west pointer, retired army colonel. i was an english professor and we
      have been married thirty years and have two children, one grown. 

      i also have at least six professional licenses from p&c to life,
      accident & health, nasd, and real estate. i presently run a small
      consulting business in my home. 

      when i went to get my husband a new jeep, i was told that the rate would
      be through the roof because of my bad credit, if they would offer me
      credit at all. i couldn't believe it. we have a substantial income, stock,
      a standing in the community and money in trust from my father. 

      i knew that i had a few late payments when my beautiful father died the
      year before and i wasps forced to shuttle between new york state and
      arizona to help my mother and administer the trust - but that was it. in
      my innocence, i thought that was the problem, until i ordered the credit
      report! 

      (joe's note: she goes on to detail many nasty surprises, that she was
      unaware of, that had popped up on her credit report.)

      i absolutely loved your book, which downloaded quickly and efficiently. i
      have found your book to be full of your essence, which comes through as
      helpful, kind, and quite likable. i thank you sincerely for this book. 

      it is the only bright spot in this mess, which came as quite a shock to
      me. i would make your book mandatory for all business school graduates. if
      someone like me, with my background, can get injured by bad credit
      reporting, imagine what would happen to the average person without a
      financial background?

      thank you again, joe.

      cheryl fardink
 

 
hi
      joe, 
      i had to pay a debt before i bought your book, but guess what? i ordered
      your e-book and received it within 5-10 minutes as you promised.

      i am so glad that you are not letting your readers down. you are truly
      giving us what you promised (information that we can use). your book is
      easy to read and understand. the most important thing to me is that it is
      not overwhelming and is easy to read. excuse me while i take a moment to
      enjoy reading clean your credit.

      take care,
      wilma w.
