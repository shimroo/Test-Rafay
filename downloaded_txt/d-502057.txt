 more church planters needed in texas!
i am so thankful for the wonderful support given by texas churches for the support of our texas works! however, i am praying that more churches get burdened, along with me, that more church plants are desperately needed for this great state! i am praying that the people that god has set aside to meet this need, answer his call!
					as your mba sec/treas of missions in this state, one of my goals is to help identify and support churches and individuals who are led to start new works in texas. i am thankful at the half-way point in my first year of service, that one church has already reached out to me to express their interest in planting a new work! god is so good to hear us.
					won't you please join me in prayer that god will burden more hearts of this great need for the souls of our state? i pray that you will answer his call and your church will embrace the personal charge of the great commission!
					please share this burden with those on your facebook friends list.
					i am busy traveling across texas and getting to as many churches as possible. please message me and set up a time i can come and encourage your church for personal involvement in missions!
