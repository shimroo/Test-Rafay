achieving excellence together

online paymentsnewslettersterm dates






our federation of schools is committed to providing excellence in education. our aim is for children to leave for the next stage of their education with the confidence and aptitude to make their own valuable contribution to the community, for staff to recognise their contribution to this development of children and parents to genuinely support their son or daughter's education.aylestone is a thriving, collaborative and caring school with high aspirations for all students. we pride ourselves on being able to offer something different in the city. we are a smaller school, but big enough to offer the breadth of choice and opportunities that other schools do. we know all our children and have a school ethos based on mutual respect. put simply, we are a happy, caring school, small enough to know each student, but also big enough to offer extensive choice and opportunities.mr s p robertson (executive headteacher)read more
