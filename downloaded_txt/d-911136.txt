about us










        creating hope
 






i was granted a place to live and they helped me pay my bills and it was a tremendous blessing. may god continue to bless their heart and their mind and the good work that they're doing for people. they helped me to put myself back on my feet.
- judith, cape coral, fl, post hurricane ian





i was struggling financially and with my health. i reached out to catholic charities, and they assisted me with a medical bill and a portion of my rent. i’m grateful for the help and i can’t thank you enough.
- nicholas, naples, fl





our mother’s house provided me with the help i needed to get back on my feet and care for my son. now i feel joy, and i’m hopeful about the future — because now i have one. 
- alexa, venice, fl, our mother's house program graduate













        healing people, transforming lives!

        volunteering at catholic charities of the diocese of venice can be a fulfilling and rewarding way to give back to the community and make a positive impact on the lives of those in need.
