information & faq’s








            how much do you charge?
          










it depends on how much you give us to sell. it’s based on the amount of time to sell it and also the quality of the product being sold. contact us for more information.








            how do you assess the items? 
          










to assess the items for auction, our process primarily relies on our extensive experience and expertise in evaluating similar items that have been sold previously. we meticulously compare the item in question to these historical sales, taking into account its current condition and any unique attributes. this comprehensive evaluation allows us to assign an appraised value to the item, ensuring that it is accurately represented in the auction.








            how long does the whole auction process take?
          










 the duration of the entire auction process is subject to various stages, each involving its own set of considerations. to commence, the initial step entails the auctioneer's thorough evaluation of the item. following this assessment, the subsequent phase involves the determination of an appropriate auction date, which is conventionally scheduled approximately 30 days after the compilation of an inventory list encompassing all items slated for sale. this 30-day interval is imperative to facilitate the comprehensive promotion of the auction, encompassing diverse platforms such as our website, auctionzip, and various social media channels. 








            how do you set up an appointment? 
          










to schedule an appointment with us, we have a team of three dedicated auctioneers committed to serving our community. given the multifaceted nature of our work, which includes appraisals, real estate transactions, responding to inquiries, familial responsibilities, and our spiritual commitments, we ensure that each appointment is thoughtfully arranged to accommodate your needs. when you reach out to us, we will collaborate with you to identify a suitable time within our schedules, striving to find the perfect moment for our meeting. your convenience and satisfaction are of utmost importance to us, and we endeavor to make the appointment-setting process as seamless as possible.








            purchasing real estate at auction
          










purchasing real estate at auction is very easy, and preferred by many over conventional real estate transactions. its actually very similar in process, without the pages and pages of tedious paperwork and the anxiety that many face in offer / counteroffer negotiations. buying real estate at auction is straightforward and quick. auction sets the price, the transaction closes, you own it...done. properties are typically available to preview before sale date. please contact us (417-767-4345) to learn of the next available time. the standard terms of a real estate auction conducted by glenworth are 10% down the day of the sale, with balance due at closing in 30 days or less. title search fees are typically paid by the seller, title insurance by the buyer, and the closing fee charged by the title company is divided evenly. property taxes are pro-rated to the date of closing. in many cases, if the home will be vacant following the auction, closing can be completed in less than 30 days. the terms for each particular auction are announced before the sale of the property and if there is any deviation, these announcements will always take precedence over "standard terms." buyers premiums are not a standard practice of glenworth auction and real estate. the high bid plus closing costs as listed in the terms of sale are what you are responsible for. there is no assessment on this price imposed by glenworth. please visit with a glenworth auction representative with any specific questions you may have on any property or the process of purchasing real estate at auction.








            do you charge a buyer's premium?
          










over the last 40 years, we have never conformed to a buyer’s premium. our business was built in a traditional sense and we use traditional practices. traditionally at auctions, what you bid is what you pay. no premium will be charged.
