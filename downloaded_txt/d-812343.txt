we are a retirement facility and adoption organization working for the retired racing greyhound. our team is committed to the greyhound breed, and we educate the general public regarding all the aspects of a greyhound's life. we work exclusively for the breed and its existence.
as every greyhound has a unique history, we maintain and provide personal pet portfolios to the new owners. these include pedigrees, racing information and health information about their pet.







the greyhound is a handsomely proportioned athlete and to see him in motion is an absolutely awe-inspiring sight. they can run 5/16âs of a mile in an average 31 seconds and can reach speeds up to 45 miles per hour. 
if you are a dog lover come and become a part of greyhound history, let one of these gorgeous animals race into your heart and home.
