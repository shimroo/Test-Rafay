prospective landing sites for future (non-msl) missions





								     
								rfp for future mars landing sites
								 (nov. 16th, 2010)
								



								the mars exploration program has issued, in november 2010, a request for proposal (round vi) for the critical data products program.  this rfp provides support to develop a number of scientifically high-priority landing sites on mars that will form an initial list for future landed missions.  details of the rfps are posted 
here.
