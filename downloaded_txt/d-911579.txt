palinurus
  antiquarian books was established fifty odd years ago because of my personal
  interests. the books found here are an eclectic gathering primarily from the
  eighteenth and nineteenth century. the sciences are heavily represented, but
  you will also find uncommon and useful books in many other subject areas. i
  welcome your inquiries.


    palinurus
    is located approximately 12 miles north of philadelphia. please call in
    advance if you would like to visit.
