now located in pilot point, texas at a boutique farm on friendship road, the original historic mcquay stables was a state-of-the-art reining and hunter & jumper training, sales and breeding facility in tioga. the facility consisted of three properties that housed approximately two-hundred horses, with an average of eighty in training at all times. the program was divided into three divisions: breeding, reining, and hunters & jumpers.  each division had it's own dedicated staff, which in addition to the office staff, averaged a total of twenty-five employees.after the sale of the facility and most of the horses, mcquay stables reining continues to operate on a smaller scale out of tom mccutcheon reining horses and colleen mcquay with the hunters and jumpers on the road and out of their private farm in pilot point, texas. click here to learn more about mcquay stables.
