speedstack is the stackup design tool of choice for professional pcb designers fabricators and brokers who have a requirement to document and design stackups drill plans and material requirements complete with high speed transmissionline information. 
accurate and easy to use, polar si8000m makes designing impedance controlled pcb trace dimensions and is the solver of choice for oems and fabricators working with impedance controlled pcbs.   the si9000e extends the capability for multi ghz designs
cits impedance test systems are the go to system for reliable traceable impedance measurement.if you need more speed polar atlas 
		   delivers an insertion loss measurement system either with a vna or as a tool for processing touchstone (r) files.
