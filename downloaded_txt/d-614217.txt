first do no harm

joe kenda

former homicide detective and star of investigation discovery, joe kenda follows his authentic and fascinating debut novel with first do no harm, another addictive tale of crime and punishment as only he can tell it.
a string of overdoses in colorado springs has detectives joe kenda and lee wilson on the lookout for a bad batch of heroin that has been cut with a drug they've never seen before.
meanwhile, at springs general hospital, dr. blair moreland--the notoriously unpleasant head anesthesiologist--has found a way to feed his deepening addiction to the very same powerful new drug: fentanyl.
but when dr. moreland starts supplying the dangerous painkiller to dealer lula lopez--planning to manufacture the drug himself--he angers a mexican crime syndicate and sets into motion a cycle of death and violence that threatens to engulf the entire city.
detectives kenda and wilson must track down the source of this killer heroin before anyone else can overdose--and stop moreland before he can escape the long arm of the law.









shogun

james clavell

the classic epic novel of feudal japan that captured the heart of a culture and the imagination of the world, by the #1 new york times bestselling author and unparalleled master of historical fiction, james clavell
after englishman john blackthorne is lost at sea, he awakens in a place few europeans know of and even fewer have seen--nippon. thrust into the closed society that is seventeenth-century japan, a land where the line between life and death is razor-thin, blackthorne must negotiate not only a foreign people, with unknown customs and language, but also his own definitions of morality, truth, and freedom. as internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, blackthorne's loyalty and strength of character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.
powerful and engrossing, capturing both the rich pageantry and stark realities of life in feudal japan, shōgun is a critically acclaimed powerhouse of a book. heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat action melds seamlessly with intricate historical detail and raw human emotion. endlessly compelling, this sweeping saga captivated the world to become not only one of the best-selling novels of all time but also one of the highest-rated television miniseries, as well as inspiring a nationwide surge of interest in the culture of japan. shakespearean in both scope and depth, shōgun is, as the new york times put it, "...not only something you read--you live it." provocative, absorbing, and endlessly fascinating, there is only one: shōgun.









lady macbeth

ava reid

new york times bestseller • from #1 new york times bestselling author ava reid comes a “masterful reimagining” (publishers weekly) of lady macbeth, shakespeare’s most famous villainess, giving her a voice, a past, and a power that transforms the story men have written for her.

“lady macbeth doesn’t retell shakespeare so much as slice cleanly through it, revealing what was hidden beneath. i couldn't look away.”—alix e. harrow, new york times bestselling author of starling house 

the lady knows the stories: how her eyes induce madness in men.
 
the lady knows she will be wed to the scottish brute, who does not leave his warrior ways behind when he comes to the marriage bed.
 
the lady knows his hostile, suspicious court will be a game of strategy, requiring all of her wiles and hidden witchcraft to survive. 

but the lady does not know her husband has occult secrets of his own. she does not know that prophecy girds him like armor. she does not know that her magic is greater and more dangerous, and that it will threaten the order of the world. 

she does not know this yet. but she will.









madwoman

chelsea bieker

the world is not made for mothers.
yet mothers made the world...
clove has gone to extremes to keep her past a secret. thanks to her lies, she's landed the life of her dreams, complete with a safe husband and two adoring children who will never know the terror that was routine in her own childhood. if her buried anxiety threatens to breach the surface, clove (if that is really her name) focuses on finding the right supplement, the right gratitude meditation.
but when she receives a letter from a women's prison in california, her past comes screeching into the present, entangling her in a dangerous game with memory and the people she thought she had outrun. as we race between her precarious present-day life in portland, oregon and her childhood in a waikiki high-rise with her mother and father, clove is forced to finally unravel the defining day of her life. how did she survive that day, and what will it take to end the cycle of violence? will the truth undo her, or could it ultimately save her?
a gripping story of motherhood and motherloss, intimate terrorism and terrifying love, the insidious ways male violence disrupts mothers and daughters, and the brutal, mighty things women do to keep themselves and each other alive, madwoman marks chelsea bieker as a major fiction talent.









the ornithologist's field guide to love

india holton

instant usa today bestseller!

"so riotously clever it almost defies description...an alchemy of romantic elements held in perfect harmony."—npr

rival ornithologists hunt through england for a rare magical bird in this historical-fantasy rom-com reminiscent of indiana jones but with manners, tea, and helicopter parasols.

beth pickering is on the verge of finally capturing the rare deathwhistler bird when professor devon lockley swoops in, stealing both her bird and her imagination like a villain. albeit a handsome and charming villain, but that's beside the point. as someone highly educated in the ruthless discipline of ornithology, beth knows trouble when she sees it, and she is determined to keep her distance from devon. 

for his part, devon has never been more smitten than when he first set eyes on professor beth pickering. she's so pretty, so polite, so capable of bringing down a fiery, deadly bird using only her wits. in other words, an angel. devon understands he must not get close to her, however, since they're professional rivals. 

when a competition to become birder of the year by capturing an endangered caladrius bird is announced, beth and devon are forced to team up to have any chance of winning. now keeping their distance becomes a question of one bed or two. but they must take the risk, because fowl play is afoot, and they can't trust anyone else—for all may be fair in love and war, but this is ornithology.









a court this cruel and lovely

stacia stark

for years, when i fell asleep, i dreamed of a man with blazing green eyes and a cruel smile.
 
the day i meet him, the ruthless mercenary leaves me for dead.
just hours after humans are born, the gods take what little power we have. in return, they protect our borders from the vicious, merciless fae.
the humans who manage to keep their power are known as the corrupt.
 
and they are burned.
 
when my forbidden power is discovered, i'm forced to flee my tiny village and the life i adore.
 
to survive, i make a desperate bargain with the mercenary who abandoned me at my weakest.
 
our deal is simple: i'll help him and his mysterious friends sneak into the city. and he'll help me learn to wield the strange, dark power i've always kept hidden. the power that may just be the key to my survival.
 
but the ruthless mercenary is hiding secrets of his own. secrets that threaten the safety of everyone i love. secrets that could tear this kingdom-and perhaps even this world-apart.









arkangel

james rollins

currently in development as a tv series from amazon mgm studios, a story of a thrilling hunt around the globe, pitting nation against nation, as ancient myths of a lost continent prove all too real--the latest novel in the bestselling sigma force series from james rollins, #1 new york times master of international thrillers
the execution of a vatican archivist within the shadow of the kremlin exposes a conspiracy going back three centuries--to the bloody era of the russian tsars. before his murder, he manages to dispatch a coded message, a warning of a terrifying threat, one tied to a secret buried within the golden library of tsars, a vast and treasured archive that had vanished into history.
as combative forces race for the truth behind this death and alarming discovery, sigma force is summoned to aid in the search--not only for this missing trove of ancient books, but to follow a trail far into the arctic, to search for the truth about a lost continent and a revelation that could ignite a global war. but sigma force has its own difficulties at home after an explosive attack on the national mall--one aimed at the heart of their covert agency--has left them vulnerable and exposed.
the growing conflict--both on russian soil and deep in the arctic--will reignite a centuries-old war between the newly resurgent russian orthodox church and the vatican, while sabers rattle across the nations of the arctic circle, threatening to turn those icy seas into a fiery conflagration.
facing enemies on all sides, it will be up to commander gray pierce and sigma force to unravel a mystery going back millennia--and uncover the truth about a lost civilization and an arcane treasure that could save the planet...or destroy it.









family business 7

carl weber

keep up with the duncan family down south as we travel to new orleans in the family business 7.

operated by the same family for more than a century, midnight blues may be fun for the locals and the tourists, but as of late, the club hasn’t been fun for its owner, big shirley duncan, or her son tyrese, descendants of the original proprietors. the pair finds themselves in the middle of a turf war between local politicians, developers, and a ruthless underworld boss, jean leblanc, who is looking to make a name for himself.

afraid for the first time in her life that her family may lose control of the blues, big shirley sends tyrese to new york to see her brother-in-law, lc duncan. in turn, lc enlists his nephew, bounty hunter curtis duncan, and his highly trained niece lauryn duncan, to help add some muscle and security to their family’s struggling business.









the x-files: perihelion

claudia gray

the truth is out there . . . but so are lies. 
#1 new york times best-selling author claudia gray extends the story of the x-files beyond its eleventh season into thrilling new territory!
fox mulder and dana scully are still reeling from the death of their son william as they struggle to find purpose away from the x-files. though their current relationship is tenuous, they hope to seize their second chance to be a family, despite the many questions surrounding scully's pregnancy.
then the fbi asks for their help on a case that hits all too close to home: a serial killer in the washington, dc area who targets pregnant women. the killer appears to possess a mysterious, uncanny power over electricity, which is enough for the bureau to re-open the x-files--if mulder and scully are willing.
they cautiously agree, concerned about the safety of their own unborn child yet committed to finding justice for the killer's victims. but their return to the fbi sparks the interest of a shadowy cabal, the heirs to the now-dead syndicate, and mulder and scully soon discover that what at first seems to be just another x-file is connected to a worldwide threat on an unprecedented scale . . . one with their own future at its heart.









clive cussler ghost soldier

mike maden

a deadly war game. an adversary as hard to find as he is to kill. weapons so sophisticated, none have seen the like before. juan cabrillo and the crew of the oregon have finally met their match in this pulse-pounding new adventure in the #1 new york times bestselling series.

when african jihadis attack a nigerian regiment using american weapons, cabrillo and the oregon crew are on the case, investigating from afghanistan to kuala lumpur to track a mysterious arms dealer—a genius, or perhaps a devil—known only as the vendor.

cabrillo goes undercover to find the vendor’s base, but his adversary isn’t just an arms smuggler. he’s an arms maker, and cabrillo just walked into a lethal military game alongside the most dangerous mercenaries in the world, designed to test the vendor’s cutting-edge ai arsenal.

and yet, surviving an arena full of flame-throwing robots isn’t even his biggest problem. the vendor has an army of high-speed drones headed for a pivotal military site, and if the oregon crew can’t stop them from releasing a deadly neurotoxin, the entire globe will erupt in conflict.









grand theft ai

james cox

"the matrix meets blade runner." -- nicholas sansbury smith, new york times bestselling author of hell divers
san francisco, 2051. rising like neo-shanghai over the bay, a labyrinth of quantum accelerators, hologram dreams, and fiercely regulated androids. forget powder, pills, or bud--kids get high slotting wafers of data under the ear, and they'll pay fat ¢rypto for the best. at the hottest nightclub in the city ... the fang.
baz covane is a battle-scarred thief who sticks to small-time bots. ria rose is the underworld "fixer" with a big-time score that could easily get 'em both killed. 'cuz the fang's psychotic kingpin otto rex has a vault with more security than a fusion reactor. and the glass inside is priceless--enough to set up baz, ria, and their crack team of cyber-misfits on the white sands of tahiti forever.
but this crime doesn't just carry infinite vr-prison time--it's baz and ria's last shot at redemption. forced to confess every last secret on their neurals, they'll have to trust each other completely if they stand any chance of infiltrating otto's lair, raiding its spiraling rings of physical and virtual firewalls, to finally hack into his mind and crack his deepest layer of security, before the blackhawks touch down with federal warrants--for grand theft ai.
