parents & ccis
support your child on this life-changing experience


study abroad has evolved to incorporate more than just language and culture. students have access to all majors abroad so they can stay on track for graduation, while building their resume and experiencing the personal growth of living abroad.  

ccis programs are developed and managed by accredited u.s. institutions so you can feel confident and secure knowing your child’s academics, program quality, safety, and security are taken care of the same as on a u.s. campus.
