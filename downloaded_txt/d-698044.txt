what are people saying



we have done business with siska for over 45 years and there is a reason.! they are a firm you can count on whether for grommets, repair of equipment ( regardless of age) or purchase of equipment .they are without doubt the best in their field.
mike t.




they were a great company to work with, i sent them samples of our job that we needed done in under 3 weeks. they made the samples, found the right tooling/hardware and shipped us the entire order in only 3 days, which gave us plenty of time to complete our job. it was our first experience with eyelets and they literally just said send us your sample and we’ll do the r & d. i would recommend them, especially if you don’t really know what you’re doing. they also asked me what my budget was, which i appreciated.
brain r.




i have been working with siska inc. for 20 plus years. from purchasing grommets, washers and eyelets, to complicated machine designs including integration with existing equipment.
you can expect to receive professional and responsive service when dealing with them. in the past few years i have come to rely on them for machining services as well. i have found them to be an honest and competent resource.
