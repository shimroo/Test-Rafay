remarkable finish propels texas past virginia and into ita d-i men's team indoor semifinals; wake forest survives another test to stay undefeated; tcu and stanford join texas and wake forest in dallas for monday's semifinals



©colette lewis 2025--dallas texas--the last time texas and virginia met, less than two weeks ago in charlottesville, texas took the doubles point and five first sets in singles, before the cavaliers mounted an improbable comeback, with freshman rafael jodar saving three team match points en route before he and stiles brockett at line 6 put up the third and fourth point for virginia.texas's 4-1 win today over virginia in the quarterfinals of the ita men's team indoor championships was, if possible in a neutral setting, even more exciting, and certainly more rare, with the final three singles matches in third-set tiebreakers when texas's jonah braswell secured a 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(5) victory over keegan rice at line 4.in all my years of covering college tennis, i've never seen three matches in lockstep like the contests at line 1, between jodar and timo legout, at line 2, between sebastian gorzny and virginia's dylan dietrich and the braswell and rice battle. no one, including coaches and officials who have decades of experience with thousands of collegiate matches, could recall anything remotely similar, and the hundreds of fans at the styslinger/altec tennis complex were treated to a rare spectacle that was unimaginable from the 4-1 score.virginia started out well in doubles, taking a 1-0 lead with 6-3 victories at lines 1 and 2, positions that are usually the strength of the longhorns doubles point. that the cavaliers could not mange to take another point, after getting four singles points in charlottesville, demonstrated just what a struggle every game was in every match.texas pulled even in the only straight-sets singles match, with freshman sebastian eriksson beating fellow freshman jungjin kim 6-4, 6-1 at line 6. eriksson, who lost to kim 6-3, 6-3 in that previous match, had not been feeling well that day, so texas head coach bruce berque had no doubts that he could reverse that loss today."he didn't lose because it was a bad matchup," berque said of eriksson's loss in charlottesville, which came at line 5. "sometimes it might be, but we just thought it was an execution thing, and sometimes there might be extra motivation from losing. but we were committed to having all of them play (eriksson, oliver ojakaar and lucas brown) and whoever did not play yesterday was going to play today."each team won three first sets, but in a 30-minute stretch the five remaining singles matches all went to a third set. shortly after gorzny and dietrich split at line 2, ojakaar put texas up 2-1 with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 win at line 5. texas looked in good shape when pierre-yves bailly had taken a 4-0 third set lead over james hopper at line 3, but hopper got both breaks back and was serving at 3-4 before dropping a deciding point. bailly was up 40-15 serving for the match at 5-3 but hopper forced a deciding point, which bailly won with a brave volley that hopper had to call out in order to challenge. the play replay electronic line calling system confirmed the ball was good, giving texas their third point with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 victory.the remaining three matches were at 4-4, at line 1 and 2 and 5-4 at line 4, then 5-4, 5-4 and 5-5. dietrich broke gorzny to serve for the match at 6-5, but lost his serve, while jodar held on a deciding point to go up 6-5 and was up 0-30 with legout serving, but jodar appeared to suffer a cramp during that game and legout held.braswell was serving from behind throughout the third set, but said he managed to cope with that pressure."it was tough," said the junior from florida, who lost the deciding match in the ncaa final against tcu last may. "it was definitely a lot of pressure. props to keegan rice, a freshman, a canadian, i think he played really, really well and i think he likes these indoor courts. i felt the pressure, he was coming after me really good but i was able to stay calm, use my experience a little bit, use that to my advantage. i wasn't playing my best tennis today, but bruce was able to keep me calm, give me some good advice and it was a team win."braswell had a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker, but gave won of those mini-breaks back, as the baseline rallies went to the server in the next four points. that made it 6-4 braswell, who lost his second mini-break and first match point, but was able to coax a backhand error from rice at 5-6 to take the victory and end the longhorns' 10-match losing streak to the cavaliers.at the time the match was clinched, dietrich led gorzny 5-2 and legout led jodar 3-1 in their third set tiebreakers."they are a great team," berque said. "i was really impressed with virginia today. they came out great in doubles, and they were really determined. and the singles, as you saw, was a battle."quarterfinal:texas[3] 4, virginia[2] 1doubles:1. keegan rice and james hopper(uva) d. lucas brown and timo legout(tex) 6-32. mans dahlberg and dylan dietrich(uva) d. pierre-yves bailly and sebastian gorzny(tex) 6-33. jangjun kim and rafael jodar(uva) v jonah braswell and oliver ojakaar(tex) 4-3, unf.order of finish: 2, 1singles:1. rafael jodar(uva) v timo legout((tex) 6-4, 4-6, 6-6(1-3) unf.2. dylan dietrich(uva) v sebastian gorzny(tex) 6-7(6), 6-3, 6-6 (5-2) unf.3. pierre-yves bailly(tex) d. james hopper(uva) 4-6, 6-1, 6-34. jonah braswell(tex) d. keegan rice(uva) 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(5)5. oliver ojakaar(tex) d. mans dahlberg(uva) 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 6. sebastian eriksson(tex) d. jangjun kim(uva) 6-4, 6-1order of finish: 6, 5, 3, 4the fans barely had time to catch their collective breath before the second quarterfinal of the day, featuring top seed wake forest and no. 5 seed nc state, began moving toward an only slightly less tense conclusion, with wake forest again surviving a stern challenge, this time by a 4-2 score.wake took the doubles point, although nc state did take no. 1 doubles before the demon deacons closed out the point at lines 2 and 3.the teams split first sets, so nc state needed to find a split, which they got, at line 5, with wolfpack newcomer nikolay nedelchev forcing a third with luciano tacchi. they also earned a split on 2, with martin borisiouk taking the second from dk suresh, while wake forest countered with a split on 6 with luca pow taking the second from jules leroux and ioannis xilas forcing a third from fons van sambeek at line 4.the matches that were decided in straight sets took two hours to finish, and they too were split, with nc state's luca stahaeli beating charlie robertson at line 3 6-3, 7-6(5) to make it 1-1 and a minute later, wake's stefan dostanic defeating braden shick 7-6(4), 7-6(3) to immediately put the deacons back in front. tacchi made it 3-1 with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 win over nedelchev, after dropping the first two games of the third set, but borisiouk had taken a big lead over suresh in their third set. von sambeek was up a break in the third for nc state, but the wolfpack needed to win the remaining three matches, which was certainly possible, given how close they were.borisiouk needed nine match points, having 15-40 leads in the final three games of the third set, before finally closing out suresh 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 to make it 3-2.  pow had a 5-2 lead and had served for the match before borisiouk could close out suresh, but leroux broke at love, which is not how pow had envisioned that final game."i came out at 5-2 and told coach, i've got this, and got broke to love" said the sophomore from england. "and then we sat down at 5-4 and i said again, i've got this. because i kind of like having the pressure on me. i don't shy away from that. i had to serve for it in doubles with tacchi and that went great. but it was key getting that first point after losing four points in the previous game on my serve. but i like the pressure and i was ready for it."up 30-0, pow was fortunate that leroux missed a routine overhead, but leroux saved the first match point by making another overhead for 40-15. but pow's good fortune continued with a leroux's shot clipping the tape and sitting up for him, and he made no mistake on the finish.wake forest head coach tony bresky acknowledged that luck has played a role in his team's best start to the season since their ncaa championship in 2018, but he also credited his team's physical condition and their experience with coming through so many close matches."knock on wood, i think we're in incredible shape," bresky said. we work really hard on our fitness, thinking that's one variable we can take out of the equation. and guys who have been in moment. obviously, a guy like luca, losing the first set and doesn't panic, or tacchi, who's been in that moment now. i think he had a super valuable experience against ohio state (a 4-3 win for wake) where he was up in the third and kind of lost his focus and ended up losing. and sometimes a little luck doesn't hurt."quarterfinal:wake forest[1] 4, nc state[5] 2doubles:1. braden shick and fons van sambeek(ncst) d. stefan dostanic and dk suresh(wake) 6-32. luca pow and luciano tacchi(wake) d. jules leroux and luca staeheli(ncst) 6-43. ioannis xilas and franco capalbo(wake) d. william manning and nikolay nedelchev(ncst) 6-3order of finish: 1, 3, 2singles:1. stefan dostanic(wake) d. braden shick(ncst) 7-6(4), 7-6(3)2. martin borisiouk(ncst) d. dk suresh(wake) 3-6, 6-4, 6-33. luca staeheli(ncst) d. charlie robertson(wake) 6-3, 7-6(5)4. fons van sambeek(ncst) v ioannis xilas(wake) 6-4, 4-6, 5-2, unf.5. luciano tacchi(wake) d. nikolay nedelchev(ncst) 6-3, 3-6, 6-36. luca pow(wake) d. jules leroux(ncst) 3-6, 6-3, 6-4order of finish: 3, 1, 5, 2, 6the last main draw matches at the baylor university site were completed today, with no. 6 seed stanford ending the cinderella story of central florida by a 4-0 score, and top seed tcu, the 2022 and 2023 national indoor champions and 2024 finalist, now able to return closer to home, after claiming a hard-fought 4-2 win over no. 5 seed san diego, who suffered its first loss of the season.quarterfinal:stanford[6] 4, central florida[7] 0doubles:1. liam branger and paul colin(ucf) d. kyle kang and max basing(stan) 6-42. samir banerjee and alexander razeghi(stan) d. mehdi benchakroun and santiago giamichelle(ucf) 7-53. nicholas godsick and henry von der schulenburg (stan) d. yassine dlimi and emilio sanchez(ucf) 6-4order of finish: 3, 1, 2singles:1. samir banerjee(stan) v yassine dlimi(ucf) 6-1, 3-6, 2-1 unf.2. max basing(stan) d.  paul colin(ucf) 6-0, 6-43. mehdi benchakroun(ucf) v kyle kang(stan) 6-4, 3-3, unf.4. henry von der schulenburg(stan) d. liam branger(ucf) 6-3, 6-25. hudson rivera(stan) v santiago giamichelle(ucf) 7-6(2), 3-2, unf.6. alexander razeghi(stan) d. nicolas oliveira(ucf) 6-1, 6-1order of finish: 6, 2, 4tcu[1] 4. san diego[5] 2doubles:1. lui maxted and pedro vives(tcu) d. stian klaassen and oliver tarvet(usd) 6-32. jack pinnington jones and cooper woestendick(tcu) d. savriyan danilov and iiro vasa(usd) 6-33. adrien berrut and nikhil niranjan(usd) v duncan chan and albert pedrico(tcu) 5-5, unf.order of finish: 2, 1singles:1. oliver tarvet(usd) d. jack pinnington jones(tcu) 6-4, 6-22. pedro vives(tcu) d. savriyan danilov(usd) 6-1, 7-6(7)3. lui maxted(tcu) d. iiro vasa(usd) 6-4, 3-6, 6-14. stian klaassen(usd) d. duncan chan(tcu) 6-4, 6-25. adrien berrut(usd) v cooper woestendick(tcu) 4-6, 6-4, 4-3, unf.6. albert pedrico(tcu) d. neo niedner(usd) 3-6, 6-4, 6-2order of finish: 4, 1, 2, 3, 6sunday is an off-day for the semifinalists this year, with the four teams returning to action on monday at 3:30 pm and 6:30 pm  at smu. the final is scheduled for 6:30 pm on tuesday.

©colette lewis 2025--dallas, texas--the first day of the ita men's division i team indoor championships was uneventful at the smu site, where i'm located for the duration of the tournament, but at the second venue on the baylor campus, the first round was a st. valentine's day massacre for the favored teams. although waco's no. 1 seed, tcu, did take out host baylor 4-1 in the nightcap, the no. 2, 3 and 4 seeds were all eliminated, with central florida's 4-2 win over second seed and defending champion ohio state the result that had all the teams in dallas talking.because i wasn't there, i won't be attempting a recap of the match, but the box score is below, along with a link to the central florida website's coverage here.central florida[7] 4, ohio state[2] 2doubles:1. aidan kim and will jansen(osu) d. liam branger and paul colin(ucf) 6-12. preston stearns and bryce nakashima(osu) v mehdi benchakroun and santiago giamichelle(ucf) 3-3, unf.3. brandon caprico and nikita filin(osu) d. yassine dlimi and emilio sanchez(ucf) 6-1order of finish 3, 1singles:1. yassine dlimi(ucf) d.  aidan kim(osu) 6-3, 6-42. alexander bernard(osu) d.  paul dolin(ucf) 6-4, 7-53. mehdi benchakroun(ucf) d. will jansen(osu) 6-2, 1-6, 6-44. liam branger(ucf) d. jack anthrop(osu) 7-5, 3-6, 6-45. bryce nakashima(osu) v santiago giamichelle(ucf) 6-7(3), 6-4, 3-3  unf.6. nicolas oliveira(ucf) d. christopher li(osu) 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-1order of finish: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6no. 6 seed stanford defeated no. 3 seed columbia 4-1, with the stanford recap here.stanford[6] 4, columbia[3] 1doubles:1. max basing and kyle kang(stan) d. michael zheng and nicolas kotzen(col) 6-32. samir banerjee and alexander razeghi(stan) v max westphal and sachin palta(col) 5-4, unfinished3. nicolas godsick and henry von der schulenburg(stan) d. hugo hasimoto and jayden templeman(col) 6-3order of finish: 3, 1singles:1. samir banerjee(stan) d. michael zheng(col) 6-3, 7-6(4)2. max basing(stan) d. nicolas kotzen(col) 7-6(5), 7-53. max westphal(col) d. henry von der schulenburg(stan) 6-2, 6-34. hugo hashimoto(col) v hudson rivera(stan) 6-4, 3-6, 3-2, unf.5. nicholas godsick(stan) v sachin palta(col) 2-6, 6-2, 5-3, unf.6. alexander razeghi(stan) d. thanapat boosarawongse(col) 6-2, 7-5order of finish:3, 1  6, 2no. 5 seed san diego's 4-3 win over no. 4 seed duke came down to no. 5 singles, with adrien berrut defeating gerard planelles ripoll 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5 in a three-hour match that featured one huge deciding point after another in the third set, and with both players trying to finish points quickly, all the volleys, overheads and passing shots made for an entertaining battle, which was ultimately decided in a wild final point, with an electronic line call challenge by berrut overturning ripoll's call on match point. the duke recap of the match is here. the san diego recap of the match is here.san diego[5] 4, duke[4] 3 doubles:1. stian klaassen and oliver tarvet(usd) d. pedro rodenas and theo winegar(duke) 6-12. cooper williams and andreja petrovic(duke) d. savriyan danilov and iiro vasa(usd) 6-33. nikhil niranjan and adrien berrut(usd) d. connor krug and teddy truwit(duke) 6-3order of finish: 2, 1, 3singles:1. oliver tarvet(usd) d. cooper williams(duke) 6-2, 6-42. pedro rodenas(duke) d. savriyan danilov(usd) 6-2, 6-23. iiro vasa(usd) d. andreja petrovic(duke) 6-2, 6-34. connor krug(duke) d. stian klaassen(usd) 3-6, 6-3, 7-55. adrien berrut(usd) d. gerard planelles ripoll(duke) 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-56. remi dugardin(duke) d. neo niedner(usd) 6-2, 6-0order of finish: 3, 6, 2, 1, 4, 5tcu[1] 4, baylor[8] 1doubles:1. lui maxted and pedro vives(tcu) d. marko miladinovic and oskar brostrom poulsen(bay) 6-32. luc koenig and deven badenhorst(bay) d. jack pinnington jones and cooper woestendick(tcu) 6-33. duncan chan and albert pedrico(tcu) d. ioan chirita and zsombor velcz(bay) 6-4singles:1. jack pinnington jones(tcu) v devin badenhorst(bay) 7-6(3), 3-6, 5-1, unf.2. pedro vives(tcu) d; oskar brostrom poulsen(bay) 7-6(6), 7-53. lui maxted(tcu) d. zsombor velcz(bay) 6-2, 7-54. duncan chan(tcu) d. luc koenig(bay) 6-4, 4-6, 6-15. albert pedrico(tcu) v ioan chirita(bay) 6-3, 6-7(4), 4-3, unf.6. marko miladinovic(bay) d. filip apltauer(tcu) 6-1, 6-0order of finish: 6, 3, 4, 2central florida will play stanford at noon central saturday, with san diego taking on tcu at 3:30 pm.the action at the smu venue was more predictable, with no. 2 seed virginia starting the day off with a 4-2 win over no. 7 seed michigan. the cavaliers dropped the doubles point, and the wolverines had their no. 1, gavin young, back in the lineup, but it wasn't enough, with virginia getting points from singles lines 1, 2, 5 and 6, with mans dahlberg clinching at line 5 after dropping the opening set."i'm really happy with mans dahlberg fighting back," said virginia head coach andres pedroso, who acknowledged that he wasn't suprised by michigan's strength in doubles. "i don't think he played that great in the first set, and he just fought back and found ways, as he's done the last two and a half years...i'm happy and grateful for the fight of my guys."virginia[2] 4, michigan[7] 2doubles:1. benjamin kittay and will cooksey(mich) d. keegan rice and james hopper(uva) 6-22. alex cairo and gavin young(mich) d. mans dahlberg and dylan dietrich(uva) 7-6(4)3. bjorn swenson and mert oral(mich) d. jangjun kim and rafael jodar(uva) 7-5order of finish: 1, 2, 3singles1. rafael jodar(uva) d.  gavin young(mich) 6-3, 6-22. dylan dietrich(uva) d. benjamin kittay(mich) 6-1, 6-33. james hopper(uva) v will cooksey(mich) 7-6(8), 5-2 unf.4. bjorn swenson(mich) d. keegan rice(uva) 6-2, 6-35. mans dahlberg(uva) d. patorn hanchaikul(mich) 2-6 6-1, 6-36. jangjun kim(uva) d. nicholas steiglehner(mich) 6-2, 7-6(2)order of finish: 2, 4, 1, 6next up was the battle between two texas schools, with the aggies and longhorns drawing an excellent afternoon crowd to the styslinger/altec tennis complex on the smu campus. a close doubles point went to texas, and the longhorns got points from lines 1 and 3 before lucas brown clinched at line 6. the contest at the top spot between two french freshmen, texas's timo legout and a&m's theo papamalamis, produced some mind-boggling points, with the most notable one at 4-4 in the first set. the speed, defense, volleys, lobs, and angles had the crowd breaking into premature applause on three of four occasions before legout finally managed to end the lengthy rally with a winner. papamalamis was a bit discouraged after that, and wasn't able to maintain that level in the second set, as legout gave no indication his own level would drop.the texas win sets up a rematch of one of the most memorable early season matches of the year, when texas went to charlottesville, went up 3-1 and then could not hold on, with virginia saving three team match points and taking an improbable 4-3 victory."no matter who we play in this tournament, the guys are going to be motivated," said texas head coach bruce berque. "but our guys are competitors and last time, virginia did a great job of stepping up when they had their backs against the wall. i'm sure virginia's going to come into the match with confidence, our guys will come into the match with hunger. i'm sure these guys will love to have the opportunity to close it out this time."that match is scheduled for noon central time.texas[3] 4, texas a&m[6] 1doubles:1. togan tokas and theo papamalamis(tamu) d. lucas brown and timo legout(tex) 6-32. pierre-yves bailly and sebastian gorzny(tex) d. luke casper and jc roddick(tamu) 6-43. jonah braswell and oliver ojakaar(tex) d. ritesh patil and tiago pires(tamu) 6-4order of finish: 1, 2, 3 singles1. timo legout(tex) d. theo papmalamis(tamu) 6-4, 6-12. jc roddick(tamu) sebastian gorzny(tex) 6-4, 7-53. pierre-yves bailly(tex) d. luke casper(tamu) 6-0, 6-14. tiago pires(tamu) v jonah braswell(tex) v 6-3, 5-6, unf.5. sebastian eriksson(tex) v togan tokac(tamu) 7-5, 5-5, unf.6. lucas brown(tex) d. ritesh patil(tamu) 7-6(4), 6-3order of finish: 3, 1, 2, 6the 3:30 p.m. match at smu saturday will feature to acc rivals with north carolina state, playing in its first team indoor quarterfinal against top seed wake forest.wake forest took out host smu 4-0,  but the mustangs had chances to put some pressure on the undefeated demon deacons, with the matches at lines 1 and 3 both at 6-6, 6-5 in the tiebreakers before wake's stefan dostanic and charlie robertson took those points to give their team five first sets."i think we've done a great job playing a really tough schedule," said wake forest head coach tony bresky. "baylor on the road, columbia at columbia, they had an incredible crowd, ohio state at home, georgia at home, tennessee at home. we've had some tough matches against some really good teams so far. so maybe in those breakers, at the end of those sets, that showed a little bit; our guys were more comfortable in those moments, you figure out what your plays are in those moments and i think that really helped us there."wake forest[1] 4, smu[8] 0doubles:1. stefan dostanic and dk suresh(wake) d. maks silagy and georgi georgiev(smu) 6-32. trevor svajda and louis cloud(smu v luca pow and luciano tacchi(wake) 6-6, unf.3. franco capalbo and ioannis xilas(wake) d. vikas deo and xavier calvelo(smu) 6-3order of finish: 1, 2singles:1. stefan dostanic(wake) v. trevor svajda(smu) 7-6(5), 3-1, unf.2. dk suresh(wake) d. jerry barton(smu) 6-4, 6-4 3. charlie robertson(wake) v ofek shimanov(smu) 7-6(5), 4-1, unf.4. georgi georgiev(smu) v ioannis xilas(wake) 6-4, 2-3, unf.5. luciano tacchi(wake) d. maks silagy(smu) 7-5, 6-06. luca pow(wake) d. noah mcdonald(smu) 6-2, 6-1order of finish: 6, 2, 5 no. 5 seed north carolina state pulled off the only minor upset of the day at smu, beating no. 4 kentucky 4-1. the wolfpack took the doubles point and got three quick first sets at lines 2, 4, and 6, and although those were the positions that ended up delivering the three singles points necessary, it wasn't straightforward, as fons van sambeek needed a third set to get the clincher at line 4."with three seniors and a junior on the team, it's really great to see the culmination of their hard work," said head coach kyle spencer. "not only did we have to go on the road to get here, we were facing a really good kentucky team, but we did a lot of positive things out there to force the action of the match, and in the end i think it was a little too much for them."spencer said there's very little they don't know about wake forest."we know them well, down the street, so to speak," spencer said. "it'll be an absolute battle and we're excited to play them. we play them at money tournaments, play them at futures, in the regionals, there's no real surprises and vice versa."nc state[5] 4, kentucky[4] 1doubles:1. braden shick and fons van sambeek(nc state) d. jaden weekes and martin breysach(ken) 7-52. jules leroux and luca stadheli(nc state) d. eli stephenson and jack loutit(ken) 6-43. nikolay nedelchev and william manning(nc state) v antoine ghibaudo and charlelie cosnet 5-5, unf.order of finish: 2, 1singles:1. antoine ghibaudo(ken) d. braden shick(nc state) 7-6(4), 6-32. martin borisiouk(nc state) d. jaden weekes(ken) 6-3, 7-6(4)3. luca staeheli(nc state) v jack loutit(ken) 7-6(5), 3-3, unf.4. fons van sambeek(nc state) d. charlelie cosnet(ken) 6-3, 3-6, 6-15. eli stephenson(ken) v nikolay nedelchev(nc state) 6-3, 6-7(1), 2-0 unf.6. jules leroux(nc state) d. matthew rankin(ken) 6-4, 6-2order of finish: 6, 1, 2, 4the main draw matches at both sites will be streamed by cracked racquets.

the above photo is from the elevator door of the styslinger/altec tennis complex on the campus of smu, one of the many details that the mustangs head coach grant chen has introduced to increase the visibility of the ita men's team indoor, one of division i's two major team championships. smu is one of two sites for this year's tournament, with first round and quarterfinal matches also being played at baylor, before those two teams move to smu for the semifinals and finals.today was media day, and due to the winter storm in the midwest, i decided to move up my arrival date, which allowed me to spend most of the day at the beautiful ruth & ken altshuler indoor courts. the six turpin stadium outdoor courts were rarely in use; with temperatures in the low 40s all day, even the abundant sunshine made a hit outside uncomfortable.all eight teams practiced indoors for two hours, then were escorted to the third level, which features a lounge and suites, where the ita staff took head shots, produced video introductions to use in the cracked racquets streaming and asked the "dating game" style questions to pairs of teammates for use on cr and social media. the coaches also did their interviews, the officials began to filter in, and the electronic line calling company play replay also has staff onsite to assist in that addition to the competition. friday's schedule for smu, with mark bey providing commentary on the cracked racquets youtube channel. all times central:virginia[2] v michigan[7] 9 amtexas[3] v texas a&m[6] noonwake forest[1] v smu[8] 3:30 pmkentucky[4] v nc state[5] 6:30 pmfriday's schedule for baylor, with alex gruskin providing commentary on the cracked racquets youtube channel.ohio state[2] v central florida[7] 9 amcolumbia[3] v stanford[6] noonduke[4] v san diego[5] 3:30 pmtcu[1] v baylor[8] 6:30 pmlinks to live streams and live scoring for all eight matches can be found at the ita's tournament page.the women's ita team indoor championships all-tournament team was announced today, with champion georgia getting the nod in four singles of the six singles spot and two doubles of the three doubles spots. click on the link above to see their results in the tournament.women's d-i team indoor all tournament team:singles:1. dasha vidmanova, georgia2. nicole khirin, texas a&m3. angella okutoyi, auburn4. aysegul mert, georgia5. guillermina grant, georgia6. sofia rojas, georgiadoubles:1. dasha vidmanova and mell reasco, georgia2. susanna maltby and carson tanguilig, north carolina3. aysegul mert and hayden mulberry, georgiai'll be completely occupied with men's team indoor coverage tomorrow, so here's the latest from two important itf junior circuit events, which are into their semifinal stages.at the itf j300 asuncion bowl in paraguay, keaton hance and noah johnston are through to the semifinals. johnston, the no. 5 seed, advanced when ivan ivanov of bulgaria retired down 1-0 in the first set. he will play no. 4 seed yannick theodor alexandrescu of romania, who beat no. 8 seed yannik alvarez of puerto rico 6-1, 6-4.no. 6 hance, who is now 12-1 in the last three j300 he's played in south america, defeated doubles partner valentin garay of argentina, the no. 3 seed, 6-0, 6-2 to set up a meeting with wild card romeo arcuschin of argentina. arcuschin beat no. 2 seed and last week's inka bowl j300 champion alejandro arcila of colombia 7-5, 6-2.hance is also through to the doubles finals, with garay. the top seeds will face unseeded thomas miranda and leonardo storck franca of brazil for the title.thea frodin, the no. 2 seed, lost in the quarterfinals today to unseeded maia ilinca burcescu of romania 6-2, 7-6(4), but is through to the doubles final, with partner yoana konstantinova of bulgaria. the top seeds will face no. 4 seeds anna maria fedotova of the dominican republic and sol ailin larraya guidi of argentina in the final.the highest seed still remaining at the j500 in cairo is no. 3 seed jacopo vasami of italy, with no. 7 seed ludvig hede of sweden taking out top seed and j300 cairo champion alan wazny of poland 7-6(2), 0-6, 7-6(7) in today's quarterfinals to advance to a meeting with vasami. in the bottom half, no. 9 seed pierre luigi basile of italy will play unseeded savva rybkin of russia.the four girls seeds in the semifinals are nos. 9, 10, 11 and 12. no. 9 seed petra konjikusic of serbia defeated no. 1 seed jana kovackova of the czech republic 6-4, 6-4 to advance against no. 10 seed nellie taraba wallberg of sweden. no. 11 seed rada zolotareva of russia will face no. 12 seed charo esquiva banuls of spain in the bottom half semifinal.

itf junior rule changes for 2025, utr joins usta's connect initiative



the itf always posts the rule changes for the junior circuit in  december, and it always takes me several weeks to find the time to study them. i posted a link to the 2025 rule change document in december as it related to the final itf junior rankings and the junior accelerator programs, but did not have an opportunity to dive in beyond that. while the changes are helpfully underlined in the complete version of  the itf wtt junior rules, what the changes replace isn't always so clear, so it helps to have the previous year's rules available for comparison.one of the big changes for 2025 was in entry fees, which increased dramatically, rising by 50% for the j500, j300 and j200 main draws: from $100 to $150. given that these tournaments provide hospitality, it's not an outrageous amount (usta level 1 tournaments are more than that now and do not provide hospitality), but the justification, which i missed on the first read, is interesting.every effort is made to keep entry fees for all tournament levels at a reasonable rate, but an increase is
needed in 2025 to enable the itf to continue to maintain existing tour systems; to provide improved
player support services; and importantly to allow us to explore new technology which has potential to
benefit players going forward. not all players travel with a coach and so we are working with partners to see if it will be possible to
introduce live streaming across certain tournaments, as well as capturing and sharing match analysis
data, tools which have potential to be beneficial for players as they develop their game. to assist us with maximising the impact of new technology, tournaments have been requested to
increase the number of matches featuring chair umpires and matches with live scoring and/or live
streaming in 2025. we will issue progress updates over the course of the year. because off court coaching has been introduced for this year at all itf levels, but only when a chair umpire is present, the itf appears to be addressing that issue in requesting more chair umpires and more live scoring and live streaming. that's a noble goal, but one i haven't seen implemented so far this year, including at this week's j500 in cairo. the problem with the itf's "requests" and "recommendations" is that they are not binding. it's been several years now that the itf has recommended that tournaments with 32-player main draws and 32-player qualifying draws change to 48 and 24, respectively, but that has not been adopted, with all the j300s in central and south america, and the j300 in egypt last week, using the 32 draws. many reduced draw sizes in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, but they haven't returned in the normal years since.there is now what is called a junior grand slam regional reserved exempt, which allows slams to formally designate a spot for a regional wild card playoff winner. roland garros has been doing this for several years with a south american qualifying tournament, using one of their wild cards; that is now a part of the itf acceptance criteria.other changes:electronic line calling is now possible within the new itf junior guidelinesplayers are now required to complete two additional itf academy courses to competethere are again more changes to the always complicated nationality/country representation rulesclarification regarding lucky loser sign-ins the day after the qualifying has been completedpermission to withdraw from one j30 or j60 and sign in as on-site alternate to another the same weekscrapping of the 16 & under team feed up initiativenew 16 & under regional reserved project for tennis europe and cosatsafeguarding course required for tournament directorsthere are many new requirements for tournament organizers at the higher level events; players should read these carefully and ask about them at the tournament desk if they do not see them being implemented. in my experience, some of the older requirements have not been provided, so i envision the possibility that the new ones will be adopted slowly, if at all.  these include, depending on the level of tournament:itf branding on show courtlive streaming, live scoring encouragedspectator seating at j300 and above, 250-person seating at j500sj500 indoor building a must for player lounge recommended for j300 tournamentsrequired number of stringersreasonable gym space and equipment a must at j300 and j500 tournamentsball persons recommended from semis at j300 and j500four balls per match, new balls for 3rd j300 a must, recommended ball changes at 11 and 13 for chaired matchesj500 4 balls, change after 11 and 13 a must, recommended at 9 and 11 gamesfree sport drinks a must at j500 tournament desks, recommended at j300transportation at least every 90 minutes a must if tournament hotel more than a 15-min walkthere are also changes to the itf junior team competition rules and regulations, but as these pertain to so few players, i will not go into those changes here.this is not a comprehensive look at the 2025 itf wtt junior rules and regulations or all the changes for 2025, but rather my annual plea for players, parents and coaches to review the changes and read through the entire set of regulations at least once each year so you can address issues that arise at tournaments in an informed and confident manner. the usta announced today that utr is one of four organizations joining its usta connect initiative. although the usta has not been using utr at all, having opted to implement the itf's world tennis number as an adjunct, utr has been using usta data in calculating its ratings; now this data sharing will go in both directions.from wednesday's usta release:included in this group of usta connect partners is utr sports. as a result of this agreement, results from a wide range of tournaments and leagues on the utr sports platform will be provided to the usta, while usta tournament and league match results will remain part of the utr rating system. the shift to bidirectional data sharing will yield more comprehensive analytics and insights for american tennis.  the itf world tennis number, along with the ntrp rating system, will continue to be the exclusive ratings for use in usta play. any new connection between utr and the usta is welcome, given the usta's mission of growing the game through as many avenues as possible. it's obvious that utr, particularly with its expansion of its pro tennis tour and its role as a trusted reference point for college coaches, is now a vital part of the tennis landscape in the united states and will add valuable input to the usta.more on usta connect, including a list of its current partners, can be found here.

georgia avenges ncaa final loss, wins ita women's division i team indoor title over texas a&m draws for men's d-i team indoor feature wake forest and tcu as top seeds; us open radically alters mixed doubles event for 2025



the university of georgia women got their revenge tuesday night at the ita women's national team indoor championships in evanston illinois, turning the tables on texas a&m in the second consecutive major team championship played between the teams. georgia had lost to texas a&m 4-1 in last may's ncaa final in stillwater, in a match moved indoors due to rain. nine months later the bulldogs prevailed by the same score, with 2024 fall ncaa champion dasha vidmanova clinching over mary stoiana at line 1.vidmanova had lost to stoiana 6-1, 7-6(4) in the ncaa team final, but had won both the ncaa doubles title in may and the singles title in november since. there was no question that match would be pivotal to the outcome, and vidmanova's 6-1, 7-6(5) victory provided some additional symmetry to the rematch.georgia had taken the doubles points with a quick 6-1 win at line 2 for anastasiia lopata and guillermina grant over daria smetannikov and mia kupres, and then a late break at line 1 that gave vidmanova and mell reasco a 7-5 victory over lucciana perez and stoiana.georgia took three first sets in singles, giving them a straight-sets path to four points and they got them, although with the requisite twists and turns that accompany most collegiate dual matches. sofia rojas, a transfer from oklahoma state who was not on the team that made the ncaa final, gave georgia a quick singles point, beating lexington reed 6-2, 6-2 at line 6 to record her fourth straight-sets win of the tournament.texas a&m's kupres, who had clinched the aggies 4-2 semifinal victory over oklahoma last night, was serving for her match with reasco at 5-3 shortly after rojas posted her point, but kupres was unable to close it out at line 3. reasco then seized the momentum and served for the set at 6-5, but lost a deciding point to send it to a tiebreaker.stoiana had buoyed the hopes of aggie fans with a break of vidmanova at 5-all in the second set, putting herself in the position of getting into the third set that texas a&m needed to extend the match. but serving at 6-5, she was broken at love, and once mert closed out perez 6-2, 7-5 at line 4 to give georgia a 3-0 lead, that tiebreaker was the focus.kupres did win her tiebreaker with reasco to get texas a&m on the board, but smetannikov dropped her second set to georgia's grant, providing georgia with a little more breathing room.vidmanova took a 4-2 lead in the tiebreaker and extended it to 6-2, but she needed all four match points to seal the championship. stoiana's return at 6-2 forced an error from vidmanova and stoiana came up with a dazzling drop volley-lob combination on the next match point. a confident stoiana overhead made it 6-5, with vidmanova getting her second match point on her serve, and unlike the first match point, she got her first serve in and blasted a forehand winner, putting that ncaa loss in the rearview mirror for all georgia fans, and picking up a fifth national indoor title for the trophy case.georgia[1] 4, texas a&m[1] 1doubles:1. dasha vidmanova and mell reasco(uga) v mary stoiana and lucciana perez(tamu) 7-52. anastasiia lopata and guillermina grant(uga) d. daria

friday, february 14th, and as with the women, will be playing the first three days at two different sites. the top two seeds at smu, which is also the semifinals and final site, are wake forest and virginia, leaving preseason no. 1 texas as the likely quarterfinal opponent for the cavaliers.  the top two seeds at baylor are tcu and ohio state, both of whom have recently lost to texas and wake forest, respectively. ohio state is the defending champion, having beaten tcu in a 4-3 nail-biter for the title.friday's first round matches at smu:(all times central)virginia[2] v michigan[7] 9 am

tournament. cracked racquets will again be providing coverage from both sites at their youtube channel.the usta announced today a major change to the mixed doubles competition this year, moving it to two days during qualifying week, reducing the draw size from 32 to 16 and prioritizing singles rankings in the selection of eight teams, while retaining eight wild cards. the tournament will also change formats introducing four-game sets prior to the final. the usta's release on these changes can be found here. prize money will increase substantially, with a million dollars going to the team that claims the championship.since this early morning announcement the reaction on social media has been mostly negative, with the consensus that this is changing a traditional major championship into an exhibition, and despite the monetary rewards, devaluing the title, opinions i share. for reactions from some of the top doubles players, including last year's us open mixed champions sara errani and andrea vavassori of italy, see this article from australia's channel 7.

texas a&m and georgia meet for women's division i team indoor championship in tuesday's rematch of 2024 ncaa final; brantmeier attorneys file amendment to include all college tennis players in suit against ncaa 



monday's semifinals at the ita women's division team indoor championships didn't have a promising start, with the georgia bulldogs cruising past virginia 4-0 in just two hours. georgia, the top seed at the northwestern site, went up quick breaks in all three doubles matches and never looked back, with virginia unable to get anything going once singles began. playing once again without elaine chervinsky, normally at no. 1 doubles and no. 2 singles, the cavaliers managed just one first set, at line three, and by that time it was already 3-0 georgia. it was a race to the clinch for the bulldogs, with aysegul mert beating martina genis salas 6-3, 6-2 at line 4 before dasha vidmanova could close out annabelle xu at line 1.georgia reached the final in 2023, losing to north carolina; their last indoor title came in 2019, with the team led by katarina jokic and featuring freshman maria carle, now in the wta top 100.georgia[1] 4, virginia[3] 0doubles:1. dasha vidmanova and mell reasco(uga) d. karolina kozakova and melodie collard(uva) 6-02. anastasiia lopata and guillermina grant(uga) d. martina genis salas and annabelle xu(uva) 6-23. ayesegul mert and hayden mulberry(uga) v margaret navarro and sara ziodato(uva) 4-4, unf.order of finish: 1, 2singles:1. dasha vidmanova(uga) annabelle xu(uva) 6-1, 5-2 unf.2. anastasiia lopata(uga) v sara ziodato(uva) 6-4, 2-2 unf.3. isabelle lacy(uva) v mell reasco(uga) 7-6(5), 2-1 unf.4. aysegul mert(uga) c martina genis salas(uva) 6-3, 6-25. guillermina grant(uga) d. melodie collard(uva) 6-0, 6-36. sofia rojas(uga) d. blanca pico navarro(uva) 6-2, 6-0order of finish: 6, 5, 4the nightcap was everything the first semifinal was not, it started out in similar fashion. texas a&m, the no. 1 seed at the illinois site, transitioned to the northwestern site with no discernible problems, and had early breaks in doubles that they held on to to take a routine doubles point from no. 6 seed oklahoma.but oklahoma immediately took control in the singles, with two quick wins by emma staker, the hero of the sooners 4-3 quarterfinal win over michigan on saturday, at line 4 and ava catanzarite at line 6 putting them up 2-1. that didn't last, with texas a&m taking lines 1 and 2 with mary stoiana and nicole khirin getting straight set wins to put the aggies back in front 3-2 a little over two hours into the match. but although texas a&m led, they were far from a victory, with both mia kupres at 3 and daria smetannikov at 5 having lost the first sets of their matches with sooner freshmen salakthip ounmang and gloriana nahum respectively.smetannikov had to save a match point serving at 4-5 in the second, after losing the first set 6-3 to nahum, but she went on to take the set 7-5, giving kupres a partner to shoulder the pressure. kupres had just earned a third set, winning four straight games at one stretch in the second set after going down 2-0 at its start.that same scenario played out in the third set, with kupres coming back from 2-0 down again. at 4-all in that match, with ounmang serving, nahum went down with a cramp with smetannikov leading 1-0, 30-all and received treatment throughout the game on the adjacent court. kupres had two break points at 30-40, with ounmang saving the first with a forehand winner, but on the deciding point, after a tense rally, she sent a forehand long, giving kupres the chance to serve for the match.the drama didn't end there, with kupres falling behind 15-30, before taking the next two points to earn two match points. she only needed one, with a first serve getting a return error from ounmang to send the aggies to their first national team indoor championship final.texas a&m[1] 4, oklahoma[6] 2doubles:1. mary stoiana and lucciana perez(tamu) d. cara mester and alina shcherbinina(ou) 6-42. daria smetannikov and mia kupres(tamu) d. julia garcia ruiz and chloe noel(ou) 6-43. salakthip ounmang and gloriana nahum(ou) v. jeanette mireles and nicole khirin(tamu) 5-4, unf.order of finish: 2, 1singles:1. mary stoiana(tamu) d. julia garcia(ou) 6-4, 6-02. nicole khirin(tamu) d, alina shcherbinina(ou) 6-4, 6-33. mia kupres(tamu) d. salakthip ounmang(ou) 5-7, 6-3, 6-44. emma staker(ou) d. lucciana perez(tamu) 6-2, 6-25. daria smetannikov(tamu) v gloriana nahum(ou) 3-6, 7-5, 2-0, unf.6. ava catanzarite(ou) d. lexington reed(tamu) 6-2, 6-2order of finish: 6, 4, 1, 2, 3tuesday's final, which will be broadcast at cracked racquets' youtube channel beginning at 7 p.m. eastern time, is a rematch of last may's ncaa team final, which texas a&m won 4-1. it's the first indoor final for the same two teams from the previous year's ncaa final since stanford beat florida in both finals in 2010 and 2011.although there is unlikely to be any decision on this case for many, many months, there have been periodic developments in the lawsuit filed by north carolina's reese brantmeier early last year against the ncaa's enforcement of its rules prohibiting tennis players from collecting prize money. today, attorneys for brantmeier and co-plaintiff maya joint have filed to include all college tennis student-athetes since march 2020 as plaintiffs. for more details, see this article from the carolina journal.
