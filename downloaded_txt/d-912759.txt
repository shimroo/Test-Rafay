for 77 days and counting justin of justin.tv has been broadcasting his life on the internet. everything he does is caught online give or take a few server issues and other technical glitches. i can barely handle being in front of the camera for two seconds let alone every second of my life but justin is hanging in there and so are his friends. i seem to have missed all the good stuff, like the interview with justine (who also is on camera most of the time at http://www.tastyblogsnack.com/live)that have made justin so popular. is it possible that with the advances in technology and things like online video and podcasting becoming so popular anyone can become famous? i mean i understand that most people still don't know what a podcast is or what justin.tv is but its still fun to think that with the right content and the right means to get it out there anyone can have their moment of fame.some may even turn that into more then just 15 minutes. hopefully with the continued advancement of technology more talented and entertaining people get more then a 15 minutes of fame and put their opinions, their content, their lives out there where people years ago would have never seen it.

	 the halo 3 beta is about to begin
	 



players from all over the world will get their shot at playing the multiplayer of halo 3 in less then 12 hours. i will be one of those players. i was sorta excited about it until about 10am this morning. thats when i listened to the egm live podcast. just hearing them talk about the beta and the fun they were having, the new control scheme, the maps, the man cannon?, and how they were not sure they could go back to halo 2 after playing it. i wanted to play it then. i was tempted to take a vacation day on wednesday so i could play it all day long. i didn't, but i will definetly be devoting alot of my time to it over the next several weeks. my coverage will appear here, on the podcast (that's good to know), and on the website popular distractions. hope to see you online.ps: i am not sure how it will work, but i am planning on using the video capture ability added to halo 3 to post some video on my xbox live gamertag. i know they are viewable, i am just not sure if its only on xbox live or if you can see them on xbox.com, i will keep you posted. my gamertag is jcrichton77labels: bungi, gamertags, halo, halo 2, halo 3, microsoft, video games, xbox 360, xbox live, xbox.com

	 falling behind sucks....especially with smallville
	 
    


smallville has been one of my favorite shows since the day it first aired. over the years i would miss an episode here and there but catch it reruns. this year i missed a few too many i think. then tonight i went on youtube and found a bunch of videos for the finale and a bizarro episode? ??? does that really exsist? either way i am psyched now. i have 2 episodes on tape and the finale this week. take a look at these videos and see what you think.
