all about (last) eve



although we weren't able to do it on feb. 14 this year, damian and i kept our valentine's day tradition alive of seeing a classic film for the occasion yesterday when we caught a screening of joseph mankiewicz's "all about eve' at the metrograph downtown. (in 2015 we saw "the philadelphia story" at bam and have never looked back!) it was damian's first time seeing bette davis's sublime performance as aging broadway star margo channing and, having not seen it in decades, all but mine. i certainly can't tell "the gays" anything they don't already know about this masterpiece that won six oscars including best picture and best director. but boy is it a thrill from beginning to end. (at one point damian turned to me and whispered: "i just got chills"!) xo

photo finish



 still in shock about the death of gary caesar, a gifted photo editor and former colleague whom i'm so grateful to have known for more than 20 years. gary's sense of style and million-dollar smile will never be forgotten, but i'd be so happy to see him one more time. rest in peace, my friend.
