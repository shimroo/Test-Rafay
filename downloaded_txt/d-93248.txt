our mission
we are a community of vowed franciscan women centered in eucharist. our mission is to be loving presence through prayer, witness and service. we are dedicated to sharing life in community, which centers us in prayer and deepens the meaning of our consecrated life. we are inspired to bring the love of christ that we encounter in the chapel out to the world. we are dedicated to responding to the needs of this time as we accompany all who face systemic inequities and as we provide a compassionate presence and give witness to the gospel of jesus christ.
