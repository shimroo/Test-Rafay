word on the street 


 




 



									at this time few things are more important than the exploration, discussion and reflection encouraged and facilitated by south carolina humanities – the state’s primary vehicle for advancing shared cultural experiences and consideration of ideas. south carolina humanities energizes communities, libraries, schools, museums and higher education institutions reaching across the state to help make us all more understanding and, yes, more humane.								



sig huitt 

former board member 




 




 



									through the 2016 sc humanities festival in beaufort, people and groups gently stepped out from their silos and worked together to make our hometown an even better place… historical and cultural organizations and artists of all kinds, from north and south of the broad river, came together to present the sc humanities festival in beaufort county. the theme was: ‘inspire, engage, and enrich.’ we all came together seamlessly to give something very special!
