                                    new range of subs                                
our range of subs has expanded 
                                      and we now offer a range of subs for music, 
                                      home theatre and combined systems. l series 
                                      is our entry level product line and f/e 
                                      series is our premium product line. 
                                    output comparison                                
every one of our subwoofers 
                                      has bass extension lower than 20hz. our 
                                      frequency response specification is based 
                                      on -3db point which is far more stringent 
                                      than +/-3db that other manufacturers have 
                                      used. +/-3db is more like our -6db specification 
                                      because the former is equivalent to 0db/-6db 
                                      specification. lower bass extension is also 
                                      advantageous in multiple sub setup.
                                    at 20 hz, our subs vary 
                                      in their maximum output capability. the 
                                      output at 20 hz is shown relative to f12. 
                                    when comparing ported models 
                                      vs sealed models, ported models will have 
                                      more full body bass and it can contribute 
                                      a bit higher output in subjective perception 
                                      of bass loudness that is not reflected in 
                                      db numbers. also larger diameter drivers 
                                      such as those in f18 do have more output 
                                      below 20hz.

home theatre subs
for systems where home 
                                      theatre is the main priority, we recommend 
                                      our vented subs. at 20 hz, a vented sub 
                                      is comparable to the output of two similar 
                                      sealed subs. lv12f 
                                      is our lowest cost sub and is designed for 
                                      smaller rooms and modest budgets. our larger 
                                      15" subs are suited to larger rooms 
                                      and have substantially more output. don't 
                                      be fooled by typical comments about vented 
                                      subs lacking accuracy. these subs are tight 
                                      and musical. 
music only systems
for music-only systems we recommend our sealed subs. we have sealed subs in various sizes and finishes. where high output at 20 hz is not needed, our sealed subs  will match the output of their vented equivalents. in addition, greater extension is possible. combined with room gain, in-room extension to 14 hz or even lower is possible. 
combined systems
for combined music and home theatre systems, many of our 15" sealed subs are a good all round compromise. our dual sealed 15" f25 is a very good choice, offering the lfe output of our vented subs but with the added bonus of greater midbass efficiency and output. 
direct servo technology  
the secret to accurate bass is in our patented direct servo technology. 


                                      a sensing coil provides immediate feedback 
                                      to ensure the cone precisely follows the 
                                      input signal. the result is very tight, 
                                      accurate and dynamic bass. unlike many other 
                                      non-servo subs which exhibit two-mode bass: 
                                      either with too much bass when volume is 
                                      up or with too little or no bass when the 
                                      volume is down, our higher resolution subwoofers 
                                      allow customers to listen at lower level 
                                      and yet able to hear detailed bass in a 
                                      wide range of volume level.

our customers say ... 
from our customers we often hear comments like these:
"this is the cleanest, tightest, and most accurate bass i've ever experienced." ... rob  more
"... i am hearing notes i've never heard before." ... kent b  more
" it's quite satisfying when you hear that some bass notes, previously thought to be a single note, are actually two notes or a series of shorter notes." ... darren k  more
