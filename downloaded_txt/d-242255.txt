							promotion of oneness of humanity.						
























objectives

					the gaden phodrang foundation of the dalai lama was founded by his holiness the 14th dalai lama and aims to promote basic human values, mutual understanding among religions, peace and non-violence and the protection of the environment. it helps to preserve the unique tibetan culture and supports the tibetan people, but also other people in need, regardless of nationality, religion and origin.						



















humanity
“in working for the good and oneness of humanity i don’t think of myself just as a tibetan or a buddhist, but as a human being. we have to think of the whole of humanity. being human is the common ground in our efforts to create a better and a more compassionate world because we all survive in dependence on others.”
