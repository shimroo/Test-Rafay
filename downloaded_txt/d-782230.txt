our mission 



texas rivers protection association 



texas rivers have always flowed through the land and lives of the people who depended on them for food, agriculture, recreation and transportation. but now, most of our rivers have been dammed, diverted, polluted, channelized or fenced in. we pledge to protect the flow, water quality and natural beauty of the rivers of texas.

get on the water 



discover texas rivers 



at trpa, we believe that the best solutions concerning problems with our streams in texas often involve citizen education. we’ve seen over and over that experiencing the magic of floating on a river helps people to better understand why we need to protect these rivers for future generations. of the 23 major river basins of texas, we are highlighting fifteen favorites and an assortment of coastal paddling trails to choose from. with that, we encourage you to find a texas river to enjoy, whether it’s exciting whitewater or tranquil quiet water.these descriptions, maps and paddling trails are intended as a starting point and are not a fully inclusive list of good places to paddle.

"a whole river is mountain country and hill country and flat country and swamp and delta country, is rock bottom and sand bottom and weed bottom and mud bottom, is blue, green, red, clear, brown, wide, narrow, fast, slow, clean, and filthy water, is all the kinds of trees and grasses and all the breeds of animals and birds and man that pertain and have ever pertained to its changing shores..."
