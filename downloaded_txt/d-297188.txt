wellness program 



 



 



central to rogosin’s mission is to empower patients through education and provide opportunities for all treatment options. the rogosin wellness program does that by connecting kidney patients to wellness ambassadors, who are peer mentors living with kidney disease, with the goal of empowering them to take charge of their health care decisions.learn more at our wellness site and our educational page with the national kidney foundation. 











what drives the rogosin institute?  



 



the world health organization defines true health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. rogosin works with patients, families, and community organizations to raise awareness about kidney disease and its risk factors and to encourage healthy behaviors to prevent chronic diseases. through partnerships with community-based organizations, rogosin mobilizes local residents, healthcare providers, youth, and community leaders to improve health outcomes in their neighborhoods. working with local, state, and federal government agencies, rogosin seeks to create new and better healthcare policy.

patient testimonials 



 






for the last five years, i have been receiving dialysis at rogosin and have been so happy for their dedicated care. i like the way they deal with me and all the patients. there is always someone to talk to and to help with most needs.




janine n. 






 






i have been a patient since 2005. had a kidney transplant in 2006. the staff is amazing and caring, in all my ups and downs they’ve extended extreme support. love them all dearly! they’re the best!!!




abigail c.  






 






the flexibility of home dialysis has allowed me to keep family and friends at the center of life instead of treatment. the option of home dialysis made treatment less isolating and more an integral part of family life.




l. wadsworth 






 






the nocturnal program at rogosin has provided freedom during the day for me to be with my family. the other plus is how i feel. this is the best i have felt since having my own functioning kidney.
