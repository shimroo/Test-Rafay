listen! do you hear a subtle hum, a buzz of computation? the  billions of microprocessors sold every year underlie the very fabric of civilization.
    i'm jack ganssle (bio) and i'm on a mission to help embedded developers produce better products faster.the 1300+ articles on this site all give better ways to build embedded products, while maximizing the fun of engineering hardware and firmware.

the embedded muse
the embedded muse was a newsletter that ran for 27 years with articles of interest to embedded developers, for both firmware and hardware. check out the back issues.
articles, books and  tool reviews
i have written over 1000 articles  about  embedded systems since 1988, as well as six books about embedded systems. don't miss my reviews of about 70 other books on the subject.
vendors make all sorts of claims about their   tools, but real-world experience is much more important. developers have   contributed their   opinions about a huge number of tools. 
from salary surveys to  articles about debouncing,   ultra-low power design, consulting, floating point approximations,   testing ram, watchdog timers and much, much more - check out these special reports about embedded issues.
