decalogue of service
	  
  
	
      (what sets us apart from competitors?)
	  
  
relaxed mornings - nothing rushed. our dive boats depart at 9am and/or even more flexible  as may be requested by divers. 

	  upon request, certified divers will receive, prior to their first "splash" of their season, a 3 minute oral review on scuba skills and safety tips.
