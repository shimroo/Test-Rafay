welcome to
mchenry county

looking to have some fun? mchenry county is full of recreational opportunities as diverse as our population, from our family-friendly trails to out-of-the-box recreational areas, festivals, and live entertainment spots. plus, roadways and metra rail lines to major metro areas like chicago, milwaukee, madison, and rockford make it easy to be in the city within an hour or so. but in between the metropolitan amenities, you’ll find quiet moments of peace and solitude, whether you’re hiking the trails, casting a line on the fox river, or hand-picking freshly grown produce from a farm stand. when you make mchenry county your home, you’ll find that culture, connectivity, and wide-open spaces are just part of the value — and a way of life.
