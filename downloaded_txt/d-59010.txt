recent sermonnext: confusing confessionin a glorious scene from the gospels, peter confesses that jesus is the christ, the anointed one sent by god to save the world. the very next words out of peter’s mouth are in rebuke of jesus, telling the lord he is certainly not going to die as he was claiming. that must have been confusing to jesus. when we confess jesus as lord, we commit to walking behind jesus in his way.  you can’t confess jesus as lord and then keep running your own show.
