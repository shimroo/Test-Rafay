member payback
when great plains does well, it's the member-owners who benefit. over the last 17 years the credit union has given back nearly $11 million to its members in the form of interest rebates and bonus dividends!





free services 
not only does great plains offer most of the financial services you need but many are at no cost. these include online and mobile banking plus bill payment service with no monthly limits. click on the services tab above to check out the services provided by great plains.




great rates
great plains prides itself on consistently offering competitive savings and borrowing rates. most financial institutions offer special rates for a limited time. these “specials” often come with relationship requirements like opening other accounts at the institution. they may also have fees associated with them or limitations that make them end up not being that special after all.
