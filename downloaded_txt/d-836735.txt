 "we stayed here for 2 weeks. my wife and i loved it so much we booked for a month next year. it has an old florida vibe. my wife really appreciates the cleanliness and attention to detail. the whole staff from the manager eric to olga the housekeeper are very helpful and friendly. each unit is unique so there are many options available. we have stayed several different places on anna maria but this is definitely our favorite."

 "wonderful beachfront resort with spectacular views! no stress in finding a place to settle for the day on the beach. plenty of space and chairs. many great dining experiences nearby & bridge street within walking distance. would highly recommend for a quiet, low key beach getaway."
diane s on trip advisor


 
 "what a jewel! this place is the perfect beach resort. my boyfriend and i had an amazing stay in the violet cottage. this adorable cottage has everything you need for the perfect stay. we walked into a large room with a comfortable king size bed, big tv, full kitchen amenities, and the best part - a beautiful white sandy beach! eric checked us in and was more than helpful and a fantastic host. can't wait to come back again!"
