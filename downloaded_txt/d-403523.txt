it began with a biscuit.our cream cheese biscuits were created many years ago by chef michael gagne. he perfected his biscuit technique in the kitchen of the robinhood meetinghouse, his family’s restaurant on the coast of maine. what chef gagne crafted was a delicate, buttery biscuit with endless flaky layers designed for you to easily bake at home.chef gagne and the rest of us baked with simple ingredients we felt good about at our restaurant and we still do to this day. it must be clean, simple, real food that delivers on taste to be robinhood meetinghouse.
