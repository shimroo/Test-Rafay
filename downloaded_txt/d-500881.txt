about us








please remember -- most everything ( but not
all) is
handmade
and that takes time.   we specialize in custom orders but we
always keep some items on hand, so please be sure to
browse our currently available pages. 
check
out our photo gallery for pictures of
custom
items we've made in the past.

the contents of this site show
examples of
our work and provide a general sense of our prices. this is by no
means everything we are capable of doing, and the pages show only a
small sample of the kinds of clothing we can create. our custom
services
have become complex enough that a printed brochure can't keep up with
styles, accessories, and prices. this web-site is currently the most
accurate presentation of our available services and merchandise.
