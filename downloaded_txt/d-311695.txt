i had hoped to delay the writing of this blog for many reasons, but the word is out to some so i feel it is my responsibility to deliver the news. it is with bittersweet feelings that i inform you of my resignation from borel middle school. you, my beloved geeks, are the reason that accepting my new position was so difficult. i adore and respect you all and have been privileged to have been your teacher and director. neither you nor the faculty and staff are the reason i am leaving. it was difficult to pass up the offer presented to me, a school in san jose across my old high school where i will teach dance, including dance team. i have met the new drama teacher and feel she is very qualified. she has a background in drama and education so this position is quite perfect for her. she also might be the one to get a play put on at borel. you are in good hands. again, my darlings, this was a difficult decision for me because i care for you so much. i told you at the end of classes that i can't have kids and adopt you in my heart. you are my kids and no longer being your teacher is so very difficult to bear. i am one of your biggest fans and hope you stay in contact with me (utenasnow@aol.com) to let me know what your are doing. i would love to come see you in shows and will still be able to as i am staying local. love, hugs, kisses, a "go team!" or two, and all my adoration,empress

	 look ahead - april and may
	 
    


first of all, i hope everyone had as much fun at our cast outing as i did. there's nothing more enjoyable than watching a bunch of theatre geeks fall all over the place. we have a few awards from last night:most spectacular display of gravity - jack! conor receives an honorable mention.best use of ice scrapings as a clothing item - jacob! monique receives the honorable mention after a few lovely falls on her jumps. best smile after repeated hat stealings - aaron! (i did not condone this game, i promise)nicest layback position - skylar, resident skater from the cast. most likely to be in trouble for trying to knock me over - anna... i'll get you my pretty!pictures of this evening will be on the windows. week of april 23rdmondayiiv3-6finch, frump, twimble4:30-6add gatch, miss jones, rosemary, biggley5-6add mailerstuesday - this has a time change due to a mandatory meeting i must attend!iiixa & iix4-6allwednesdayiiv review3-4finch, frump, twimble, gatch, miss jones, rosemary, biggley, mailersthursdayact one speed thru for blocking3-5allfridayact two speed thru for blocking3-4:30allsaturdaydance clean & spacing12:15-1 "pirate"1-2 brotherhood2-3 coffee break3-4 secretary4-4:30parisin honor of courtney and brynn's birthday (april 30th and may 1st) the off book deadline will be monday the 30th for our first stumble thru. use the speed thrus to test yourself! during stumble and run thrus focus and noise become major issues. when cast members are not onstage they may either: do homework or be practicing their dances, songs, and dialog. excessive talking will result in a dismissal from rehearsal that will be counted as an unexcused absence. i will not be breaking for intermission so use your longer breaks between scenes to use the bathroom. remember - run thrus, especially those with the orchestra, are not rehearsals where you are retaught the material. run thrus are to practice what you already know! if you are unsure of something, get with a cast member to review. we're almost there. go team!
