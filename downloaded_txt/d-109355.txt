welcome to the orthodoxphotos.com web photo gallery!



	      this photo gallery brings you no less than 1747 pictures of different orthodox christian sights. they are meant to bring the
              holy orthodox faith closer to the souls of the people. the orthodox church is the initial form of christianity,
              long before catholicism and protestantism. it is the initial christian church, the undivided church, the early church
              that was formed 2000 years ago by our lord jesus christ when after his ascension, he sent down upon his apostles
              the holy spirit to help them start building the church - presently known as eastern orthodox church.
