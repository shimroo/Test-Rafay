i have been a money order agent with memo since 2017! memo has been a fantastic company to work with over the years and i would strongly recommend anyone in the grocery or convenience store business to consider offering the service if you are looking for a way to generate additional foot traffic to help increase profits. offering the money order service has provided my business with a competitive edge. i would highly recommend memo’s services to any company; their customer service is exceptional!

boyer’s food markets and memo have been business partners for decades!  it is because of that great partnership that last year we also added memo bill payment to the list of services we offer our customers as it is a far superior service compared to our previous provider.  having a dedicated national accounts manager like tony is outstanding and their customer service is second to none!!  i would highly recommend memo’s services to any company!
