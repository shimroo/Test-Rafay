keswick mrt is primarily responsible for the area outlined on the map which includes skiddaw, helvellyn and great end. for more extensive search operations we will operate anywhere in the lake district or even further afield.
the map shows the rescues for this year with the yellow flag the most recent. click on the pins for the details.
as well as rescues we also receive “alerts” where the team is contacted but the issue is usually resolved by mobile phone rather than team deployment.
