extramask from "the game" (aka 26, barry kirkey is his real name) has a radio podcast every morning called "the barry kirkey radio show" where he talks about the pua community in general. he has no problem giving an opinion on every single guy out there and ripping on him, if he thinks he deserves it. the show is pretty funny and entertaining. take a look at it here:  http://www.revolution31.com/blog/

i never really bothered about other puas, i was introduced first to neil strauss and read his book. interesting enough, the first few chapters were extremely good until the middle where tips were hidden in words.but it got me researching with mystery and his method, finally to his tv show. i finally found his company and bought magic bullets. it was really effective as it improved my skills alot.i did a website completely love system's manuals, i bought all of them.http://www.wayofseduction.org

alright here's the deal ladies i mean gentlemen;  was that a neg?  i am a man, and by the looks of the only one on the internet.  ha.  so, if you are interested in picking up a woman, first decide if it's to sleep with her or marry her.  i only deal with trying to marry a woman because seducing is so fucking easy.  the key here is to be so totally self-conscious that you, in essence, are disclosing everything about yourself.  but this only makes sense if the other person is actually listening, most times they are not.  i suppose now that i look at the comment moderation, this comment might not even see the light of day, so be it.  the key to understanding a woman is that they are based solely on anxiety.  that's it, nothing more; don't get me wrong, that's a good thing.  long story short, if you take that away, they feel safe, and might fall in love with you.  the contradiction lies in that they also love this anxiety so if you take it all away they feel trapped.   female seducers love the anxiety that tastes bitter-sweet, it makes them feel alive, mostly because they are otherwise dead inside.  so to invoke this, simply realize that they think too.  they know everything you are trying to do before you even get to it.  why else did you come up to them?  what most women crave, to make their life meaningful to them, is a chance encounter, an unexpected happening that works out.  that divine force that makes them think life sucks and that they are going to die at such a young age is reversed into a god of blessing.  you.  the key is not to force the issue at all, of course to dodge around it will get you no where.  actually listen to what they are saying.  each bit from the word to the tone of their voice is revealing.  first every beautiful girl knows they are beautiful, how could they not?  you schmucks keep telling them.  so what to do ... do nothing.  keep still, be preoccupied, and most importantly clever.  react instantly to anything you would find offensive.  a tempered look of disgust is all that is needed.  then look away.  laugh earnestly at their jokes, which are only so often funny, and suspicious side glances will also instill curiosity.  they are having a dialog in their mind about what's going on, based on everything that has happened to them from each joy to every repressed thought, and if you break that, they become anxious.  perhaps i am not making sense to you, that is always the case.  alas, girls have asked me to marry them all from a stare.  i look like anthony keatis or dave grohl for god's sake, at least that's what women tell me.  it's true know that you might not be tall enough, skinny enough, jacked enough, but it doesn't matter.  a woman just looking to get laid is all she will get.  besides she is still concerned about the first guy that broke her heart, whether it looks like it or not.  now that i think about it, it is a pathetic game.  i'm better left ignored.

new to the community and several weeks into dyd material. it's done wonders for self confidence and inner game, but i'm beginning to realize that there is no teacher like experience. struck up a conversation the other day and pulled off a 3-minute number close you could have wrapped a bow around. mind you the girl is maybe a cute 7, everything seems to be going ok after 1 hour of coffee and a walk. i'll see her again for tea this week, but something has struck me as i've replayed things in my mind.does dyd work with girls who arent a 9 or 10? many of the techniques dd talks about are aimed at being challenging and different from most guys who approach  attractive  women. given that a 6 or 7 may not be approached by men on a continuous basis, she may not have the same psychological makeup or a 9 or a 10 (in the sense that she inherently filters the men that approach her). does c+f, acting indifferent, and other techniques that dyd preaches work on more average women?

vin just put out an awesome e-book called "the attraction code." it very clearly illustrates dominance and how to achieve the state and execute it. imo he's one of the best because he's no-bull****.

hey donovani've been obsessed with this stuff for the last month now, and your site is by far the best resource i've found. very few site aren't out there to get your money, so you deserve big praise.one concern though: is there any way that you could index all the invaluable resources of your site? i can never find anything in here! like the mystery method is outlined in several posts, but how do i go from a2 to a3? i have to go back to google everytime...

when i first started learning how to meet women and get dates, the internet was an amazing tool for me.one of the great things about meeting women online is that you can literally do it anytime... from anywhere...it's also a great place to practice first conversations, cocky & funny humor, and escalating from "conversations" to dates.if you're interesting in learning more about how to meet women online, then you should take a couple of minutes and check this out. make sure you watch the video clips, by the way...http://www.seduction-chronicles.net/mwolet me know what you think.talk soon,david d.labels: david deangelo, online dating

online dating is a great tool. if you have a great assortment of photos (ie wearing nice clothes, around other girls, having fun) you will get noticed and get more dates than you can handle.

first let me say i'm a girl. and i have to say i am truly amazed! the techniques you talk about always work!!! even if the guy is not that attractive. enough "negs", cockiness and of course humor, and i'm ready to mount the guy!! the problem is most guys are pusses!!! where are all these alpha male men?? so i'm wondering where does a girl find guys who actually have a clue??? is there something we can do to attract those guys. b/c seriously i can't date another loser wuss.

this is amazing.  so, the "neg" should replace the "compliment" altogether?  okay, granted, atleast for a1-c2, but after those stages, when you get into c3-s3, then true compliments are welcome, right?  or not?? when are "normal" compliments like "damn, you're beautiful." accepted, welcomed, desired more than negs?  i believe the efficacy of the "neg", but i can't believe that it's completely killed off all desire for normal compliments.  negs are more creative, yes, but people desire a good ol' fashioned compliment now and again.
