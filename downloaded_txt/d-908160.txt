tj faculty attends isac conference in st. louis
11/13/2024
the tj faculty attended the annual conference of the independent schools association of the central states (isacs). since this conference rotates among major cities in the midwest, it was a particular gift that its st. louis setting allowed our entire faculty to join 1,100 other independent-school educators from 140 schools in 13 states in thinking about the art and science of teaching. tj faculty attended sessions on the neuroscience of learning, ai, strategies for building students' moral courage, and pedagogy across a variety of disciplines. we are grateful the tj community recognizes that such learning opportunities only strengthen our ability to provide—as our mission states—"the strongest possible college-preparatory program." such a program considers all aspects of our students' development into young adults with the skills, knowledge, courage, and open-mindedness it takes to "lift up the world with beauty and intellect."
