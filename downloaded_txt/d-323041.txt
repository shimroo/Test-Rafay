united progressive alumni : upa home
          










welcome to the online home of progressive alumni
we are an independent organization of cornellians
dedicated to the continual transformation of
our alma mater into a more inclusive, just, and democratic
institution. we believe that the university and its
administration should themselves practice the values impressed upon
every student at commencement: civic responsibility, ethical
integrity, and commitment to a just community.
if you're a fellow
cornellian, you may wish to examine our aims and consider joining our alternative alumni
network.
if you're from another
school and wish to build your own alternative alumni network,
we can help - we hope to see similar networks established everywhere
to build a diverse new community of progressives. please visit the critical mass page for
more details.
if youâre interested in online gambling,
  we encourage you to take a look at the full list of netbet casino slots in order to familiarize yourself with their features.
