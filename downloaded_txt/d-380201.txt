we 
                      believe that an organization's 
                      abiding sense of "being responsible" in all its 
                      decisions and activities is what leads to organizational 
                      integrity. 
                      we work with leaders of organizations of all sorts and sizes 
                      to help them become a responsible enterprise. an 
                      ethical edge is the competitive and cooperative advantage 
                      a responsible enterprise gains by embracing 
                      organizational integrity 
                      as its fundamental philosophy of organizational purpose. 
                      an evolving branch of applied ethics, organizational 
                      integrity aims to expand the depth and breadth of trust 
                      among an organization's stakeholders: leadership, employees, 
                      shareholders, suppliers, communities, and the environment. 
                      
this 
                        site describes the theoretical basis and practical application 
                        of the emerging concepts of the responsible enterprise 
                        and organizational integrity, which drive effective 
                        strategies 
                        for responsible business. it is a public service

ethics 
                      and policy integration 
as 
                      lynn sharp paine writes, superior performance in today's 
                      world has both a moral and a financial dimension. organizational 
                      integrity provides the ethical foundation 
                      for organization design and development. 
                      it goes beyond the particular concerns of business ethics, 
                      governmental ethics, professional ethics, and environmental 
                      ethics to address how people responsibly expand their range 
                      of informed choice to achieve shared purposes. it, in turn, 
                      embodies two exciting approaches to the ethics and practices 
                      of organizations in an era of globalization: organizational 
                      ethics and the learning 
                      organization. these three concepts underlie 
                      emerging international standards of stakeholder engagement, 
                      organizational performance, and program evaluation and reporting. 
                      these are implemented by organizations of all sorts and 
                      sizes, in turn, through corporate 
                      responsibility programs unique to each 
                      organization, which draw on a developing body of "best 
                      practices." 
the 
                      responsible 
                      business enterprise is a developing concept 
                      that strives to integrate the myriad perspectives on the 
                      role of business with emerging global norms. as such, it 
                      looks at business form a number of perspectives: corporate 
                      social responsibility, corporate governance, organizational 
                      ethics, and business and professional ethics.

                      inquiry is an ongoing process of discovery, and you are 
                      invited to join in! our findings 
                      are organized into answers to questions 
                      about the essentials of organizational integrity and 
                      what it means for business, government and other associations.
