– steve, new crest court
“we love our new davidson home. we have purchased other new homes and the davidson product is a step above. the design details are all very well thought out and executed. the customer service is outstanding.”









– bryan and jennifer, arterro homeowner
“… davidson thought of every detail and the workmanship is outstanding. from our open floor plan and entryway, to a sprinkler system in every room- no detail was spared.”









– chelsey, arterro homeowner
“i purchased my davidson home about 8 months ago and i absolutely love it…also, the home is well built and absolutely beautiful. the floor plans are open and inviting… if we ever move, we will buy another davidson home.”









– gregg & theresa, arterro homeowner
“we are so happy to be moved into our beautiful new home and we look forward to spending many years here.”









– pat hasbrook, kensington del sur homeowner
“i can remember bill coming up to the house when it was being built and saying, “see that wall over there, we’re going to change it. i don’t like it.” he subsequently had the wall changed to accommodate the courtyard, separating it from the other outdoor living space. bill is a visionary. what he did changed the entire scheme of what would become our back garden.” 









– g & s, arista homeowner
“my wife and i recently purchased a home from your organization at the arista development at the crosby. our experience in working with your team has been so remarkably unique, positive and unexpected that we felt compelled to tell you just how very pleased we’ve been with the entire experience.”
