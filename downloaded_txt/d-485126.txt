|complacent]hellooooooo, long time no seeeeee. as you can see, some friends were very curious what was going on with me, so here i am!same ol', same ol'. though the mental health group in control of my life has now contracted out to two other frickin groups to help (me). i guess i'm just that big of a fuck-up. because i get barely any exercise, i sometimes get cramps, usually after the weekly outing "into the community". today's was the worst though: all four appendages. yes, both my legs and arms. ugh. but i got through it, like i always do. my daily life continues to consist of video gaming and watching tv & movies to help forget how very crappy my life is. i'm currently watching brooklyn nine nine (among many other things). i gave up on it during season 1, but now i've started it all over again. such a funny show. i also recently finished a rewatch of power rangers jungle fury on dvd. man, those disney seasons are looking so much better now.. that we've seen the neo saban seasons. lol.i also continue to buy blu-rays, when i can afford them anyway. i try and save money from my money that the mental health group gives me every week. sometimes i fail, sometimes i don't. nebula realms is just too tempting sometimes, y'know? ..i'm starting to consider importing international copies of the marvel cinematic universe blu-rays now, since i recently discovered that the us doesn't get imax 2d versions of the movies with the full pictures. shifting aspect ratios and all that. dahmyoo disney! :( there appears to have been six so far, and i've downloaded them from international torrent sites, but i'd rather have discs to save hard drive space. :pi.. dunno what else to say. as i said, same ol' same ol' for the most part. except my landlord continues to try and kick me out of my apartment. and i think the mental health group in control of my life continues to want me in assisted living. but i won't have that shit. the world continues to work against me, but in my way i continue to fight back i guess. ssdd. same shit different day.see yas.

ws-37393-9: damnit soony.
[jun. 3rd, 2017|12:37 pm]
prometheusufo




on thursday, at one of my case workers' insistence, i closed my long-standing bank account and put my money on a prepaid card. i was able to pay for my phone.. and then they blocked me from spending any more of my money. so when the 24 hour internet fast didn't work with my psn ip ban problem and i wanted to buy a new router.. i couldn't. and so i reached out to my awesome twitter followers to paypal me so i could get that router. but of course no one helped out. *sigh* i miss my psn friends so bad. and a router replacement appears to be the only option now. i've googled ws-37393-9. i've youtubed ws-37393-9. all the fixes out there either would not work or it wasn't possible to do them.. i found a page recently where i could buy an amazon gift card code directly from paypal, so if anyone were to paypal me, i'd put the money to good use and buy that router right away. i need a wired router. and i found a refurbished one for $30 on amazon. that's with shipping...but oh well. i'll just sit here doing nothing. because just about everything i used to do involved psn. as you may know, i'm really shy in real life and have been diagnosed with aspergers. i talk to no one. but i was able to get out there a bit thanks to psn and my friends list of about 300. lol. among my friends, i coined the catchphrase "damnit soony", making fun of everything they did wrong and everything they claimed was coming "soon". that phrase has now never been truer.damnit soony.

a 24 hour internet fast & a lot of catching up to do...
[jun. 2nd, 2017|05:40 pm]
prometheusufo




hello. verrrrrrry long time, no see. sorry for not updating in so long. my life just seems very boring to me. the health group in control of my life tried to put in assisted living.. then the hospital. ugh. but i managed to stay out of that chit. they wanted to put me in the hospital over these damn sores that have been coming and going on me for years. ugh.. anyway, i've made some new friends on nebula realms. and one of them accidentally ddosed me off psn. then a day later, my ip was banned from psn. argh. but so is the life of a paranoid pariah. just when i think i've won.. something comes along and hits me right back down again.i'm writing this entry over the course of a day without internet. playstation pretty much told me to get a new ip. then my isp told me the whole thing was automatic and that i had to turn off my modem for 24 hours in order to get a new ip. argh again. all my friends are online though.. so i'm pretty lonely right now. i try to keep my mind off it by watching movies and tv. i recently bought saw: the complete movie collection on blu-ray for only $8.82 on amazon. all seven unrated movies on three discs. wow. so i watched the heck outta those. after them, i plan to watch all the resident evil movies again before watching resident evil: the final chapter. the damn ps4 media player app needs an update though. bad. everything i watch with it goes out of sync. that's why i've been sticking to short half-hour shows for right now. *shrug*so a power rangers movie came and gone while i was.. away. i've watched it three times so far, all cam versions. i'll likely watch it again when its released as web-dl or blu-ray rip in a couple weeks.. then again when it is released on blu-ray at the end of the month. to tell you the truth, the movie could've been a lot better in my opinion. buuuuut it's power rangers, so i must own it no matter what. target will have steelbook packaging and the power rangers: aftershock comic as a store exclusive bonus, while best buy has digipack packaging and some art cards. they're tempting, but i'll likely go with the walmart exclusive bonus disc version.. even though it's exclusively in stores. very annoying, since i can't really do my media buying in stores anymore. :(i actually noticed i was banned from psn while i was on it. i was still online when i wanted to test my ps4's internet speed.. but it said psn signin failed. so of course the first thing i did was reboot, hoping the error message was just that -- an error. but no. and my main account had been blocked from even using psn customer support chat, so i had to use my other us account to get in and talk to them. they revealed to me that they had "detected activity that infringes the playstation™network terms of service and user agreement" (i saved the chat log). so i'm thinking they detected the ddos that my friend accidentally did to me for a short time. he apologized for doing it right afterward, but now with this whole ip banning.. i may not treat him too much like a friend anymore. i dunno. he meant to ddos someone who entered our party chat and left quickly, not me. his ip was actually banned from psn days before the incident, so he was using a vpn to get on psn. :s here's hoping this 24 hours of no internet works.. or i'll have to try the next option -- buy a brand new router. :|oh man, i'm in the home stretch now. only about 6 more hours until i can get back on the internet. it's only been 18 hours.. but i feels soooooooo much longer.. let me talk more about the health group in control of my life. it will help me get my mind off of the lack of internet. they have really given me lots of pills to take. argh. i have to take nine pills in the morning, followed by three more throughout the day. but i must take them.. or they'll probably put me in assisted living. and just when i get used to a case worker, they seem to leave and i get a new one. i had one some months that was really nice. i felt we could have something more.. then she left. she even gave me her real phone number and not her work phone number.. but we didn't stay in touch. after that, i got another one who felt more like a sister to me. but then she left too. now i have two case workers. aiyaiyai. soooo i'm passing the time by watching a lot of tv and movies. i also played some.. *inhale* saban's mighty morphin power rangers: mega battle. phew. long name. it's so difficult for me to pass the levels though. i'm still only on chapter two, if you can believe that. i also finished this season of family guy and the final season of girl meets world (damnit disney channel for canceling it). i used my old 500gb ps3 hard drive as ps4 extended storage for a little while there, until i bought a 4tb external hard drive. now i have more space than i'll ever need for games.. for right now anyway. now the 500gb is being used for said tv and movies. i've downloaded a lot of tv and movies recently to fill that 500gb too. yet i still need to watch the rest of x-files on blu-ray (i'm in the middle of season three.. of ten), almost all of naruto on dvd, as well as the final blu-ray season of dragon ball z (before i can begin dragon ball super.. thirty dollars for 13 episodes on blu-ray soon? damnit funi). and yet i'd rather spend all my time on nebula realms, the next playstation home. with each update, it's getting better and better. and "very soon" it will be back in the playstation store. i've already spent maybe $200 on virtual clothing on nebula. my avatars definitely dress a lot better than me. and unlike playstation home, they've already promised to port it to whatever next playstation console is coming.. as well as pc eventually, so no need to worry about losing all those virtual items that i have and will purchase. i've made a sizable amount of online friends through nebula as well.. i miss them.. damnit psn for ip banning. :(i'm in the home stretch now. only 90 minutes left. i'm almost there. and i'm happy because i made it and will soon be back on psn.. i hope.. i better. i'm really missing psn. i've been on psn since 2008, and probably spent thousands on them. so they better let me back on.. anyway, what to uselessly ramble on about now to waste time..? i've seemingly covered everything i wish to cover already. my life is rather boring.. as you now know. i sorta need a new tv.. since only the hdmi works. i really need a new computer.. because the blue screens have been coming more often. ugh. but i now can't afford any of that. because of all the times i overdrafted and the health group in control of my life came to my rescue and paid off the fees.. with my money. i really hope i don't have to buy a new router. the cheapest one i saw on amazon that wasn't the one i already had was $30.. and was about to go out of stock.  i only have about $90 to my name now and i was told to keep most of that for groceries next thursday. :/ *cough*paypal me!*cough* ...eh, it was worth a shot. :pi plugged the modem back in shortly after 5pm, 24 hours since i had turned it off, and.. it did not work. twenty four hours wasted. -_-see ya.. maybe..

soony desexifying ps4 themes [nsfw]
[may. 29th, 2016|06:44 am]
prometheusufo




hi again. this time i'm mostly here to complain about how sony has been de-sexifying themes and avatars. i recently became addicted to ps4 themes, especially ones from truant pixel. :p but that's not really the point. every once in a while, i also buy sexy ps4 themes.. since i'm a straight male. lol. there's a real lack of them though, and after some searching on the playstation store, i discovered that not only do sexy ps4 themes (from smobile particularly) are released altered, but they expect the consumer to pay more for them. wow. check out my findings below...as you can see, more skin is covered in the ps4 themes than in the ps3 or psp themes.. and sony (or the theme pubisher) expects you to pay more for their censoring handiwork. argh. let's just hope sony either raises this censorship or lets us make and use our own ps4 themes in the future. i also found some psp themes that were too risque even for a ps4 release. check these out below. see ya...

|okay]i had another crazy dream this morning. it would make a great romantic comedy movie.:p two couples are about to get married. guy 1 to girl 1, guy 2 to girl 2. but then guy 1 meets girl 2 and girl 1 meets guy 2.. and sparks fly.. but they don't know they're each getting married. haha. i was a side character in my own dream though, while keira knightley and kristen bell played the girls.. and i think chris pratt played one of the guys. anyway, i woke up before i got to see how it ended.. and because i was a side character doing my own (embarrassingly funny) thing that.. i don't wanna mention. lol. :psee yas.

[tags|dreams]
[current mood
|amused]i had the most wild dream ever this morning. it started by letting a couple stray cats into my apartment a few times. after getting to know one of them a bit.. i learned she was an anamorphic cat? she could change into a human. and she looked exactly like eliza dushku. i later learned she was.. eliza dushku. we soon fell in love and she soon left the other stray cat.. who was also anamorphic? after a few hiccups in our sorta odd love-making, i learn the other anamorphic cat had some kind of spell over her to never leave him. so we end up going to some wedding of some kind to face him. there, we find out he's pregnant or something. wtf? :p anyway, after dealing with one of the other anamorphic cat dudes there, i deflate his fake pregnancy bubble thing.. then defeated him in a rather odd way. with his defeat, eliza is now free from the spell.. and free to be with me again. the end. ;)after a bit of a cliffhanger ending.. after that happy one.. i woke up. :/ ...my subconscious keeps giving me the craziest story ideas through my dreams. i think it wants me to get back into writing. but.. i don't know. i stopped writing mainly because i ran out of ideas. i did an x-files-like series called "the truth-seekers" for the longest time, making sure i stayed to the real truth of the alien mystery for the most part. and before that, i did a series called "power troopers".. stealing heavily from power rangers. lol. in total, there was over 300 short stories... and it all began from a rather simple dream that i wrote down in a notebook. that i then wrote a sequel to.. and another.. and another. etc etc. :paaaannnyway.. see yas.

|depressed]the bastards at adult & child mental health group tricked me into signing over my payeeship all those years ago. just because i was planning on buying $100 in power rangers dvds.. in payments. my damn aunt read this very blog, then told them. then a couple of them came over one day and said they were taking over as my social security payee, then asked me to sign something concerning my medicare or whatever. what if i signed away my payeeship right then and there? now they pay my rent and cable internet for me, then give me a small $60 a week for groceries. and i can barely survive week to week on that. i sometimes end up going hungry for perhaps the last day of the week. i tell adult & child this and they can't really do much for me until their damn weekly checks for me come in...so of course my media viewing has suffered. i now have to pirate movies and tv shows more than ever. i got an e-mail from my cable company a few weeks ago. 20th century fox caught me torrenting their movie the martian. what if i'm caught and reported again.. and again.. i may lose my internet..? adult & child kept losing the checks to pay for my cable internet a few weeks ago, so i lost my internet for one incredibly long and dull weekend. i nearly lost my mind not being able to download my media as well as not being able to contact the closest i have to friends. my only friends are online, so if i lose internet...sooo... paypal has now made it easier than ever to.. give me money. *pouts* i just noticed the option to create a short link and so have created one: paypal.me/prometheusufo. i doubt anyone really cares though.. that the laptop i use to download and upload and share episodes and news.. is really a piece of crap now. sorry, person who donated it to me. i leave it on 24/7 and always am checking for the latest news with it.. but reboot it every couple days or so because it begins running so poorly. sometimes i can't even get to restart it correctly, so i must use the power button. i'd hate to mess up the only way i currently get my media..my media helps keep me sane. but i can rarely even buy it anymore. i had to spend money that was meant to pay my phone for the month just to get the region-free power rangers samurai blu-ray from germany. now the power rangers megaforce blu-ray is on sale on amazon.de and i can't even afford it. it's only about $20 right now. :( i tell adult & child that the various drugs they have me on are helping, but i don't think they really are. i think i'm on the max dosage of the antidepressant already. :s aaanyway, time to shut down this pity party. see ya soon, i hope..[ paypal.me/prometheusufo ][ fbi calls 50% of us who doubt 9-11 potential terrorists ][ chemtrails, directed energy weapons and cell towers ][ weaponized cell towers being built everywhere ][ obama to expand surveillance state powers ][ obama pushing nsa surveillance tool to other agencies ][ military study predicts when you’ll protest on twitter ][ elites fund anti-globalization movement ][ doctors who found cancer enzymes in vaccines all murdered ][ cdc media campaign of fear, anxiety to push flu vaccine ][ nuclear waste dumped striaght in kentucky landfill ][ 'pentagon needs russia as next big enemy' - usaf officer ][ mckinney - what is us doing in south china sea? ][ mep explains why whole banking system is scam ][ scalia last hours with members of secret society ][ scalia murdered after obama meeting ][ snowden - it's a choice between trump & goldman sachs ][ snowden sums up the campaign in just one tweet ][ 'trump must be stopped' plead 'the economist' & cfr ][ gop plan to elect hillary to stop self-controlled trump ][ obama ordering black leaders to endorse hillary ][ video: ghw bush makes throat cut gesture at trump in debate ][ rubio caught taking unknown substance during debate ][ second us cyberspace weapon now fully operational ][ us navy whistleblower 'saw proof of ufos & et on earth' ]

|blah]so.. my birthday was at the start of this month. i'm now 33. i feel so old. :| life continues onward i guess. not much has been happening really... oh, i bought the power rangers samurai blu-ray from germany.. but it takes about 3 weeks to get here. argh. i bought it because the german power rangers blu-rays were recently revealed to be region-free. they have the original english audio tracks, so no worries there. the samurai, megaforce and super megaforce sets even include the specials. yay. i go out once a week to buy groceries, even though i sometimes run out early.. and go hungry for a day or so. :s and that's because the damn mental health group still controls my money. they give me a minuscule $60 a week to go crazy with now, plus $16 in "food stamps" per month. wow. i had to put some stuff back last week when i went to the grocery store. but oh well...i finally installed plex on my laptop now that it's free, so i can now stream those huge movie files instead of worrying about transferring them over via usb drive to my ps4. my tiny 250gb hard drive is still always full though. damnit. :(okay, i mainly did this entry so i could throw out another round of links below. my twitter followers don't seem to like them, so i don't usually bother them with them. see ya... :p[ trump - 'if elected, you'll find out who really did 9/11' ][ trump calls out the chimp on iraq genocide & wtc ][ trump - $2 trillion destroying iraq, worst decision ever ][ even globalist nwo pope fears trump, attacks him ][ obama says trump won't be president... ][ video: sellout sanders destroyed the audit the fed bill ][ how hillary stole nv - vote fraud caught on cam  ][ drudge slams mainstream media coverup of hillary's fading health ][ mysterious nazi submarine from wwii discovered in great lakes ][ rule of law won't stop us lust to run world ][ america... the greatest threat to world peace ][ obama raises 'safe' radiation in drinking water 27,000x higher ][ coverup of west coast radiation from fukushima ][ huge radiation readings in ca and nm disappear ][ obama ignores fire nearing st louis nuke dump ][ nuke expert - 'fukushima plutonium is everywhere, it's everywhere' ][ man wounded with rfk says 2nd gunman killed kennedy ][ jfk, rfk murdered by military-security complex ][ flooding europe with savages ‘strategically engineered' ][ nj towns teaches illegals how to escape arrest ][ govt wants cash to become illegal ][ einstein inked manifesto for extermination of white race ][ musicians are terrified to speak out against israel ][ ‘israel the aggressor while playing victim' ][ br nathanael - scalia dies... jew control arises ][ key questions emerge in death of justice scalia ][ video: scalia murdered for obama gun control agenda ][ scalia dead 'with a pillow over his head' - yet no autopsy ][ us government to track 'suspicious' internet memes ][ lg smart tv caught collecting data from usb drives! ][ companies secretly track employees health & lives  ][ apple unlocked iphones for the feds 70 times! ][ apple - suspect iphone password changed in govt custody ][ virtual reality can reduce depression ][ downing a drone to protect privacy now 'criminal mischief' ][ video: davos plan to decode your brain, read your mind ][ cartoon explains microwave mind control ][ mds find cancer enzymes in vaccines... all murdered ][ all parents must watch - vaccines do mitochondrial damage ][ cdc marketing plan to create big flu vaccine demand ][ parmesan cheese has sketchy ingredients ][ the satanic branding of energy drinks ][ good guy with gun prevents tragedy - gets fired ][ beachgoers kill rare baby dolphin while taking selfies ][ wildlife suffers from wireless devices emf radiation ][ a crystal could store data for 13.8 billion years ][ things don’t really exist, they flicker ][ video: oh, my - hidden by nasa - stunning structures on mars ][ video: nasa coverups on mars continue - clear structures ][ video: 1,000s of obvious buildings on mars - what do you think? ][ video: explosive mushroom cloud on mars by indian orbiter ][ nasa rover photo of ancient mars burial site? ][ reaching mars in a few days? yes! says nasa ][ rise, fall of argentina real life x-files unit ][ ‘we started from ets who built the pyramids’ - cricket star ][ no 'contact with et yet' - obama to 6 year old ][ what  should we do when we find aliens? ][ mt. rainier ufo shot down in 2001 - military threatened 200 ][ ufo emits smaller object to ground level  ][ space... cold, vast, deadly - won't stop humans ][ earth is two planets fused together ][ hubble finds largest black hole ever ][ did the maya create the first 'comics’? ]

[current mood
|blah]welp, a few of you have been wondering what's been up with me.. so here's a little update:the mental health group in charge of my life continues to be somewhat invasive.. but oh well. they have three or four people controlling everything i do now. i was excited to sell some of my dvds (mostly the old dragon ball z dvd volumes i had no use for anymore) as soon as one of them said i would be in charge of the money i got from them. but then they got a bit angry when i spent all the money in record time today.. rather than save it for items they think i need. she stated that i could only buy a new ps4 chatpad as a "reward" for how well i had been doing. *rolls eyes* they also did a test today.. and they're going to force me to start testing my blood just because i'm getting close to getting diabetes. -_- my search for a good, well-made ps4 chatpad continues. i bought one for $12 (including shipping).. and of course it broke within months. then an online friend of mine was awesome enough to buy me one as an early christmas present. on ebay. it was new and sealed.. but it only lasted days. and it broke in the exact same spot the cheaper one did: the micro usb port. it did seem better manufactured though (otherwise), which was why i ordered the exact same one from amazon today. i also e-mailed the company (collective minds) and they offered to replace the broken one.. with a proof of purchase.. that i don't have. the ps4 chatboost not only features a blue (yes, bloo!) backlit keyboard, but also claims to make the ps4 controller battery last longer. wow. in the end, i just wish sony would make one already. microsoft has already made one for their xbox one. ugh. :|now back to the all-controlling group. they went into the negative on my payee bank account, then they expect me to pay for something they screwed up. no thanks. yet the guy who did the actual screwing up claims he got promoted and no longer works with me. haha. i miss him. he was fun.the four kings casino and slots is now up and running on the playstation 4 (for free), as a pretty fun playstation home replacement.. at least until nebula realms comes out. i'm sure the group doesn't like that this new game is emptying my wallet though. but i'm able to actually make friends.. and meet up with old ones as well. since i'm not comfortable with real life human interaction so much, it's pretty much the only way. :/see ya everyone. if i don't see ya before then, happy holidays. my new years' resolution? to blog more often. let's see if i can actually do that. :p

another horrible dream
[jul. 31st, 2015|08:23 am]
prometheusufo




i had another dream this morning. it started out by blaming by dad for not bringing back my cat who had run away (he ran away in real life a while ago now, i last saw him about a week ago though). our cat wouldn't run from him like he did me (like he does in real life). so my dad soon tricked the cat into our car and we drove home, leaving him and another cat in the car.. for only 15 minutes or so. next thing we knew, a fire had started outside in the parking lot. we also noticed there was now a young, pudgy boy trapped in the car as well. a firetruck arrived in what seemed like record time and soon put the fire out.my dad didn't seem to want to tell the police about how the kid could've gotten in the car, but i told the cop the truth. we really didn't know how he got in there. i pleaded with the cop not to let my cats go.. because the kid and the cats were stil in the car at this point. i don't know why. the policeman also explained that it was probably a neighborhood kid who started the fire. pretty much in front of our apartment. my dad didn't doubt that.not long after that, another fire was started in the parking lot.. this time even closer to the car with the cats and the boy inside. this time a fire truck didn't come. after some hesitation, my dad sprang into action with a fire extinguisher. soon, the fire was again out. but this time.. the cats and boy soon escaped from the car. a policeman explained to us that the cats escaped. i saw them from the window though and ran outside to their side. the cats appeared singed a bit, but they seemed okay.their fur now appeared gray and black. i picked up my cat and he began to attack me. and i let him.. because i thought i deserved it.ack. it was then that i woke up.. see ya.

[current mood
|sad]it started out like a normal dream. it was the last day of high school, the last few moments in fact. i was with a few of my friends who i'll probably never see again, in class. one of my friends happened to be played by allison mack, chloe sullivan from smallville. heh. oddly enough, i never thought of her as particularly attractive. not my type, i guess. until this dream came along anyway. we all mentioned our plans for after high school.. but i had none. :/ the final bell rang and allison fussed about being the only one not ready to run out that door for the last time. heh.allison then met up with me in the hallway briefly on the way to the school buses. she handed me a note then took off. i immediately stopped to read the note. and i was surprised to find it was a confession of love. she had liked me for quite a while too. she even referenced some moments she had with clark kent / tom welling during smallville in the note, confirming the confession was coming from the actress. i was overjoyed by the confession of love. to be truthful, it was probably not about who it was.. but more that i possibly wouldn't be alone for the rest of my life.i ran out to the school buses, hoping to see allison one last time. i found her and ran up to her. i confessed that i liked her too and we hugged, then we began to trade phone numbers (we're friends, why don't we have each other's numbers already? lol). but it was then i noticed that i had lost the love letter she had just given me. she stopped giving me her number. said something then she took off.. never to be seen again. that was when the dream took a turn for the worse. everything is kinda fuzzy and all runs together from there. the high school bully (i guess) found my letter and was making fun of it to his friends. i went after him to get the letter back. not long after that i woke up... but not in my home. i saw a man shaking his head near my bedroom window and went outside to see what was the matter. i ended up being shot by the man, who ended up being the father of the bully. i ran back into the house, despite being shot multiple times, and struggled to dial 911. this was when the father's truck came right through the bedroom wall at me. ack.jump forward some years.. and i'm looking for allison on a movie set.. or something. i.. ended up being attacked again, this time by random people. i remember a moment or two where i confess to these people that i'm actually somewhat resistant to these attacks, explaining why i was able to survive multiple gunshots earlier.. there was then a long struggle to wake up from this damn dream.. until i finally did. argh. :/this dream was likely just one long message from my subconscious that my life is going nowhere. that the happy ending i sometimes wish for.. will in fact never come.. *sigh* :(see ya.

|chipper]the day for started at about 10am. i was asleep, of course, when my case worker buzzed to be let in. we were about to do the usual grocery shopping when he suddenly remembered that i had a doctor's appointment today. heh. so i deposited my "weekly allowance" into the bank and headed off to the doctor. while waiting, i heard of the kids there singing not the power rangers dino charge theme.. but the power rangers dino thunder theme. heh. that made me smile.. for some reason. :p after the doctor's appointment, i thought i was finally going to go grocery shopping. but no. the case worker instead dragged me along with someone else to mcdonald's. man, it's been easily over a year since i've had fast food. it was pretty nice, even if i had to pay for my own. and it was welcome food.. since i had been out out food for the last day or so and having to resort to eating peanut butter out of the jar and raisin bran with no milk. ugh. :|after dropping the other older man off, we finally went grocery shopping at my local kroger as usual. but then on the way back, my case worker mentioned going to a pantry for some free food.. since i've obviously kept complaining about running out of food every week. he wouldn't take no for an answer. lol.so after dropping my groceries off, he picked up another guy. he was pretty funny. we both went and picked up our free food, then he dropped us both off at our homes. oh, and did i mention the gas tank was in danger of going empty just about the whole time? yikes. :pnow i easily have enough food for the week at least, but only have about a dollar in the bank again. ugh. luckily, if anyone is feeling extra generous, they can now donate with the paypal button on my livejournal profile.. i think. i got my paypal account reinstated today.. after like four years or so. :/sorry for not posting here that much lately. i'll try to get back to it. see yas..

lol crazy weird dream
[may. 29th, 2015|03:03 pm]
prometheusufo




i just had one weird dream. so i had this binder of porn at school or something.. and i accidentally left it behind. some muppets (yes, muppets) got into it and were all shocked and appalled and shit. lol. i came back for it.. and that's when the madness began. the mighty morphin power rangers (yes, power rangers) kept coming after me again and again to destroy the binder. and when unmorphed, i couldn't even have the original actors for jason, zack and trini. they were random standins i didn't recognize. lol. and tommy, he transformed into green ranger at first.. then he lost his powers and transformed into.. the magna defender.. and then masked rider. lol. so i kept flying (yes, flying) about, running from the rangers. beating them off me the best i could. they randomly transformed into sentai heroes as well. so random.i eventually figured out it was a dream.. but i couldn't end it no matter what i did. every once in a while, i would drop the binder and would have to retrieve it. once, it dropped near principal kaplan and as i came to get it back, he shouted at me "deee-tention, forever!". lol. after much struggling, i finally slowly woke up. phew. :pso crazy. maybe it all has to do with the power rangers movie concept art and my recent run-in with a lionsgate lawyer (details here). an online friend even jokingly said the power rangers were going to come after me. lol. anyway, see ya.. :p

oh, hey. i posted my thoughts on the fall 2015 upfronts elsewhere.. on my new ello. ello is like facebook, but without the ads or selling of user data.. yet no one appears to want to use it but me. i have 0 friends there. so.. i'm just gonna post all the crap i did post there this week.. here. enjoy. :p---fox fall upfront press release | fox new series trailersgotham is back and is being teamed up on monday with minority report, the tv series sequel to the tom cruise film. let's hope the latter can  make it. fox doesn't exactly have a good track record with sci-fi shows.  looking forward to scream queens on tuesday, a comedy-horror series from the executive producers of glee and american horror story. click here for a teaser. also, lucifer comes up from hell.. and wants to solve crimes..? oookay. it's based on a dc comic, so i'll give it a shot. :pbut the most exciting of the fall series for me would have to be the return of the x-files for a six-episode revival, beginning with a two-night event starting sunday, january 24th at 10pm et. :dnbc fall upfront press release | nbc new series trailersnot much excitement here for me. only one hour of comedies? aw. i love undateable, so i'm glad it'll return in the fall. but for an all-live third season? that'll be interesting to see. heroes reborn lands on thursday at 8pm et. looking forward to that one. also looking forward to checking out blindspot. check out that trailer! :o the sitcom coach is sequelified in mid-season. dunno how i feel about that one. :pabc fall upfront press release | abc new series trailersout of all the shows, i'm of course most excited for more marvel cinematic universe in the form of agents of s.h.i.e.l.d. & agent carter. woohoo! but among the new shows.. the muppets  looks most promising. unfortunately, most of the youtube video trailers were set to private by abc i guess shortly after they were released to the press.. for some unknown reason. luckily, click here to check out the trailer for the muppets. lol. looking pretty funny. :pcbs fall upfront press release | cbs new series trailerssurprising absolutely no one, supergirl will open in november to some heavy competition: gotham. yes, cbs has opted to do... just that. and after viewing the supergirl trailer...  i'm going to have to see more before making a decision on whether it  sucks or not. and i'm currently leaning a bit toward the former,  unfortunately. ugh. :(among cbs's other new series are two movie adaptations: limitless coming this fall and rush hour coming mid-season. hoo boy. lol. at least the star of the limitless film, bradley cooper, will be making recurring appearances in its series. the rush hour duo has of course been recast. :(the cw fall upfront press release | the cw new series trailersizombie is back in the fall, yay. congrats power rangers rpm's rose mciver... i should watch it already. :p also back for a third season is power rangers rpm's adelaide kane's reign. cool. should check that out too. :p the most anticipated of the cw's new series though would have to be dc's legends of tomorrow, which unfortunately isn't even starting until mid-season. bew. but at least there's a trailer. and it's very good. :)

pshomeless - rip playstation home 2008-2015
[apr. 1st, 2015|07:52 pm]
prometheusufo




today is my first day without playstation home, the social gaming platform that helped me actually make friends. see, i have a disability that makes me "shy" to others in real life, so i end up talking very little to anyone. home helped me talk to people a bit more and make friends. i believe i used it for nearly a third of my life actually, from when i first immersed myself in the closed beta on october 14th 2008 to its very last minutes last night (it shut down on the early morning of april 1st at 3am et). i was there for it all, from the ndreams' xi game to granzella's kikai machine empire game, and many many more. i'll keep its memories close to my heart.. in the form of the over 10,000 pictures that i took from october 2009 onward, as well as the original music heard on home.. many tracks of which i conveniently uploaded to mediafire for other homesters to enjoy. :)i do feel that sony closed playstation home a bit prematurely. the ps3 still has a year or two left in it, in my opinion. but i guess now, instead of focusing on the past, is the time to move on to bigger and better things on the ps4. i do hope that the upcoming social gaming platforms atom universe and/or project nebula succeeds on ps4, so that i can actually get to see my friends again. until then, it'll just be a back-and-forth passage of words in the xmb.. or whatever the ps4 user interface is called. *sigh* i'm beginning to get a bit emotional now, so i better end this here before it gets any worse. see ya around.. i hope. :)

i always seem to write and post a blog just as it gets pretty bad. then soon after, things get better. for instance, right after the last two entries where i was near foodless my "go to" guy arrived and finally took me to the grocery store. both times. phew. and the last time, he gave me two grocery checks (of my money) to deposit in my bank. i took this as a test of my money saving, so i didn't go crazy and spent it. i wanna save up for a ps4 anyway. so here's hoping he doesn't ask me to spend it on food next week and comes with another check instead. teehee. :pin other news, my time with mega as my power rangers file sharing partner may be drawing to a close. :( they sent me thirteen infringement emails in one day, blocking my users direct access to the us-unaired episodes of power rangers super megaforce. ugh. but thanks to a friend, i've discovered a new file sharing site called hive. the file sharing space you get is unlimited. they only limit you to 50gb of uploading a week. plus the more friends you have on hive, the cheaper the premium features are. if you get over 100 friends, those premium features are free. in under 24 hours, i already have 12 friends. :p ..i already uploaded hariken's us-unaired super megaforce encodes as well as yesterday's episode encodes from dekabroken. i'm also currently uploading the rest of super megaforce so far in hd mkv from deka. so feel free to join at this link. :)welp, see yas. :p

the group in control / soon to be homeless / feeling blah

[current mood
|blah]still here, still alive.. for now. the group that controls my life. ugh. they're starting to get on my nerves. my "go to guy" said last wednesday that we would go to the grocery store again on friday. that never happened, of course. i admit.. i ate the food a little more fast than usual before he never arrived on friday.. because i thought we were going again on friday. now i have only peanut butter, jelly and a small amount of bread to last me until whenever the next grocery check becomes available. argh. i don't even like pb&j.. -_-i've been spending a lot of time in playstation home lately.. because time to spend there is now running out. home is closing.. and i hope i'll be able to keep in touch with all the friends i've made there. *sigh* neotopia was a glimmer of hope.. but is now fading fast. it's not getting nearly enough money pledged on kickstarter for it to become a reality. however, i've decided to not buy any more ps3 games and to try and save up for a ps4 even though neotopia looks like it isn't going to happen..i guess the antidepressant has helped. i no longer feel depressed as often as i used to. now i just feel like.. *shrug* whatever. i guess that's better. :/see ya soon, i hope...

never mind what i said about this new team in control of my life being nice. sure, the new guy bought me some food to last the weekend on friday because a check for my grocery spending hadn't come in. he said he would be here with the check on monday. i expected him not to come when i figured out monday was a holiday. he didn't. but then he didn't come on tuesday either. it's now midday wednesday. i'm broke and near foodless. my phone was deactivated this morning so i can no longer text them to let them know of my predicament. hooray.see ya soon... i hope.

soon to be homeless.. unless.. / mega drama / shuffling me

pleeeease back neotopia on kickstarter! i've backed it for £5 so far.. since i literally only have about $10 to my name as i type this. :( i'm hoping to raise it a bit later in the month at least. the money isn't taken until the end of the campaign, and that's only if it succeeds. :( i neeeed neotopia since my only friends that i've made are on playstation home.. and that's now closing in april 2015. :( ..after this month, i guess i'll have to try and start saving money for a ps4.. *sigh*anyway, besides all that drama.. i guess life has been okay. i guess. someone got my mega link with all my power rangers episode downloads reported and deactivated due to copyright infringement. ugh. luckily, only the link was deactivated and no files were lost.. so far. so i just put everything in a new folder with a new link. and due to mega being loose with its "free 50gb", i now have all of kamen rider dragon knight, power rangers rpm, megaforce & super megaforce in one place. it's currently taking up 132% of my "free 50gb". lol. :p i may consider uploading a zip or rar file of all dragon knight & rpm bonus features currently included in my torrents of said series as well. :dthe group that oversees my life have set me up with yet another person to deal with me on a weekly basis. wow. make up your damn minds. lol. the new guy is nice though. i like him.. slightly more than the previous one. too bad i can't talk to him due to my "shyness". anyways.. see ya. :/

okay, okay. instead of deleting episodes from my mega account, they'll simply be moved to an archive account instead. yay. click here to check out mega archive 1, containing kamen rider dragon knight, power rangers rpm and power rangers megaforce. :) and for now, all of power rangers megaforce and super megaforce so far can still be found over here on the main mega account. :p in other news, it seems the power rangers super megaforce temporary encodes from the uk will begin on september 23rd. starting where nickelodeon has left off with ""united as one". :)finally got in captain america: the winter soldier on 3d blu today. but i wanted to watch it within agents of shield: season 1. and so the wait continues.. :(well, that was a short update...................... see ya. :p
