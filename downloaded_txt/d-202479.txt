 today, our legacy continues as evansville's premiere rv dealership. whether you're from owensboro, petersburg, or anywhere in between, we are here to ensure your rv experience is the best it can be. our customers come from illinois, indiana, and kentucky just to experience what american rv is all about. our large selection of travel trailers, fifth wheels, toy haulers, and motorhomes from top manufacturers such as: keystone springdale, cougar, and montana; forest river cherokee, grey wolf, and wolf pup; coachmen catalina, freedom express, apex, and northern spirit; and our newest addition, alliance paradigm, delta, and avenue; are all unlocked and open for you to dream about and browse. our no-pressure staff are here to help you find the perfect rv for your budget, need, and wants.
 we look forward to welcoming you to the family!
