marlowe is the greatest discoverer, the most daring
pioneer, in all
our poetic literature. before him there was no
genuine english blank verse or tragedy. after his arrival, the way was
prepared—the path made straight for shakespeare.

the case of the murdered bard
to all you shakespeare fans i dare to say
the stratford actor never scribed a play.
another man deserves our praise today--
a man who paid the price prescribed to pay
for undermining christendom's old sway--
a poet who allegedly got killed
in friendly-deadly fray when he was billed--
his high-aspiring voice uniquely stilled.
yet still he willed his destiny fulfilled.

make no mistake, stratfordians, take note:
kit marley (known as 'marlowe') surely wrote
(four centuries ago) the words we quote
from the original "first folio"
of 36 collected shakespeare plays
and sonnets written in his younger days,
plus other famous verses you may know:
whoever loved, that loved not at first sight.
are you familiar with this saw of might? 
it's one of many christopher had penned
in plays and poems before his sudden end
at the hand of a man employed by his best friend.

so lend your ear! the evidence makes clear:
kit marley used the pseudonym shakespeare--
which worked out well for 'stratford will' shakspere,
whose name got him a theatre job and share
of ticket sales at the globe theater door
although not knowing whom he stood-in for:
the greatest playwright of his time for sure.

with the recent
closing of the marlowe-shakespeare
connection blog, the marlowe lives! association is reviving its marlovian blog under a
trendy new name and look: wtf shakespeare
about marlowe, the man and the myth.
the ml!a is also pleased
and nonplussed to announce the phoenix-like reappearance of john baker's one-and-only school of thought
emporium in all its rough-hewn unhinged glory. we're hoping to find
a dozen or so articles for  a chapbook titled  baker's dozen: 13 essays on the
marlowe-shake-speare connection.
