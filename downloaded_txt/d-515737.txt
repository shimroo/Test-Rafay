the alcuin experience

changing the world starts at school. here’s how we do it.





the world is our classroom
from planting more than 1,000 trees in iceland to sharing home-cooked meals with villagers in rural peru, riding the funicular to mountaintops outside of quebec, and speaking at the podium of the u.n. general assembly, alcuin students know no boundaries. beginning with overnight campouts in 3rd grade, travel is an integral part of the alcuin experience. 




where makers make it happen
in the hive, students bring ideas to reality. whether working on a scale model for a 4th level presentation, preparing for a robotics competition, or building a solar powered charging station for a diploma programme class, alcuin students ignite their imagination in a state-of-the-art maker space where engineering meets entrepreneurship. 




express yourself
at alcuin school we know that participation in fine arts is essential to educating the whole child. from finger painting in a toddler montessori garden to composing original works in a diploma programme music lab, students at all stages are invited to pursue their individual talents and passions through theater, film, music, visual and performing arts—all supported by professionally trained and experienced faculty. 




a place for everyone
what’s your jam? debating geo-politics in montessori model u.n.? tutoring children in need at nearby schools? taking your team to all the way to a state championship title? testing your talents at a robotics competition? entering your original film in an international arts festival? with wide range of clubs, sports, and activities, alcuin offers limitless ways for students to follow their passions and explore worlds beyond the classroom.
