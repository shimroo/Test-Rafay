our
              thanks to everyone who traveled with us last year,  
              the 24th year for font tours.
              and now, in 2015, font is into its 25th year.



              some
              feature photos:





in
              the wonderful photograph above, 
              it may look like a leaf, but it is a butterfly,
              aptly called the red-striped leafwing.
              the photo was taken in the dominican republic.
              notice to two white legs of the butterfly,
              as it clings to a real leaf.

              the blakiston's fish owl
              as we saw it during our japan tour in november 2013.
              the species is said to be the rarest and the largest owl in the
              world.
              during our november '13 tour, we saw 3 of them.
              the blakiston's fish owl has been found during 24 font tours in
              japan, 
              during all of our tours on the northern island of hokkaido.

above:
              in iceland, it is called hrafnafifa.
              elsewhere in its range it is known as alaska cotton.
              another name yet for it is scheuchzer's cottongrass.
              the scientific name for the plant:
              eriophorum scheuchzeri.
              it is one of a number of interesting "northern plants"
              that have been seen during font tours.

              the longest-lived non-colonial animal ever known.

              many of the photographs of the more than 2,400 things in nature 
              in this website
              were taken during font tours 
 at various places in the world.
              but not all. some photos have been kindly provided to us
              so as to make our lists & photo galleries more complete.

              a purpose of this website, of course, is to present 
              information about font tours.
              but another purpose has evolved, to have a showcase
              of interesting photographs by which people
              not only on tours, but home at their computers,
              can see the beauty and intricacy of nature.
              often people contact us about photos, either for an id,
              or simply to say they enjoy and appreciate those we have.
              school teachers contact us often.
              our sincere appreciation to all
              who have shared their photos with us.
