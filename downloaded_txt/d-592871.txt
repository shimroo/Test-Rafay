welcome to lrs performance inc. 



from street to strip we build performance!
lrs performance is a performance shop capable of providing great customer service, knowledge and a straightforward, honest answer.  our goal is to provide customers with our experience gained through many years of racing and high performance modifications on and off the track.  lrs performance applies that knowledge to customers’ cars for a “do it right the first time” approach. we are not a parts warehouse business trying to sell any product produced in today’s market. we are a performance oriented company who installs what we sell and we only sell what works.
with over 40 years of aftermarket experience, we provide excellent technical support and service! we do the research to determine the perfect combinations that will work best for your particular application.
we specialize in fuel injection, superchargers and nitrous oxide equipped street cars and race cars. we offer great service and track tested products that we feel are the best in the industry. we would like to thank you for checking us out and encourage you to call us with your high performance needs.
