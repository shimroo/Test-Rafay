i get emails.... boy, do i get emails! 
today i'm going to share with you a response i wrote to a well-intentioned guy who was clearly very passionate about getting some artists he'd found into the mainstream. he was fairly polite, and even though he had no idea how to write or talk to a music industry professional... i felt kinda sorry for him.

streaming royalties suck now, but just wait
 spotify et al are still relatively new companies and services. whenever any new digital music company launches; musicians, labels etc. think they are some kind of instant savior that will make all artists and labels finally rich and famous. but how can that be?

the importance of a youtube channel for your music business

booming in popularity - 3 billion hours of video are watched every month
 so if youre not sharing videos, youre missing out. article by djembe drum shop.

attorney-client relationships work and not work. i want to discuss here, completely candidly, what i believe what you
should know about hiring an attorney and working successfully with that
attorney. article by bart day.

money for your music: facts about music licensing
where music meets
licensing, there's money to be made. how much money? we have all read
about the multi-million-dollar deals for icon bands like the rolling
stones and led zeppelin, but what about the money for the rest of us?  article by the g-man.

"i've been promoting my music on the internet since 1995. i'm
									now doing music full time. i didn't need a record label to accomplish that. i did it on my own, by the grace of
									god, and in fact, i really don't care if my music ever is 'discovered' by a major record label. what i do care
									about is the fans who listen to my music every day, how it touches their lives, and how it brings them joy. i get
									such encouragement from my fans, email from people i've never met from all around the world. and now i'm able to
									work from home, write my music, and spend more time with my wife and beautiful little boy.
									that is my definition of success." - david nevue, author of how to promote your music successfully on the internet.
