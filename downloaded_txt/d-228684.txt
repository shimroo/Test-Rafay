loch
                  ness facts - loch ness is the largest body of fresh water in britain. 
(1)â there is more water
                in loch ness than all the other lakes in england, scotland and wales put together.(2)â it is around twenty
                two and a half miles long and between one and one and a half miles wide, a depth of 754 feet with the
                bottom of the loch being as flat as a bowling green.(3)â it holds 263 thousand million cubic feet of water which is
                around 16 million 430 thousand million gallons of water with a surface area of 14000 acres and could
                hold the population of the world 10 times over.(4)â it is fed by 7 major rivers the oich, tarff, enrich,
                coiltie, moriston, foyers and farigaig plus numerous burns, with only one outlet the river ness which
                flows 7 miles through inverness into the moray firth 52 feet below the loch surface.(5)â during a heavy
                rainfall the lochs level has been known to rise by as much as 7 feet and a rise of 2 feet is common
                place.(6)â the rain
                catchment area for loch ness is so large that a rainfall of just quarter of an inch adds 11.000.000 tons
                of water to the loch.(7)â it is said that the loch never freezes and this is
                true.(8)â because of the great
                amount of water in the loch a thermocline lies at around 100 feet down in the loch. the top 100 feet of
                water alters temperature depending on the weather conditions but below the thermocline the temperature
                never alters from 44 degrees fahrenheit. so as the surface water cools in winter and nears freezing
                point it sinks and is replaced by the warmer water from below. this can cause the loch to steam on very
                cold days, in fact it as been estimated that the heat given off by the loch in a winter is the
                equivalent to burning 2 million tons of coal.
