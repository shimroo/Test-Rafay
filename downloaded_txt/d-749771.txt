welcome to circle b farm quarter horses. located in seagrove, north carolinawe have been an aqha registered quarter horse breeder for 30 years.  our goal is to produce good quality quarter horses that are a pleasure to own, ride, and show.  our quarter horses make good young prospects for roping, ranch work, and cutting, or for good solid trail horses.  most of our mares and stallions come from the krogman ranch in white river, south dakota.we are currently standing three aqha ranch bred stallions.  our qh stallions have sound minds, great dispositions, and correct conformation and bone structure.  they pass these traits to their babies.we welcome visitors but do request you call for an appointment.
