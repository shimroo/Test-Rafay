testimonials









a mansion is hidden in this condo location. the grand master living quarters are a condo on its own and it has a second master with great space! the theater room was perfect for the kids gaming setup and movie nights. the living room and kitchen area has enough room to spread out and talk to everyone while cooking. the swimming area is on the smaller side but the amazing staff and security make sure everyone who’s there is supposed to be there, it’s never packed. overall i was blown away by this listing and will be booking again!

having rented a two and three bedroom unit in years past, it was great having a 5 bedroom all inclusive unit.

daniel r.  - jun 28, 2023





amazing property with best views of the bay. very spacious and clean. able to accommodate 4 families with ease. the movie room and arcade entertained the little ones after dark. phoenix on the bay’s lazy river and pools were very clean and staff is respectful.
