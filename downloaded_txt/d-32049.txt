spi supplies is a proud distributor of nunano afm probes. nunano specializes in the design and manufacture of probes for atomic force microscopy and cantilever-based sensor devices. offering high quality silicon afm probes manufactured to the tightest dimensional tolerances available in the market, offering minimal variation in spring constant and resonant frequency.

spi supplies is proud to offer kammrath and weiss modules to our north american customers. module selections include the tensile module (compression as option) for the sem. this module can test up to 10kn and offers a number of options for your specific sample needs.
we also offer the transfer module for the purpose of carrying delicate and sensitive specimens in a capsule from the sem into a glove box or vice versa, while protecting specimens from air or moisture at all times.
these device will mount on the specimen stage just like a microscope sample. it takes just a few moments to install it in the sem.
