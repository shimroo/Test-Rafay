dan and his crew  are awesome technicians
i had a lead frame issue on my 06 chrysler 300c and i went all over the city looking for a proper diagnosis for months and my car just sat there. i wanted a quote from a company that wasn’t just trying to gauge me on price. i was even told it would be cheaper for me to go buy a brand new second hand transmission and to rebuild it and swap it out than it was to replace the lead frame.
so i actually did go buy another transmission like an idiot.
so yesterday i called dan at national and he diagnosed my problem and he gave me a price quote at half the price of what other shops quoted me  he fixed it in one day and now my car is running smoother than ever. thanks to dan and the boys at national trans i actually feel ok putting money into the rest of the car now.
they have decades of experience and i fealt  confident my car was in good hands when i handed him the keys.

i had my transmission rebuilt here 4 years ago. recently, it lost 3rd gear. i brought it in to see what was up. it was a freak, hard part failure (input drum). nobodys fault. luck of the draw situation.
shitty deal, but these guys came through big time! they pulled the transmission and essentially re-rebuilt it, including a new input drum, and only charged me for the parts & fluids!! outstanding!!
bear in mind, this job requires 12-13 hours of labour, which they did not charge me for!! and they showed me exactly what happened, and gave me the failed parts, so i could show my son (we are "car guys")
brock, case and the restvof the staff, you guys are more than fair, and much appreciated! and the transmission is working beautifully again!
thank you!
