welcome to evax










conventional voice evacuation systems
small applications such as churches, schools, and theaters sometimes require more than just a basic fire alarm to effectively and safely evacuate occupants.





mass notification
the ability to quickly broadcast pre-recorded and live warnings to all personnel is considered essential in reducing casualties in the event of a large campus facility emergency.





high rise multiplex
a variety of complications can occur when trying to evacuate occupants from a high rise building during an emergency situation.
