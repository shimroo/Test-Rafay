looking 
                  after travellers health 






---








an 
                  interactive travel site
that can design customised lists of travel 
                  medicine requirements for individuals or groups of any size.






as 
                  more and more people travel to distant parts of the world, there 
                  is an increased chance of them coming into contact and even 
                  contracting diseases rarely seen in other more developed countries.

                  these travellers should therefore be prepared for such risks, 
                  and seek appropriate advice about their health before they venture 
                  abroad.

the 
                  travel doctor is here to help and advise these travellers 
                  look after their health before, during and after such a trip. 
                  







who are we?



we were originally formed as a partnership 
                    between a full time doctor and a pharmacist based in south 
                    wales in the uk.

we both have 
                    extensive experience of foreign travel to exotic locations 
                    where we have taken part in various expeditions and adventure 
                    holidays.

                    for more information go to the
about us page.







 


one 
            of the most worrisome problems facing international travellers nowadays 
            is how to deal with illness or other health emergencies in a foreign 
            country.

            the traveller not only has to cope with foreign languages and customs 
            but with different food, water, climate, altitude and other environmental 
            hazards.

            there is a good chance, too, that the traveller's own immunity does 
            not match the local foreign environment.

            furthermore, increasing numbers of vulnerable travellers, including 
            older people, pregnant women, young children and those with complex 
            medical problems, are going to more adventurous or remote destinations. 
            

the travel doctor is an interactive 
            web site that is able to produce personalised lists of travel medicines 
            for expeditions, global adventure travellers and ordinary holiday 
            makers.

we also 
            give advice on immunisations, malaria tablets, general medications 
            and other forms of health information for all types of traveller.

            if you need any advice on travel medicine or other health issues during 
            your trip, you can log on to this site and use it to retrieve any 
            relevant information you may require.

 you can 
            either browse this site using the navigation bars like the one in 
            the left hand column or you can use the search facility below to locate 
            the information you require:
