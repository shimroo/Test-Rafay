	 october garden
    


i have 3 beds of happy swiss chard growing during this cool season.  all from one packet of seeds.  they are so beautiful.  i love the red and yellow stems.  and they taste delicious too.on mondays, i saute a large bunch of chard in coconut oil, with lots of fresh chopped garlic and grey sea salt.  it's enough to last me through the week.  each morning for breakfast, i poach 2 eggs for about 2 minutes, and serve it on a portion of the reheated chard, with a tablespoon of butter melted in. i only had room for 8 cauliflower plants in this bed, 4 white and 4 purple.  i started them from seed in august.  i must have about 40 seedlings that i am trying to give away.  they need lots of room, 15" spacing.  i am going to border the bed with bronze arrow lettuce as soon as they are ready to transplant.this bed has a variety of lettuce and greens.  some volunteer arugula and curly endive.  the chives are still going strong.  the flats in the back are full of baby lettuce seedlings which should be ready to transplant out in another week.
