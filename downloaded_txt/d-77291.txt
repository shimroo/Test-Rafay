about us



combat sports international
it doesn't matter if you're in it to get in better shape, a rookie just getting started or an experienced fighter stepping once again into the cage, the right mma gear is essential. hitting the gym without the proper mma equipment like mouth guards, mma gloves, and hand wraps is a good way to get hurt. you need to protect yourself with headgear, knee and elbow pads, and shin guards available from combat sports. we carry mma equipment from the top manufacturers in the game.
