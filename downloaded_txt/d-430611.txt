 bay,                                   and when he took over the program two years ago, the program was in need of rebuilding from the ground-up.                                                                                                  “we worked hard on changing the culture of the baseball program because we had had a lot of turn-over in head coaches, over a five-year period, and one of my goals was to bring some stability to the program,” said coach patrick who played baseball at                                              williamsburg

      in year two, the program grew by leaps and bounds as the bears finished at around 14-14 for the season, still comprised mainly of freshmen and sophomores.                                                                                                  “just as we think we have things pointed in the right direction, the schsl has their two-year realignment, and i promise you, bar none, we have

he batted .390 with 20 rbi’s last season with 15 stolen bases,” said coach patrick. “he is very dedicated to the sport of baseball and this will be his fourth year starting on the team. he makes very few errors and he has soft hands with a quick whip to first base.”                                                                                                  junior

and he protects the plate very well with few passed balls,” said coach patrick. “brantley is a very smart player and he is fully aware of what is going on in the game at all times.”                                                                                     b. jones batted a solid .400 with 15 rbi’s as a sophomore. “brantley is also our number two pitcher and while he might not throw as hard as his brother, he is a pure pitcher that throws a lot of strikes,” said coach patrick. “he had the best era on the team last year at a little over 1.00.”                                                                                     coach patrick says that since garman is a solid back-up catcher this season, he will not be afraid to use b. jones more on the bump. “sometimes you hate to put your starting catcher on the mound if you lose a lot of defenses behind the plate,” said coach patrick. “with garman available to catch some it will give brantley a little more mound time.”                                                                                                  during this interview coach patrick stated he had not made final cuts and some spots in the out-field were still wide-open. he does feel like junior                                              clarkson                                                                                thompson

starting for the first time. matthews led the team in batting at .420 a year ago and he can also play some first base.                                                      moore will be the team’s number three “lefty” behind the jone’s brothers.                                                                                      some of strong newcomers to the varsity include 8

                                                         “i appreciate the girls accepting their roles and doing what we ask them to do,” peace said. “they work extremely hard.”

the man and keeping up with the ball is,” said coach jeffries. “we do not have a double figure type scorer like we had last year (gaddis now at                                              coker

scoring all four years she’s been here,” boland said. “she’s an all-around player. she’s played in all five positions, but she needs to be on the wing or in the post. we’ve had her at the point so her stats are a little down, but she can play any position.”                                                                                                  senior guard

she plays small forward but she also plays everywhere,” boland said. “atyria has taken the biggest leap. she’s only played basketball for a few years but she’s started half our games and has come off the bench. she can move people around the court.”                                                                                                  chapin looks to finish strong against

they have a good chance of getting better next season.                                                                                                 “there’s no doubt they should be a pretty good team for the next couple of years, that’s the goal,” boland said. “yes, they’re young, but i’m tired of saying that. we’ve lost a couple of seniors every year, and it’s not a lie that we’re young, but it’s time to pick it up.”                                                                   ﻿                                                                               the chapin

had a rough go and are currently in fifth place, playing irmo tuesday and white knoll thursday.

says the focus of every season is individual improvement. glace preaches positivity and perseverance with his teams and that helps them compete with most teams in class aa/a.                                                                                     “we work hard to stay positive by focusing on the good stuff and letting go of the bad like water on a duck's back,” glace reports. “it has

dual contests and qualitied for the state tournament in aa-a. the season ended with a first-round loss to clinton.                                                                                     abbeville has a co-ed program with several girls competing on the mat. the girls have their own state individual tournament and abbeville will have a few state title contenders.                                                                                     there also will be state contenders from the boys team with hopes that several panthers can earn spots in the state finals.
