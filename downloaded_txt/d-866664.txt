what our customers are saying…
 i use hiwaay for my internet and ordered the firewall and voip package from vertix for my office. i would rate the installation and customer service at a 10 out of 10. we are extremely happy with the multiple products we purchased from hiwaay and vertix networks. the vertix voice phone system allows us to get all of our voice mails and faxes to our email, so we stay productive on the go. our entire office network and voip phones are on battery backup, so if the power goes out we have almost 5 hours of service, and that’ll keep our business running through the storms. business continuity is a must these days. – july 2015
