      absent-bodiedness 
are you pretty 
much living above the chin? identifying only with your head has some consequences, 
especially for eating.  how do you add your body back into the process?

quick, what are your associations to "fat"? 
"thin"?  we have been taught to 
      "read" personality traits from body size . . .   
rethinking 
      resolutions
resolving not to set yourself up 
the emotional 
immune system   
like the physiological immune system, the 
"defenses" that protect your psyche need bolstering when  you're being 
exposed to toxins.  what's the "vaccine" for living in a weight-obsessed 
culture?  
the art of change 
      trying to make a change? it's messier than "just do it" implies. how do you 
aim for the right goal, and maintain your commitment and motivation?  
if you lived in your body you'd be home now 
      if you could move out of your body and someone could move in, what tips would you give the  new tenant about 
      living here?
