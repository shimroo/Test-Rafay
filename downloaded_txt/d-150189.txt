who we are 

military families speak out [mfso] is an organization of military families across the us and around the world who have a loved one who has served in the military since 9-11. our membership includes gold star families. we seek to support our troops, bring them home, and take care of them when they get here; as well as speak out against other unjust military interventions. 
as families with loved ones who were or are in the military, we have both a unique voice and role to play in speaking out. it is our loved ones who are, have been, or will be on the frontlines. it is our loved ones who are risking injury and death. it is our loved ones who are returning scarred both physically and emotionally. 
our mission:
the mission of military families speak out is to be a community of support and advocacy for our troops and veterans. we are a uniquely authoritative voice for military families who oppose deploying our troops or use of military force, unless our country and our people are in direct danger and only as a last resort.
veterans for peace is the 501(c)(3) sponsor for military families speak out
please consider supporting our work with a donation, a t-shirt purchase, or by  joining us!
