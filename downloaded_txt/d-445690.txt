international & interagency services




the chicago district is responsible for water resources development in the chicago metropolitan area, upper illinois river watershed, lake michigan watershed in wisconsin and the upper wabash river watershed in indiana – an area of about 31,500 square miles.
the chicago district delivers vital engineering services through flood and coastal storm risk management, navigation, aquatic ecosystem restoration, regulatory, emergency management, recreation and interagency support services.
mission: deliver engineering solutions in collaboration with our partners in order to reduce disaster risk, strengthen the economy and support national security.
vision:  innovative and respected professionals, dedicated to solving the nation’s toughest engineering challenges
creating resilient infrastructure, fostering environmental stewardship, and ensuring water resource sustainability, the chicago district envisions a region where communities thrive through innovative engineering solutions and strategic partnerships.




since 1824, the u.s. army corps of engineers has provided safe, reliable, efficient and environmentally sustainable waterborne transportation systems that include channels, harbors and waterways for movement of commerce, national security needs and recreation.
the chicago district maintains 21 federal harbors including channels, coastal structures confined disposal facilities, and three locks, including the chicago lock, one of the busiest in the nation.




the chicago district has extensive experience addressing flood and coastal storm damage in urban areas and can provide a wide range of planning and engineering services. our experience ranges from small-scale studies to the construction of large-scale projects. the corps partners with local communities and other non- federal sponsors to help manage flood risk and coastal storm damage using both structural and non-structural solutions.




the chicago district delivers sustainable and innovative solutions for ecosystem protection, restoration and invasive species challenges by partnering with federal, state, local and other stakeholders. partnerships are instrumental in protecting existing significant ecological resources that are at risk.
additionally, restoration activities are critical in restoring degraded aquatic ecosystem function, structure, and dynamic processes. the restoration intent is to partially or fully reestablish the attributes of a natural, self-regulating, functioning system.




the regulatory program is committed to building strong since 1870 protecting the nation’s aquatic resources and navigation capacity, while allowing reasonable development through fair and balanced decisions. the corps evaluates permit applications for essentially all construction activities that occur in the nation’s waters, including wetlands.
the chicago district has jurisdictional authority under section 10 of the river & harbors act for any work in, over, or under navigable waterways, and under section 404 of the clean water act for any discharge of fill material into waters of the united states to help ensure that environmental impacts on aquatic resources associated with these projects are avoided, minimized, and mitigated.
in the event of natural disasters such as flooding, emergency permit procedures can be activated to expedite permits to reduce further damage, and protect life and property.




during response operations, the chicago district conducts emergency operations to save lives and protect improved properties including public facilities and residential/ commercial developments in accordance with public law 84-99. assistance is supplemental to local and state efforts and is provided at the request of the governor.
under technical assistance, subject matter experts can be deployed to the affected area to provide guidance on flood fight techniques, inspect existing flood protection projects and recommend corrective measures. under direct assistance, materials to include sandbags and plastic sheeting can be provided to supplement local, and state supplies should they become exhausted. temporary flood control measures can be constructed if beyond the capability of local interests and the state to perform in a timely manner.




located in the heart of north-central indiana, the chicago district’s j. edward roush, salamonie and mississinewa lakes provide many opportunities for outdoor recreation including camping, boating, camping, swimming, hiking, hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing and other outdoor recreation activities. j. edward roush lake was named to honor retired u.s. representative j. edward roush, who was instrumental in obtaining funding for the three lakes.
the three lakes manage flood risk in the upper wabash river basin. they work as one unit and have saved $1.6 billion in flood damages since their construction in the 1960s. they have an annual total visitation of approximately 1.3 million with an estimated $36 million in visitor expenditures in the local community.
the chicago district partners with the indiana department of natural resources to manage the campgrounds, boat ramps, beaches and hunting areas.




supports non-department of defense federal agencies, state and local governments, tribal nations, and foreign governments by complementing their capabilities in the delivery of professional services and technical products.
utilizing the talents of in-house district staff and regional and national experts from usace laboratories and technical centers of expertise, assistance has varied from highly specific technical advice, to detailed planning and design documents, to complete program management services.
usace have also functioned as extension of staff, often addressing issues that arise with inherently governmental functions associated with contract acquisitions and/or contractor oversight.

chicago district history2020 marked the 150th anniversary of the u.s. army corps of engineers chicago district when, in 1870, congress appropriated the first funds to undertake improvements to the harbor at the mouth of the chicago river and calumet harbor.
we share a lot of our history with the city of chicago and worked hand-in-hand solving many problems together through the years.
by building the harbors authorized by the rivers and harbors act of 1870, army engineers created an important shipping center that contributed to chicago’s growth.
by 1900, massive growth and expansion of navigation was underway. the corps constructed harbors and harbor improvements along the illinois, indiana and wisconsin shorelines, and in the 1930s completed the illinois waterway, linking lake michigan with the mississippi river.
during world war ii, the chicago district supervised several of the largest wartime construction projects in the corps’ military construction program including the douglass aircraft plant, several immense ordinance projects, airfield runway extensions and military hospitals in the region.
other district highlights include construction of the mccook reservoir, a nationally significant engineering marvel that was a part of the tunnel and reservoir plan published in 1972; and directing the emergency relief effort for the great chicago tunnel flood of 1992.
"i remember the long hours," said david handwerk, planner in the planning branch, who helped coordinate district efforts with the city of chicago during the tunnel flood. "we had a night crew and a day crew both working over 13-hour shifts. the first few days were longer than that. seven days a week pretty much for the duration. i recall the district engineer at the time slept in a cot in his office when he wasn’t on site."
handwerk began his career at the district in october 1984 – first in planning, then project management, and his last year in 2000 at chief of civil design. he recently returned to the district.
as the mccook reservoir project manager, mike padilla, programs and project management branch, began work on the reservoir in 1993 when he was still an engineering intern, worked on the project from 1993 to 2000, and after a period with seattle district, took over managing the project again in 2010.
"i am so proud of this project. i experienced basement flooding at an apartment building i once lived at, so solving this problem was personal for me. i look back in wonder at all the challenges we faced as the project progressed and our success in solving them. placing the reservoir into service for the first time in 2018 was the highlight of my career. big civil works projects sometimes take decades but they are worth waiting for," said padilla.
the mccook reservoir spanned 30 years and the first stage was completed in 2018. a project partnership agreement was signed with the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago in 2019 for construction of mccook stage two.
the mccook reservoir would be the corps’ contribution to the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago’s tunnel and reservoir plan, which would seek to solve the decades-long dominant engineering challenge in chicago – handling of combined sewage overflow.
in the state of indiana the corps chose an abandoned refinery site for a confined disposal facility constructed in two stages after nearly 40 years of ceased dredging. high levels of contamination in both dredged sediments and surrounding areas added complexities.
"addressing the legacy of indiana harbor is a major accomplishment for the chicago district," jennifer miller, chief of environmental engineering, said. "over 100 years ago, we helped to construct what would become a major economic and strategic force for the nation – the harbor itself. our country’s victory in world war ii and subsequent rebuilding were all dependent on the steel industries in indiana. but those industries left a legacy that needed to be addressed. chicago district is lucky enough to serve the nation by protecting the great lakes and addressing historical environmental issues. the past cannot be redone, but the future can be what we make it. our efforts for environmental dredging and ecosystem restoration in indiana are a foundation for the future."
the chicago district boundaries have changed dynamically over the years, but the most significant was in 1980 when the district was reduced to six counties in the chicago metropolitan area and three in northwest indiana.
in 2020, the chicago district’s 150th year, the district expanded again to the upper illinois river, eastern wisconsin and northern indiana and expanded its business lines of coastal storm risk management, navigation, aquatic ecosystem restoration, regulatory, emergency management, recreation and interagency support services.
though founded in 1870, the corps’ presence dates back to 1830 when army civil engineers surveyed and mapped the most practical route for connecting the waters of lake michigan with the illinois river. the maps produced outline chicago harbor improvements and establishes the eventual illinois and michigan canal route.
in 1833 a town was incorporated there.
