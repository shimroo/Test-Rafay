“i just want to start off by saying how wonderful it is to work with wayland and his staff at pallet machinery group. they have always been open and honest and very knowledgeable on the equipment they have sold us throughout the years. both from the sawmill side and pallet side, both new and used, they have always treated us in a timely and professional manner. i believe their past service will allow us to work together in our future plans. thank you again pallet machinery group.”< swipe to see more >





luke gruber  |  general manager, gruber pallets, inc.

"we sold our champion qc306 through pmg and the process was extremely easy! their network of buyers allowed us to sell our machine much faster than we anticipated. a buyer was flying out a couple of days after we listed the machine for sale... a few days after that it was out of our facility. pmg's staff had great communication throughout the whole process."< swipe to see more >





charles hensley  |  president, quint-c pallet

“we began our company in 1981, pallet machinery group has been the backbone of our growth. since partnering with pmg we have achieved production daily. the employees are able to understand the controls and operation of the system. there has been less downtime, but when it happens the customer service is quick to respond and the technician’s knowledge of the machinery is exceptional. we are very pleased with the product and excellent customer service!”< swipe to see more >





mike leitzel  |  a&l wood inc.

“the pallet machinery upgrade was an investment with return. we upgraded a duomatic in jan 2017 and since then have achieved production rates on par with the turbo. more recently we brought in a used duo max and without any hesitation put the upgrade on that machine. that machine was up and running in no time. the system works. the controls are intuitive and our operators quickly grasped the logic. we’re also very satisfied with the customer service we’ve received from our contacts at pallet machinery. when issues arise (which in our case have been minimal) we get very prompt responses from pallet machinery. they know the machines, the computer and they can troubleshoot. downtime has been virtually non-existent. we trust pallet machinery group. i highly recommend the upgrade. money well spent.”< swipe to see more >
