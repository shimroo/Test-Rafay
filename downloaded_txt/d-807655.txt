during this unprecedented crisis juris solutions' employment division
has moved to the vanguard of remain-at-work, return-to-work initiatives.

we are already actively involved in employment testing for over 50 nyc
agencies covering thousands of ny workers, and our programs
are ensuring essential businesses, and those employers who will soon transition
back thousands of ny workers, have them safely screened.

                         your current

we offer rapid covid-19 on-site testing for schools, agencies,
 municipalities, and private businesses. 
all testing can be put through insurance for anyone ahead of time and 
we can offer to coordinate on site testing at a public or private business.



in conjunction with the nyc mayor's office, and in accord with city, state, and
federal calls for private testing, juris has utilized its network of physicians and
locations to establish fixed and mobile covid-19 testing centers to expedite the
safe continuance of essential workers and return of the rest of the workforce that
is so vital to our public health and getting our economy back up and running.



we are ensuring exempted entities continue to operate in a safe manner 
by offering periodic and continuous antibody testing / screenings. 

this includes ongoing and project-based initiatives, such as the recent screening
of 3000+ cruise ship passengers overseen by one of our physicians. 

our employment testing gives peace of mind in uncertain times to those essential
workforces on the forefront of sustaining us during this unprecedented event.



should you be in need of our services, join the nyc mayors office, the

department of corrections, and other essential governmental agencies and
private employers in being proactive in protecting public health and keeping the
workforce safe by  implementing our programs.
