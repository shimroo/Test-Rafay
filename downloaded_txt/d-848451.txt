                                        i was very pleased. but the delivery driver broke one of the flowers right in the front of the arrangement and the balloon was flat. other than that everything else was perfect...

thank you.

florist's response:

i'm so sorry that happened justin. the bags we have to use when it's cold have a tendency to break off flower heads sometimes, but it's better than the whole arrangement dying in the cold. i'm always hesitant to overfill the balloons when it gets cold because they can explode when they get back in the warmer air inside. i would be happy to send out a replacement arrangement and balloon. please just give me a call at 937-222-9441 and i'd be happy to help.

                                        i am a florist in ny and ordered flowers for family in dayton. ordering online was easy and convenient. florist’s choice can be a bit of a gamble… ed smith’s was a real winner! i am very pleased and i look forward to becoming a repeat customer.

                                        i was nervous about ordering online. i was worried that the plant wouldn't look as nice and full, or be large enough, or arrive on time. i had no need to worry. the plant was impressive! it was large, beautiful, healthy, and arrived on time. i would rely on ed smith's again.

                                        i’m a long term customer of ed smith.  they do not disappoint. it was beautiful, full of color and assorted flowers.  captivating!  this would make a beautiful centerpiece to your table or just a special gift for you.  i love a keepsake and the  beautiful pumpkin hits the mark.  i was born on thanksgiving so these colors speak to me.  a reminder of fall, thanksgiving, blessings, warm nights by the fire with someone you love. a beautiful gift for someone you love.  i highly recommend ed smith!

                                        what a beautiful bouquet of flowers with the lantern! absolutely a grand display. the purple flowers were a lovely accent, considering it was the phyllis’s favorite color.

conner smallwood & steve bower



                conner and steve are long time friends who left the corporate world to pursue their true passion. their floral education came under the tutelage of brian smith, son of the company founder ed, who had owned and operated the shop for almost 50 years. under brian's guidance, their skills blossomed, proving their worth to carry on the smith family legacy. 

conner and steve bring energy, passion, creativity, and vision to a floral industry which is often stuck in traditional modes of operation and thinking. with strong customer service backgrounds, the customer's experience is their priority and the flower shop staff is their family.
