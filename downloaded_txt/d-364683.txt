don't threaten us!

“the air force stated on page one of the kc-x solicitation that this was to be a capabilities based acquisition,” said randy belote, a vice president of communications for northrop. “the kc-30 is far superior to its competitor in every area of capability and meets or exceeds the key requirements established for future warfighters by today's combatant commanders. the combatant commanders and the air force have made it clear that they want a new and versatile tanker capable of performing its mission in new ways, not an old tanker employing yesterday’s methods.”that sounds like a threat to me. $500m fine to the northurp/airbus for laying the groundwork for a protest. heraldnet: aerospace blog

25% of us bomber fleet grounded

so the us lost 1 bomber, what is the big deal you might think? well that 1 bomber is about 1% of our total strategic bomber inventory and now with the rest of the b-2 fleet grounded that means we have about 75 b-52 (fifty years old) and b-1 (25 years old) ready to fly combat missions.shockingly this is only the tip of the iceberg; the entire usaf fleet averages about 25 years old; our most significant air denfence fighter fleet, the f-15, has recently been grounded with the little known effect of us having to ask canada to fly air defence missions over alaska for us; the size of the usaf is now lower than at the start of ww2. crazy!slashdot | military grounds stealth bomber fleet

thank you president carter, democrat

there was a time when the us embassy was considered sovereign soil and the world knew that if violated, the entire might of the us military would come crashing down on them. then the us elected a "progressive" democrat president. thank you president carter. thank you democrat voters. let's not make that mistake again. yes, that is what puts me on the mccain train.protesters burn u.s. embassy in serbia - europe- msnbc.com

give up? no. unite? if we have to, yes.

i have no intention of giving up my desire for a true conservative republican nominee. however, as there are no clear convervatives running this year (what is wrong with our party?) and it appears mccain may wind up the nominee, i agree completely with hugh hewitt who say's:"there are seven reasons for anyone to support the eventual nominee no matter who it is:  the war and six supreme court justices over the age of 68."while mccain is not my kind of republican he comes closer to it than anyone in the democratic party. if, and i hold out hope against it, if mccain wins the nomination he wins my full support and my vote in november. i hope it does not come to that, but if it does so be it. any republican over any democrat, any day!

rudy: gut it out, we need you now.

so i blew it with my request for fred to stay in the race and hold out for a brokered convention. now it appears to be up to rudy. we need you mr. mayor. we need you to stick this out, fight to the end, and take this decision to the stage at the republican convention.i'm not asking for much, just to get this decision out of the hands of the media and the uninformed. give republicans the opportunity to hear real discussion of the issues and pick the candidate that best represents our party. thank you hugh hewitt for the scorecard.

fred: go for brokered!

over at the corner on national review online they are asking "who to vote for if you don't think fred can pull it out, and you wish to stop mccain." don't do it fred and those who want a conservative president. don't give up. stay in this to the convention. it is time to ignore all the naysayers and go for brokered!at the convention in a room full of concerned republicans, where the media is on the sidelines, a conservative voice will stand out. it will generate excitement. it will motivate the base. that conservative voice will go on to attract those who care about the security, economic and sovereign, of this country. that conservative voice will be fred thompson.go for brokered fred!

heartbreak and energy focusing

pictures of innocence like this have to cause your heart to break a little and bring an energy focusing pause to your busy routine. as much as your mind may spin over work needs; the frustrations of primary, soundbite, politics; and anger that we dance around with thug regimes, the reality is none of that matters. the frustration it is that those are all just, perhaps necessary, distractions from what is important: this family needs our prayers. this little girl needs the healing touch of god.i think i will set that other, suddenly not so important, stuff aside for a few minutes now, and again later, and focus on something real. what do you think?

no more "evasive maneuvering."

"u.s. navy ships uss port royal (cg 73), uss hopper (ddg 70) and uss ingraham (ffg 61) were steaming in formation at approximately 8 a.m. as they finished a routine strait of hormuz transit when five boats, suspected to be from the islamic republic of iran revolutionary guard navy (irgcn), maneuvered aggressively in close proximity of the hopper. following standard procedure, hopper issued warnings, attempted to establish communications with the small boats and conducted evasive maneuvering."1or2thoughts:first: the us navy should never exercise "evasive maneuvering." the only maneuvering should be into a better firing position.second: the us navy should not act diplomatically with the enemies of the united states. the only thing these people understand is the aggressive use of force. exercise it!third: if the rules of engagement were followed, they need to be changed. last: next time this better include the line "and all five hostile boats were promptly sunk by naval gunfire."three u.s. navy ships approached by iranian boats

so now we are hoping for a brokered convention?

i am not sure what to think reading duane patterson's post. as one looking for a conservative presidential nominee am i supposed to now hope for a brokered convention? what has happened that the hope of conservatives is for fred thompson to have enough money to hang in until something good happens for him; or that no one gains a lead and out of right field newt gingrich is (just possibly) going to show up to save the day. i cannot remember being more disallusioned, but now seeing a glimmer of hope, during the primaries before. is it ok to now be hoping for a brokered convention?thank you hugh hewitt for duane's post.

ha, sean said "ubiquitous!"

when "ubiquitous" and "suzapalooza" show up at the same place someone has to get double or triple comment points. these would of course be like "whose line is it anyway" points because they don't count and you can have as many as you want, but still, "ubiquitous" and "suzapalooza?" go figure!

can you short sell a college football program?

can you short sell a college football program? if so i am all in, or is that all out?anyone who knows me is aware i am no colorado football fan. having said that; how can any school in the country think hiring someone with the record of neuheisel is a good idea?i hope mr. neuheisel has reformed. i hope for ucla (and i am less fond of any california school than cu) that the evidence proves contraindicated and mr. neuheisel brings honor both on field and off, but come on. neuheisel? this is like putting bill clinton in charge of improving the morality of your intern program!proof that "higher education" doesn't mean much i guess. very curious to know what you think, let me know will you please?

things you don't expect to find on a golf course.

 enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee this morning (thank you sweetheart) and the golf channel is on but i'm not really watching when in the background i see elephants. this gets my attention so i turn up the volume and hear "he's hit dangerously close to the crocodile river and that's a place you don't want to be." goes without saying.it is the alfred dunhil championship in south africa. beautiful course but i think i will stick with geese, coyotes, and the occasional deer and leave animals that may kill me to others. guess i don't enjoy golf enough.

beware the blog police!

back from blog world expo and i think i lost the blog police somewhere between the las vegas convention center and denver. the blog police you ask? yes the blog police. they are real, they are everywhere and they are watching even now! apparently, i may be guilty of the following violations:1) i have advertising on my site.2) i did not live blog blog world expo.3) i do not blog hourly.4) i do not blog daily.5) i seem to agree with blogworld expo - the good, the bad, and the ugly point 7.6) i use spell check occasionally (the rest of the time i leave things mispleled.)7) i thought blogging was simply another way of communicating with people not a near mystical and sacred art.overall an interesting show where i learned a few things,met some very good people such as jeremiah owyang, avinash kaushik,chris brogan and scott allen and most importantly i am satisfied this is a valuable means of communication.thank you seeds of growth for a post that seemed to summarize much of my experience as well.

it is always about having the will!

thank you hugh for the bridge and the fence where you point out the difference between something where people or governments have the will to do something, the i35 bridge and where that will is lacking as in border control. i have long held that it is a lack of will that keeps us from doing hard things and that lack of will, or more importantly, those who have that lack which must be confronted and defeated. other examples are those of oil shortages and high gas prices; our lack of will to aggressively drill where oil exist such as alaska or off the coast of several states and our restrictions on refining contribute to these shortages and resulting prices. the oil is there, but our lack of will to go get it causes our inconvenience. the lack of will to succeed would, if allowed, lead to our defeat in iraq. we have the capacity to prosecute this or any war successfully and only a lack of will can prevent that.when choosing a leader or when you are the leader, always remember; it is always about having the will!

now for something completely different!

tough day? do something completely different and go to a youth service at church with a pumpkin chuck, skateboard competitions (with helmets of course,) a dj and an awesome rocking worship band. doesn't sound like your thing? not mine either, other than the rocking worship band, but it does get you thinking different and is fun to watch.

...and i say i should pay less!

warren buffett says "i should pay pay more tax" and i say i should pay less. what is the difference? mr. buffett has the freedom to pay more at his leisure however there are laws preventing me from paying less. what is not said in the story is that mr. buffett pays his employees more than he pays himself therefore they are taxed at a higher percentage of their income. it is called an income tax for a reason. by the way; it was originally going to be called the "confiscation of your money to pay for things you would never pay for on your own tax" but that was considered to long so they shortened it to income tax. thanks drudge report for the link to i should pay more tax, says us billionaire warren buffett | | guardian unlimited business.

what not to do: rice taps clinton, carter for middle east advice

secretary of state rice is looking to former presidents clinton and carter for middle east advice, presumably to learn what not to do. like consulting the french on war strategy, there are certainly good lessons to learn. listen closely, examine the records, then do the opposite and perhaps we will get somewhere positive. rice taps clinton, carter for middle east advice | reuters

sabotage in wartime: treason!

"it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this resolution is just the latest in a series of congressional efforts to sabotage the conduct of that war." thomas sowell should have specified these are democrat congressional efforts at sabotage. it is frightening to think that we all have neighbors and family members who support, by voting for democrats, those who are treasonous in their actions and words. is it enough to hold only the elected democrats in contempt or must our outrage extend to those who support them? friend, co-worker, and neighbor are all culpable in what during time of war can only be considered treason. is it enough to stop at contempt for today's democrats or must action be taken? obviously there must be political action to remove these, not just irresponsible, but dangerous politicians from power but that is not enough. with national security at risk there should be legal and emergency actions taken against those who actively support our enemies! free political speech is one thing, but treasonous action is another and should not be tolerated. realclearpolitics - articles - sabotage in wartime:

taiwan

if it looks like a country and acts like a country it is a country. just because it is more successful, and a better world partner, than it's larger neighbor taiwan should not be denied recognition any longer. indeed, if "china" keeps throwing a fit it should be argued that taiwan and not "china" is the legitimate country. this should have happened long ago but it didn't and it is over time to correct this wrong.china warns taiwan of 'danger' - - the washington times, america's newspaper

barry bonds' home run machine

i completely agree, and have for a long time, that a batter with armor has an unfair advantage. now to see that there is a mechanical aspect to this as well is yet another reason mlb should be ashamed of how they have handled this. the same, though less directly, can be said for pitchers in the american league. not having to face a reprisal from the other team after plunking or pitching inside to a batter has o have extended many games and careers for al pitchers. add to this not having to bat and run bases and their advantage over nl pitchers is even more outrageous.exclusive: barry bonds' home run record tainted by mechanical device

check the husker schedule first!

"don't do it on a college football saturday."reality is if you are a husker fan, have family members who are husker fans, or are getting married in husker land, you need to understand the game will get watched. i have heard of a wedding where the groom, mother of the bride, and most of the rest of the wedding party crashed the bar next door to watch the end of a husker game while the reception was going on. great wedding. great reception. the only way to improve it on game day? provide big screen tv's for everything except the "i do's." college football games override possible wedding dates:
