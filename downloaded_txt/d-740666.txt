alpha omega 2012

ok. i'm not a scientist in fact i'm not even sure if i spelled it right. however i do know that no one knows when the end of the world is... i will say, i am a christian and i know the things in the bible are very far off. think of this so far the bible's predictions have not been wrong yet. some of them have not came true yet. i belive that one day it will. this shift will complete revelation 6:14 (then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up and every mountain and island was moved out of it's place.) not everyone thinks like me and i respect people and don't bash what i believe in peoples faces. the fact is that we are already in the end times. just because this shift will happens doesn't mean that's the end. revelation chapter 6-7. there are different places in the bible that describe the end, it mentions earthquakes, flood, fire and faminne. the anti-christ i believe he's around. the thing is no one knows when the world will be destroyed. so the calender dec 21 2012. yea somthing bad will happen if we shift but that dosn't mean that no one will survive. oh and for some people that are sceptic on the bible and my religion i'm not going to try to say that your wrong. one thing i hate most is when other people push their thoughts on me. which is another reason why people turn away from being a christian. i belive what i believe and the only thing is.... if i'm wrong, i have nothing to lose. but i know he exsist and i bet i can find any answer to any question that anyone has about weather or not he exsist... the main part of this whole blog is to have people think. do some digging in revelation prophecy because when that day comes i would hate to have not done anything to help be a tool to  help save someone.

2012, response to judge

albert gongelez is a fool. majority of public lost confidence in him. most feel same about our judge and government. not just americans but world as a whole. we're free to speak our own minds. and im probably the least educated as far as it comes concerning the law, or courts. but i spend a good 4-8 hrs a day watching history, science, and discovery etc. and so i read post about authors being prosecututed for false stories? i havent even read thier stories. but i can say, many of us who do read or beleve, or understand what is being said, its majority is probably re-written history based on theory of the mayans they predicted many events that have happened on earth to this date. those embeciles who attempt to silence us people need to be shown thier place where they belong, cause we as people, have right to be informed. educated and prepare for such if anything was to happen. sure they might be trying to re-kindle our thoughts to prevent panic or such, but look at hurricane andrew and katrina many died as a result of our government failure i think its natural people decide to research on thier own and thankful for those who have the time and knowledge to put such resources out readily avialable to us to be prepared on our own, cause unfortunately we cant always rely on our govn.
i was orginally an evolutionist growing up many years. so obviously im facinated in science. and unlike religion, i think being able to see proof before our own eyes thru science is more conviencing. im not saying religion is false or anything. my orginal beleif was "religion" was purpose to balance good between evil cause if we all killed each other, what the point of life?
btw 2012 doesnt neccessarily mean end of world.  mayans have said/predicted along with biblical beleifs that "one ending to life will come another" what this means we can only spectulate.

flares can kill gps

"bursts of radiation caused by solar flares interfere with the signal from satellites orbiting the earth, causing the receivers in cars to lose track of their position."
so if you have thrown your road map away, and are relying on gps to get you somewhere, and it plays up, don't blame the manufacturer - blame nature!

storm warning for 2012

the next solar maximum could be 50% higher than the last! although this is unlikely to harm us much, if combined with a reduction of strength or reversal of the magnetic poles, it could cause some major problems.

purity of spirit

has it been said?  the birds of the air will make themselves ready!  hasn't it been said?  i will come, like a thief in the night!  it now will be said...  creation was, and forever will be, the great dream!  singularity, emanating and withdrawing itself away from the collective unity known as god - the great spirit.
the tree of life; the tree of knowledge;  our world had already been seen, our world had already been lived.  strange, you may wonder as your eyes slowly close.  is not the past really the future, and isn't the future really the past.  the great paradox<> rational turnes to irrational, add free will and the irrational becomes rational.
hasn't it been said?  split a piece of wood and you will find me, lift a stone and i will be their!  continue to search the dream within yourselves and the answer will make itself known, yes seek!  what good comes from prophecy?  wear a sweater and the air will turn hotter, yield yourself naked and the air will become colder.  prepare for death and you will live forever, prepare for everlasting life and ye shall surely die.
it has been said, the first will be last; and the last shall become first.
there will be signs in the last days, store the seeds of the cultivating fields.  for the reaper has cometh for a new day, for all will be made new again.  yes, the days will speed up in their own time.  for little is coming fast, and large will become unmoveable.
love was the enigmatic dream of the ancients, and it shall never be lost.  nurture the love found in the last man adam>< so that it will become nature for the first man adam<>

redundant crap your honor

i love my suppressive government!  how the f__k can you prosecute someone for expressing an opinion in a book and call that fraud. no wonder we have a drug problem on this planet. next it will be illegal to wipe your ass! all these people who earn a living making rules for others need to go. fast. if 12/21/2012 prophesises that then i am all for it. it is time for mankind to be set free! no more phoney crone leadership to sell us down the river while raiding the national treasury in the name of justice. no more hiv tainted flu vaccines for third world countries to help lower the world population. i have a better way. lets send all politicians to mars!
the mayans predict the evolution of mankind. they postulate that we will become telepathic and clairvoyant by 2012. i pray for this every day. if it is true it will be the downfall of all lying bastards everywhere. you know who you are and soon we will to. prosecute that mr suppressive!! you might be a judge! i am  man and in gods eyes i have as much right as you do. i will stand up in his court any day of the week. can you ???? men have been suppressed since the beginning of civilization! by who???   our own leaders. they keep us ignorant so that we need to rely on there leadership and the money continues to flow to the top of the heap. this is  why jesus was crucified. he was a threat that represented the freedom of mankind so he was wacked! plain and simple. all great leaders who threaten the illuminati leadership get wacked! all of these statements are only my humble opinion based on all that i have read as well as my life experiences.

strange bird formation in ireland

we are quite used to the v pattern flocks of birds form when flying in formation, but someone has taken a photo of some birds in a star formation. it's either photoshopped, a freak pattern that quickly dispersed, or something actually needing to be researched!

solar storm to arrive in 2012

like most experts in the field, hathaway has confidence in the conveyor belt model and agrees with dikpati that the next solar maximum should be a doozy. but he disagrees with one point. dikpati's forecast puts solar max at 2012. hathaway believes it will arrive sooner, in 2010 or 2011.
"history shows that big sunspot cycles 'ramp up' faster than small ones," he says. "i expect to see the first sunspots of the next cycle appear in late 2006 or 2007—and solar max to be underway by 2010 or 2011."
who's right? time will tell. either way, a storm is coming.

2000-year-old 'computer'

alternate science fans have known of this for a long time, the 2nd century bc greek astronomical calculator with 37 gear-wheels. now it has been deciphered using x-ray technology, and it is more impressive than previously thought.
the calculator function could add, multiply, subtract & divide.
it could align the number of lunar months with years and display where the sun and the moon appeared in the zodiac.
it also had a dial that predicted when there was a likely to be a lunar or solar eclipse, and it took into account the elliptical orbit of the moon.

white buffalo calf killed by lightning 11/2006

lightning strike kills white buffalo
(published monday, november 27, 2006 12:13:08 pm cst)
by gina duwe
gazette staff
lightning on sunday night struck and killed two buffalo cows and three buffalo calves, including a white buffalo-miracle's second chance-on the heider farm south of janesville, dave heider said this morning.
heider discovered the five dead buffalo when he went to check on the animals this morning before going to work.
the white calf's mother was walking around and grunting, so heider followed her up the hill where he found the five dead buffalo with burn marks laying near a tree.
he thinks it was one lightning strike that hit all five and the nearby tree.
the farm became a destination for thousands of visitors after miracle, a female white buffalo, was born there on aug. 20, 1994. in 1995, visitors to the heider farm increased tourism to rock county by 22 percent.
white buffalo are extremely rare and are said to fulfill a native american legend foretelling peace.
miracle died in 2004 and is now stuffed in the heider gift shop.
a male white buffalo was born on the farm aug. 25 this year.
"how many times in a lifetime does lighting strike?" heider said to the janesville gazette after the second birth.
sunday's storm answered his question, again.
earlier this year, lightning struck a couple of his scottish highlander cows, heider said, but it had never happened to any of his buffalo.
he said they figured they'd better "call it in and get it on the news wire" so people wanting to visit the white buffalo wouldn't be surprised.
"i suppose it's going to be a great loss to a lot of people," he said.
since the august birth, "a lot of people" have called about visiting the farm, including people from canada, he said.
sunday night's thunderstorm brought 0.24 inches of rain to the area.
"it's just coincidence, i guess, that lightning struck twice," he said. "he (miracle's second chance) was born in a storm and died in a storm."
(note: i've been looking for links which are native american interpretations of this event--none so far. 12/21/06 jk
