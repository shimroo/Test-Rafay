   the history of red wing boat company clyde (little man) and elizabeth lester originally opened the doors 59 years ago as lester lumber & building. at the time we were building houses in our thriving east houston neighborhood. when the housing market crashed, the lester family used what remained of their lumber inventory to build wooden boats. we came to be known as east end tackle in the 1940’s. several years later we changed our name to red wing boat company, inc. clyde lester received the bill ferguson award in 2004, an award given to people who have contributed many years to the boating industry. the entire family was extremely proud of him. less than a month later, clyde passed away. the company is currently run by clyde and elizabeth’s children: barbara, ralph, and fred, as well as many other employees through the years that have become part of our family. red wing has been a member of the boating trades association of metropolitan houston for many years. clyde and fred lester have served on the boat show board and many other committees. fred has also served as president three times. red wing boat company currently sells new and used boats, sells and services evinrude and yamaha outboard motors, and carries many parts and accessories in stock.red wing has been a member of the boating trades association of metropolitan houston for many years. clyde and fred lester have served on the boat show board and many other committees. fred has also served as president three times. clyde received the bill ferguson award in 2004, an award given to people who have contributed many years to the boating industry. the whole family was extremely proud of him and less than a month later, clyde passed away. the company is currently run by clyde and elizabeth’s children: barbara, ralph, and fred, as well as many other employees through the years who have become part of our family. red wing boat company currently sells new and used boats, sell and service evinrude and yamaha motors, and carry many parts and accessories in stock.
