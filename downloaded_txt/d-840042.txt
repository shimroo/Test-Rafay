improving wildlife habitat for 
    over 90 years
 
 



    









 
 






kester's is 
      dedicated to the improvement

of all types of wildlife habitat.
      

we have not heard of ups 
      discontinuing pickups.  so as long as ups is still picking up our 
      packages, we will continue shipping out order.

the more food you can provide the more 
      wildlife your land can hold and it just mean's the more sport you will 
      have on your land.

whether your looking to attract deer, 
      upland game birds, or ducks and geese we have many different products to 
      help you reach your goals. we have been helping people for the last 90 
      years to improve wildlife habitat. from the backyard enthusiast to small 
      game farms or land owners.  to fish and hunt on your own land it what 
      we at kester's are all about.


      the number of wild ducks or other game that can exist on any area is 
      governed by the amount of food that grows there to support them. if you 
      don't have an adequate food supply wild game will look elsewhere.  as 
      civilization crowds them from their natural habitat, it is necessary to 
      propagate their food in other areas. the planting of natural foods for 
      wildlife is an act of conservation, which helps preserve wildlife habitat 
      for future generations.


      providing some cover is also essential. wildlife need a place to hide when 
      they feel threatened. providing adequate food and cover will improve the 
      wildlife in your area.
the dept. of interior, u.s. corps of eng.,  
      u.s. fish & wildlife, national parks, national wildlife refuges, and waste 
      water 
      filtration systems have used many of our wildlife products. we are there 
      for all your wildlife needs.
