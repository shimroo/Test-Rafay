what is nar-anon? 

nar-anon is a fellowship for families and
friends of addicts whose lives have been or are being affected by someone
else’s addiction.are you sick and tired of being sick and tired? have you
tried everything you can think of to change the addict and nothing seems to
work? don’t give up. there is hope. if you would
like your life to be different, nar-anon can offer you a better way to live.
you will meet people at nar-anon meetings who understand your frustration. 

how can nar-anon help me? 

nar-anon is intended for parents, spouses, children,
siblings, and friends of addicts. nar-anon can provide new insights to help
with our attitudes, behaviors, and emotions. we can regain our own sanity and
well-being. we learn addiction is a family disease, and we need a recovery
program too. in nar-anon we learn we are not responsible for another person’s
addiction. addicts need help and so do we. it can be a great relief to learn
more effective ways of coping while gaining hope and peace of mind.what will i find at nar-anon? 

you will find love, understanding, and hope in the nar-anon
family group. people in the group may be experiencing, in varying degrees, the
same hurt, anger, and anxieties you may be feeling. we find people in
nar-anon who understand what we are going through and are ready to share their
experience, strength, and hope to help us.what can i expect if i keep going to meetings? 

nar-anon family group meetings, with the twelve steps and
twelve traditions, offer a new way to live. you will learn how to change your own
thinking and attitude about the addict – about life. experience, strength, and
hope shared at weekly meetings provide an ongoing opportunity to review and
reinforce the tools needed to bring peace and serenity into your life. this is
your program and your recovery. if you keep coming back ... if you work it ...
it will work. is my changed attitude going to make a difference? 

addiction is a family disease. it affects everyone who is
close to the addict. most of us believe the addict is the one who needs to
change. it comes as a shock to hear we also need to change. it is time to look
at ourselves. when
we discover nar-anon, we find
others with the same
feelings and problems. we learn we cannot control the addict or change him. we
have become so addicted to the addict that it is difficult to shift the focus
back to ourselves. by working the steps, following the traditions and using the
tools of the program, we begin, with the love and help of our higher power and
others, to change ourselves. nar-anon is a fellowship for relatives and friends of
addicts who share their experience, strength, and hope. addiction is considered
to be a family disease and family members are encouraged to attend nar-anon
meetings as soon as addiction is suspected.-- from "nar-anon offers hope," copyright 2016 nar-anon family group headquarters, inc. used with permission.
helping


 
  
  your role
  as helper is not to do things for the person you are helping, but to be
  things, not to try to train and change his/her actions, but to train and
  change your reactions. as you change your negatives to positives -- fear to
  faith; contempt for what he does to respect for the potential within him/her;
  rejection to release with love, not trying to make him/her fit a standard or
  image, or expecting him to measure up to or down from that standard, but
  giving him an opportunity to become himself/herself, to develop the best
  within him/her, regardless of what that best may be; dominance to
  encouragement, panic to serenity; false-hope, self-centered, to real hope,
  god-centered; the rebellion of despair to the energy of personal revolution;
  driving to guidance; and self-justification to self-understand -- as you
  change in such ways as these, you change the world about you and all the
  people in your world for the better.
