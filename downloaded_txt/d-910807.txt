mailing faqs the internet has brought about colossal changes in the field of marketing. the low cost of delivering messages via banner ads and email seemed to spell the doom of direct mail. it was not meant to be. the fleeting images on a screen, although inexpensive, are still no match for the power of paper in a customer's hand. in fact, last year was the best year ever for direct mail, capping over a decade of double-digit growth. and nothing beats direct mail for its ability to accurately measure effectiveness.
