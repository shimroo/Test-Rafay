aboutthe neo soul cafe vibe



neo soul cafe is programmed by dj frances jaye who is an eclectic, music loving deejay. her passion was to give the listening audience a format of music from avant-garde r&b to organic soul incorporating elements from jazz, funk, hip hop to pop, fusion, and african music.

with her creative mind, dj frances jaye knew she had to create a multimedia movement called neo soul cafe, an oasis for soul music connoisseurs. “the music that gets your head right”. neo soul cafe is about the music, the people and the culture. neo soul cafe is a movement, and has one purpose which is to give the world a platform to know about “good music”.
