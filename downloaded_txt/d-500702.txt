we are located in orting, washington, in the foothills of the pacific northwest's mount rainier area of puget sound, within a beautiful hour's drive from either seattle or tacoma in washington state. 
we have been active in the breed since 1994 under the covington affix not just showing & as a hobby breeder but in breed clubs, serving on  boards, educational committees, program committees, genetic health committees, attending seminars & educational events, participating on national and international breeder panels, mentoring and heidi is a championship show judge in both the akc & ckcsc-usa. 
	

	in those 30 years, along with the  dedicated owners and co-owners of covington dogs, we have bred or owned dogs that carry over 100 championship titles between  ckcsc-usa, akc & uk in the conformation ring along with titles in obedience, therapy work, lure coursing, tracking & agility, including the #1 agility cavalier in the nation- 2 years running. over the years, we have been recognized as one of the top 5 breeders of  champions in the ckcsc-usa and in the 2011, we were recognized as one of the 6 most influential breeders in the us in the international publication of "the world of cavaliers". 
we are not showing as much these days as heidi is focusing on her judging, but still have the occasional covington champion and enjoy a few litters of lovely puppies a  year.  our  primary focus is and always has been that these little dogs represent the cultural and historical legacy they were originally bred for: true "comfort spaniels" and the ideal companion for our families. if you would like additional information about us or our cavaliers  please contact us through the e-mail link on this site.

it is with such heavy heart i share the news of the recent loss of my beloved mulit bis- ckcsc-usa, akc champion covington chrome at 11.5 years of age to stomach cancer.  pictured here winning reserve best in show at the 2007 ckcsc-usa national speciatly at 21 months old.  chrome had a small g3 heart murmur which had nothing to do with his illness.  he fought a good fight for many months and although couldn't eat much at the end, was very happy to be a dog and enjoyed his normal routine with all his brothers who were so gentile and protective of him. he was his stoic happy cavalier self right up to the last day when he let me know he was ready to go.  we will always love you "chrome dome" and all the fun times we had traveling & in the show ring with you. you were a mommy's boy a pure cuddle bug. rip  and i will meet you at the rainbow bridge my blessed boy.

thank you to the harvest moon classic in pleasanton ca for the hospitality and invite to judge cavaliers at your show.  special thanks to sandy olson for all your help & extra. 
october 14, 2016

attended the ckcsc-usa national in harrisburg pa.  was an honor to be invited as one of 4 breeders represented on the international breeder pannel at a dinner event this year at our national specialty.  

panel members:  rachel & erika venie/orchard hill usa, heidi mohn/covington usa, tanya engel/angels pride germany & michael levy/pascaval uk.


also, a very exciting roll out on cavalier health reasearch "live for love", taking a new approach to mvd & sm researech based on longevity vs irradication which after 30 years has proven impossible.  was honored to to get a special invite to join the founders  & board of this new endowment at dinner at our national banquet to speak about my experience and trends in our breeding program which connect to the finding that this new focus that those cavaliers that have the ability to adapt and live longer with mvd carry certain genes and or chromosomes and it runs within families.

today we heard the very sad news from jacks owner, doc myer, that ch. covington burnt suede has crossed the rainbow bridge at the young age of 9.5 years from complications from lymphangiectasia, a form of inflammatory bowl disease, this can sometimes be caused by a reaction to vaccines. vaccines are important, but be careful not to over vaccinate your dogs.  for more information on vaccinations, look into www.hemopet.com
