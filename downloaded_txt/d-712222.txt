welcome to the vermont medical society

the vermont medical society is the leading voice of physicians and physician assistants in the state and is dedicated to advancing the practice of medicine by advocating on behalf of vermont's clinicians and the patients and communities they care for. 
the society serves its 2,900 members through public policy advocacy on the state and federal levels, as well as by providing legal, administrative and educational support, producing a rich flow of news and information and offering member benefits that increase medical practice effectiveness and efficiency.
founded more than 200 years ago, the society has long been recognized as one of the state's most prominent health care organizations.
