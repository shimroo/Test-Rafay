us man in aleppo (syria) & political “opponent” wasim maziak celebrates 10-years’ old “concerns” over the health of us hookah (shisha) users









update sep 2013
lettre ouverte à wasim maziak, opposant politique syrien et
directeur du centre « de recherche » usa-syrie à alep (us-scts) [openletter to wasim maziak, syrian political opponent and head of the us-syrian«research» centre in aleppo (us-scts)]. 7 sept 2013

tunisie-secret.com/lettre-ouverte-a-wasim-maziak-opposant-politique-syrien-et-directeur-du-centre-de-recherche-usa-syrie-a-alep-us-scts_a592.html




chemical (and social...) weapons of mass distraction... the brandished logo is that of the us-syrian "research" centre in aleppo...



subject: ««waterpipe»»™ geopolitical thriller not terminated > hookah, health & war: the real face of “syrian” political opponents











 in last year’s
(sorry) interview with us tv channel, us man in aleppo (syria), author of the who junk report on ««waterpipe»»™
smoking (as well as of a long series of scaremongering junk publications sold
to the us against syria and the arab world as a "contribution" to the “arab spring”
(see ref. below)) and ««waterpipe»»™
millionaire, sells again his anti propaganda through media ganging
together with him and his fellow anti-««waterpipe»»™ activists : 







http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/hookah-smokers-putting-health-in-jeopardy-fiu-researcher-says-160330735.html







highly relevant: 


 





syrian
waterpipegate: us-syrian center for tobacco studies ["our man
in aleppo"] 





« independent syrian experts are likely right to say that the
ongoing pseudo-revolution there (17 months now) is meant, not only to achieve
macro objectives in the region but, also, in the end, a certain lifestyle (all
independent travellers knowing syria will understand): the simplicity of daily
life, its low cost, middle east sociability best expressed by syrian
coffee-houses and patios with their gurgling narghiles, etc... what is at
stake is the repeated intent, begun in iraq, to implement the us great/new
middle east project at all levels: from the political hyper-structure to the
socio-cultural aspects. in the view of their designers and their men in the
region, the “arab way of life” must be shattered thanks to the emergence of a
consumerist society essentially based on competition.”







ten
post-11/9 great myths about hookah (shisha, narghile) smoking &
public health







the
syrian ban on smoking in hospitality venues (cafes, etc.)







the
lebanese ban on smoking in hospitality venues (cafes, etc.)







““arab
spring””. public health researchers from universities of cambridge, florida
& london school of hygiene, deny the reality of one million iraqi deaths –
in pro-nato paper

  

their ""arab spring""'s updates (bloody for some of them...):

us-man in aleppo (syria) wasim maziak once again highly concerned with “global” ««waterpipe»» “epidemic”

 info or war? compare bbc mantras: “1 shisha = 450 cigs” & “gaddafi bombing his people” demand (mps, etc.) that your country withdraw from the totalitarian fctc treaty (“framework convention for “tobacco control””). write to hugo chávez frías, outspoken president of venezuela so that he can spark it off and smash the pharmaceutical lobbies behind. an initiative launched in the hague on march 15, 2010
