as the ny state mandated corona lockdown imposed by gov. cuomo 


 


has just surpassed a full year (365+ days) 


 


businesses must look forward as they will have to operate under the new guidelines


 


your internet web presence will play a major role on how fast you get your business back to normal


 


 


 


clubhouse2000 has been considered an essential business


and as we continue to play a significant role in keeping many businesses online and in the search engines during the shutdown 


clubhouse2000 chose not to send out or drop off any billing invoices during the initial 15 day shutdown then


 


as this shutdown was extended multiple times throughout the summer of 2020


we continued maintaining your web presence by paying your online bills during this rough time for your business  


at least until you were able to navigate your business through these new mandates and regulations imposed on you by the state.


 


 


 


we understood the uncertainty of the situation and wanted to help your business as much as we could by


maintaining your online services by paying the fees from our own account.


we had hoped that this would be appreciated and when this shutdown has ended and if your business has survived you would 


please pay the emailed billing invoices as promptly as you can. very much appreciated


 


 






 
 






 


initially they told us 15 days to end the shutdown


which was then extended by another 30 days


over 1 full year now


we realized your business was about to go through 


some hard times


 and did not want to add to your stress 


by billing your business during those uncertain times


 


clubhouse2000 


was there for you and your business when you needed a 


compassionate and caring company


to help you retain your web services and to remain online


throughout the initial 45 days, then throughout the summer


 








 


we chose to maintain our clients online presence


throughout this shutdown which included: 


 


membership to our network of 50+ online magazines


website hosting fees


domain renewals and forwarding


seo maintenance and management


updating links for online ordering and delivery services


updating hours and days of operation during the shutdown


posting corona compliance messages & information


adding your business to our new social media platform


creating additional websites for existing clients


 






 
 






 





















 
 
 






 


 


* important update to program: paycheck protection program (ppp)


 


 


 


attention business owners who have applied for or have already received their loan disbursement payment


 


 


 


as many of the professionals understand the laws the way they are written now


 


your business's internet presence is now considered part of your utility expenses


 


what does that mean to you as a business owner?


 


the newly updated formula used to calculate whether or not this government relief money


 


will be assigned to your business as a loan by your bank to be paid back with interest
 or
forgiven as a government grant is simple:


 


(formula to determine the level of debt forgiveness)


 


75%   of the loan amount must be used to maintain your payroll for the next 2 months  
the remaining 25% of the funds must be used by your business for things such as rent and utilities


 


 


 


any monies leftover that are not utilized for payroll, rent, and utilities


will be considered a bank loan and must be repaid with interest over the next 2 years


 


you will have only 2 months after initial deposit to disburse 


the non payroll monies such as rent and utilities


 


 


 


as a business webmaster / internet marketer / networker


 


i feel it is my obligation to inform you of all the internet and web services that i normally provide


 


 plus those i have made available for small businesses during this shutdown such as:


 






 



websites - design, hosting and maintenance




website updates and links - to online ordering and delivery




web banner ads and webpage ads - to promote your website




web video ads - to enhance your website, web ads, and your youtube channel




social media campaigns - on facebook and instagram




membership to the long island network - comprised of 50+ online magazines & 50 facebook pages




corona compliance messages & updates - keep your customers informed of changes coming 



 






 


which are now officially considered a utility expense for your business by the paycheck protection program (ppp)


 


 


 


just because cuomo wont let you work at your place of business doesn’t mean that you cannot work on your business


 


that is where i come in


 


my simple advice to my existing clients and to all those small businesses


that have received or about to receive ppp monies


spend as much money as you can increasing your online presence (utility) 


all of which should be forgiven as a grant


(if used within first 60 days of ppp monies deposited into your bank account)


 


 


 


during this government imposed and state mandated “stay at home” quarantine period


 


businesses have learned how important it is to establish a large and effective online presence,
			 


"to not only survive now, but to thrive going into the future"


 


 


 


time for you as a business owner to step up and grab some of that internet marketshare by


 



1. adding one or more websites to your business
			2. advertising, marketing, and networking your websites on established web magazines
			3. business cards and fliers promoting your online presence and website



 


 


 


in order for a business to use this increase in online presence as a utility expense for the pp program


 


this important web service should be performed and invoiced by an established internet business


 


having friends and family do this work for your business


leaves you open for a bank audit in the future which may lead to a repayment of this money


 


take advantage of my web services over the next 60 days to take advantage of the pp program


 


“those businesses that take advantage of the downtime will see a greater return on the upside”


 


(check with your accountant to verify this new update and the accepted use of the internet expenses as mentioned above as a forgivable utility use)
