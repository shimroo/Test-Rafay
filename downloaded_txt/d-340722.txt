welcome to the edinburgh language technology group


the edinburgh language technology group (ltg) is a research and development group working in the area of natural language engineering since the early 1990s.  it now functions cross-college at the university of edinburgh and involves staff from one of the largest communities of natural language processing specialists in europe at the institute for language, cognition and computation of the school of informatics and from the edinburgh futures institute at the school of literatures, languages and cultures.
the ltg’s work is application oriented: we focus on building practical solutions to real problems in text mining and processing. we have worked in all areas of large-volume text handling, from text annotation through markup architectures and from information extraction to automatic or computer-assisted generation of text. for example, we have applied text mining to historical and literary text. we have also used it for mining unstructured electronic healthcare records.
