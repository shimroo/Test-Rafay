experience a new science of instant transformation



the dawn of this new quantum age presents you with the radical

new paradigm--that you are not your body or your situation, but instead are
pure energy, pure consciousness. you exist in an interconnected holographic
multiverse in

which you are literally jumping from one parallel universe to another with
every choice you make. through such

quantum

jumps, in a moment you can become smarter... more confident...

happier... more outgoing... more effective... in better relationships...

with more willpower. you can gain practical tools to achieve real change in

your life, and leap forward to become happier and more prosperous, living

the life of your dreams. join me in exploring the place where science

comes together with inspiration and imagination.
bigger than the mandela effect
one of the main reasons the "mandela
effect" grabs peoplesâ attention is that it demonstrates
that facts and histories can change. increasing numbers of people are
observing changes to human anatomy, geography, passages in books, products,
movies, and more. if there is no boundary line demarcating the end of the
classical physics world and the beginning of the âquantum
realm,â we start to see what the mandela effects and reality
shifts are telling us, and where they may be taking us, too. relativity may
apply to spaceship travelers and quantum measurements alikeâand
such âquantum phenomenaâ as teleportation, tunneling,
entanglement, and superposition of states might be witnessed all the way up
to the realm of the immensely, gigantically enormously huge star systems,
galaxies, and constellations. 

reality shifts and the âmandela effectâ thus offers
to take humanity out of a presumption of material realism and classical
true-false logic into the realm of quantum logic, where facts are entangled
and sometimes seemingly unrelated things move together coherently, like
birds of a flock moving in perfect synchrony. quantum logic invites us to
consider how something can be: true, true-and-false, not-true-not-false, or
false. mandela effects, reality shifts and quantum jumps show us that just
because we think something is a certain way doesnât mean it will
stay that way.

we can benefit from incorporating quantum consciousness in ways that
positively transform all areas of academic study and our daily lives as we
come to recognize alternate histories as being a natural part of existence.
medical professionals can adopt a view of spontaneous remission being a
naturally occurring process, and doctors can encourage people to adopt
âhealthy beliefsâ with states of mind that facilitate
quantum jumps as one of the fundamental foundations of healing. we can be
relatively certain that as long as we keep asking, "how good can

it get?!", we will likely have a wonderful future to look forward
to.
