current parent
our five precious children found in the leffell community entry points for friendship, personal growth, academic challenge, and jewish pride.













june 2021
we wanted to thank you for the miraculous school year you provided our son during the pandemic. it has been great to see him progress academically. we are exceptionally grateful for the incredible social environment you created for the students. he loved going to school this year and, while he won't admit it to you, he is sorry to see the school-year end.  we recognize how much effort went into pulling this off and wanted to thank you for all the work the entire school put in.













current parent
our daughter loves her teachers, her classmates, and pretty much any activity at leffell! we cannot thank you enough to you and your team for everything accomplished this year. never in our wildest dreams did we think our daughter would have such a safe, healthy and crucial year in her education. leffell has succeeded beyond any expectations imaginable.













alumni parent
our son would not be where he is today without the tremendous education he received here. and i am not talking solely academically… his soul would not be as rich and deep if it were not for his teachers, deans, and experiences at the leffell school. he has grown to be thoughtful, articulate, passionate, and motivated to change the world for the better. what else could parents ask for!













alumnus
attending schechter westchester (now the leffell school) has undoubtedly been the best decision i have ever made in my life, and i am forever grateful for your incredible guidance and support throughout my entire experience. 













current parent
there are many schools with excellent academic reputations. but there’s something else about the leffell school students that i find so compelling. it’s not just academics, and it’s not religion per se . . . you hit the nail on the head: the values and character!
