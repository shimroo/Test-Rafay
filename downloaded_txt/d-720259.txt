hymn 49-50 ~ dear lord & father ~ lyrics 



dear lord and father of us all,forgive our foolish ways;reclothe us in our rightful mind;in purer lives thy service find,in deeper reverence, praise.in simple trust like theirs who heard, 







beside the syrian sea,the gracious calling of the lord,let us, like them, without a wordrise up and follow thee.

    seeing the truth about everything      




 
























 








 












 1. we need to always be seeking the truth about whatever topic that we are studying. if we're not seeking truth, we're barking up the wrong tree.
2. einstein gives us a big clue in one of his more famous quotations: curiosity has its own reason for existing. never stop questioning.
3. einstein stated high reverence for mary baker eddy because of what she revealed to the world in 1866. he realized the truth about that topic ~ "there is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter".
4. he had been studying his whole life about matter, time, light & relativity. he says, imagine you're having a conversation that is very pleasant, then time will go by very quickly. but if you're working on something that ends up being laborious, time moves very slowly. what it really means is that time is based on the evaluation of the observer. it may be going by quickly for one person & very slowly for another.
5. our thinking is what's going to determine the speed of time, whether it is passing by quickly for us or slowly.
 







 if one would be watching an entertainment movie, & it was really the kind of movie the individual liked to watch, the time would probably go by quickly. whereas if it was very slow moving that didn't seem to have much of a plot, you may even turn it off because it has no interest to you. you stopped the time for this event.
6. mary baker eddy was living her prayer. everything we think, say & do is living our prayer. we can have a very boring prayer or we can have a very vivid one. we can have one filled with life, vigor, activity & progress. or we can have one filled with inactivity, & not of very much interest at all.
7. genesis 1:1 ~ in the beginning ~ mary baker eddy interprets this to mean ~ the only creation that exists is the creation of god = unfoldment of revelation.
8. genesis 1:1 to genesis 2:3 ~ the original word used for god is elohim which means the real, true god. 
9. genesis 2:4 ~ beginning with this verse, the term used for god is jehovah. this is the opposite of elohim. elohim is the perfect god. jehovah is the material sense which is the false record of creation.
 







 10. genesis 2:4 ~ beginning with this verse, everything is foggy &. nothing is clear. therefore, the whole story of adam & eve is in a mist, a mistake, a fog, & nothing can be seen with clarity. everything is a false record of creation. 
11. we must reject the false record of creation because this is not our heritage. we must insist that our true heritage is genesis 1:1 to genesis 2:3.
12. if you are looking through a mist, certainly you're not going to see with clarity. that's why car's windshields include wipers to improve the view as one travels through rain. it keeps the water off of the viewing area, otherwise you're not going to be able to see clearly as you drive. we're doing the most important driving when we are following the mind of god in directing our path to be on the path of truth ~ so that we can see truth about everything.
13. when we're studying about god and man & the relationship between god & man, we want to make sure that if we're depending on the 5 senses of sight, hearing, feeling, tasting & smelling, that they are based on spirit ~ so that we can see everything with clear vision.
