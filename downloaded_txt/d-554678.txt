latest news: building automation protocols such as bacnet, modbus and lonworks have been added






welcome to data network resource!


		here you will find notes and tutorials on much of that
		which is encountered when working within the data networking environment.  not only data
		protocols, but website writing tutorials, cabling and smart building related
		information is available.
		


		a large range of old and newer data network technologies are covered in this site.
		for instance, some of the common technologies related to ip include:
		ethernet, ip addressing,
		data encoding, ip telephony.
		and quality of service.
		


		topics related to routing protocols including
		ospf, eigrp, and
		bgp	are detailed here.
		


		other sections more removed from data network technologies include material on website production using
		html, and notes on operating systems such as unix,
		as well as protocols and essays related to smart or intelligent buildings.
		


		use the menus above and the google search to navigate the site or the internet.
		the topics are organised roughly around the
		osi model.
		in the appropriate places throughout the site there are links to other related websites.
		


		feel free to make comments, browse and link to the site.  this resource is provided free with no obligation.
