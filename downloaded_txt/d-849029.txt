entelos predictive biosimulation




entelos is a leading clinical trial partner that supports drug research and development teams with to mapping and predictive modeling through software. the entelos software platform replicates the system biology of virtual human patients and populations so that the right biomarkers are identified and translated correctly. this results in the right patient being paired with the right trial. entelos software analyzes the granular data points required to more accurately predict clinical outcomes.
clinical trials require predictive mapping that starts with triage and predictive insight. the correct target and biomarker are identified before moving to candidate selection for the trial. entelos understands patient dissimilarity, inter-species rendition and trial design. entelos provides mechanism-based mathematical models; disparate virtual-patient phenotypes; biosimulation software, and expert consulting support. entelos’ extensive disease modeling includes type ii diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and dermatology.  it also addresses nutraceuticals.  
target selection support includes detailed, quantitative modeling and simulation to compare the impact of varied targets on therapeutic outcomes.
biomarker selection services include replicating disease biology and drug response over time.

inter-species translation helps researcher to progress from animal models to phase 1 via biosimulation predictors correlated to patient outcomes.
patient stratification addresses patient diversity. entelos simulates varied patient phenotypes and mechanisms to predict outcomes in identified sub-populations. 
trial design optimizes the size and duration of clinical trials. entelos conducts simulated trials and tests different study considerations to predict clinical outcomes. predictions for therapeutic response are plotted at multiple time points. this allows the closer study of disease progression. 
biosimulation  generates answers to key questions. which patient population has the right phenotype to be included in the trial? what are the optimal dosing and monitoring schedules for phase ii and iii? how many dosing arms are needed? which biomarkers can identify early success and which can help identify risk of adverse events? when is the correct time to terminate a clinical trial? how does the drug candidate or target translate to international markets and populations?
 before undertaking qualitative design entelos sources modeling data from journal articles, expert reviews, authoritative textbooks, and a proprietary network of subject matter experts, collaborators and consultants. a thorough analysis of pertinent physiological pathways and functions is performed prior to the design stage.
