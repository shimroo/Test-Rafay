 by scott mckenzie 


posted on january 14, 2025

anyone could have written alex van halen’s book 



 by scott mckenzie 


posted on january 4, 2025 




i recently reviewed alex van halen’s memoir brothers for popmatters. read the whole review here. in short, anyone with a decent amount of research could have written this book. personal stories, insights, intimate memories ain’t present. the book quotes — over and over again — interviews with the late guitar legend eddie van halen. if…
