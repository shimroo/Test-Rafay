duke kahanamoku beach#1 beach in america 2024













for over three decades, dr. stephen leatherman ("dr. beach") has reviewed, evaluated and rated beaches and coastal areas throughout the world. in addition to his annual ranking of america's best beaches, he works tirelessly to increase awareness about the dangers of rip currents and to promote no smoking at beaches.top 10 beaches list of 2024








1. duke kahanamoku beach, oahu, hawaii
kahanamoku beach is located on the west end of waikiki beach, far from the large crowds elsewhere. it is the widest beach on this world-famous stretch of sand and protected by an offshore coral reef, making it a good beach for families with children. the nearby duke kahanamoku lagoon is also a favorite bathing and swimming spot. this is one of the most picturesque beaches in the usa with the iconic diamondhead volcano in the distance.












2. coopers beach, southampton, new york
coopers beach is located on the south shore of long island, new york, shielded from the cold labrador currents in the beautiful village of southampton.  as the first “gold coast” in the country, coopers beach is hundreds of yards wide, made of grainy white quartz sand.  the beach is backed by large sand dunes covered by american beach grass interspersed with large and extravagant mansions.  some of the best beach access in the hamptons exists on coopers beach, and a snack bar serving lunch and drinks can be found here as well.












3. wailea beach, maui hawaii
wailea beach is a series of five pocket beaches, which are part of the wailea resort complex that is mandated to provide a public right-of-way for visitors. the white coral sand beach gently slopes offshore and is great for snorkeling when the ocean is calm. the swanky hotels are set back far from the beach, providing a beautiful-landscaped park, adorned with tropical vegetation and flowering bushes and trees.












4. caladesi island state park, dunedin clearwater, florida
caladesi is reached by pedestrian ferry boat, private boats or a long walk north from clearwater beach; the inlet is closed so caladesi is no longer a true island, but still a great getaway. the white beach is composed of crystalline quartz sand which is soft and cushy at the water’s edge, inviting one to take a dip in the sparkling clear waters. there are boardwalk trails, but my favorite is the kayak and canoe trails through the mangroves to see the large blue herons and other birds that frequent this wonderful natural area.












5. beachwalker park, kiawah island, south carolina
south of charleston, beachwalker park is the public beach located on the southern end of kiawah island. this is a nature-lovers coast so visitors can bring their canoes and kayaks to paddle through the tidal inlets. it is also fun to walk or bicycle down the fine-grained sand beach to captain sam’s inlet to see thousands of birds. the water is not clear, but it is clean and provides fantastic seafood for low-country cooking.












6. main beach, east hampton, new york
main beach provides the perfect blend of nature and built environment.  wealthy summertime residents flock to the beaches protected by a conservation easement that dates back over 300 years.  main beach is a great place for star-spotting as many actors and actresses frequently visit this beach for its peaceful, countryside setting in a small village.  the big, wide sandy beach composed of grainy quartz grains has towering sand dunes and beautiful clean and clear blue water.  the best way to get around this beach is bicycling in order to avoid parking.












7. poipu beach, kauai, hawaii
located on the sunny, dry side of this island is poipu beach, which is actually two beaches in one.  a tombolo, which is a narrow sand spit that extends from the shore to an island, separates the two pocket beaches.  the offshore island knocks down the big waves, so that small waves break gently on the shallow sandbar, creating a fun area for children to play. as you move along the crescent-shaped beach, the waves vary in size in response to the exposure to the pacific ocean.












8. delnor-wiggins pass state park, naples, florida
this barrier island beach boasts of beautiful white sand beaches and crystal-clear gulf waters.  activities include swimming, snorkeling, paddleboarding, shelling, and fishing.  wildlife in the park includes bald eagles, ospreys, and manatees.  pine trees provide welcome shade.  the park is still recovering from hurricane ian in 2022 so some areas are still closed.    












9. coast guard beach, cape cod, massachusetts
coast guard beach, accessible by bicycle or shuttle bus from the salt pond visitor’s center, was formed where a sand spit attached to the glacial cliffs. the sand is fairly coarse so the beach slopes steeply into the water. the picturesque old coast guard station still sits atop the glacial bluffs, allowing for a spectacular view down upon the nauset spit barrier system and bay. during the summer, beach-goers take quick, refreshing dips in the ocean as water temperatures only reach 60-70 degrees.












10. ft. de soto park, st. petersburg, florida
fort de soto park is a very large coastal park, consisting of five interconnected islands and spanning 1,136 acres.  north beach is the best swimming beach with its fine, white sand and clean, clear water of the gulf of mexico.  there is much to explore in this vast natural ecosystem which has a wealth of bird life and sea life—bring your kayak or canoe.  there is also an historic fort to explore.
