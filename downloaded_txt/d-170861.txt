sabiki-style seabass / cod rigs
as seen in the april saltwater sportsman
http://www.saltwatersportsman.com/article/species/sabiki-style-sea-bass/1
                                     
these are great rigs, and not just for sea bass.   as noted in the article, tip these with a fresh strip 
                                     of squid, and they will catch just about everything.   these work really good in the surf as well.





2008 testing
                                  underwater fishing lights
here is only one reason to use fishing lights during deep sea fishing such as halibut or ling cod.   this one hit like a freight train, also brought in a 60# to fill our limit.
