undeniable exhilaration!marchfourth is a kaleidoscope of musical and visual energy that inspires unabashed dancing and an atmosphere of celebration. born in portland 22 years ago on a mardi gras day, marchfourth’s collaborative roster has evolved through many musical generations. the m4 family now spans from oregon and seattle all the way down to new orleans. costumed as a psychedelic punk rock marching band circus troupe, m4’s show features electric bass, guitar, a 4-piece percussion corps, a 7-part horn section, dancers, acrobatics, stilt-walkers, a live visual artist, and a diverse musical repertoire. far from a "marching band" in any traditional sense, they have been known to swagger through town playing a few tunes before taking the stage. marchfourth travels in a 47 foot tour bus named the highway star, bringing their unique brand of party and good vibes wherever they go. their show is a sonic journey with worldwide influences, echoing the deepest grooves of american funk, rock, and jazz boiled all together in cinematic fashion, with showmanship, flare, and big heart. this genre-busting, joy-inducing, in-your-face experience is not to be missed!pure joy!
