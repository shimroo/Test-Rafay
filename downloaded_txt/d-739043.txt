brief biography
please see my  cv here  for more comprehensive information


i have worked extensively with elections management bodies in developing and post-conflict countries for almost twenty years, in africa, the americas, asia, europe and in the pacific. i participate in regional and global electoral support initiatives and have contributed to many publications and competence development efforts. in several countries, i developed and delivered voter registration, results management and poll-worker management systems.
elsewhere, i provide advice to elections management bodies to enable them to specify, develop, procure, deploy and support a variety of technologies, including biometrics, in support of electoral processes, particularly voter registration and results management systems. in recent projects, the emphasis has been on assessing feasibility and advising on the practicalities of implementing new voting technologies.
