executive chef/owner frederic feufeu




																			executive chef/owner frederic feufeu, a native of the loire valley and veteran of the new york restaurant scene, has received numerous awards for his authentic french bistro fare and contemporary cuisine.
                                    










																			his culinary journey has taken him from the prestigious les sorbets school in brittany, to paris, london and ultimately the rainbow room in new york.  what followed was a series of notable executive chef positions with the st. regis hotel, the brasserie pascal, le taxi and 14 wall street restaurant.
