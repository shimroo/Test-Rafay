 the
                                skyscan detects electromagnetic
                                emissions from individual
                                lightning strokes, and can be
                                detected at long range by use of
                                ad hoc sensors.
 you
                                are at immediate risk any time
                                there is detected lightning
                                activity within 9 miles of your
                                location.
 the
                                skyscan lightning detector is the
                                newest high technology weather
                                monitoring product available
                                anywhere in the world. it is a
                                hand-held instrument with an
                                electronic system to detect the
                                presence of
                                lightning/thunderstorm activity
                                occurring within 40 miles of your
                                location. it uses patented
                                technology (full digital
                                microprocessor insuring accuracy
                                and reliability) to determine the
                                distance to the detected stroke.
                                the distances are indicated in
                                four ranges: 0-3 miles (0-5 km),
                                3-8 miles (5-13 km), 8-20 miles
                                (13-32 km) and 20-40 miles (32-64
                                km).
 since
                                skyscan allows you to know the
                                level of activity of the storm,
                                it determines if it is moving
                                towards, away or parallel to your
                                position. each time skyscan
                                detects a lightning stroke, it
                                emits an audible warning tone (if
                                this feature has been turned on
                                by the user) and lights the range
                                indicator column. the full column
                                stays lit for approximately 3
                                seconds. this feature allows you
                                to see the distance to the last,
                                closest, detected stroke without
                                waiting for skyscan to detect a
                                new stroke.
