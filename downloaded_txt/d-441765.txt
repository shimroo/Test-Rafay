the uspta is now





scroll down








for nearly 100
years,
the united states professional tennis association (uspta) has been the leading
organization for
tennis
professionals. as racquet sports have evolved since our inception in 1927 our organization has also changed
to meet the diverse needs of those in the industry.












for the next 100
years,
the uspta will continue its journey as the racquet sports professionals association
(rspa). this transformation reflects our commitment to supporting professionals across all racquet sports,
recognizing the diverse and dynamic nature of our industry.















what this means for you
as the rspa, we're expanding our horizons to provide unparalleled career support
for
professionals in all
areas of racquet sports. here's what you can expect:

comprehensive career pathways: whether you're on the court or behind the scenes, we're here to guide you
    through every step of your career journey.
diverse certification programs: our certifications now cover a wider range of racquet sports, ensuring
    you're equipped for success in your chosen field.
expanded resources: access a wealth of knowledge, tools, and networking opportunities across the entire
    racquet sports industry.
innovation-driven education: stay ahead of the curve with cutting-edge training programs that blend
    traditional wisdom with modern techniques.








we've changed more than just our name
the transition to rspa is more than a rebranding – it's a recommitment to our
core
identity:

continuous improvement: we're dedicated to helping you grow and adapt in an ever-changing industry.
relational focus: building strong, supportive relationships within our community remains at the heart of
    what we do.
unity: we're bringing together professionals from all racquet sports under one inclusive umbrella.
leaving it all on the court: our passion for excellence drives everything we do, both on and off the
    court.








while there may be easier paths to certification, the rspa offers something more
valuable – a lifelong partnership in your professional journey. we believe that the future of racquet sports
requires more than just technical skills. it demands a holistic understanding of the industry, adaptability,
and a commitment to service.
join us as we embark on this exciting new chapter. together, we'll shape the future of
racquet sports, support each other's growth, and continue to share our love for the games that bring us
together.
welcome to the rspa – where you can turn your passion into a pursuit. 




new website coming soon
we're excited to announce
that a
brand-new rspa website is currently under construction. this new digital home will reflect our expanded
mission and provide enhanced resources for all racquet sports professionals. while we put the finishing
touches on our new site, this page will serve as an information hub for our transition from uspta to rspa.
stay tuned for the launch of our comprehensive rspa website, where you'll find even more tools, resources,
and opportunities to support your career in racquet sports.
