we would highly recommend imagemaker360 to anyone who wants to set themselves apart. don't miss using their narrated virtual tours! they are phenomenal! we have been using the professional services of imagemaker 360 for the past few years and would recommend them to anyone who wants to showcase their listings with photos that will engage potential buyers right away!

the photos are professionally taken and we appreciate how the photographers are careful with attention to those little details â such as lighting, best angles, placement of curtains, pillows, etc. which helps to promote our listings in the best possible way.

the other feature that we absolutely love is the narrated virtual tours. this feature allows us to showcase the special features of our listings that we want to be sure we highlight - especially any of those unseen features you donât want a buyer to miss, the propertyâs location, nearby amenities etc. and they write the script for us!

the script is always completed very quickly and then narrated by a professional announcer as the tour goes through all the rooms of the home.

we have been told many times by both buyers and sellers that they feel this feature adds a whole new dimension to virtual tours. buyers seem to warm up to being able to really "tour the home" with this personal touch. silent tours are like silent movies â the narration makes it so much more interesting!

we always use the narrated virtual tours option and in fact show a demo at listing presentations. on a recent listing presentation our client felt this service set us apart from the other two agents he called in. we ended up getting the listing!!

we would highly recommend imagemaker360 to anyone who wants to set themselves apart. don't miss using their narrated virtual tours! they are phenomenal!

thank you so much for the incredible job that you did on my virtual tour.  the narration product was amazing and the process could not have been easier.your script writer and announcer did an incredible job creating the script using just a few notes that i provided.  everything was very professional looking and sounding. we received 10 offers on the home and i have no doubt that this was in part to the incredible virtual tour that you did.  i look forward to selling many more homes using your tours as part of my marketing plan.

last month, i received two prestigious properties to list in toronto worth over $2.4m.  i researched the local virtual tours being used and i decided to contact your office, as you add more class and uniqueness. imagemaker360 arranged floor plans(online and hardcopy), a great photographer, a domain name(address of property), a webpage, image and virtual tours with script and male narration.  on completion, all times lines were met, results were all of top quality and my clients were very very impressed along with other real estate agents who came to our open houses.

how it works - tour hosting for virtual tour providers
imagemaker360 does not charge a monthly fee, start up fee or a tour volume penalty. you simply pay for the tours when you need one. 
when you become an imagemaker360 provider, you can choose to pay a fee per tour and charge your clients directly. alternatively, imagemaker360 can bill your clients for your full package cost and send you your portion.
our imagemaker360 providers have an account set up in our system where they can manage their client's tours, upload images and place new orders. our imagemaker360 staff review each tour to give customized movements to the images and then create a video version of each tour.  your client will then receive a completed tour link and a link to a tour management center where they can take advantage of all of the features imagemaker360 has to offer!
imagemaker360 has live customer service staff to assist your clients with their tours and management center, as well as support for you as a provider!
if you require more information, please call us at 1-800-852-2871.
