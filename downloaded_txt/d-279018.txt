the first lesson in vaping
october 11, 2021october 10, 2021
 

if you are shopping for e-liquid, undoubtedly you are looking for one that will give you a rich, full flavor vapor. but did you know if your e-liquid is improperly prepared you end up with an e-juice that is not only tasteless but may not have accurate levels of nicotine and could actually damage your vape device?
some online vendors buy inexpensive, pre-flavored liquid in bulk and try to dilute it to the various nicotine strengths. the problem with this is the flavor of your e-liquid is also diluted during this process. the seller may save a few bucks, but you end up paying the price.
the only way to prepare a true, quality e-juice is to take the preparation process very seriously. first, you start with the purest pharmaceutical grade glycol/nicotine bases and 100% natural flavoring extracts and essential oils. these ingredients may cost a little more, but the final product is well worth it.
next, you use strict quality control during mixing and measuring the pure glycol/nicotine liquid. this step is critical to ensuring accurate and consistent levels of nicotine in your e liquid. you do not want a liquid labeled 36mg of nicotine having only 10mg.
it is only after you have made the nicotine strength you need that you add your flavoring. this guarantees a full flavored, full strength e-liquid that will give you the amazing tasting vapor you love.
using the finest glycol/nicotine base, all-natural flavoring and precise production techniques is the only way to get a true premium quality e liquid.
this requires expertise and you can not make it at home on your own, the way expert does. you may get the thing after practice for couple of weeks but to do that, you need to start with quality premixed vape juice. this will make you understand, how it should taste, and you will get a benchmark. the best way to setup quality standard benchmark will be to compare with eliquid depot brand. you should check out their website at eliquid-depot.com.
buying your first vape device
technology is advancing daily at an incredible rate. these advances have made our lives more efficient, saved us money and also improved our health. nothing could be a better example of this than the groundbreaking technology of vaping.
the vaping happens through a device which appears on the surface identical to regular cigarettes but in actuality contains a micro electronic control system that delivers a precise amount of nicotine to the user. the best part is that there is absolutely no smoke given off by the vape juice making it a much healthier alternative to smoking tobacco.
when you buy vape device, they come in 2 basic styles: the pcc (personal charging case) and the standard starter kit. both have advantages so here we will discuss at the online vape shop  eliquid-depot.com what makes them each unique.
the vaping kit is exactly what it sounds like. it will contain everything you need to get started vaping with the vape juice. starter kits from different manufacturers will contain different accessories but the most common pieces included are the mod pod kits, charger and vape juice. upper end kits may also contain car chargers, usb chargers, extra batteries and extra e-liquid.
