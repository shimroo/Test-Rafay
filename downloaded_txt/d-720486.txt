east cooper mobile massage 
brings massage 
to clients around the mount pleasant region of south carolina. serving homes, resorts, and businesses since 1999. why ruin a great massage by having to drive in the heavy traffic. wouldn't it be great to roll off the table and take a warm bath, or sit in your jacuzzi? this is possible by having the massage in the comfort and privacy of your own home. we bring the table, music, linens, and oils, giving you a massage that is nurturing and focused on your needs. our licensed therapists' primary concern is your comfort and privacy. get an in-home massage. you deserve it!  if you prefer, i do have an office available in mount pleasant for in-call sessions.
