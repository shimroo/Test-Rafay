when we receive them. unlike many refurbished laptop retailers we spend a lot of time and money refurbishing the laptops ourselves to improve their appearance and condition. these are examples of the work we do to improve the quality of our laptops:replace heavily scratched and dented lids, palm rests (keyboard surround) and bases with new or resprayed partsreplace pcmcia units with broken buttonsreplace broken catches and switchesreplace or cover worn keyboard capsreplace batteries which do not hold at at least one hour's charge (usually with new batteries)we make great efforts to describe the condition of our laptops accurately so you know exactly what to expect and are not disappointed. if we have inaccurately described any of our laptops we will be happy to exchange it for a different laptop. we want you to be satisfied with your purchase. before you buy from any other supplier check their descriptions and see it they are as detailed (and honest) as ours!grade aa  laptop with this grading will be in very good condition for it's age but more specifically the various components will be as described below:screenno scratches, chips or scuff marks on glass. it has no dead pixels and the picture does not have 'screen burn'. the screen has the correct level of contrast and brightness consistent with its age. it does not have an unusually large number of light or dark patches which affect the picture quality.casethere are no cracks in the outer case, screen, keyboard or drive surrounds (apart from some minor hairline cracks which are barely noticeable). all the coating on the case eg. rubber, silver is present apart from very minor scratches. there are no security badges or remnants of security badges on the outer casing, keyboard or screen surround.there may be scuff marks or minor scratches on the outer casing which is normal for a used/refurbished laptop. there may be small dents on the lid.keyboardthis does not have excessive wear, for example, letters which are heavily worn and can hardly be recognised. it is normal for there to be some signs of wear on the keys eg. a "shiny surface".batterythe battery charges properly and holds at least 1 hour's charge during normal operation eg. typing or surfing the net not playing dvds/cds (unless stated otherwise in condition section). the battery will hold a full charge overnight.grade ba laptop
