testimonials





there are not a lot of materials that will withstand the impact of tennis or baseball size hail impacting at 80 plus mph like your permalatt products! your chemical bonding held.
centennial, co




a pergola cover was constructed for our tennis court rest area, but the condo board was advised there was insufficient shade from the midday sun here in hawaii. it was felt a lattice with small openings would provide shade for court users, while retaining the open concept the pergola provided. the 1” openings that permalatt products offers worked perfectly and will require no painting or routine maintenance except periodic cleaning. installation was done by our maintenance staff. they reported the permalatt was easier to cut, handle and install than traditional wood lattice.
waikoloa, hi



repairs were needed to all the traditional wood lattice courtyard doors and openings on the exterior walls at our 35-year-old condominium project on hawaii’s big island. in the past, use of wooden lattice required a lot of maintenance and very frequent repairs as it weathered and aged. the permalatt proved easier to work with than the previously used wooden lattice (cutting and sizing). as you can see, the color match was spot on. the installation was done by our maintenance staff. both shores staff and owners of the 10 courtyards that were updated are extremely pleased with the product and the look.
waikoloa, hi



from the minute (the permalatt rep) picked up the phone i was treated as if i ordered a million dollars worth of product.  their service and product exceeded all my expectations.
chicago, il



it is such a great product and really made this customers yard beautiful!  100% maintenance free!
piscataway, nj



our re-modeled deck is a retrofit of what was originally just a 20 year old standard wooden railing with diagonal wooden lattice. we were able to revise it with the vertical permalatt to a two tier structure which we are extremely happy with. it gives us a lot of privacy, but also a lot of visibility.  we have had numerous compliments on it.

very nice stuff.  the shipping costs are sometimes the deal breaker but glad i paid the price.
okatie, sc



thanks again for your assistance when i ordered from permalatt.  it was incredibly easy to work with and certainly seems like it will last for years to come.
east longmeadow, ma



finally the lattice is installed!  we love it!  it is so much better than products we have available in the northwest.  with our weather conditions cedar doesn’t seem to retain its looks after a while so we chose your lattice and azek decking along with the custom wall structure the lattice is installed in.  trust this will last at least our lifetime.
everett, wa



contractor donnie smith of fishkill, ny stated the lattice was easy to work with.  i personally like its detailed profile.  one can easily see it’s a quality product and i’m very happy with the outcome.
beacon, ny
