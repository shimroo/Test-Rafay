why? because "intelligence, or the

=================================================================
paset information: 
for the month of

january:


happy new year

repentance & forgiveness through the 
merits, mercy, grace & justice of jesus 
christ,
our lord and master, is the only "cancel culture" that is eternal in 
its nature, & 
does
not leave negative collateral damage in society, as a whole, past, present & 
future.

noah warned people that they must repent as

the world was filled with wickedness.
[research note:

scientific evidence for the many myths of the great flood, presented
 in ancient origins®, is biased in fact by lumping biblical texts in with 
mythology of the
various nations and ancient cultures throughout the world.
genesis - inspired 
version,
in chapter 8 and elsewhere, contradicts completely evolutionists, as natural 
selection
of species telescopes into a few thousand years for all actual surviving living 
creatures;
as the whole earth was convulsed within its ocean regions, voluminously 
regurgitating
water from great deep fountains, causing gradual global flooding & habitat 
extinction.
since only the one, worldwide noah related family unit remained, all the 
civilization
"myths" have been created within the posterity descent of their respective 
families.
scientific studies have noted past warmer conditions at respective poles. 
biblical
statements validate an initial "garden of eden" environment for the planet 
earth.
logically, and biblically, it suggests that the general one land mass habitat 
surface
of the earth was divided during the days of peleg, as so recorded in historical 
data;
that the initial formation of polar ice caps did not occur until it was an after 
effect
of the worldwide flood during the time of noah; as the earth had 40 days and 
nights
of perpetual rains upon its surface, including climate changes and shifting 
impacts,
as it relates to earth weight balance irregularities and real physical attrition 
during
ice formations and expansions; assisting in splitting the main united land 
formation
apart into its present continental divisions, like an orange irregularly from 
its ends.

happy birthday jesus christ (dear king of the jews) on 

06 april 
2025:
[robbie williams | happy birthday jesus (official 
audio) - youtube]
\***he 
that hath seen me hath seen the father***/

(statue of christ, by thorvaldsen, vor frue kirke, copenhagen)
jesus christ took upon himself the sins of 
all mankind, when he allowed his perfect
body to experience total emotional rejection and subsequent mortal physical 
death
[bleeding drops of blood in 
extreme mental anguish, 
in the garden of gethsemane].
rebuked: my soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here 
and watch.
jesus christ is king of the jews, the i 
am, messiah, king of zion & 
	

rock of heaven.
master, which is the great commandment in the law?  and jesus said unto 
him,
thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,

difficulty.
we are told in both the kjv and the jst that the man child is to rule all 
nations with
the rod of iron and that he will be caught up to the throne of god (see v. 5; 
jst v. 3).
the prophet joseph smith, jr. changed verse 8 in the kjv to read, "and the 
dragon
prevailed not against michael (adam), neither the child, nor the woman which was
the church of god (the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints), who had 
been
delivered of her pains, and brought forth the kingdom of our god and his christ"
(jst v. 7). 

zion. elder joseph fielding smith noted, in doctrines of salvation, 
v. 1,
page 229: "after christ comes, all the peoples of the earth will be subject to 
him,
but there will be multitudes of people on the face of the earth who will not be
members of the church (i.e., the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints; 
for
the law shall go forth of zion, and the word of the lord from jerusalem -

yet all will have to be obedient to the laws of the kingdom of god, for it will 
have
dominion upon the whole face of the earth. these people will be subject to the
political government, even though they are not members of the ecclesiastical
kingdom which is the church (the king, his lord and majesty jesus christ)."

"most importantly, the declaration, the constitution, and the bill of rights are 
based on
the idea that all people have certain fundamental rights that governments are 
created
to protect. those rights include common law rights, which come from british 
sources,
like the magna carta, or natural rights, which the founders believed, came from 
god.
the founders believed that natural rights are inherent in all people by virtue 
of their
being human and that certain of these rights are unalienable, meaning they 
cannot
be surrendered to government under any circumstances." thus, it can be said,

joseph smith translating genesis - byu studies
[research note: testimony of willard chase, manchester, ontario county, new 
york;
dated 1833, states "i became acquainted with the smith family, known as the 
authors
of the mormon bible, in the year 1820. . . . in the year 1822, i was engaged in 
digging
a well. i employed alvin and joseph smith to assist me; the latter of whom is 
now
known as the mormon prophet. after digging about twenty feet below the surface
of the earth, we discovered a singularly appearing stone, which excited my 
curiosity.
i brought it to the top of the well, and as we were examining it, joseph put it 
into his
hat, and then his face into the top of his hat. it has been said by smith, that 
he brought
the stone from the well . . . " 

seer stones implies their use by seers. so, the very unusual
significance of this commentary, along with the testimony of william purple, is 
location;
that "the stone was under the roots of a tree or shrub as large as his arm, 
situated
about a mile up a small stream that puts in on the south side of lake erie, not 
far
from the new york and pennsylvania line"; as well as "two small ones on the 
beach
in nauvoo . . . joseph said there is a stone for every person on the earth." we 
know
from the book of mormon that there was a complete conversion of the 


remnants left
in the americas, after the appearance of jesus christ. these people would 
certainly
have been entitled to individual seer stones, as well as righteous jaredites and 
later
righteous nephites and lamanites. nevertheless, much of the book of mormon data,
may be buried deeper in the ground, under large overgrowth, and many feet down.]

the sealing power -  the sealing power makes individual salvation
and family
exaltation universally available to the children of god. [research note: this 
elucidated
sealing power is inseparably connected with the 

church of the firstborn. 
celestial saints
of god dwell in the father's presence, become like him, and receive all things 
from him;
have part in the first resurrection and will reign with christ in the 
millennium; similar to
the saints who were residents of zion in the days of our great patriarchal 
father 

enoch.
see:

the joseph smith papers: "firstborn" search: 

doctrine and covenants 93; 
et cetera.


jesus christ 
presides over all the holy priesthood, after the order of the son of god; thus,
faithful saints will receive through jesus christ, the 

rights of 
inheritance of the 

firstborn,
with 

adam and eve, 
and all their sealed posterity, 
within the celestial

patriarchal order.


noah, who is angel gabriel, is next to adam in priesthood, or the 
patriarchal priesthood,
as he was the father of all living is his day, and to him was given the 
dominion. and thus,
for adam to retain his standing as head of the human family, under the lord 
jesus christ,
various keys of the priesthood held in this grand conference, in all 
dispensations of time,
by all successive church officer leaderships will be returned to adam, through 
said noah,
at adam-ondi-ahman. 
the 
prophet joseph smith, jr. 
actually saw men, before they had
ascended from the tomb, as though
they were getting up slowly. they took each other
by the hand and said
to
each other, "my father, my son, my mother, my daughter,
my brother, my sister." this would require a priesthood prerequisite of 
patriarchal
order, reestablished upon the earth, as in the days of noah, down to all offices 
of
the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints; before ushering in the 
millennium;
and in

the parable of the ten virgins, gathering faithful, wise, prepared virgins.

it is very obvious, upon introspection, that the original spelling of a-w-m-e-n, 
with an "e",
being changed to awman, and then later to ahman; it implies definitional feeling 
sense
of awe-man, or the delightful man; as ah, by definition and meaning expresses 
delight.
in other words awe, to the righteous: his glorious countenance gives a fullness 
of joy;
as joseph smith, jr. experienced a 

fullness of joy when he saw both father and son:
"my soul was filled with love and for many days i could rejoice with great joy 
and the lord
was with me" (1832). ergo, joseph had the holy ghost as his constant aid and 
companion.

alexander neibaur, journal, 24 may 1844, extract, page 23, notes joseph 
smith, jr. "saw
a fire towards heaven came near & nearer | saw a 
personage in the fire light complexion |
blue eyes a piece of white cloth drawn over | his 
shoulders his right arm bear after a wile |
a other person came to the side of the first |"

visions of the father and the son, in the newel k. whitney and co. store, in
kirtland, o., notes a sacred experience by 

zebedee coltrin: 
"a personage walked through
 the room from east to west, and joseph asked if we saw him. i saw him and 
suppose the
others did & joseph answered that is jesus, the son of god, our elder brother. 
afterward
joseph told us to resume our former position in prayer (kneeling, with our hands 
uplifted)
which we did. another person came through; he was surrounded as with a flame of 
fire .
. . the prophet joseph said this was the father of our lord jesus christ. i saw 
him" also,
john murdock stated: "i saw the form of a man, most lovely, the visage of his 
face was
sound and fair as the sun. his hair a bright silver grey, curled in most 
majestic form.
his eyes a keen penetrating blue, and the skin of his neck a most beautiful 
white
and he was covered from the neck to the feet with a loose garment, pure white,
whiter than any garment i have ever before seen. his countenance was most
penetrating, and yet most lovely. and while i was endeavoring to comprehend
the whole personage from head to feet it slipped from me, and the vision was
closed up. but it left on my mind the impression of love, for months, that i 
never
felt before to that degree" (john 
murdock journal, typescript, 

byu archives, 
page 13.)
the

firsthand nephite witnesses of christ had similar profound experiences of 
great joy
and rejoicing; and it seems self evident, after joseph smith, jr., received a 
complete
forgiveness of all of his sins, that part of the many other things that jesus 
christ did say
to joseph smith, jr., during his first vision, was the savior's invitation to 
joseph, to feel
the wounds in the body of the messiah; and being embraced fully by his personal 
love.

urim and thummim: lights and perfection; and genealogy

[research note: in 

discourse, 7 april 1844, as published in times and 
seasons, page 613,
joseph smith, jr. stated: "i do not calculate to please your ears with 
superfluity of words
or of oratory, or with much learning; but i calculate to edify you with the 
simple truths
from heaven. in the first place, i wish to go back to the beginning of creation; 
there is
the starting point, in order to be fully acquainted with the mind, purposes, 
decrees, &c.
of the great eloheim, that sits in yonder heavens, it is necessary for us to 
have an
understanding of god himself in the beginning. if we start right, it is easy to 
go right
all the time; but if we start wrong, it is a hard matter to get right." family 
genealogy
and history begins on this earth with adam; his book of remembrance descent 
records.

discourse, between circa 26 june and circa 4 august 1839a, by willard richards, 
p. 63,
notes: the priesthood was first given to adam (by the laying on of hands): he 
obtained
to the first presidency & held the keys of it, from generation to generation; he 
obtained
it in the creation before the world was formed . . . he had dominion given him 
over every
living creature. he is michael, the archangel, spoken of in the scriptures, -- 
then to noah
who is gabriel, he stands next in authority to adam in the priesthood; he was 
called of god
to this office & was the father of all living in his day, & to him was given the 
dominion.

book of abraham facsimiles/facsimile 2 - fair notes, concerning (figure 3), 
that it is
made to represent god, sitting upon his throne, clothed with power and 
authority; with
a crown of eternal light upon his head, representing also the grand key words of 
the holy
priesthood, as revealed to adam in the garden of eden, as also to seth, noah, 
(shem), or
melchizedek, abraham (lineage line), and all to to whom the priesthood was 
revealed.

adam (teachings of joseph smith) 
notes: adam delivers up his stewardship to christ,
that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe, but retains 
his
standing as head of the human family . . . (father and patriarch of the human 
race). . . .
(our lord and master jesus) christ is the great high priest. adam next . . . i 
saw adam
. . . the keys of the first presidency, grand key words of the holy priesthood, 
keys of
the universe, are all interconnected with government; such as: the sun, and to 
borrow
its light from kolob through the medium of kae-e-vanrash, which is the grand 
key, or,
in other words, the governing power. note kolob governs all those planets which 
belong
to the same order as the earth, upon which abraham stood. since this earth was 
formed
to become a celestial residence for the father and son to visit, it is self 
evident therefore
that other star planets exist to govern other terrestrial and telestial 
planetary systems.


light, or the 
light of christ, is the physical grand governing key of the universe, for it is
the light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the 
law by which
all things are governed; the same light that stimulates all human / life thought 
processes;
whereas the holy ghost adds additional external intelligence from the throne of 
god.
this corresponds to 

an eye single to the glory of god. 
in other words, 

d &c 88: 67-68:
"and if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with 
light, and
there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light 
comprehendeth
all things. therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to god, 
and the
days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and 
it shall be
in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will." the all 
seeing eye,
as in the 
eye of providence 
(the eye of 
providence: a journey into masonic symbolism).

mentions that kolob has measurement according to celestial time; which, 
celestial time,
signifies one day to a cubit. one day, in kolob, is equal to a thousand years, 
according
to the measurement of this earth, which is called by the egyptians jah-oh-eh. 
the cubit,

grammar and alphabet of the egyptian language, circa julycirca november 1835, 
p. 32,
is mentioned 17 times. under [p. 31], of the 2nd part of the 2d degree, flos 
isis is listed as
the king of day or the central moving planet, from which the other governing 
moving
planets receive their light. -- having a less motion -- slow in its motion -- 
the earth's chief
joy. . . . kliflosisis . . . hereditary, coming down from father to son: right 
of authority from
eight days old: according to the law of priesthood. then, mention of 
vehkliflosisis as the
same fixed star <planet> in its <motion> according to the cubit measurement of 
time.
four cubits: (that is from <the length> the end of the longest finger to the end 
of the other
when the arms are extended: making in our measure seven feet, {the same as 84 
inches},
which is twenty=one inches to a 
cubit.); 
for the physical dimensions of ancient patriarchs;
as zebedee 
coltrin (wikipedia),


testifying 
when he was a patriarch in the church: "adam
was a large broad-shouldered man, and eve, as a woman, was as large in 
proportion."
validated as well by early descriptions of the urim and thummim, had in the 
possession
of the prophet joseph smith, jr.; namely, "eyeglasses . . . longer apart between 
the stones
than we usually find in spectacles"; breastplate was much too large for joseph 
smith, jr.;
that the breastplate extended from the neck downwards of a man of extraordinary 
size.
thus, numbers become of interest, as in 15, for 12 apostles and 3 in the first 
presidency;
correlated to governmental priesthood star system powers; or, unity in 
leadership 
hands,
as in ten fingers times ten fingers times ten fingers = 1000 yrs; celestial kolob 
time of a day.
profoundly, it appears that the body of jesus christ provides actual 
measurements for all
the observed universe:

all things denote there is a god: seeing christ in the creation.
or, as noted in the

book of abraham and facsimiles, 1 march16 may 1842, page 719,
thus i, 
		
abraham, talked with the lord, face to face, as one man talketh with 
another;
and he told me of the works which his hands had made; and he said unto me, my 
son,
my son, and his hand was stretched out, behold i will shew you all these 
(abraham was
unrestricted in his view of the universe; not as the prophet moses was to the 
planet earth).
and he put his hand upon mine eyes (his hand was large), and i saw those things, 
which
his hands had made (his body was / is an eternal memory storage facility of all 
his works),
which were many; and they multiplied before mine eyes (a zoom platform, 
delivering
limitless human connections, temporally and spiritually), and i could not see 
the end
thereof; and he said unto me this is shinehah, (which is the sun.) and he said 
unto me,
kokob, which is star (adamic word formations). note in facsimile no. 2, from the 
book
of abraham, that 

figure #5 ", 
an upside down bull that is a strong, muscular, mature
male cow, (which cannot be evaluated properly, unless the facsimile is 

rotated around,
like a rubik's cube), 
"is called in egyptian enish-go-on-dosh; this is one of the 

governing
planets also, and is said by the egyptians to be the sun (as noted above as 
shinehah) . . ."
strange as it may appear, the validity of joseph smith, jr., as a modern 
prophet, seer,
revelator, and translator, comes from the intense controversy from non lds 
(mormon)
egyptologists, beginning in the late 19th century, that disagree with joseph 
smith, jr.,
in his interpretations of the facsimiles in the book of abraham; also asserting 
that some
portions of the papyri have been reconstructed incorrectly. wikipedia mentions 
ham's
descendants are interpreted by josephus and others as having populated africa, 
as well
as adjoining parts of asia. the bible refers to egypt as 'the land of ham' in 
psalm 78:51;
105:23, 27; 106:22, and 1 chronicles 4:40. 

the pearl of great price (1913) / abraham does
mention: "now, pharaoh being of that lineage by which he could not have the 
right of
priesthood, notwithstanding the pharaohs would fain claim it from noah, through 
ham,
therefore my father (terah, father of abraham) was led away by their idolatry." 
in other
words, the pure priesthood of the ancients was distorted with animal symbolism 
as set
forth by the pharaohs; thus, the egyptologists read from the books containing 
idolatry
symbols; and, 

joseph smith, jr.
translated the unadulterated original abrahamic texts,
as discussed in

teaching the book of abraham facsimiles | religious studies center, etc.
what is lost in the weeds of counter evaluations, in facsimile no. 3, as fig. 
l., is abraham
sitting upon pharaoh's throne, by the politeness of the king, with a crown upon 
his head,
representing the priesthood, as emblematical of the grand presidency in heaven; 
with
the scepter of justice and judgment in his hand; whereas fig. 2 is king pharaoh, 
and also
fig. 4. is prince of pharaoh, king of egypt; female attire: showing no 
priesthood authority;
also, that the representation is from greatest to least in authority, as the god 
of abraham:
"i dwell in the midst of them all; i now, therefore, have come down unto thee to 
declare
unto thee the works which my hands have made, wherein my wisdom excelleth them 
all,
for i rule in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath, in all wisdom and 
prudence,
over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen from the beginning; i came down 
in the
beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen." parallels 
job 
38 kjv : then
the lord answered job out of the whirlwind, and said, who is this that darkeneth 
counsel
by words without knowledge? gird up now thy loins like a man, for i will demand 
of thee,
and answer thou me. where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth? 
declare,
if thou hast understanding. who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? 
or who
hath stretched the line upon it? whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? 
or who
laid the corner stone thereof; when the morning stars (daughters of god) sang 
together,
and all the sons of god shouted for joy? . . . abraham is reasoning upon the 
principles
of astronomy, in the king's court, and all these manifestations do contradict 
completely,
modern uninspired false universe descriptions found in scientific 

physical cosmology;
especially in the presentation of 
dark matter
from 

big bang nucleosynthesis, 
as well as
incorrectly stating 
dark energy 
is the dominant component of the god created universe.
in 

facsimile 2, 
mention is made concerning fig. 8 through figures 21, noting that fig. 8
contains writings that cannot be revealed unto the world; but is to be had in 
the holy
temple of god. fig. 9. ought not to be revealed at the present time. fig. 10. 
also, fig. 11.
also. if the world can find out these numbers, so let it be. amen. figures 12, 
13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 will be given in the own due time of the lord. the above 
translation
is given as far as we have any right to give at the present time. what is yet to 
be revealed
is stated in abraham 3: 10: "and it is given unto thee to know the set time of 
all the stars
that are set to give light, until thou come near unto the throne of god (ahman 
residence)."
further knowledge will come forth at 

the millennium 
time when satan has been bound.
immortal beings will frequently visit the earth and help with government and 
other work;
and there will be no death as currently experienced, as children will grow up 
without sin.
in an all seeing eye twinkling, mankind will achieve eternal unbroken 
spirit-body contact.
to fully understand the magnificence and glory of facsimile 2, in its universal 
revelation;
it is to comprehend the manifestations given as a great and glorious symphony 
orchestra,
playing in all its parts and musical scores, from individual words and 
interwoven feelings
of the beethoven's 9th, 
even unto the finale; the jubilant masterpiece end in "ode 
to joy".
paraphrasing: to try to translate the ancient words of god without passion is 
inexplicable.
true 
astronomy is 
based upon the glory of god.

moses 1: "the heavens, they are many, &
they cannot be numbered unto man, but they are numbered unto me, for they are 
mine.
and as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another 
come;
and there is no end to my works, neither to my words. for behold, this is my 
work and my
glory---to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." thus, 
facsimile 2. general
information, is only a temporary, temporal connectivity to the throne of god; as 
all planets
destined for immortal glory, process through their telestial, terrestrial, and 
celestial states
of being. 

facsimiles 23; abraham 45, 
represents only a snapshot in planetary earth time.
a 

cosmic distance ladder 
cannot measure 
star basics 
of 

extragalactic astronomy; nor see
a "planet earth" transcending into a very new location in a glorified celestial 
star system.
stellar nurseries originate from the creation of an earth initially given a 
"garden of eden".
it is therefore totally impossible for human 
minds to 

comprehend or

imagine the universe!
again, god says, "the heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto 
man".

using record sources known to have originated from a civilization, or 
civilizations having
temporal blessings, but without the authority of the fullness of the patriarchal 
priesthood.

the purpose and function of the egyptian hypocephalus was not to promote 
melchizedek
priesthood objectives, but to establish the harsh rule of pharaohs over their 
own people.
faith in the lord jesus christ was transformed into the 

scarab, in 
the form of the dung

beetle, 
associated with the divine manifestation of the early morning sun. a rising sun 
in
egyptian religion, was an amulet conveying life and resurrection to its wearer; 
as found
near a mummy, providing the dead person with 

false assurance 
of afterlife resurrection.
transposing secular egyptian traditions onto facsimile 2, creates 

a mass of confusion.
(president david o. mckay said that brigham young university "was established 
for the
sole purpose of associating with facts of science, art, literature, and 
philosophy the truths
of the gospel of jesus christ.") and in like manner, facsimile 2 cannot be 
translated into
its original meaning, unless and until the symbols are directly connected to 
jesus christ,
as well as the stated fact of given records reviewed were timeline written by 
abraham, etc.
comprehensively, the powers of the priesthood include the keys of the universe, 
which
involve creative powers that can be adjusted over time, such as shown by the 
heavens
and earth being altered by such holy leaders, as moses, elijah, enoch, etc. 
jesus christ
did say: "if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this 
mountain
remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be 
impossible
unto you." 

joshua commanding the sun to stand still upon gibeon 
had this faith key.

further careful consideration should be given, as to what relationship exists, 
between
the sumerian sexagesimal, or base 60 numerical system, with sixty as its base, 
for use
in measuring time, angles, and geographical coordinates. the sumerian 
mathematics
were grounded in a sexagesimal system, or base 60, which could be very 
conveniently
counted using the twelve knuckles on one hand and the five fingers on the other 
hand.

surveying the galaxy | galaxy map 
notes items of great interest. . . . same technique is
used by many animals to build a three dimensional view of their surroundings. 
animals
with two forward facing eyes such as apes and owls can use a similar technique 
to build
a three-dimensional model of their immediate environment. this suggests: "this 
planet
receives its power through the medium of kli-flos-is-es, or hah-ko-kau-beam, the 
stars
represented by numbers 22, and 23, receiving light from the revolutions of 
kolob."; that,
this portion of facsimile 2, relates to a measurement in the shift in the 
apparent direction
of an object (kolob) from two different positions. this shift (measured as a 
angle) is called
a parallax. . . . astronomical parallax . . . to define the parsec, the basic 
unit of distance
beyond our solar system. a parsec is the distance of an object with a parallax 
of one arc-
second (that is a 60th of a 60th of a degree) when using the radius of the 
earth's orbit as
a baseline. the nearest star has a distance of 1.3 parsecs and the centre of the 
galaxy
has a distance of about 8000 parsecs. this combines sumerian sexagesimal with 
kolob.

in which direction does the sun move through the milky way? it includes the 
additional
items: "with respect to its own axis of rotation, the sun is moving through the 
galaxy
tipped at an angle of about 60 (degrees) from the galactic plane. this also 
applies to
the planets orbiting the sun -- just like the disk of our galaxy. . . . 
essentially, the sun
and the plane in which the bodies of the solar system orbit around it are both 
tilted
forward by 60 (degrees) as they move through the galaxy . . . the sun actually 
appears
to bob up and down through the disk (we are up right now, above the plane of the 
disk)
as it moves, with a period of about 60 million years"; combines sumerian 
sexagesimal.

instruction, 2 april 1843, as reported by william 
clayton [d&c 130], page 68, very clearly
indicate that facsimile 2 is kolob centric. in answer to a question which i 
proposed to him
as follows, "is not the reckoning of gods time, angels time, prophets time & 
mans time
according to the planet on which they reside he answered yes  but there is 
no angel (who)
ministers to this earth only what either does belong or has belonged to this 
earth  and
the angels do not reside on a planet like our earth but they dwell with god and 
the planet
where he dwells is like crystal, and like a sea of glass before the throne. this 
is the great
urim & thummim whereon all things are manifest both things past, present & 
future and
are continually before the lord. the urim & thummim is a small representation of 
this
globe. the earth when it is purified will be made like unto crystal and will be 
a urim &
thummim whereby all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom, or all kingdoms of 
a lower
order will be manifest to those who dwell on it. and this earth will be with 
christ  then
the white stone mentioned in rev. c 2 v 17 is the urim & thummim whereby all 
things
pertaining to an higher order of kingdoms even all kingdoms will be made known 
and
a white stone is given to each of those who come into the celestial kingdom, 
whereon
is a new name [p. 69] written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it. 
the new
name is the key word. it is self evident that kolob is a celestial kingdom. flos 
isis is listed
as
the king of day or the central moving planet, from which the other governing 
moving
planets receive their light. -- having a less motion -- slow in its motion -- 
the earth's chief
joy; it follows that it is the very throne of god ahman; (and center to kolob), 
whose light is
modulated to avoid overwhelming other creations; appearing as a "black 
hole" 
from earth.
kolob also is like crystal, and like a sea of glass before the throne of god. 
this is one of
the great urim & thummim star planets whereon all things are manifest both 
things past,
present & future and are continually before the lord; as well as all other 
celestial residents;
those who individually have their own crystals to explore higher orders of 
intelligences.
facsimile 3 has abraham sitting upon 

pharaoh's throne 
with a crown upon his head, that
represents the priesthood; as emblematical of the grand presidency in heaven; 
whereas
facsimile 2, figure 3. is made to represent god, sitting upon his throne (which 
looks in its
construction to be the same as
pharaoh's throne), 
clothed with power and authority; with
a crown of eternal light upon his head; representing also, the grand key words 
of the holy
priesthood; showing thereby, by picture form, eternal priesthood government 
progression.
collected works of 
hugh nibley, one eternal round (lectures 
| the interpreter foundation)
what is the grand key word to understand the interpretation of facsimile 2, in 
connection
with the collected works of hugh nibley? it is the word of egyptian religious 
apostasy.
all the tremendous data sets noted in the

book of abraham facsimile 2, in comparison,
do compound the translation process, into a mass of confusion. thus, mentally 
reference
the grand apostasy from the true church of jesus christ, established in his 
short lifetime.
the egyptian nation began in an apostate condition, having lost through ham, 
patriarchal
attachment priesthood, with his ancient fathers. within the context of the many 
factions,
there are a series of changes in extant facsimile over time, that 

parrot regional frictions;
which brings up the issue 
of 
animals
talking: garden of eden 

serpent; 

balaam 
and his ass.
add to this, the millions of hindus who revere and worship cows, which raises 
the status
of mother to the level of goddess. lord 

krishna (avatar 
of hindu sun god 
vishnu*); a 
friend
and protector of cows. the hindu scriptures mention the 

cow goddess 
named 

kamadhenu
as having emerged from the churning of the cosmic ocean: direct astronomy 
connections.
yet, a cow being female in nature, negates conveying priesthood authority or 
grand keys;
(this cow of heaven is the prehistoric male of the celestial bull); female 
identity juxtaposed,
like 
excessive 
veneration of 
mary, mother of jesus, first-century jewish woman of nazareth.
(a taking up, or assumption of the virgin mary, contradicts the atonement of 
jesus christ;
as a self initiated, independent act, which parallels the false egyptian 
theology: that 

thoth

isis, a 
female deity, with the secret word formula she needed to resurrect 

osiris.
set {deity}, which is an 
actual distorted representation of the patriarchal priesthood of
seth,
son of adam, the first man, whose descent through noah was administered to 
melchizedek,
or shem, the brother of ham. shem being vilified by ham, {whose posterity 
thereafter laid
claim to shem's right / authority}; included a false power of resurrection by 
egyptian gods.
in 

antiquities of the jews, 
josephus refers to seth as 
virtuous and of excellent character, &
reports that his descendants invented the wisdom of the heavenly bodes, {i.e., 
received the
revelations from god the eternal father, through his only begotten son jehovah, 
or jesus}
and built the "pillars of the sons of seth"; two pillars inscribed with many of 
their scientific
discoveries & inventions, most notably of which their astronomical findings {methuselah}.
seth in  

zohar 
referred as "ancestor of all the generations of the egyptians or tsetsaudim".)
this is clearly noted in collected works of hugh nibley, section reading the 

hypocephalus;
part 2, figures 5-21, notes figure 3 is "god sitting upon his throne," visibly 
moving through
the heavens, of which the sun is the (male) similitude; as, fig. 5. said by the 
egyptians to be
the sun, . . . as also floeese or the moon, the earth and the sun in their 
annual revolutions.
then we have the egyptian god ptah 
/ pth, compared with biblical
phut / put / 
phthouth.
ptah is embodied in the sacred bull, 

apis (deity) 
that represents 
egyptus 
pharaoh offspring;
thus note carefully p of gp pre-publication  manuscripts: elder
egyptus shown as

zeptah.
in egyptian 

hieroglyphics "z" symbolized as a door bolt; that used in the 
egyptian religion
to secure false doors which were believed to allow a deceased's spirit to move 
between
the afterlife and the living world; door bolt of two eyes: 

horus udjat 
eye and sun 
eye of ra,
(sacred doors of devotion & meditation as used to pass through into the presence 
of god);
an independent goddess (female) representation of the disk of the sun, acting as 
a mother.
(ptah; as naked dwarf and 
deformed: matches 
vamana | vishnu* avatar, dwarf incarnation.)
notes: 
zodiac balance sign of justice: 

libra (constellation) 
is in fig. 16 & 17;  facsimile 2;
in combination with the three additional drawings that are also duplicated in 
both frames.
twelve constellations, as astrological signs, in which the outcome of an event, 
like a birth,
are affected by the zodiacal positions of sun, moon, and planets, is 
evolutionary astronomy.
this is directly contradicted by the inspired commentary in
kirtland 
egyptian papers, seen
from a professional genealogical research standpoint.
hugh winder nibley put 
the prophet,
seer, revelator, & translator, joseph smith, jr., in a very unprofessional 
light, suggesting:
that the grammar was "of no practical value whatever"; or, expanding on jay 
todd's false
argument, suggesting that the alphabet and grammar materials were largely an 
uninspired
production of joseph smith's scribes, which is denial of all real content 
contained therein.
when the prophet joseph said about fig. 8, contains writings that cannot be 
revealed unto
the world, but is to be had in the holy temple of god; it clearly means that 
joseph knew
all things pertaining to the endowment and all ordinances related thereto. and 
additionally,
when the prophet joseph said, beginning with fig 9., and repeated on through 
fig. 21, that
information ought not to be revealed at the present time . . . also . . . if the 
world can find
out these numbers, so let it be. amen. . . . will be given in the own due time 
of the lord; it
is exceedingly self evident that the said prophet joseph smith, jr., did himself 
well know
what should then not be presently revealed; as well as, since abraham and 
methuselah did
know concerning the planet kolob (being seers themselves); so was it revealed to 
joseph;
as also it was forbidden to reveal the location of the city of enoch taken up 
unto heaven.

there is no indication in this record source that the full sense of the writers 
was conveyed.
the record itself adds the following to the scriptures, in a very haphazard 
manner; namely,
that man's first place of residence here upon the 
earth was a place of happiness, of purity,
holiness & rest; that first man adam was the father 
of fathers; that our abraham was father
of many nations, a prince of peace, & one who kept the commandments of god; a 
patriarch,
rightful heir, a high priest; that ah lish is the 
first being --- supreme intelligence, supreme
power supreme glory, supreme justice, supreme mercy, without beginning of life 
or end of
life, comprehending all things, seeing all things, the invisible and eternal 
godhead; (that
this statement itself contradicts and invalidates the big bang 
origination of the universe);
that the first man, or adam, had the keys or right 
over patriarchal rights by ordination; that
adam had the largest reign, dominion, 
possession, power; a king with universal dominion
over all the earth; that the tradition of embalming 
was initiated by ham and his posterity;
that the open warfare in the egyptian gods and the loss of an eye mimic 
the transgression
of ham in having kingly blessings and the posterity of shem having the 
priestly blessings;
that egyptians believed that death, or going down into the grave was 
misery and hell; that
patriarchal priesthood provided opportunity to become sanctified and see 
the face of god;
that the first blessings of men were part of the

as there appears to be a direct correlation between facsimile 2, and figures 5, 
6, and 7;
with fig. 6. represents this earth in its four quarters; and, the

revelation chapter 7:1- kjv:
and after these things, i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the

the sea,
nor on any tree.

(research note: wind is the movement of air caused by the sun's uneven heating 
of the
earth's surface and the earth's rotation. this implies immediate cessation of 
earth orbital
rotation, and neutral pressure gradient upon the whole surface of an immobilized 
world;
including additional cessation of moon orbit and rotation to stop all sea tidal 
movements,
completely shutting down

resources;
as well as cause intense 
air stagnation atmospheric pollution, and a lack of precipitation

physical senses, like visual sight, smell,
sound, taste, touch, balance, the extended body awareness, and internal body

(that according to 
digital 
giza | ancient egyptian writing, the base set of hieroglyphic signs
totals around 750, with variations on them that numbers into the thousands. 
hieroglyphs
are not "letters" in the same sense as the english alphabet. individual 
hieroglyphic signs
do not necessarily correspond to the sound of one modern letter {though a small 
number
of them do}. some characters are equivalent to two, three, even more letters and 
sounds --
& some have no sound at all, but instead visually help to classify the meaning 
of a word.
an ai overview of the latter-day saint {lds} understanding of ancient egyptian 
language
"character degrees" suggest different levels of meaning associated with each 
hieroglyphic
symbol, often categorized into five degrees, with each degree representing a 
deeper or
more spiritual interpretation of the symbol; going back to, or descending from 
first father
adam and his book of remembrance; encompassing all the various degrees of 
salvation,
{for transmission of light and knowledge unto all of his posterity who obtain 
preservation
in three degrees of the celestial kingdom; or, the terrestrial 4th & telestial 
5th degrees};

eternal father (ahman) and jesus
the christ, by the power of the voice of the holy ghost, as linchpin of all 
communications;
that having been united; being united that which will be united, one 
glory above all other
glories, as the sun excels the moon in light, this glory excels being filled; 
with the same
glory equality so as to see and behold the face of god; the sun as a male 
celestial bull;
that the earth, jah-oh-eh, is under the tripartite 
influences from the governing powers of
oliblish, enish go on dosh, and kai-e-van rash; which are the grand key or in 
other words,
the governing power which governs the fifteen fixed stars; meaning that the sun 
transmits
the glory from god via kolob by multidirectional influences to the receiving 
earth & moon;
as earth transitions from first, creation; to telestial, terrestrial and final 
celestial exaltation;
that kli flosisis signifies kolob in its motion, 
that is swifter than the rest of the twelve stars;
that alkabeth, angels in an unalterable and 
immortal state; men after they are raised from
the dead, and translated unalterable state; absolutely and with absolute 
certitude verifies

beings;
that the fifth high priest from adam validates the

sanctified state as it shall be in eternity; (that invalidates the false death 
of the universe.);
that hahdees, kingdom of wickedness, has power only 
in extent of its transitional duration;
that flo=ees the moon, boroweth light, is the 
lesser light, irrespective of its orbital motion;
that ahme=os= is god without beginning or end; 
that god presides in an infinite universe;
that dah tu hah dees, kingdom without glory, 
dominion of darkness, has degrees and parts;
that jah=oheh is the earth including its affinity 
with the other planets; with their governing
powers: which are fifteen: the earth, the sun, and the moon, first in their 
affinity; including
one power. flo ees is the moon in its affinity with the sun, & the earth. flos=isis 
is the king
of day: or central moving planet, from which those other governing moving 
planets receive
their light; whereas kliflosisis signifies time; then there is vehklifloisis, 
the fifth planet, or
fixed star in its motion; namely limdi, whose cubit measure motion is six days 
to one cubit;
that the lord is blessing joseph with power to 
reveal the mysteries of the kingdom of god;
to translate through the urim & thummim ancient records & hyeroglyphics . .
