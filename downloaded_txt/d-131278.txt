marketing tips






newspaper advertising – mistakes to avoid






our customers know that a lot goes into successful newspaper  advertising campaigns. creating a classified or display newspaper ad is not always  easy and sometimes not as successful as you might likeâ¦the first time around.  our âmarketing tipsâ offer easy,  practical ways to enhance your success with most any form of print advertising.

            this month we are offering some suggestions on what not to do when creating  your next newspaper ad. 





1) do not use an abstract  headline...  people canât relate to your ad if they donât  know what you are advertising. headlines are your first (and many times your  only) chance to make an impact. let readers now up front what you are  advertising and/or that your ad pertains to them.......click to learn more.
 







2) avoid text heavy display ads - letâs be honest, we canât all afford full color,  full page ads. that is the reality. if your budget only allows for a black and  white 4â x 4â ad then it is critically important to make use of that space. use  relevant images, graphics and logos to spice up your ad. text only display ads  are boring and tend to get lost in the paper.......click to learn more.





3) do not run one time - and expect your ad to perform at its best. newspaper  advertising is most effective when a good ad is combined with consistency.  running a small ad one time in your local newspaper is probably not going to  bring people in by the thousands. running your advertisements frequently to  build consumer confidence is a great way to enhance response......click to learn more.





4) do not only test one ad - different versions of your ads are going to generate  different results. budget permitting, try two or three versions of the same ad to decide which one  is going to bring in the most business. you may be surprised at how a little ad  change can bring big results......click to learn more.





5) do not leave out contact information - this sounds simple enough. however, we are not  just talking about throwing in a phone number. people want options. provide a  variety of contact information, ensuring that everyone has a comfortable way to  get in touch with you.....click to learn more.

newspaper advertising makes sense


newspaper  advertising works. for many products and services, newspaper advertising can  generate a high volume of inquiries. 

newspapers  still have the capability to reach thousands to millions of readers daily. many  advertisers take advantage of these huge audiences by placing ads regularly.

create better display ads


newspaper display advertising is a powerful way to advertise your product or service. combining a well designed display ad with the right statewide to nationwide exposure will produce results.

      newspaper display ads vary in   size, from as small as one square inch up to a full page. they run in just about   every section of the newspaper, generally according to the type of product or   service being advertised.
 
      display advertising is a great   way to get your message across to potential customers. with display ads, you can...to read the complete article, click here. 











classified ads vs. display ads


classifieds ads are comprised of text only. they are run in  their own section with other classified ads under topic specific headings, ie.  help wanted, business opportunity, real estate, etc.

display ads are larger ads run in just about every section  of the newspaper. these types of ads can utilize different fonts, characters,  graphics, etc. to help promote your product or service.

knowing the difference between classified and display ads is  half the battle. knowing which one is best for you can be a bit trickier...to read the complete article, click here.

stand out.


when running a display ad, make sure you stand out from the rest. to test your ad, cut it out (to its actual size), tape it over another ad of similar size in the paper and stand back, way back. does your ad stand out? if your ad blends in with the rest of the paper, perhaps you need to try a different design. take hints from the ads that attract your attention.
