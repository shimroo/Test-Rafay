we know museums 


museums are traditionally called temples of culture and art. for many hundreds of years museums have been “calling cards” not only of this or that city, but also of countries, because they preserve not just interesting “things”, but traditions of culture, evidence of the highest achievements of human creative genius. that is why, despite all the complexity of socio-economic development of the world community, museums are the most resilient institutions of civilization.


museums help to solve urgent problems and adapt to man in the new millennium. a visitor comes to a museum for new impressions, gets acquainted with the exhibitions and expositions that interest him or her, while resorting to the help of guides or participating in the interactive activities offered to him or her.



at the present stage museum activity is gaining more and more socio-cultural importance, the role of museums is increasing, and the purpose of a museum is changing. a museum is an institution that collects, studies, stores and exhibits items – monuments of natural history, material and spiritual culture, as well as educational and promotional activities. thus, the purpose of a museum is not only to store and exhibit information, historical and cultural monuments, but also to involve a museum visitor in the process of cognition, appeal to his inner world, influence on the sense-emotional sphere of a museum visitor. a new communicative approach was formed in museology, in which a visitor is viewed as a full-fledged participant of the communication process, rather than a passive recipient of knowledge and impressions, as it was in the traditional approach.



involving visitors in the interaction with exhibits is the main idea of the interactive museum, which has been very popular lately. the news museum in washington, for example, offers everyone to try their hand as a journalist, take a professional aptitude test, and have a competition with a friend on the subject of journalistic ethics (at the ethics center, questions that journalists face every day are displayed on interactive kiosks, and the visitors’ task is to answer them correctly). at the science museum in london, there is an interactive exhibition: “exploring the science of climate”. this project is an opportunity to experience climate change firsthand by traveling through different eras and geographical zones. through games, visitors discover the secrets of ice and stalagmites, and then are initiated into modern ideas of low-carbon living.




the interactive museum is a fabulous kaleidoscope of interesting experiments and discoveries, unforgettable positive emotions. the interactive museum is interesting for both individual and group visitors. parents and children also get bright and unforgettable impressions: every adult can plunge back into childhood and feel like a child, and children can try themselves in the role of scientists, researchers and discoverers. and examples abound.
