barrel designs is proud to present unique handmade tables, 
                  chairs, barstools, wine racks and other entertaining 
                  accessories, for your home, office, patio or business. our 
                  barrel stave furniture designs take on life and form from 
                  seasoned oak wine barrels and quality hardwoods.

                  each piece from our barrel stave collection is carefully 
                  finished to enhance and heighten its beautiful grain and to 
                  help protect the wood from becoming dry and brittle. 

                  the oak barrels are naturally hued from the wonderful wine 
                  once held. many have been toasted to impart the special 
                  flavors winemakers strive for in creating a distinctive 
                  vintage. this process creates a natural contrast in the oaks 
                  color and adds a compelling interest to the finished barrel 
                  designs furniture creation. 

                  we make every effort to preserve each barrels unique markings 
                  and original cooperage imprints, further adding to the 
                  interest and authenticity of each wine barrel design.







 



 
 




our goal is to recycle and transform as many of these romantic vessels as possible, making their beauty, comfort and warmth a special part of both your home and lifestyle.
                          cheers!
