alien harvest
a forced landing is a pilot’s worst nightmare.
the forced landing of an airliner, on the frigid wastes of antarctica, is
unimaginable. as winter draws its white cloak over the continent, rescue
becomes impossible; hope slips away, and the ice entombs its victims. years
pass, generations come and go: alien contact is made, and the world is subjugated.
now the future depends on one man.

quone-loc-sie
there comes a time when the last great war
is almost forgotten: a time when people grow and make what they need for
the simple lives they live. it is also a time of oppression; when overlords
are suspicious of the people, for now is the time foretold …in the
end devastation will be faced. "men will weep. women will perish. families
will be orphaned. ruin will reign. hope will be gone. death will give forth
life. out of the sun good will face evil in the un-winnable final battle.
evil will be ripped apart. good will be cast into pieces. the prophecy will
come to pass."

subterranean
there was an old manor house in the quiet english
village of houghton on the hill. it was torn down many years ago to reveal
a hidden stone cellar: in the cellar were two bricked up arches. no one
knew what was behind the bricks, until the child went missing.

poisoned ground
left alone the rainforest will quickly take back what has been taken
from it. nature will obliterate the marks of human hands beneath vine and
creeper… unless the legacy has so poisoned the soil it is beyond redemption.
then the wound may not heal. year may pass upon year; lifetimes may come
and go before the evil is purged from the ground, or until by fate someone
happens onto the scene. a person who unknowingly can cleanse the ground,
or unwillingly be corrupted with it.

curse of the first invaders





 
for 60,000 years the aboriginals were the masters of australia; but
two hundred and fifty years ago that changed when captain james cook stepped
ashore. cook wasn't the first to sight the australian continent: there had
been many others before from both europe and asia, but some say none of
these were the first and there is reason to believe that over a thousand
years ago there was the first invasion.

forever war
click here to view more books in the forever war series
there is a time far, far into the future where
all that has happened before is forgotten. a future where all people know
of is a century's long war that raged even before the systems were colonized.
some believe that having the knowledge of how it began can bring it to an
end, but changing the past has consequences that no one could have imagined.





 
the future can never escape from the past no
more than situations can remain the same. such too can be said of each and
every person, but you and i are not always who we seem to be, even to ourselves
let alone to a stranger. in some the secrets are even deeper, so deep that
even they are unaware of their place or of the course that fate has laid
out before them.
