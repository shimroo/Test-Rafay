 author(s):  alyssa essman, stephanie karhoff, cca, peggy hall, nic baumer

video of episode 144 – dealing with don

agronomy & farm management podcast episode 144 – dealing with don
there is nothing more frustrating than getting rejected at the elevator due to high vomitoxin (aka don) levels. don is produced by a fungi produced on the ear and is usually infected at the time of pollination. to give farmers a better perspective of what happens behind the scenes at a grain elevator, we interview 3 grain merchandisers on their process when don test levels start creeping up. jason beckman (poet (https://poet.com/grain) ), lisa mitchell (gerald grain (https://www.geraldgrain.com/) ), and seth miller (the anderson (https://www.andersonsinc.com/) ) take us behind the scenes of their operations to look at testing, grain flow and market impacts. we end with some quick reminders about don management and to check the c.o.r.n. newsletter (https://agcrops.osu.edu/newsletter/co...) for updates and research on corn fungicide and disease.
