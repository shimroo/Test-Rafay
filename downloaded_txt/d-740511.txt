“slatted venting” technology sports sunglasses
a classic wrap-around sports sunglass combined with our new “slatted venting” technology.
most companies cut holes in their lenses to allow for venting. 
unfortunately, this technique allows air, dust and debris directly into the eyes. our new venting bar has slatted vents which direct air away from the eyes and instead circulates air flow behind the lens to minimize fogging.

compact, lightweight tr-90 nylon frame with wrap-around lens design provides maximum coverage.
innovative “slatted venting” lens design channels air flow to minimize fogging. ergonomically designed arms for greater comfort. molded tpr arm tips for a soft comfortable fit.
tpr nose pad for greater comfort and impact protection.  
lenses are coated for anti-fog and anti-scratch resistance.
adjustable, washable retention head strap holds eye guards in place. micro fiber lens cleaning/protective storage pouch included.
