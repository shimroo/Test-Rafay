stem magnet pathway






 
the stem magnet pathway affords all learners an enhanced, stem-focused curriculum that aligns with the rapidly evolving individual, societal, and economic stem landscape. the student-centered curriculum of this pathway equips students with the stem mindset by nurturing inquiry (learning that aligns to natural student curiosities) and fostering the essential problem-solving skills necessary to participate in a dynamic world.
the stem pathway includes elementary, middle, and high school opportunities.
read more about this magnet pathway.























why center for innovation?






centennial campus center for innovation magnet middle school provides students with skills and dispositions to navigate an ever-changing world.  utilizing design thinking, students learn to empathize with others, solve problems and iterate solutions until finding success.

students grow through layering and building their capacity for each of nine characteristics of an innovator.  these characteristics propel students towards success for any future path.

 























magnet information







a howling hello from the red wolf community at centennial campus center for innovation magnet middle school!  we are thrilled you are interested in learning more about #ourden.  the magnet application window for the '25-'26 school year closed on thursday, january 23.  we're excited to learn who our new #centennovators will be when acceptances are announced on february 21.  if you applied to attend ccmms, please save the date for monday, march 3 from 8:00am to 9:00am so you can attend our magnet welcome event.  this event, held next door at the friday institute, is an opportunity for our newly accepted families to learn more about what to expect next school year as well as a chance to get to know other students joining #ourden.  we hope to see you there!
if you'd like further information about our school and our magnet theme, please contact our magnet coordinator, rachel hensey, at rfrasier@wcpss.net.
