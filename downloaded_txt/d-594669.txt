cft launches community schools training program

the cft has launched a training program following governor newsom’s extraordinary allocation of $2.8 billion to expand existing community schools and establish new ones.

according to cft president jeff freitas, “this is a national effort, and california now has the largest amount of funding in the nation for community schools. these funds will assist nearly 1,000 community schools in our state.”

the governor expanded the community schools partnership program in the state budget for 2021-22 by using one-time prop 98 monies. the funds can be used through 2028. the program is a grant-based and schools will have to apply for the funding. the cft is working to secure broad stakeholder committees in the regulations now being developed, including professional input from educators, staff, and their unions.

		i am union. though i have played leadership roles in my union organizations (aft and cwa upte-cwa) over the three+ decades i have been a member, i know that my most important role is that of rank and file member. i have known and been directly inspired and educated by union leaders like marty hittleman, jim araby, julien minard, greg eddy, jelger kalmijn, lindy cloud,  nicholas dix, gloria alvarado, fred glass, teferi gebre, sarah halverson-cano, joshua pechtalt, rico tamayo,  paul jordan, frank oppedisano, jessica ulstad, casey rose, rosemary lee, kenneth burt, grant miner,  susan solomon,  cathy campbell, kenny williams, laura rico , and so so many others. the thing these leaders did best was empower rank and file members to take control of our working conditions together. the rank and file members i’ve had the privilege of standing shoulder to shoulder with over the years are too many to count too, but i can name a few here… jeff qualey, sarah auwarter, betsy fisher, jaymi, kristin fredriksson, steve ed nelson, jean bain, sara ferguson steuart, dennis, joel, julie fricke oblouk, jenny, robyn reese, scott, jerry, anh, carlos, alma, george, kathe, kathryn, bethany, edie, sandy asper, nancy, mary, patrick, cynthia, jenn, jennifer, brian, todd, cherilyn, susan, cara boyd, dave brees, nick, gail, paula, jackie… too many to name. i’m pretty sure i’d be here all day trying to come up with them all. we know who we are! add your name if we’ve ever been in a union campaign of any sort!

                            our labor unions are not narrow, self-seeking groups. they have raised wages, shortened hours and provided supplemental benefits. through collective bargaining and grievance procedures, they have brought justice and democracy to the shop floor.

                                                            john f. kenned


                            
                            commit yourself to the noble struggle for human rights. you will make a greater person of yourself, a greater nation of your country and a finer world to live in.

                                                            martin luther king, jr.


                            
                            unions have been fighting the 1 percent vs 99 percent fight for more than 100 years. now the rest of us are learning that this fight is also our fight.

                                                            dave johnson


                            
                            there may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.


                                                            elie wiesel


                            
                            “education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.”

                                                            malcom x


                            
                            ““upon the subject of education … i can only say that i view it as the most important subject which we as a people may be engaged in.”


                                                            abraham lincoln


                            
                            there are vivid memories from my childhood - what we had to go through because of low wages and the conditions, basically because there was no union. i suppose, if i wanted to be fair, i could say that i'm trying to settle a personal score. i could dramatize it by saying that i want to bring social justice to farm workers.


                                                            caesar chavez


                            
                            "when i liberate myself, i liberate others. if you don't speak out ain't nobody going to speak out for you."
