writing on the web: a history

june 5, 2015 
writing on the web


i was thinking yesterday about the first time i noticed the web.  it was 1995 and yahoo! was still "jerry and david's guide to the world wide web." at the time i was a writer, and the internet struck me as the perfect way to talk to readers without all the fuss of contracts and editors, not to mention dead trees. it was clearly a better way to communicate.

where are all the women in web development?

may 25, 2015 
existence & stuff


so, lately i’ve been hearing a lot about the underrepresentation of women in stem fields, including my own field of web development. over the last few years it’s become something of a hot topic.  when the president’s council of advisors on science and technology predicts a shortfall of 1 million stem workers over the next decade, people tend to talk.

keeping up with the kids

may 25, 2015 
front-end smithery


having worked in web development for 19 years has its advantages, but there are plenty of disadvantages too.  gray hairs and wrinkles are a topic for another post.  i’m talking about all that useless knowledge (table layout, anyone?) you still carry around and how you can get stuck in your ways.  of course, by “you” i mean me.

friday afternoon video: the penny blossom web site

may 24, 2015 
friday afternoon video


yes, it's from season 2, but it's a classic.  and what is a blog without a clip about web design from the big bang theory?  one of my favorite scenes, obv.

best free image optimization apps for mac

may 24, 2015 
front-end smithery


images on the web can be a brilliant user experience enhancement.  or they can be a serious impediment to users trying to load your pages.  don’t frustrate your users with gigantic image files.  with just a couple of small, free apps for your mac, you can process images before adding them to a theme or uploading them to your site as content.

built with drupal 8: a front-ender's tale of danger and suspense

may 3, 2015 
drupal planet


a few weeks ago i decided to rebuild this blog from scratch.  it had been literally years since i'd posted, so i figured i'd include just a few of the last entries.  also, drupal 8 was in beta and i'm impatient.  why not build a brand new site in 8.0.0-beta9?, i thought.   how hard could it be?

noted elsewhere



building better interfaces with svg
well-done and convincing argument for moving to svg.


27 questions (and answers) from my first drupal 8 site build
to say this guy saved my bacon would be an understatement.  kudos, mr. korostoff.  much appreciated.


ancient sumerians, tablet computing and html tables
nice analogy.  compelling argument for simplifying content.


 coding for the non-coder: designers can think like developers
...and vice versa.  we're all just trying to solve problems.  


how to keep up to date on front-end technologies
beautifully designed recipe for keeping up to date in our industry.


taking bbedit seriously
write up about my favorite (old faithful) editor.  still best-in-class, imo.  here's why.
