please sign the guestbook so we know you were here.

                please keep checking back for new information!






 
this website is in memory of priscilla & steve valentine, who traveled all over performing shows with their potbellied pigs. nellie was their first pig and the "star" of valentine's performing pigs, but they traveled with many other pig performers throughout the years. you will read about these pigs on the various pages of this website.
unfortunately, nellie passed away in feb. 2012 at the age of almost 20 years old. soon after, in march of 2012, steve passed away from a long fight against pancreatic cancer. then, just a month later, in april 2012, priscilla passed away from complications of pneumonia. sadly, this ended valentine's performing pigs. therefore, this website was taken offline by the valentine's {former} webmaster at that time.
however, even though valentine's performing pigs were no longer performing, many folk in the "pig community" wanted to see the valentines' memory live on. that's when i was contacted to revive the website. i have re-vamped, had to re-format every page, and have restored all the former information. in addition, new info will be added to this website, so please check back often.
