wood turning tools & stuff

turningwood.com was founded on the principle that products woodturners need, have to be of great value, affordable and available. just like woodturning, it is all about passing on the knowledge. in these pages you will find a cornucopia of “stuff”. traveling all over the country to symposiums and to demo, taking photos with and of our friends. the idea is for you to sit back and surf the site. if you have any questions, please let us know.
