                                                        there are two ways we can take advantage of social media marketing:  1) use their paid advertising platform; 2) utilize their free announcement services and design our posting to go viral.  a posting that goes viral is worth a million dollars in advertising.  so how do you create something that can go viral?  we brainstorm.  we put all of our heads together to generate ideas and we analyze each one.  from there, i'm sure we can think of something to create that can potentially go viral.  we do this via brainstorming online or during lunch or office meeting.  it's really that simple.

frequently asked questions

                                    we've compiled the most frequently asked questions and provided them to you below for your reference.  our goal is to be as transparent as much as possible so there's no surprises.
                                







how do i order or buy a website package?


                                        it's simple.  first determine what type of website do you need, an informational, ecommerce or membership driven website. if the answer is informational, then determine how many pages you will need to complete the website - home, about us, services, products, contact us, are just a few example of pages you can have on your website.  you can then expand from there.  for example, you can add to the about us page by including team, then a page for each team member, etc.  from there, you can now select which website package has the right number of pages you need then click on add-to-cart, then checkout.
                                    

what happens after the website is complete?


                                        just sit back and relax for a couple of days.  this will give google enough time to tag and rank your website.  from there, depending on the marketing service you chose, you will be able to see your site ranked on search engines e.g. google, bing and yahoo.
                                    

how can i get more traffic to my website?


                                        there are various ways to get online traffic to websites, it all depends on your marketing plans and what industry your business is in.  with online marketing, we can focus on your target market via keyword pay-per-click campaign.  if it's a geographical area that you're after, we can focus our marketing campaign targeting zip codes, gender and income level.  when all is said and done, we will provide you orientation and training on what we have setup so you can take over the marketing campaign if you wish.
                                    

how do i convert that traffic into dollars?


                                        the best way to convert that online traffic into dollars is to convert your website into an ecommerce website.  it can be as simple as adding a paypal add-to-cart button or it can be as elaborate as a paid membership account or download service.  in any case, your website will need to have ecommerce features in order to convert that traffic into actual dollars.
                                    

does web hosting matter in regards to traffic?


                                        yes, it does.  we co-manage our own server with professional service technician that works directly at the data center.  we know how hard it is to manage a web hosting server, to make sure it is protected at all times, blocking and detecting illegal entries, malware and virus scans, just to name a few.  so if there's thousands of websites on one server and one of them get's infected, the entire server is infected, unless a preemptive and proactive approach to security has been undertaken.  with thousands of hosted websites also slows down the server significantly which slows down the load time of your website.  this is where you get hurt on search engines.  the slower your site loads, the lower your ranking gets which means less visitors.
                                    

should i get a dedicated ip address?


                                        yes.  having a dedicated ip address separates you from the pack - meaning, if one of the hosted websites on the server gets into trouble, your site will be excluded from the violation because you have a different and separate ip address.  this is the primary reason to have a dedicated ip and just one of the benefit of having a dedicated ip address.
                                    

why do i have to include an ssl security certificate to my hosting account?


                                        having an ssl certificate installed on your hosting account converts your website from http:// to https:// - meaning, it is secured and encrypted against hackers and viruses - it also protects your online visitors information from being stolen.  by securing your website (https://) you will also notice that your organic ranking will start going higher and your cost on pay per click campaigns should get lower.
                                    

is email included in your web hosting package?


                                        yes.  we include 50 free email accounts to each web hosting account regardless of package and size of hosting account.  you can setup pop or imap email types on all your devices - laptops, desktops, mobile phones and other devices like tablets.
                                    

can i edit my website myself via cpanel?


                                        yes, you can.  login to your cpanel (yourdomainname.com/cpanel) then click on file manager.  from there, you can edit each html web page online.
