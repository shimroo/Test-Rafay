“there is something magic about a new attitude. no matter how out of shape i can get (and gee i’m so good at it), no matter how closer menopause is getting, it just takes 10 days of this workout and my body reacts. and my friends say you’re doing that keli thing, right?’ this is a staple in my life.”


maria rosaria












 
“keli, i found this video in 2006 (along with a cheap little step that was packaged with it). i was 50+ pounds overweight, shy, depressed and at a crossroads. i started doing this routine three times per week, cleaned up my diet, and lost the excess weight. your “new attitude” routine will always have a special place in my rotation–and i will always be grateful for the part you (indirectly) played in getting my life back on track. thank you!‬‬.”

about keli roberts 
growing up in australia, from a very early age i was active and involved in competitive sports. i especially loved swimming, track and field, net ball (like basketball, but with no back board and no dribbling) and synchronized swimming. after l left school, i worked as a model and actress in australia and europe but found the lifestyle very unhealthy and the work totally unsatisfying. moreover, it also made me feel like i was never good enough! my modeling career left me with very low self-esteem.
after quitting modeling, i got certified to teach fitness through achper, australia’s top fitness certification and i soon began teaching classes. initially, i was teaching as a means to attend theater school, but i soon found out that i was happiest teaching fitness classes. so, i dropped out of theater school and thrust myself full-time into the fitness industry. i had found my true passion – teaching fitness!
