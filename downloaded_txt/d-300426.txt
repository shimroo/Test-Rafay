fw: social profiling





     from: madhu chandra  sent: tuesday, march 01, 2011 12:17 pm to: finicy.739073@gmail.com  subject: social profiling   social profiling: the root cause of racial  discrimination faced by north  easterners crimes on record against north east people in delhi and  ncr   unprecedented racial  discrimination   the delhi police,  delhi and union governments, civil society, and  intellectuals have, in general, refused to accept the racial discrimination  faced by the people from north east india who are working, studying, and living  in delhi and the  national capital region (ncr). the refusal and denial to accept the struggles  faced by the people from north east india especially by law enforcement  authorities has continued for the last five years until the killing of 19 –year  old tangkhul girl from manipur in october 2010 at murnika by an iit ph.d.  student. the awakening after this incident lasted hardly a month and was  forgotten until everyone was reminded by the moti bagh gangrape case of a 30  year old mizo bpo employee on november 23, 2010 at midnight.   racial discrimination on  record        cases  total     2009  2010  2005-08  fir  no        fir   molestation  29  36%  8  6  15  14  15   rape  4  5%  1  1  2  4  0   beating        girls  6  8%  3  1  2  4  2   beating        boys  22  28%  20  2     4  16   murder  5  6%  3  1  1  4  1   attempt        rape  1  1%        1  0  1   misbehaved  3  4%  1     2  0  3   non        payment  6  8%  2     4  0  6   rent        non refund  2  3%  1     1  0  2   media          1  1%        1  0  1   missing        person  1  1%     1     1      total  80  100%  39  12  29  31  47   percentage        48.75%  15.00%  36.25%  38.75%  58.75% source: ?????   the whole nation cried when shilpa shetty in the  celebrity show "big brother" faced racial abuse in 2007 or when indians were  victimised in australia recently. but we were  silent spectators when it happened to our own people from north east india.  non-acceptance and denial of the racial discrimination that north easterners  face by the law enforcement agencies and government authorities is an additional  form of racial discrimination.   several shocking incidents have happened in the last six  years in delhi  and ncr, beginning with the heinous gang rape of a girl from mizoram in a moving  car at dhuala kuan in 2005. a verdict of 14 years imprisonment came after four  years of litigation.   the north east support centre & helpline was  established in 2008 and conducted two pilot studies. the first was done in 2008,  based on media reporting of sexual abuse in the national capital, and found  almost 50% of cases involved girls from north east india. a second pilot study  was conducted in 2009 and revealed 86% of north east people living in the area  said that face racial discrimination in various forms including: sexual abuse,  physical attacks, vulgar remarks, social profiling, and economic exploitation.  these findings were reported in national newspapers and television from which  law enforcement agencies and government offices should have understood the  plight faced by the people of north east india in delhi and ncr.   the double blow of racial discrimination came when the  law enforcement agencies, particularly the delhi police and ncr police, refused, denied,  or delayed cases filed by victims from north east india. if the police forces  would have avoided social profiling in performing their duties, the issue of  sexual abuse, racial discrimination, and economic exploitation faced by the  people from north east india would have been prevented a long time ago. due to  the discrimination by the law enforcement agencies, racial discrimination is  unprecedented today. in 2009, we saw the highest record of violence against the  people from north east india in delhi and ncr. there is nothing to celebrate in  2010.   after much advocacy, the delhi police issued a "zero  tolerance" policy regarding crime against women including the violence faced by  the people from north east india. delhi police at least began consistently  registering complaints but we've yet to see if they will honesty handle the  cases, punish the perpetrators, and give justice to the victims. a white paper  must be written on how police handle the cases pending in police stations  related to the racial discrimination faced by north easterners.   nature of racial discrimination faced by north east  people   the main outcomes of discrimination are sexual abuse,  social profiling, and economic exploitation. whenever and wherever any attack  happens to the people of north east india, it is deeply connection with  gender-based discrimination and social biases which affect the economic  opportunities for the people of north east india living in delhi and ncr.   a common definition that makes  sense in our context is: "racial discrimination is treating people differently  through a process of social division into categories not necessarily related to  races." the plight faced by people from north east india is seen in the form of  social profiling. it is a crime as per article 15 of indian constitution.  "prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place  of birth. (1) the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds  only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them."   blacks suffered apartheid for years  and whole world condemned it. the un has criticised india's caste  system and civil society has called it worse than racism. the racism faced by  north east india citizens is definitely an outcome of the caste system. to fight  racism, one can not ignore the apartheid of casteism which exists among indian  societies.   whenever sexual abuse or a racial  attack happens, the general public often socially profiles people from north  east india on the basis of a different culture, a different look, and a  different geographical background. social profiling is against the ethos of  india's distinctive of unity in  diversity. social profiling will distance the communities from one another.     economic exploitation is one of the  immediate effects of racial discrimination, particularly for young working boys  and girls from north east india. two sisters who were sexually abused by twenty  men in gandhi vihar in january 2008 had to close their cyber café through which  one of the girls supported her brother and sister who were pursuing further  studies. she could not relocate and restart her business in delhi and went back home.  like her, most of the victims who suffer sexual abuse in their offices have had  to quit their jobs.   what are the root  causes?   we have been asked about the root cause a hundred times.  indeed many people tried to blame north east girls for their lifestyle. many  civil society members and law enforcement agencies have said the girls are too  liberal, free, or brought the attack on themselves by their dress. they said  this instead of condemning the crime.   socially profiling people from north east india is the  root cause of sexual abuse, social discrimination, and economic exploitation.  social profiling makes north east girls appear vulnerable in the eyes of  perpetrators because society will shift the blame to the victims.   the notion of social profiling is wrong and we define it  as the opinion formed upon one's appearance or culture, and which treats  everyone equal due to biased opinions formed upon some limited experience. once  a community is socially profiled, one's economic, social, educational, and  professional status does not matter and everyone is looked down upon socially  and racially.   along with social profiling, a major problem is the  mindset of people about north east communities. this mindset says that the  people from north east india are strangers, too free in their culture, cheap,  will do anything they like, or that you can get them to do wrong things for  free. social profiling is sadly also seen in the attitudes of local police when  they insult, deceive, ignore, and deny the complaints of north east victims and  even connive with perpetrators in many cases.
