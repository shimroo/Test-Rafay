truth. not talking points.erick erickson is a former elected republican and lawyer who ran political campaigns across the nation.  he knows most of the republican heavy hitters and has relationships across both parties.  with his deep knowledge of politics and campaigns and his deep bench of sources, erick is able to deliver entertaining, informative, and relatable conversations to his audience in a refreshingly unpredictable way.  a principled conservative, erick has the courage to cut through his own side’s spin so his audience is smarter.  a husband of a wife battling cancer, the father to two kids, and a theological background, he is able to pivot from the daily headlines and politics to living life transparently and honestly with his audience.  erick does it all weekdays from the swingiest swing state in america where he can explain the left to the right and the right to the left with the courage to cut through the talking points to get straight to the truth.erick erickson broadcasts five days a week live from 12pm to 3pm et with a weekend best of program and is distributed over the westwood one wegener system.  affiliate relations and ad sales are handled by compass media networks.




    about the show→
  

    


“erickson is a conservative who has not been reluctant to tell his audience the truths he thinks they need to know as opposed to engaging in the daily dance of affirmation and only telling them what they want to hear”

— michael harrison, talkers magazine




“his voice and his values are respected by people all across this country.”

— former vice president mike pence

 


“one of the most consistent reasons people say they tune in and keep listening to erick is because they never know what he is going to say. he is unpredictable in what he covers and what he thinks.”

— pete spriggs, former program director for wsb




“erickson’s influence stems from the fact that he’s not just a pundit—he’s an activist who gets involved in contentious primary battles, bestowing endorsements that draw attention and cash to little-known candidates.”

— the atlantic
