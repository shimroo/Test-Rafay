cody the escape artist!i know i haven't posted in awhile, but this is event-worthy.last friday, when we came home, we heard a wimper. we looked around and opened the front door and noticed cody sitting there, on the outside. this was puzzling as we thought we left him in the house all day.we went to the backyard and checked all the gates, doors, and fencing for openings or holes. there were none. then we decided to go outside the backyard and goad cody into joining us (to see which way he may have originally escaped). what is puzzling is he ran back in the house. we checked with any possible house workers (such as a gardener) who may have come in and accidentally let cody out, but none came that day.  additionally, we noticed that his food, water, and bed was not touched all day, and confirmed to us that he must have been outside all day long.upon further tests, we realized that he actually ran into the garage. the door from our garage to our house doesn't always lock shut, so a curious dog can push the door wide open. also, in the past week, when i take cody to work, he has developed the habit of following me, about 5-10 seconds later so he doesn't get caught and immediately sent back to his dog bed. our theory is that cody noticed that we were leaving the house and snuck into the garage after we entered the car. as we drove out of the garage, he must have followed us out, and stayed outside while the automated garage door closed shut. we are the luckiest owners in the world! saturday would have been a much different day. instead of taking cody to the dog park and lounging about, we would have been frantically visiting shelters and animal hospitals, posting signs, and worried about our dog. things like this help remind us how lucky we are sometimes.

walk n wag 2009this past saturday, cody and i participated in a fundraiser for the humane society of silicon valley. here's our page:http://hssv.convio.net/site/tr/walknwag/generalwnw2?px=1043001&pg=personal&fr_id=1070we had a great time, and cody was able to find a tennis ball right before the walk started. this helped immensely because it prevented him from barking. (he barks when he's not in the very front of a pack of people/dogs). they took a video of the beginning. cody and i show up in about second 41. as you can see, cody's trying to weave through the crowd finding the best way to get past people. we had a good time overall. cody made me power walk for the 3.5 miles of the walk since he was trying to catch up to the front. we ended behind 2 other dogs so it wasn't bad given how we first started. cody lost his ball midway through the walk when they had a big bucket of water filled with hot dogs. he wasn't really interested in the walk after that and when i dragged him away from the water/hot dogs, he lost his ball in the process (he left the ball in the bucket while he was dunking for hot dogs).it was such an emotionally exhausting day for him that he just crashed for the rest of the day. a tired dog = good dog. :)

kidnapped!a couple of months ago, we asked that one of our friends pick up cody from daycare. cody doesn't know these friends very well, and didn't recognize the dog they had, even though they had met a couple of times previously. when we finally picked up cody a few minutes later, he was relieved that he didn't get kidnapped. this is a picture of poor, concerned cody with their dog, javier:

our "human" toddlercody turned 3.5 years old this past weekend and he's acting his age!we had a house/dog sitter stay in our guest room a couple of weeks ago and cody "discovered" our guest bed when she was staying there. now, this is our nightly routine:8pm-11pm - cody naps on our bed in the master bedroom11pm - cody moves to the guest bed when we kick him off the master bed5am - cody wakes up, leaves the guest bedroom, and whines by our bed until we let him join us.cody has developed human toddler traits! at this rate, i expect him to be sleeping on his own bed soon, waking himself up to attend elementary school, and getting his driver's license in a few years. how quickly they grow up....
