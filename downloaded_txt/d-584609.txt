the center for cultural preservation










america is filled with numerous untold stories, from family stories to folktales, that makes us all richer. however our consumer world often blinds us to the value of our traditions and heritage and replaces them with “things”. what we lose is access to wealth of our collective cultural tapestry.
the center for cultural preservation is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to sharing our cultural treasures through oral history projects, documentary film, public programs, books, education and more. as we connect to our cultural heritage, we also become better stewards of our natural inheritance to insure our land is protected for many generations to come.
please join us, support us and work with us to make the invisible visible once more.
