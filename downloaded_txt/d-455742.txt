wvue-tv, feb. 9



descending: the cost of a sinking airport
officials at msy admit the new orleans airport has been sinking since it was built 60 years ago, and repairs to address related issues have cost as much as $500,000 since 2019. “this clearly is going to impact the timeliness of the flights,” apa spokesman capt. dennis tajer told wvue-tv. “we’ve got to make sure, above all else, it does not affect the safety.” watch the report ...
 




the associated press, jan. 8


stowaways on planes and inside landing gear raise worries about aviation security
an entire generation has grown up since the 9/11 attacks without any major catastrophes, which has led some people to get complacent. “we’re seeing some fissure cracks. they’re unacceptable,” apa spokesman capt. dennis tajer told the associated press. “and we’ve been lucky that it hasn’t been somebody with broader nefarious intent.” read the article …
 





the times, jan. 6


missile strikes become leading cause of death on commercial flights
apa spokesman capt. dennis tajer told the times of london that pilots want more of a say in determining the risk of a flight route. “time and again … the men and women that fly the plane are excluded from the decision process of whether or not it’s safe to fly,” he said. read the article ...

     aviation coalition underscores commitment to safety   our country is mourning after the unthinkable loss of the passengers and crews of flight 5342, pat 25, and med jets flight 056.  the entire aviation community is united in our grief and our commitment to taking action to ensure accidents like these never happen again.  we never take safety for granted, and we never will.  aviation remains the safest mode of transportation in the world. nearly 50,000 flights take off and land safely each day in the u.s., and our national airspace system remains the gold standard of safety.  “we have the safest skies in the whole world,” transportation secretary sean duffy has said. “traveling by air is the safest mode of transportation.”  national transportation safety board (ntsb) chair jennifer homendy echoed that, saying, “i assure you that the safest mode of transportation is air travel. it is incredibly safe.”  we are confident that the ntsb, working with the federal aviation administration (faa), department of transportation (dot), department of defense (dod), and other parties, will identify root causes and issue recommendations for the aviation industry and the u.s. military to prevent future accidents.  the work of chair homendy, ntsb board member todd inman, other ntsb members, and the ntsb staff is critical for responding to these accidents and making our system even safer. as member inman recited days ago, “through tragedy, we draw knowledge to improve the safety for us all.”  we strongly support this important work and urge policymakers to ensure that the ntsb and the faa have the staffing and resources needed to ensure that the u.s. aviation system is safe and efficient and can continue to innovate.  we will find out what caused the terrible tragedies last week. we will learn from them. we will undoubtedly make changes. and by making an incredibly safe system even safer, we will honor the passengers, crew members, and u.s. servicemembers who have been lost.  aeronautical repair station association air line pilots association, international air traffic control association aircraft owners and pilots association airlines for america airports council international – north america association of flight attendants-cwa american association of airport executives association of uncrewed vehicle systems international aviation technical education council cargo airline association coalition of airline pilots associations experimental aircraft association inc. general aviation manufacturers association global business travel association international association of machinists and aerospace workers international council of air shows national agricultural aviation association national air carrier association national air traffic controllers association national air transportation association national association of state aviation officials national business aviation association professional aviation safety specialists, afl-cio recreational aviation foundation regional airline association travelers united u.s. travel association vertical aviation international vertical flight society
