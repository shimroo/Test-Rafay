welcome to tallulah falls!

home of tallulah gorge, an ancient, awesome 1000 foot chasm carved over millions of years by the tallulah river, tallulah falls is actually a series of six waterfalls cascading down through tallulah gorge.
the town, named after the falls, is conveniently located on highway 441/23 in the northeast corner of the scenic georgia mountains, 1 1/2 hours north of atlanta, and 2 hours south of asheville, nc.
along with being the site of tallulah gorge state park, our town overflows with natural wonders, recreational opportunities, and quite an interesting history.  at the dawn of the 20th century, tallulah falls was a bustling resort town that rivaled niagara falls.  people came from all over to see the waterfalls and the awesome gorge.  come see for yourself what others have been enjoying for years!
