welcome to the official joel cage website

howdy blokes & folks.thank you for visiting my site!!
	please be sure to friend me on facebook, to which i post only performance info (no nonsense, i promise). facebook is the most immediate means of promoting shows; i hope you'll do me this honor.
	
	
facebook events lista comprehensive description of dates coming up in the next two months or so.
all showsa complete and simple list of all shows currently booked through october.

	
it's a tedious task, keeping the gig list current. i book 'em as they come; feast, famine and everything in between. if you have interest in a performance in a particular place or timeframe, please 
	email me 
	and i promise a swift response. 
		
	
	
	you may also follow me on  twitter & instagram as well as other social media sites.

		
	
	please sign up to the email list, which i mainly use to spotlight upcoming concert appearances at many fine listening rooms around new england. while i love all my gigs equally, i am especially fond of these performances where you, the listener, can enjoy the pin-drop silent atmosphere of a formal concert setting, and where i get to not only strum the tunes, but hold forth on important things such as where the songs come from, and observations regarding life as an itinerant minstrel.
	 find out where iâm playing, and come check out a show! check out the "cool stuff" section. come back and visit the site often as iâm always updating shows and adding more media!until next timeâ¦â¦â¦..






















about joel cage
joel cage:acoustic rock song stylist

âwith his treasured guitar bearing earnest timeworn character, mr. cage delivers a performance music lovers quest. in true artist form, joel reverently puts his heart and soul into his music as evidenced with the onset of each song when his eyes close and, devoid of all visual distraction, he transitions from his physical space into a spiritual place - his music. his guitar skills are commanding taking you on a musical journey under constant direction of his soulful rhythm weaving artistic inflections produced only by skill and technique at the hands of time. keeping intrigue alive, joel interjects percussive choreography with an impassioned spirit that takes animated form working him into a sweat- an honorable sign of a soulful musician. whether heâs delivering a raspy quality from deep within or the light-hearted easiness of natural tones, his vocal qualities lend rich substance and meaning to his repertoire of songs in full complement to his genre. then, as if backing out of his spiritual place, joel returns to the place he began looking pleased with his journey just taken and rendering his audience rewarded for having traveled along with him. a sound musician and entertainer in his own right, heâs a âmust seeâ. — elise saad
you canât compare joel cage to any other player â he stands alone. he inspires amazement. his command over his guitar is incredible â heâs an original â completely subsumed by the instrument..
those prone to comparison will liken joel cage to luka bloom, chris smither, richie havens, bruce cockburn, or an acoustic pete townshend, but most frequently to the bluesy articulation and textural fortitude of stephen stills.
those of a more discerning palate will ardently maintain that joel cage is a style & genre completely his own, unique and immune to the kind of qualifications that place him in any sort of pre-ordained niche. 
what you get is a one-of-a-kind experience.

as deftly coined by proprietor ray brady of the dedham square coffeehouse:
 âjoel puts on a show you are sure you will never see again. every time.â
when you go see joel cage play in a restaurant or tavern, you want to watch him as if you were at a concert ..  when you do this, the hustle and bustle of the establishment doing business disappears, and you get a better view of the place from which he plays.  itâs a whole different environment .. and while joel would insist that itâs a lateral move, you canât help but get a feeling of transcendence..

live review
cage on stage:dedham square coffeehouse






when i have a chance i'll ask my friend why he came in tonight.

i mean most of my friends are usually working on a saturday night, or have been to so many concerts that the idea of sitting in a cafe drinking beer or wine and listening to some guy play guitar and sing songs, well they just don't think it'll do it for 'em.

the place filled-up early tonight, most took the seats toward the front, but some asked if they would be able to have a conversation if they sat in the back. we told them they would be fine; we didn't tell them that when joel cage plays, everyone moves forward.

it's just what he does, draws you in. one man, one voice, one sixty-something year old gibson arch-top, a sonic landscape, and a bunch of amazing songs. the folks who came in to have a conversation gave up, (in good way) and moved forward by the end of the night. it's what he does, he draws you in.

when i finally had a chance to talk to my friend he was gone, gone closer, you can't help yourself. when i have a chance i'll ask my friend why he came in tonight, but i don't have to ask him why he moved forward.

joel puts on a show you are sure you will never see again. every time.
 — ray brady, dedham square coffeehouse

once upon a time, joel cage was a different person, playing a different type of music, and treading another musical turf. something happened and he quietly transitioned into an award-winning acoustic talent, with indefatigable vocal energy and guitar prowess. each performance seems fresh, enhanced, and downright direct. in short, to fully appreciate this man's talent, you must see him live!
