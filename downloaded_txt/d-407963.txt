dave at parker and sons came to my rescue. i woke up with a rainstorm in my living room after a pipe burst upstairs. he was friendly, prompt, and made me feel so much calmer by assuring me everything would be alright. he was absolutely correct. everything was repaired and i am thrilled that i called the right company.































sabrina g.



parker and sons is a life savor. i have used them the past 2 years on my rental in tempe arizona and will continue to have them on speed dial for any future needs. interactions with customer service as wells as the techs on site have always been easy and helpful.































erin s.



parker & sons is amazing. when our ac went out, my first call was to our home warranty company, but they couldn't get anyone out to see us for 5 days, which is an outrageous amount of time to be without ac in arizona! luckily, my next call was to parker & sons. they were able to come out same day and get our ac back up and running. we are very happy.
