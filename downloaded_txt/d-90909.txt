a digital playground of unrivaled variety
the moment you step into gamezone’s virtual world, you’re greeted by a dazzling array of gaming options. with such an extensive collection, boredom becomes a thing of the past. whether you’re a seasoned pro or a curious newcomer, gamezone offers something for everyone.

poker paradise: a card sharp’s dream
for poker aficionados, gamezone is nothing short of heaven. boasting an impressive 34 different game versions, it caters to every style and preference. from the globally popular texas hold’em to filipino favorites like pusoy and tongits, the options are endless.

if the thrill of the spin is more your style, prepare to be amazed by gamezone’s collection of over 1,186 slot games. this vast array of options transforms your screen into a vibrant, virtual casino floor. from nostalgic classic fruit machines that evoke the charm of traditional slot parlors to state-of-the-art video slots featuring stunning graphics and immersive soundtracks, the choices are staggering.

celebrating filipino gaming heritage
while gamezone embraces global gaming trends, it never loses sight of its filipino roots. the platform takes immense pride in preserving and promoting classic filipino card games, ensuring these beloved pastimes continue to thrive in the digital age.
pusoy: the filipino poker
pusoy, often likened to chinese poker, is a game deeply ingrained in filipino culture. gamezone’s digital version maintains the game’s essence while adding exciting new twists. in pusoy, players are dealt 13 cards and must create three hands: a three-card front hand, a five-card middle hand, and a five-card back hand. the challenge lies in strategically arranging your cards to beat your opponents’ hands.

tongits: fast-paced fun
tongits, a rapid-fire rummy-style game, is another filipino favorite that gamezone has successfully translated to the digital realm. the objective is simple yet challenging: create sets and runs of cards to reduce your hand value to zero or as low as possible.
understanding that players have different preferences and skill levels, gamezone offers multiple versions of tongits. whether you’re interested in tongits plus, tongits joker, or the quick-play tongits quick, there’s a variation to suit your style. 
tournaments and events: where legends are born
gamezone is more than just a platform for solo play; it’s a vibrant community where players can connect, compete, and showcase their skills. regular tournaments and events are the heartbeat of this community, offering thrilling competitions and the chance to win impressive prizes.
the excitement doesn’t stop at regular tournaments. gamezone consistently introduces new promotions and special events, particularly around holidays and special occasions. these limited-time offers add an extra layer of excitement to the gaming experience, giving players even more reasons to log in and play.
safety first: a secure and fair gaming environment
in the world of online gaming, security and fairness are paramount. gamezone understands this implicitly and has implemented robust measures to ensure a safe and equitable gaming environment for all players.
licensed and regulated by pagcor (philippine amusement and gaming corporation), gamezone adheres to strict standards of fairness, transparency, and responsible gaming. this government oversight provides players with peace of mind, knowing that they’re participating in a legitimate and regulated gaming environment.
accessibility: gaming on your terms
in today’s fast-paced world, flexibility is key. gamezone recognizes this and has made its platform accessible across multiple devices and platforms. whether you prefer gaming on a desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablet, gamezone ensures a seamless experience across all devices.
this multi-platform approach extends beyond mere device compatibility. gamezone has partnered with various gaming services, including glife, bingoplus, arenaplus, and perya game, to expand its reach and provide players with even more ways to access their favorite games. this strategy not only increases convenience for players but also helps to grow the gamezone community, creating a more diverse and engaging gaming environment.
bridging tradition and innovation

fpl 2024-2025: double gameweek 25 preview

posted on february 12, 2025february 12, 2025 by fiso 




did you follow the “common wisdom” from the double gameweek 24 preparations and did you captain mohamed salah? the you must be pretty happy with yourself right about now, seeing as the egyptian superstar (for a change) delivered big in liverpool’s first fixture away at bournemouth’s vitality stadium. he scored both of the goals in liverpool’s 0-2 victory for a 16-point haul and the reds still have the visit to goodison park coming up tonight (wednesday night, february 12th) where salah also got a goal and an assist. that’s why we do recommend waiting at least for the result of tonight’s game before making any transfer decisions with regard to gameweek 25. 
or better said, double gameweek 25, because the fantasy premier league is offering up consecutive double gameweeks. and what’s more, after bournemouth away and everton way in dgw24, liverpool are doubling again in dgw25, together with aston villa this time.
teamdgw24 fixture 1dgw24 fixture 2aston villaipswich town (home)liverpool (home)liverpoolwolves (home)aston villa (away)
in other words, there is quite a lot to take into account in the build-up to double gameweek 25, which kicks off on friday evening. make sure to check out the everton – liverpool game on wednesday night (a 2-2 draw with a last second equaliser by everton), keep an eye on the exploits of premier league teams in europe (yes, that is a major factor again as well) and don’t forget the doubling sides. both the reds and the villans have juicy double match-ups coming up.
don’t forget, the deadline for gameweek 25 is set at 18h30 (uk time) on friday, february 14th, 2025. the free to play fpl or pay to play season/weekend/daily games like fanteam are ideal ways of following the premier league action.
most transferred in/transferred out players (as per february 12th, 2025)
 transfers outtransfers inpossible reasonsgksanchez (che), raya (ars), flekken (bre)sels (nfo), henderson (cry), martinez (ast) defhall (new), alexander-arnold (liv), martinez (mun)kerkez (bou), gabriel (ars), aina (nfo)bournemouth form + fixtures, alexander-arnold injury doubt (now fit), martinez injuredmidgordon (new), amad (mun), diaz (liv)kluivert (bou), rogers (ast), mbeumo (bre)dgw25, mbeumo and kluivert form + fixtures, gordon injury doubtforisak (new), watkins (ast), jackson (che)wood (nfo), mateta (cry), gakpo (liv)dgw25, mateta and wood form, watkins and jackson injury doubts
premium pick
obviously, it’s mohamed salah (£13.7m). liverpool have a double coming up for the second time in a row and even without having played the second match of their double gameweek 24, salah is already sitting on 16 fpl points. with 21 goals and 13 assists from 23 league starts, the egyptian is the best attacking player in the premier league season bar none. and we’ve still got fourteen matchdays to go, mind you. is he going to break his incredible 2017-2018 season record of 32 goals, 12 assists and 303 fpl points? no one knows, but what we can tell you is that he is well on his way. in a gameweek as complex as double gameweek 25, with so many factors to take into account, don’t complicate life more than strictly necessary; just take salah as your premium fantasy pick for gw25 (and captain him as well, but more about that later). oh, and liverpool are facing wolves at home and aston villa away in double gameweek 25.
non-premium pick
where the premium fantasy pick for double gameweek 25 was a no-brainer for us, the non-premium category gave us a bit more of a headache. not because there are no good options available (there are), but because our initial first choice is currently flagged in the official fantasy game. ollie watkins should be a shoo-in for ipswich at home plus liverpool at home in aston villa’s double gameweek 25, but that would mean going against conventional fpl wisdom of not risking a flagged played for a double gameweek, as the risk of simply getting him for one (or even none) of the two games is real. for that reason, we have decided to play it safe and go with cody gakpo (£7.6m) instead. we are aware that this is a repetition of last week’s non-premium fantasy pick, but with liverpool’s consecutive doubles, the dutch forward is simply a very good option. he has started every league game since his feature from the bench back in gw11 and is currently at what we can only hope in the start of a nice run of attacking returns. gakpinho got a brace plus an assist in gw23 against ipswich at home and then an assist in liverpool’s first fixture of dgw24, against bournemouth last weekend. the second game, against everton, is played on wednesday night where he didn’t return, after which the reds return to action against wolves at home on sunday. their second dgw25 fixture, against aston villa at villa park, is planned for next wednesday, february 23rd, and we expect gakpo to feature heavily in all of these games.
the budget enabler
even without a double gameweek, the aston villa roster has been a rich source of budget enablers so far this season. so, now that the villans have got a nice double coming up, consisting of ipswich town at home followed by liverpool at home, it’s no surprise that a villa player features in budget category this week as well. we are, of course, talking about morgan rogers (£5.6m), who has been our stand-out budget fantasy pick on more than a few occasions this season. the thing is, he simply represents incredible value. for a player who started the season with a price tag of £5.0m, the fact alone that he is a nailed-on part of the attack of a top-10 (and possibly even top-7) side is great. add to that his current 6 goals and 5 assists from 23 league starts, and what we’ve got here is a bonified fpl budget gem.
the differential
our differential fantasy pick for double gameweek 25 could just as well been our budget enabler of the week, but we’ve decided to put ethan nwaneri (£4.5m) in here for now. the arsenal youngster is having his breakthrough season and is far from being a starter for the moment. at the same time, manager mikel arteta is giving him opportunities of late and he has definitely showed himself during those few minutes he get. nwaneri actually currently sits on 3 goals from just three league starts and a total of 281 premier league minutes, which includes a goal in gameweek 24 against manchester city. we have a feeling that he might be getting more minutes in dgw25 and beyond, at least on the short to medium term, as the gunners are dealing with a bit of an injury crisis amongst their attacking players. the likes of kai havertz, gabriel jesus, bukayo saka and gabriel martinelli are all ruled out for the upcoming game against leicester city at the king power stadium. the foxes have the leakiest defence in the entire league and we’re hoping nwaneri, with his current ownership of just 0.8%, will get plenty of opportunities to benefit from that.
the (vice-)captaincy
mo salah for liverpool’s double gameweek 25 against wolves (home) and aston villa (away). 
if for some reason you feel salah is a bad option for double gameweek 25, then martin odegaard away at ipswich town or erling haaland, after his 2 mid-week goals in the champions league, at home to newcastle could be interesting alternatives.
riskier options for the armband include cole palmer away at brighton, the flagged ollie watkins for his double against ipswich town and liverpool (both at villa park), and justin kluivert for bournemouth’s visit to southampton.

mastering strategy: the games that reward smart play

posted on february 12, 2025february 12, 2025 by admin 





photo
chance? it’s fun. it’s exciting. but it won’t get you far. if you want to win – not just hope for a good outcome – you need strategy. real strategy. the kind that separates the best from the rest.
some games demand cold, hard calculations. others call for adaptability, psychological warfare, or just knowing when to wait. but every game that rewards smart play has one thing in common: those who plan ahead walk away victorious. let’s talk about the games where brains can overcome blind chance.
fantasy sports – the numbers game disguised as fun
some people think fantasy sports are about picking your favourite players and crossing your fingers. those people lose.
the best fantasy managers don’t guess; they predict. and they do it with cold, unfeeling data. in the 2022 fantasy premier league season, the top 1% of players made transfers at least 25% more efficiently than casual players – meaning they weren’t just reacting; they were anticipating.
picking a star striker coming off a hat-trick? that’s what everyone does. the real move? finding the under-the-radar midfielder tucked in a relegation-threatened team on a losing streak. or spotting a backup running back who just became a starter due to injury. the difference between winning and losing? knowing what’s happening before the herd does.
poker – a game of math, nerve, and making people uncomfortable
poker’s got an aura of mystique. people talk about reading faces, bluffing with confidence, staring into souls. that’s part of it. but do you know what actually wins? numbers.
the best poker players aren’t making decisions based on gut feelings; they’re crunching probabilities as they go. if the pot is $100 and you need to call $20, your break-even point is one win in five hands. but is your hand strong enough to make that worth it? good players know. great players exploit the ones who don’t.
and then there’s the human element. ever seen someone hesitate a fraction too long before betting? or over-explain their hand when they’re trying to look casual? that’s where strategy meets psychology. play the maths, read the room, and most importantly – make sure they are the ones feeling uncomfortable, not you.
competitive video games – the meta hustle

photo on unsplash
in esports, skill gets you in the door. strategy keeps you there. the best players don’t just practice – they study. they watch tournaments, analyse patches, and track what’s actually working right now. in league of legends, the win rate of top-tier champions can swing up to 10% overnight with a single update. if you’re not keeping up? you’re playing the wrong game.
adaptation is everything. back when i played counter-strike, the difference between winning and losing wasn’t just aim – it was positioning. knowing which angles were being held, reading the economy, figuring out if the enemy team could afford rifles or if they were stuck on pistols. playing on autopilot? that’s how you lose.
casino strategy – managing risk like a pro
most people think casino games are pure chance. but honestly, in most instances they’re wrong. take blackjack. if you play perfect basic strategy, the house edge drops to 0.5% – meaning over time, you lose less than one dollar for every $200 wagered. but if you play randomly? the house edge jumps to 5% or more. that’s the difference between stretching a bankroll for hours or busting out in ten minutes.
and even in pure luck options, like when you play slots online, strategy still matters. high-volatility slots? they pay big – but not often. low-volatility slots? you’ll get frequent wins, but they’ll be smaller. smart players adjust their bankroll and bet sizes accordingly, playing the long game instead of chasing instant gratification. although you can’t technically “beat” these games to control the outcomes, strategy is the difference between mitigating risk and hoping for a lucky streak.
the common thread – smart play wins, always
strategy isn’t a ‘bonus’ in these games. it’s the whole game. the difference between good and great isn’t luck – it’s preparation, calculation, and execution.
in fantasy sports, the best players aren’t reacting, they’re thinking three weeks ahead. in poker, they’re making +ev decisions, whether they win the hand or not. in video games, they’re adapting faster than the competition. and in casino gaming, they’re managing risk while everyone else is playing blind. luck fades. strategy lasts. the only question is – are you playing smart?

foreign businesses cut investment in india under government pressure

posted on february 4, 2025february 4, 2025 by admin 




the investment fund omidyar network and the american company wework inc. are going to leave the indian market in 2024, while the bookmaker parimatch is still unable to invest in the country. 
as reported by twn in india, the above companies are joining giants such as disney, general motors, vodafone group and byd, which had already faced difficulties in the indian market. for example, parimatch, a well-known betting company, has also experienced problems when planning to invest in the indian economy
omidyar network’s decision to stop investing
the news that omidyar network will immediately cease any new investments in the indian economy in 2024 came as a surprise. the company has previously invested over $600 million in various local startups such as e-pharmacy 1mg, edtech vedantu, fintech startups kaleidofin, kiwi, m2p fintech, and indifi. pierre omidyar, the founder of ebay and a sponsor of the foundation, did not provide a clear explanation for the decision, noting only “significant changes in the context and economic landscape.”
according to some sources, omidyar network and other western companies are prohibited from investing in india. obstacles to doing business in india are also felt by parimatch. parimatch has been forced to postpone investments in india because of the local environment’s hostile attitude.
loss of capital by indian startups
the exit of omidyar network coincided with a significant reduction in funding for indian startups. in 2023, funding decreased by 62% to around rs 66,908 crore as compared to rs 180,000 crore in 2022. these are the lowest funding figures since 2018, when startups in india raised rs 1,00,930 crore.
wework inc is also leaving india
in april 2024, wework inc. announced its plans to exit india entirely, selling all of its 27% stake in the local unit through a secondary transaction. the company filed for bankruptcy although it reported revenue of rs 1300 crore in the 2023 financial year. potential buyers of the shares include the office of the enam family group, the investment firm a91 partners, and caratlane founder mithun sacheti.
high taxes scare away the gambling business
in october last year, india introduced a 28% gst on online gambling, casinos, and horse racing. this tax caused the immediate exit of super group from the market, followed by bet365. gambling companies have sued the government to reduce the tax to 18%. the ceo of dyutabhumi hotel and resorts, ravindra shinde, believes that the tax is excessively high compared to other countries. parimatch believes that business conditions in india do not allow foreign companies to develop. this, according to parimatch, seriously complicates business operations in this subcontinent. the bookmaker never entered the market and even faced a fake of its brand.
chinese investors face difficulties
india complicates the situation not only for western companies but also for chinese investors. in particular, it rejected a proposal from byd, a chinese electric car manufacturer, to build a $1 billion plant. in december 2023, india’s law enforcement authority detained three senior officials of the chinese mobile company vivo on money laundering charges.
causes of investment difficulties
india has tightened its grip on chinese companies as part of its geopolitical strategy, protecting national interests. the country seeks to become the vanguard of the american ‘indo-pacific strategy’ to contain china’s development, which creates additional barriers for foreign investors. this leads to many companies, including parimatch, facing difficulties when trying to invest in india. 






how to balance risk vs. upside in super bowl fantasy pools

posted on february 3, 2025february 3, 2025 by admin 





picture credit
super bowl lix is gearing up to be an electrifying rematch between the kansas city chiefs and the philadelphia eagles, set for february 9, 2025. while casual fans are eagerly anticipating the showdown on the field, fantasy football enthusiasts are already diving into their super bowl pools. crafting the perfect lineup is crucial, as it can be the key to victory – striking the perfect balance between risk and potential reward is essential for maximizing your fantasy points without exposing your team to unnecessary volatility.
understanding risk vs. upside in fantasy pools
every player selection in a fantasy pool carries a certain level of risk and upside. risk (in this case) refers to the potential variability in a player’s performance, meaning some players have wide scoring ranges depending on game conditions. upside, on the other hand, measures a player’s maximum potential if everything goes right.
finding the balance between safe, consistent performers and high-upside, boom-or-bust players is the key to developing a winning lineup. a lineup composed entirely of high-risk players can easily fall apart if they underperform, while a team full of safe choices may lack the explosive scoring needed to win a large pool.
key super bowl lix players: evaluating risk and upside
selecting the right players for your fantasy pool requires balancing risk with potential rewards. some players offer high ceilings but come with volatility, while others provide steady production with limited upside.
below is a breakdown of key players in super bowl lix and how they might fit into your risk-reward strategy.

patrick mahomes (chiefs, qb) – high upside, moderate riskmahomes is arguably the most dynamic quarterback in the league, capable of posting massive fantasy numbers. however, the eagles’ pass rush could force him into difficult situations, increasing his interception risk. if you draft mahomes, it’s wise to balance his potential with a safer player elsewhere.
jalen hurts (eagles, qb) – balanced upside and riskhurts brings dual-threat ability, making him a strong fantasy option. he can score by going aerial or on the ground, giving him a high floor. however, his success will depend on the eagles’ offensive line containing kansas city’s pass rush.
saquon barkley (eagles, rb) – high floor, moderate ceilingbarkley has had a historic season, surpassing 2,000 yards in total offense. his consistent rushing ability makes him a safe fantasy option, but the chiefs’ defensive scheme has been effective against star running backs, slightly capping his upside.
travis kelce (chiefs, te) – high floor, high upsidekelce is mahomes’ most trusted target, and his playoff performances have been stellar. he’s likely to see heavy volume, making him one of the safest fantasy plays – with significant scoring potential.
a.j. brown (eagles, wr) – boom-or-bust potentialbrown has the ability to dominate a game, but the eagles’ run-heavy offense sometimes limits his opportunities. he could deliver a monster performance or see fewer targets if the game script doesn’t favour passing.

strategies for balancing risk and upside in super bowl fantasy pools
1. diversify your selections
a well-balanced lineup includes a mix of high-upside and reliable players. avoid stacking your team with too many volatile options, as this could result in a complete collapse if the game doesn’t unfold as expected.
example: if you select mahomes, pairing him with kelce (a high-floor player) rather than a.j. brown (a more volatile option) could create a more stable lineup.
2. leverage matchup data
looking at past performances against similar opponents can help gauge a player’s potential. analyzing team strengths and weaknesses can highlight key mismatches that could influence fantasy scoring. for example, if a team struggles against tight ends, selecting travis kelce might be a priority. similarly, if a defense excels at limiting deep passes, it might lower the ceiling for a receiver like a.j. brown.
for a more data-driven approach, bettors can turn to team and player analytics on fanduel, which provide breakdowns on player tendencies, defensive matchups, and expected fantasy production. using these insights, you can identify undervalued players or avoid potential fantasy pitfalls.
example: if the chiefs’ secondary has allowed a high completion rate to slot receivers all season, devonta smith could emerge as a strong contrarian pick with solid upside.
3. consider game script scenarios
think about how the game is likely to play out. if you anticipate a high-scoring battle, focusing on offensive playmakers might be the right move. if you expect a defensive showdown, prioritizing safer running backs and possession receivers could be beneficial.
example: if the chiefs are forced into a pass-heavy situation, mahomes and his top receivers may offer more fantasy value. conversely, if the eagles take an early lead, barkley may get an increased workload.
4. monitor injury reports and player status
player injuries can drastically impact fantasy value, especially in a high-stakes game like the super bowl. a last-minute injury to a key offensive lineman could weaken a team’s ability to protect the quarterback, while a banged-up wide receiver might see fewer targets. staying updated on super bowl news is essential, as even minor player status changes can affect fantasy projections.
finalizing your super bowl fantasy strategy
balancing risk and upside in fantasy pools isn’t about eliminating risk entirely—it’s about making calculated decisions that maximize point potential without exposing your lineup to unnecessary volatility.

select high-floor players like kelce and barkley to ensure consistent production.
mix in high-upside picks like mahomes or brown, but avoid overloading your team with boom-or-bust players.
consider game script, injuries, and matchups to make data-driven decisions.
in large pools, don’t be afraid to take a contrarian approach with one or two lower-owned players.

risk management is key
super bowl lix fantasy pools require a strategic approach to risk management. by selecting a balanced combination of reliable producers and high-upside players, you can build a lineup capable of winning without being overly dependent on volatile performances. whether you favour mahomes’ passing explosiveness, barkley’s steady production, or kelce’s reliability, making smart, well-rounded decisions will put you in the best position to come out on top.

fpl 2024-2025: double gameweek 24 preview

posted on january 30, 2025january 30, 2025 by fiso 




we have had to wait 23 gameweeks for it this season, but the first double gameweek of the 2024 – 2025 fpl campaign is finally here. and despite the fact that it’s a small one, with just two teams playing twice, the match-ups actually look enticing. that is particularly the case for liverpool, who are facing bournemouth and everton, though it should be noted that both of those games are away for the reds. the other double is for everton, who are playing leicester at home on saturday followed by liverpool at home on wednesday.
teamdgw24 fixture 1dgw24 fixture 2evertonleicester city (home)liverpool (home)liverpoolbournemouth (away)everton (away)
the impact of the upcoming double gameweek can also be seen in this week’s transfers and we would not be surprised to see an impact on chip usage statistics as well. the triple captain chip in particular seems to be talked about a lot in the build-up to the double gameweek 24 deadline, with mohamed salah the obvious target. on top of that, liverpool have got a relatively kind set of fixtures after this double gameweek 24, which will only spur fantasy managers on to invest more in reds assets this week. therefore, expect a (small) spike in wildcard activation as well.
don’t forget, the deadline for gameweek 24 is set at 11h00 (uk time) on saturday, february 1st, 2025. the free to play fpl or pay to play season/weekend/daily games like fanteam are ideal ways of following the premier league action.

premium pick
we mentioned mohamed salah (£13.7m) as a serious candidate for the triple captain role at the start of this article, so we are obviously including him as our premium fantasy pick for double gameweek 24. the egyptian superstar blanked twice in a row in the premier league, in gw21 against nottingham forest away and in gw22 against brentford away, but he got back to scoring ways last weekend. a single goal against ipswich town at home brought the roughly 71% of managers who own him 8 fpl points. that goal has brought salah’s totals to 19 goals and 13 assists in 22 league starts so far, and to 222 fpl points in total. no player in the official fantasy game has more points than that and there is a very good chance that no player in the official fantasy game will score more points than salah in double gameweek 24, when he faces bournemouth and everton (both away).
non-premium pick
cody gakpo (£7.6m) was one of the few “usual starters” who appeared at the kick-off against psv in eindhoven on wednesday. as liverpool were already sure of the next round in the champions league, manager arne slot decided to rest some of his usual starters. gakpo was on the pitch as well though, as he faced his childhood club, and he even scored the opening goal of the match from the penalty spot. the reds would eventually go on to lose the game 3-2, but more importantly for fpl managers is the fact that gakpo was taken off after 51 minutes. we know slot likes to rotate a little but up front, but this makes us hopeful that the forward will prominently feature during double gameweek 24, after having started the previous eleven league games as well. the dutchman scored 7 goals and provided 2 assists over that run, which seems to have cemented his role in the liverpool front three. with away games against bournemouth and everton coming up in dgw24, we feel gakpinho’s current ownership of 18.6% is set to get a considerable boost over the coming days.
the budget enabler
morgan rogers (£5.6m) is on fire. we included him as our stand-out budget fantasy pick last week and we’re doing so again this week, despite his blank against west ham united in gameweek 23. the 22-year-old and his aston villa teammates are facing wolves at molineux this weekend and they will be coming into that game brimming with confidence. that’s because on wednesday, they clinched direct qualification for the next round of the champions league by beating scottish champions celtic 4-2. three of those four goals were scored by morgan rogers, who had not yet scored a goal in europe up to that point, but who did already record 6 goals and 5 assists in the premier league this season. a fantastic result for villa and a memorable night for the winger, who is listed as a midfielder in the official fantasy game. next up for the villans are wolves, who look condemned to the relegation battle until the very end of the season. only southampton have conceded more than their 52 goals in 23 league games, and we don’t think the upcoming visit of aston villa is going to make those numbers much better.
the differential
honestly, we’re not sure you should make too much effort to get in on everton’s double gameweek 24, despite their double of home games. then again, if you’re looking for an affordable differential fantasy pick this week, the toffees have a few interesting options on offer. we initially focused on their defensive assets, but we then realised that consecutive clean-sheet wipe-outs are absolutely possible in dgw24. we don’t expect everton to shut out liverpool and leicester, for all their faults, do know how to score a goal. so, in the absence of playmaker dwight mcneil, we have opted for striker iliman ndiaye (£5.5m) instead. the senegal international has been part of the starting eleven for a while now and he has been on target of late as well. he scored a goal against spurs in gw22 and then another goal against brighton in gw23 to bring his total for the season to 5 goals in the league. don’t expect ndiaye to blow up this double gameweek, but at a current ownership of just 3.6%, he could provide considerable differential value on the short term.
the (vice-)captaincy
our captain is obviously mohamed salah for liverpool’s double gameweek 25 against bournemouth (away) and everton (away).
the liverpool roster offers a few interesting double gameweek alternatives as well, including defender virgil van dijk, winger (listed as midfielder) luis diaz and forward cody gakpo. outside of the reds, aston villa players ollie watkins and morgan rogers could deliver big away at wolves, as could chelsea’s cole palmer at home to west ham united.

fpl 2024-2025: gameweek 23 preview

posted on january 23, 2025january 23, 2025 by fiso 




for the first time in a long time, the fpl team of the week back in gameweek 22 featured a couple of manchester city players. actually, thanks to the 0-6 thrashing of ipswich town, it even featured three of them, though perhaps not the three you would immediately expect: jeremy doku with 12 fpl points, matteo kovacic with 13 fpl points and phil foden (our differential pick for gw22) with 19 fpl points. you would think that a brace plus an assist would be enough for the england international to clinch the player of the week title as well, but alas. one justin kluivert from bournemouth decided to score his second hattrick of the 2024-2025 season in gameweek 22 as well, against newcastle, which resulted in 22 fpl points.
onto gameweek 23 then, where liverpool assets will once again be in the spotlight for a lot of fantasy managers. the reds are hosting an ipswich side that just got battered by city and are then up for a double gameweek 24, with visits to bournemouth and merseyside rivals everton. the toffees themselves have a double gameweek as well, which might attract some interest as well as they play home twice: leicester and liverpool. considering their tough gameweek 23 fixture though, away at brighton, we feel interest in their assets might be marginal. as for other fixtures this gameweek, besides liverpool – ipswich town, newcastle’s visit to saint mary’s looks interesting from an fpl point of view, as does arsenal’s visit to wolves and spurs’ home game against leicester city.
don’t forget, the deadline for gameweek 23 is set at 13h30 (uk time) on saturday, january 25th, 2025. the free to play fpl or pay to play season/weekend/daily games like fanteam are ideal ways of following the premier league action.
most transferred in/transferred out players (as per january 23rd, 2025)
 transfers outtransfers inpossible reasonsgkraya (ars), sanchez (che), onana (mun)alisson (liv), sels (nfo), pickford (eve)liverpool + everton dgw24defsaliba (ars), gabriel (ars), gvardiol (mci)alexander-arnold (liv), hall (new), aina (nfo)liverpool + everton dgw24, saliba injury doubtmidpalmer (che), savinho (mci), iwobi (ful)kluivert (bou), foden (mci), amad (mun)foden form, kluivert hattrick in gw22forjackson (che), solanke (tot), raul (ful)wood (nfo), gakpo (liv), mateta (cry)wood + mateta form, solanke injury
premium pick
we joked about getting rid of mohamed salah (£13.7m) in our preview article for gameweek 22, after the egyptian had just blanked for the first time in twelve gameweeks right before that. obviously, that was not real advice, as salah is still the best asset in the official fantasy game, even after making it two consecutive blanks in a row due to not getting directly involved in any goals in gameweek 22 away at brentford.  don’t worry though, he is still the stand-out premium fantasy pick in our opinion. first of all, he’s very good. second of all, he did score (and dominate) on tuesday in the champions league against lille. third of all, he faces ipswich town at anfield on saturday afternoon, a few days after the tractor boys got whipped 0-6 by manchester city. and fourth of all, liverpool are one of two teams to have a double gameweek in gw24, with away games against bournemouth and everton. if you are still not one of the roughly 70% of fantasy managers who own the egyptian at the moment, you’re probably going to want to get him in asap.
non-premium pick
we know, this is now the third gameweek in a row that we are picking alexander isak (£9.5m) as our stand-out non-premium asset in fpl, but it’s kind of inevitable at the moment. the newcastle forward did blank in newcastle’s shock 1-4 defeat at the hands of bournemouth in gameweek 22, but prior to that, he was on an 8-game streak of consecutive attacking returns, scoring 11 goals and providing 3 assists over that run. isak now has 15 goals and 5 assists to his name in total, from 20 league starts, and up next are southampton at saint mary’s. the saints are brave, we can’t deny them that, but the premier league definitely seems like a bridge too for them this season and we could hardly come up with a better opportunity for a striker in form like isak to get back to scoring ways. southampton are dead last in the league with just 6 points from 22 games and only wolves have conceded more goals than them (51 vs 50 goals). isak is about as far from a differential pick as they come right now, with just over 59% of managers owning the swede, but going without him this weekend might very well mean missing out on a serious haul.
the budget enabler
over the coming three gameweeks, aston villa face the following opposition: west ham at home this weekend, wolves away in gw24 and ipswich town at home in gw25. that brings several villain assets firmly back onto our radar, including morgan rogers (£5.5m). the winger, who is listed as a midfielder in the official fantasy game, has provided incredible value for money this season. he started the season with a price tag of just £5.0m and has delivered 6 goals and 5 assists since then. rogers is obviously a starter for aston villa and with the kind of run they have coming up over the next few gameweeks, we see more attacking returns on the horizon for the 22-year-old, starting with west ham at home on sunday. if you’re looking for a cheap midfielder, for example as part of a wildcard strategy as more than a few fantasy managers are considering at the moment, we don’t see many better options than rogers.
the differential
we have decided to put all of our differential eggs in the kaoru mitoma (£6.3m) basket for gameweek 23. the japanese winger, who is listed as a midfielder in fpl, is coming off back-to-back double-digit hauls and is now facing everton at home next. he scored a goal in the 0-2 away victory over ipswich town in gw21 (10 fpl points) and then took it a step further in gw22 by scoring a goal and giving an assist in brighton’s 1-3 victory at old trafford. their gameweek 23 fixture mirrors their gameweek 1 encounter with everton, when the seagulls booked a 0-3 victory and mitoma scored one of the goals for a nice 8-pointer to get his season started. brighton are the favourites once again on saturday afternoon, against an everton side that has been far from effective on the road so far this season. they have won just one of their 10 away games in the league and they concede an average of 1.5 goals on the road. we expect there to be goals at the amex stadium on saturday afternoon with everton looking to be more attacking under a new manager and we hope that mitoma will be heavily involved in most of them.
the (vice-)captaincy
mohamed salah is the highest-scoring player in the official game right now and when you see him play, you realise that he is for a reason. he is one of the best players on the planet and for gameweek 23, in which liverpool host ipswich town, he is our captain (as he will be in the next gw with a double game).
alexander isak away at the very poor southampton is a great alternative to mo salah for the armband, while kai havertz away at wolves could be a smart move as well. the risk-takers amongst us might consider opting for son heung-min as an extremely unpredictable spurs side welcomes a leaky leicester side to north london.
