how does a good lawyer try a case?


august 5, 2024
 / 
todd rose



investigation
a thorough investigation of the facts in dispute must occur immediately. critical evidence and important witnesses can be lost if a prompt investigation is not conducted. our firm employs numerous investigators and experts to ensure that valuable evidence is preserved.
a good criminal defense trial attorney must be able to perform a thorough investigation that includes review of the charges and the alleged facts, defenses and affirmative defenses, and potential sentence and sentencing issues.
an analysis of potential constitutional issues is also exceedingly important, as violations can result in the evidence being deemed inadmissible at trial. a good criminal trial attorney will also find any hidden evidence, unknown witnesses or other mitigating factors to strengthen the client’s case.
preparation
much of what distinguishes attorneys is the preparation phase. after thoroughly analyzing and researching the facts of the case, a good criminal trial attorney will be able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the case.
it is vital that the lawyer develops a defense “strategy.” it is also important that a good criminal trial attorney file motions during the pretrial phase to thoroughly prepare the case for trial.
research
a good criminal trial attorney must know how to apply current law and past legal precedent to a client’s exact situation to develop a solid defense strategy. every case favorable to a client’s case should be made known to the trial court.
a good lawyer will not perform bare-bones legal research but will research case law in all jurisdictions to locate favorable decisions.
presentation
a good criminal trial attorney knows how to properly navigate a trial, from jury selection to opening statements, questioning witnesses and beyond.
a good lawyer must make effective use of questioning, cross-examination, legal challenges and presentation of alternative theories of the crime to ensure that the client receives a fair trial and is able to present any evidence that could raise a reasonable doubt about guilt.
use of experts
good criminal trial attorneys will hire effective expert witnesses and investigators to develop facts that strengthen the case.
storytelling
good criminal trial attorneys know that good stories hold the jury’s interest. stories are essential in virtually every part of a trial, from opening statements to the questioning of witnesses, to closing arguments.
good stories can arouse the judge and jury’s sense of injustice. such narratives form the blueprint by which to persuade the jury to return a verdict of not guilty.
our awards represent our level of dedication
in line with these principles, our attorneys have won dozens of awards for our groundbreaking work. to name a few: u.s. news and world report’s best law firms award, martindale-hubbell av preeminent ratings* and super lawyers. our awards represent nights and weekends working tirelessly to defend an individual’s rights and freedom. those honors reflect hours and hours pounding the pavement, reaching out to witnesses and preparing cases. the plaudits speak to our thorough research and complete dedication to achieving justice for our clients.
ultimately, the awards and honors speak to the level of motivation that our entire team of attorneys has to serve people like you.

what is the primary role of a paralegal?


july 4, 2024

todd rose




as with many professions, to simply frame the role of the paralegal as an assistant to a practicing attorney would be a misnomer. although the breadth of the role can be expansive, make no mistake about it, the primary role of the paralegal is to research and investigate. when i entered law school many of my working adult peers immediately sought employment in the paralegal field in order to obtain a firm grasp on the law, particularly with the procedural aspects.  
although the paralegal field is often considered as a good foundation to becoming an attorney, it is important to understand that the responsibilities, duties, and skills are quite separate and distinct from one another and should not be viewed as a pipeline to law school, but rather a distinct and proud profession.
paralegal’s primary responsibilities
the paralegal is first and foremost a research professional who is adept and skilled in the current law and all yearly updates and changes to it. while the attorney is skilled at packaging and communicating the points of the law from which to argue his or her case on behalf of clients the bulk of the legal research brought to them is performed by paralegals. although the seasoned attorney will supervise and provide the final decision on the points of law to be used, the paralegal enjoys a place as a trusted assistant whose ability to perform their work can either make or break a legal case.
the legal research skills employed by paralegals in order to assist their lawyers is conducted primarily, but not limited to, through researching individual case facts, organizing case files, contacting and interviewing witnesses, gathering supporting evidence, and drafting the necessary legal documents for each case. obviously, the work of the paralegal is critical to a lawyer’s success in the courtroom. an organized case file will provide the lawyer with the materials that he or she needs to present an argument that is both persuasive and ground within the law.  drawing upon strong research skills, a paralegal will become more and more experienced at finding any and all legal precedents, which allow lawyers to successfully argue the legal points necessary to get evidence admitted in a case in order to provide standing which will ultimately support the position of the client.
today, available technology and legal software platforms, which allow paralegals to organize case files, bill clients, and research the law, are powerful and numerous. this technology allows for the ability to store, classify, isolate, and protect case files and legal documents as well as all emails coming into the law office. it stands to reason that the paralegal should be quite familiar with computer skills and all aspects of electronic document and spreadsheet preparation so that in addition to research the ability to organize becomes an essential skill. although law offices will never become paper free, the ability to create, store, and transmit documents electronically is only going to increase. if you find yourself working at a solo, small, or boutique law firm expect to still conduct searches through paper-based filing systems until the office upgrades its technology. the paralegal should always be as technologically aware and proficient as possible.
expanded role of paralegals: from state to state
as an expanded responsibility, many paralegals serve as investigators for their employing attorney or partner. this role expands upon merely calling and interviewing clients and known witnesses and allows the paralegal to search for new witnesses, evidence, and facts in a particular case. as a licensed private investigator with experience in three states, i have worked for many attorneys in civil and criminal case preparation to supply the facts and supporting evidence necessary for case preparation, which could only be provided though additional outside investigation. among other services performed, i have located and interviewed defendants and witnesses, took photographs, provided background information on witnesses and adverse parties, and gathered physical evidence. for one reason or another, there are many attorneys who do not want to or cannot afford the services of a private investigator. this is where the paralegal is essential.
the laws of the various states in our nation are different and each state empowers paralegals to greater or lesser degrees. some states allow for paralegals to serve as a private investigator although they are not specifically licensed to do so.  in new york state, for example, the new york general obligations law article 7 exempts licensed attorneys and their full time employees, to include paralegals, from the requirement of having a state-issued private investigator license that is otherwise required to engage in most forms of investigative conduct within that state. in any state without a private investigator’s license, or an exemption to it, engaging in any unlicensed investigative conduct, such as defined in new york’s article 7, may be a criminal offense.  paralegals working within an empowered state such as new york could serve as in-house investigators providing another valuable service to their employers.
in sum, the primary role of the paralegal in today’s legal society is that of researcher and investigator. through the skills of document organization, legal research, and investigation, the paralegal becomes an indispensable part of a legal team. the paralegal should not equate his or her status to that of an attorney but as part of the necessary support staff which operates and organizes the law office, conducts critical research, and investigates the facts pertinent to each case. this is all done under the distinct and proud role of the modern paralegal profession; a profession that most attorneys are loath to do without.




becoming a paralegal: what you need to know


may 9, 2024

when you’re exploring careers in the legal field, consider becoming a paralegal. these legal professionals play an important role in legal proceedings without having to spend years and a significant amount of money going to law school. when you’re a paralegal, you’ll be able to assist lawyers in a law firm or legal department with a wide range of responsibilities and duties to help legal proceedings, including trials and litigation, go as smoothly as possible.learning more about the role of a paralegal and how to become one can help you determine if this might be a good career option for you. keep the following information in mind while considering this career path.
what does a paralegal do?
a paralegal performs several tasks to help lawyers prepare for trials, hearings, and other legal proceedings as well as meetings. these tasks can vary depending on the type of law firm or legal department a paralegal works at, among other factors, such as whether they specialize in a particular area. some of the tasks that paralegals are responsible for might include researching laws and regulations, drafting and maintaining legal documents, gathering facts for legal cases, and contacting clients and witnesses.
paralegals might also arrange evidence, gather formal statements and affidavits, and summarize reports to help attorneys prepare for trials. these legal professionals might assist lawyers during trials as well by taking notes, reviewing transcripts, and handling other relevant duties. the duties you can expect to perform as a paralegal can vary based on the size of the law firm or legal department you work for. you might have a wider range of job duties and responsibilities if you work at a smaller firm. at larger law firms, your work might focus on a specific part of legal proceedings, such as researching laws and regulations or gathering evidence.
legal assistant vs. paralegal
legal assistants and paralegals both provide assistance in law firms or legal departments. however, their job duties and responsibilities are notably different. while paralegals focus on performing tasks that directly help lawyers with legal proceedings, such as drafting legal documents or reviewing transcripts during cases, legal assistants mainly handle clerical and administrative tasks. they might answer phones and direct calls, schedule consultations or appointments, and file paperwork.
legal assistant and paralegal careers also differ in terms of education. legal assistants do not need to have any formal degrees for this type of work. however, they can earn a diploma to help them learn the skills needed for this career, such as a legal office assistant diploma. paralegals do not have any formal education requirements either, but earning an associate degree, bachelor’s degree, or advanced degree can be highly beneficial when competing for open positions. many employers looking to hire paralegals prefer candidates who have a degree.
paralegal vs. lawyer
with paralegals responsible for performing a wide range of legal tasks, it’s helpful to know how they differ from lawyers. paralegals can help attorneys and lawyers prepare for meetings, trials, and other legal proceedings. however, their duties are limited when it comes to their interactions with clients. paralegals are not allowed to provide clients with legal advice or represent clients in court. lawyers have the education and training needed to represent clients and offer legal advice.
the educational requirements for lawyers are also much more rigorous. lawyers have to graduate from law school and pass the bar exam. bar exams and requirements for becoming an attorney are state specific in order to work as an attorney. paralegals do not have to spend as much time earning a degree or need to pass the bar exam in order to work.
how to become a paralegal in 6 steps
if you decide to become a paralegal, becoming familiar with the steps involved can help you understand what to expect. while the exact path to a career as a paralegal can differ, the following offers a general idea of how to become one.
1. is being a paralegal right for you?
before getting started on the path to becoming a paralegal, first consider whether it’s the right career for you. think about the kind of career you want to build and the skills you already have. are you good at communicating with other people? do you have strong interpersonal skills? do you enjoy conducting research? are you good at staying organized? paralegals need to have solid communication, interpersonal, organizational, and research skills, along with other skills. going through a degree program, such as a paralegal associate degree program, can help you develop or improve these skills.
keep in mind that you’ll play a valuable role in legal proceedings, but you won’t have the authority to directly counsel clients or represent them. if you’re satisfied with this level of involvement, becoming a paralegal can be a good career path.
2. find the right paralegal education
if you decide to become a paralegal, having the right education is important. although there aren’t any formal educational requirements to become a paralegal, earning a degree can help ensure that you develop the right skills. with many employers preferring to hire paralegals who hold a degree, this can also help you get your foot in the door when you need to find a job in this field.
when exploring education options, look for a degree program that provides you with the coursework needed to become a successful paralegal. an associate degree can help you learn the skills you’ll need and gain the right knowledge within a shorter timeframe compared to more advanced degrees. you might also have opportunities to do an internship, which gives you hands-on experience before you graduate.
3. paralegal certification
do you need to be certified in order to work as a paralegal? there are no federal requirements for certification, and you won’t find certification offered at the national level. however, becoming certified at the state level can show employers that you have a strong commitment to this career, which can give you a competitive edge when you’re searching for jobs. the national federation of paralegal associations (nfpa) also recommends certification for paralegals.
professional organizations offer certifications for paralegals. some certification options for paralegals include the professional paralegal certification from the national association for legal support professionals (nals), the certified paralegal certification from the national association of legal assistants (nala), and the advanced certified paralegal certification from nala.
4. find a job and get experience
when you graduate with a paralegal degree and earn certification, you’ll be ready to begin working in this profession. you can start looking for jobs before you graduate. if you’re able to do an internship at a law firm or legal department, you might be able to transition into a paid position afterward. having a job as a paralegal helps you gain experience, which you can use to advance your career.
5. specialize
paralegals have the option to specialize in a certain area of law. while you don’t have to specialize, doing so might be a good option if you have a strong interest in a particular area of law. for example, you might choose to specialize in family law if you have a desire to play a role in helping families with legal matters, such as child custody. other areas that you might choose to specialize in include corporate law, litigation, personal injury, immigration, real estate, intellectual property, or criminal law.
6. advance your career
when you work as a paralegal, you’ll have opportunities to advance your career if desired. doing so can open up new job opportunities and provide you with an even more fulfilling career, depending on your goals and interests. advancing your paralegal career might involve learning new skills, going back to school for an advanced degree, or working toward earning a promotion. some of the careers that you might consider pursuing include policy analyst, legal secretary, judge, law clerk, or attorney.
state-by-state examples
some states have local organizations that offer voluntary certification for paralegals. the requirements for these certifications vary by state, so it’s important to make sure you understand your state’s requirements. the following are a few examples of how these requirements might differ from state to state.
new york
the empire state alliance of paralegal associations (esapa) in new york offers the new york state certified paralegal program for voluntary certification. a few of the requirements to become certified include being a legal new york resident, being employed as a paralegal, and meeting experience or educational requirements, such as passing the paralegal advanced competency exam (pace) or having an associate degree in paralegal studies from an institutionally accredited school and six years of substantive paralegal experience. keep in mind that you must meet at least one of the experience or educational requirements.
ohio
in ohio, the ohio state bar association for legal professionals (osba) offers the osba paralegal certification program for voluntary certification. the requirements you’ll need to meet for this certification include meeting the osba definition of a paralegal, providing at least three professional references, passing a written exam, completing continuing legal and paralegal education, and meeting education or experience requirements. education or experience requirements include having a high school diploma and associate or bachelor’s degree in paralegal studies along with a certain amount of experience working as a paralegal. this can be one year of experience for those with a bachelor’s degree, five years for those with an associate degree, or seven years for those with a high school diploma.
virginia
the virginia alliance of paralegal associations (vapa) offers the virginia registered paralegal program (varp) for voluntary certification. to qualify for this certification, vapa requires a paralegal to be a voting member in any vapa member association or area liaison. other requirements include completing a minimum of 12 hours of continuing legal education credits, which includes two hours of ethics every two years. paralegals must also provide proof to vapa that they have completed the continuing education hours to maintain certification.
wisconsin
the state bar of wisconsin offers voluntary certification for paralegals. becoming a certified paralegal involves meeting education or experience requirements; being employed or retained by a law firm, lawyer, agency, or corporation; being directly supervised by a lawyer licensed in wisconsin; and passing a background check. education requirements include having an associate or bachelor’s degree from a qualified paralegal studies program, meeting eligibility requirements if you haven’t graduated yet, or earning at least 21 continuing education credits. work experience requirements include working at least five years as a paralegal, teaching paralegal studies for at least three years, having a high school diploma, and having three hours of approved continuing legal education.
how long does it take to become a paralegal?
the amount of time it takes to become a paralegal can vary considerably depending on different factors, such as the degree program you complete and whether you become certified. remember, many employers in the legal field prefer to hire paralegals who have a college degree.
going through an associate degree program to become a paralegal can take a couple of years, or possibly less if you are in an accelerated program. a bachelor’s degree can take about four years to earn. and a more advanced degree, such as a master’s degree in legal studies, can take an additional one to two years.




what are a lawyer’s responsibilities?


march 19, 2024

[1] a lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.
[2] as a representative of clients, a lawyer performs various functions. as advisor, a lawyer provides a client with an informed understanding of the client’s legal rights and obligations and explains their practical implications. as advocate, a lawyer zealously asserts the client’s position under the rules of the adversary system. as negotiator, a lawyer seeks a result advantageous to the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealing with others. as intermediary between clients, a lawyer seeks to reconcile their divergent interests as an advisor and, to a limited extent, as a spokesperson for each client. a lawyer acts as evaluator by examining a client’s legal affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.
[3] in all professional functions a lawyer should be competent, prompt and diligent. a lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the representation. a lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure is required or permitted by the these rules or other law.
[4] a lawyer should use the law’s procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others. a lawyer should demonstrate respect for the law, the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other lawyers and public officials. while it is a lawyer’s duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of official action, it is also a lawyer’s duty to uphold legal process.
[5] as a citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, the administration of justice and the quality of service rendered by the legal profession. as a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond its use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law and work to strengthen legal education. a lawyer should be mindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor, cannot afford adequate legal assistance, and should therefore devote professional time and civic influence in their behalf. a lawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the public interest.
[6] a lawyer’s professional responsibilities are prescribed in the rules of professional conduct, as well as by substantive and procedural law. a lawyer also is guided by conscience and the approbation of professional peers. a lawyer should strive to attain the highest level of skill, to improve the law and the legal profession and to exemplify the legal profession’s ideals of public service.
[7] reserved.
[8] in the nature of law practice conflicting responsibilities are encountered. virtually all difficult ethical problems arise from conflict among a lawyer’s responsibilities to clients, to the legal system and to the lawyer’s own interest in remaining an upright person. the rules of professional conduct prescribe terms for resolving such conflicts. within the framework of these rules, many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. such issues must be resolved through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral judgment guided by the basic principles underlying the rules.
[9] the legal profession is largely self-governing. although other professions also have been granted powers of self-government, the legal profession is unique in this respect because of the close relationship between the profession and the processes of government and law enforcement. 
[10] to the extent that lawyers meet the obligations of their professional calling, the occasion for government regulation is obviated. self-regulation also helps maintain the legal profession’s independence from government domination. an independent legal profession is an important force in preserving government under law, for abuse of legal authority is more readily challenged by a profession whose members are not dependent on government for the right to practice.
[11] the legal profession’s relative autonomy carries with it special responsibilities of self-government. the profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulations are conceived in the public interest and not in furtherance of parochial or self-interested concerns of the bar. every lawyer is responsible for observance of the rules of professional conduct. a lawyer should also aid in securing their observance by other lawyers. neglect of these responsibilities compromises the independence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.
[12] the fulfillment of a lawyer’s professional responsibility role requires an understanding by them of their relationship to our legal system. the rules of professional conduct, when properly applied, serve to define that relationship.

the ethical responsibilities in lawyer/client relationships


february 23, 2024
 / 
todd rose



if you find yourself in situation or disagreement that requires a legal resolution, it is advisable to consult a lawyer. it’s your lawyer’s job to advise you and represent you in court to help settle private legal matters. your lawyer can also interpret the rules and regulations for individuals and businesses, as well as prepare the legal documentation such as appeals, wills, contracts and lawsuits on your behalf.
lawyers are often involved in the most private matters of an individual or business. which poses the question: what ethical responsibilities do lawyers and clients have to each other?
competency in handling a case
wherever you are based, there will always be a selection of law firms you can employ.  it’s your responsibility to research beforehand what type of lawyer or firm will best meet your needs. you can visit the law firm or search online for information on the firm or lawyer before making an appointment.
it is also helpful to note that there are various types of lawyers that specialize in specific fields. some lawyers specialize in intellectual property (ip), family law, personal injury, malpractice, business law, employment law, tax, bankruptcy and estate planning, among others. your lawyer should tell you in your first meeting whether they can handle your case. they may refer you to someone else in their practice who is more suitable.
being on the same side
both the client and the lawyer have responsibilities to assist each other. the lawyer is expected to support your case whilst remaining faithful to his obligation to the law. your lawyer must keep you informed on matters such as settlement offers as well as the possible outcome of the case or viable courses of action. on the other hand, you must support the lawyer’s approach, especially when you have agreed on it beforehand. you must also make sure you disclose any information pertinent to the case. 
lawyer-client privilege
lawyer-client privilege is common phrase you may have heard of in relation to the practice of law. lawyer-client privilege applies to any confidential information shared between client and lawyer. it is the lawyer’s ethical responsibility to use the information you provide as an advantage in the case.  you must provide any information that will allow your lawyer to create the best case. withholding information from your lawyer can backfire and may be used against you.
withdrawing from the case
there might be instances when a lawyer needs to remove his or her service from the case. if this happens, it’s the lawyer’s responsibility to protect your interests by looking for or suggesting new representation. if, on the other hand, you decide you want to be represented by a new lawyer, you should inform your current lawyer of this decision as soon as possible.
for a harmonious lawyer-client relationship, it is important to remember the ethical responsibilities you have towards each other. both parties must be open about the information they have, whether it relates to the case or the capacity of the lawyer to handle the case. the information shared between you must also be kept confidential and not used to secure an advantage over each other. finally, if you intend to drop your case or want to look for alternative representation, you should be honest and inform your lawyer as soon as possible.

marketing law firm marketing: the reason for the role

06 january 2020  hits: 61138


why would anyone knowingly become a law firm marketing specialist – a role that is demanding, complicated, challenging, and stressful? to explore this mystery, we went to the source. accordingly, this time around we asked the law firm marketing specialists of cee to complete the following question: “i went into law firm marketing/bd as a career because ____________.“

“i went into law firm marketing/bd as a career because i was given the opportunity to transform my then-daily work of passive translations into more creative tasks such as putting together pitches, capacity statements, and submissions. luckily, i was on-boarded to the profession by one of the finest law firms in croatia, and i was even more lucky to have continued my professional growth within the international environment of cms. ”
jelena bosnjak, business development & marketing manager, cms zagreb
“at the time, it was a big step up and from where i was standing it seemed like the dream job: exciting, important, attractive (traveling and training opportunities), and thus never boring. i made the right choice. i have grown a lot, have had great mentors, learned unforgettable lessons and got to be a part of this amazing journey that is kinstellar. i’m having the time of my life in the process and have never had a dull moment.” 
adela ene, head of marketing, kinstellar
“a colleague of mine made me a job offer i could not resist. it was not only because of our acquaintance, and remuneration was not a decisive factor. i simply got inspired by the firm’s innovative vision. when i met the managing partner, he was bold enough to say: ‘we want to expand our services beyond just legal advice and offer our clients comprehensive solutions to their business challenges.’ i thought to myself, ‘a lawyer who officially declares himself as an entrepreneur rather than a lawyer? – looks like a fantastic marketing opportunity must be around the corner!’ and here i am, dealing with so many innovative marcomms projects you would never expect a law firm could be doing. sponsoring a student team developing a revolutionary satellite to be placed on elon musk’s falcon 9 rocket? – why not? it was a great opportunity to emphasize our firm’s digital transformation competences (we labelled that initiative as ‘make it fly’). another example of ssw’s untypical approach: as part of our 10th anniversary celebrations, we invited a famous futurist, mike walsh, to deliver a power speech on leadership trends and new challenges triggered by ai, automation and technology.”

“i went into law firm marketing / bd as a career because i like working and communicating with people with different characters, it is challenging, it is interesting, it is unpredictable, it can be really rewarding and a little frustrating at times. but that is what makes the journey worth it.
because law firm marketing is many exciting things, including: (i) pitches for clients; (ii) market research; (iii) editing and proofreading; (iv) legal directory submissions; (v) document design; (vi) event management (vii) public speaking; (viii) communication with lawyers, publishers, editors, marketing and communications executives from all over the world; (x) fellow team meetings and constant learning and exchange of ideas; and (xi) meeting clients.
you can never get bored and every day comes with a challenge.”

“some people set long-term goals and follow them methodically.  my short term and long term goal are the same – to do my job as well as i can. i started out at my current firm in an admin position and have now progressed to the role of marketing specialist.  depending on the day, the work can be interesting, exciting, challenging, frustrating, stressful, and several other adjectives. i definitely still have a lot to learn. but in answer to your question, “how did i get to where i am professionally?” i would say, doing my job well, being in the right place at the right time and just plain luck.”

5 marketing laws and regulations you should know

marketing budgets, and the strategies they fund, often draw a great deal of attention when businesses look beyond the basics of daily operations. but, a violation of the law that prompts consequences would nullify all that time and money spent. by making every effort to adhere to the regulations protecting consumers, you eliminate the risk of incurring crippling fines.
this article provides a rundown of five critical marketing-related laws of which businesses need to be aware.
false advertising
simply put, all advertising must be truthful. imagery and messaging cannot mislead buyers. for example, if you own a honda dealership, you cannot use photos or video of a 2022 civic in an ad if you’re only selling the 2021 model.
you must also be honest about what buyers can expect from what you’re selling, with all claims substantiated. if a supplement temporarily alleviates bloating, the copy shouldn’t include the word “cure.” if your company doesn’t fabricate copper components, your ad cannot claim you work with “all metals.” discrepancies can also occur with terms that aren’t interchangeable, like waterproof and water resistant.
false advertising laws allow state or local officials to take legal action and seek consumer restitution if an ad is deceptive.
copyright infringement
many businesses don’t think twice about using another content creator’s graphics, photographs, video, or music. common practice includes incorporating images from a google search into social media posts or blogs—most of which are copyrighted and require consent.
how to mitigate copyright infringement risks:

use original content as often as possible.
purchase stock photos or use websites like pixabay or pexels for free stock photos and graphics.
thoroughly read content licensing details.
give proper credit to the content’s photographer, videographer, musician or graphic designer.
never use a photo or graphic with a trademark or logo.

children’s privacy
it’s important to be aware of the age of target customers. the children’s online privacy protection act requires online platforms to obtain parental permission prior to collecting the personal information, such as email or ip addresses, geolocation information or other identifiers, of children under 13. federal regulators are very serious about child privacy rights, issuing hefty fines (up to $40,000 per child affected).
sms marketing
the telephone consumer protection act (tcpa) went into effect in 1991 and has since been modified to include sms/text messaging.
under the tcpa, businesses are not allowed to send texts to wireless numbers without prior written consent. even if someone has previously shared their phone number, your business cannot text them unless they have knowingly opted into the program or have given permission, in writing (on paper or digitally), to be sent messages.
to ensure your business complies with the tcpa, consider these methods to get your target audience to subscribe to sms marketing:

in-store signage: customers at the checkout already have existing interest in your business and will likely be receptive to a text club offering exclusive offers and incentives.
email marketing: all eblasts should include details on how to join the text club.
contests: ask social media followers to sign up for your text club to enter a competition or contest.

live video streaming
video streaming has become increasingly popular on social media, allowing viewers to participate in q&a sessions and watch events live. however, without proper planning, your business could face a host of legal issues. for example, live videos often unintentionally use copyrighted music in the background or feature customers/employees without their consent.
before you hit the record button, make sure you aren’t loitering/trespassing, confidential or proprietary information isn’t visible, and everyone being filmed has signed a release form.
stay informed
business owners are often unfamiliar with the ins and outs of marketing and communication law. those who don’t think they’ll get in trouble, and ignore the law, may find themselves spending years trying to resolve issues they could have easily avoided.
to prevent a future fraught with legal risks, stay informed about marketing regulations or hire a team of trained experts, like baer performance marketing.
if legal trouble is already at your doorstep, seek the guidance of a lawyer specializing in marketing, privacy, and anti-spam laws immediately.




the role of lawyers in the marketing process

while many lawyers recognize the importance of marketing for growing their practices, there are still a great number of lawyers who are anti-marketing for various reasons. some lawyers are generally skeptical of the need for marketing, uncomfortable with the idea of “selling” to clients, or think marketing is a big waste of time. marketing may be out of the comfort zone for lawyers at first, but once they understand their role and how it can help them in their practice they are likely to gain interest . first, let’s explore some common objections to marketing and resolve any qualms about them.
marketing is not a waste of time. many lawyers think their time is better spent on “real” legal work. however, it is not necessarily the case, or even likely, that all a firm’s clients will come as a direct result of superior legal work. of course, being a good lawyer will help in this regard, but it isn’t enough to sustain your firm indefinitely. if your work slows down or competition kicks up, you are going to need a marketing strategy to gain new clients and stay in business.  
business development and marketing in the legal industry is not unethical. marketing for lawyers sometimes gets a bad rap. even some young lawyers are skeptical of whether marketing their services is professional, or worry they may alienate clients with their efforts. you can look to a state bar ethics counsel for answers to your ethics concerns or insight into how other firms reach out to clients.
you don’t need to be a professional marketer in order to market your firm. while your firm may choose to hire an outside marketing agency or expert, or dedicate members of your own staff to marketing efforts, you as a lawyer can and should be involved in most aspects of your firm’s marketing strategy. you have the legal knowledge and industry insight, and you know your target client base best. that information plus a little basic marketing training is enough to get you started.
now that you understand that marketing is both a necessary and acceptable practice for you to engage in as a lawyer, we will discuss the roles a lawyer should take in your firm’s overall marketing efforts.
build buyer personas before developing a content strategy. as a practicing lawyer, you should have a number of clients you know well, in terms of their backgrounds, values, and what they look for in a legal service. you should use this knowledge to develop buyer personas, or representations of the ideal client, for your firm’s services. this is an area of legal marketing where your work representing clients is a necessary part of the strategy. as we said, you know your target client base, so this is not a time to take a hands-off approach.
content marketing is key. once you develop your buyer personas, you will have a better idea of what type of content to create in order to appropriately market your firm. blog posts and thought-leadership pieces which you likely already produce as a lawyer are the bulk of content marketing. here, your role as a lawyer is essential again because you are the legal professional. take the opportunity to enlighten your audience with content that showcases your legal knowledge and expertise.
generate new leads from relationships with existing clients. some lawyers will say that they get the majority of their clients from referrals, making other marketing tactics unnecessary. referrals are indeed a great source of leads, but marketing efforts can strengthen and expand your referral network rather than replace it. you can then leverage the network of people who trust your firm by getting client testimonials and using these to market your firm. marketing from the perspective of a “regular” person instead of a lawyer will help potential clients feel less like you are selling to them.
continue using traditional marketing methods. “old school” lawyers especially will be happy to hear that even in today’s digital era, traditional marketing still has value. appearing at speaking engagements, hosting workshops, and attending networking events are great ways to build relationships in the industry and gain consistent leads. you can combine this practice with digital marketing efforts by advertising and promoting these events online.
leverage your social media presence. social media marketing is a must when it comes to marketing the law firm in today’s age. while you can delegate posting on social media to marketing staff, being comfortable using social platforms yourself can be helpful in growing your network. leverage your own personal contacts through facebook and professional contacts on linkedin to gain leads and expand your reach.
