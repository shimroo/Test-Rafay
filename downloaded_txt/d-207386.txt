alumni testimonial
being a hindu and going to a catholic school, it may seem that you would be looked down upon for having a different religion, but in reality, every single day, father john encourages me to continue on my own journey of faith.




college-aged alum testimonial (belmont student)
i feel that gilmour academy has academically prepared me for the demands of college. gilmour's curriculum, particularly in subjects like english and math, equipped me with strong analytical and writing skills.




college-aged alum testimonial (john carroll student)
at other schools you can feel like just another number, but at gilmour i felt like i was a person whom everyone cared about.




college-aged alum testimonial (mit student)
gilmour's rigorous academics and supportive community helped build my confidence and provided me with a strong educational foundation. the catalyst research i did, the coding foundation and exposure to engineering i received, and my experience in speech and debate gave me an initial advantage over other students at mit. 




college-aged alum testimonial (ohio state student)
through the socratic-style classes, gilmour taught me how to think reflectively and analytically. through kairos, mass, our ga culture, and all the religious opportunities, my faith strengthened immensely. praxis and our service activities helped me become a more engaged global citizen.




college-aged alum testimonial (ohio state student)
i genuinely enjoyed my time at ga and am forever grateful for the memories made, lessons learned, and people met. it has left an imprint on my heart and an impact on my life that will forever be with me. not only did gilmour prepare me for college, but it prepared me for the real world.




college-aged alum testimonial (penn state student)
i think that i have gained the ability to embody the entirety of the gilmour mission statement. i’ve gained the courage to act through my leadership skills and my communication skills. i have developed the confidence to see through my experiences and my education.




college-aged alum testimonial (westchester community college student)
i loved every second of being at ga. i really enjoy doing service and helping others and it’s one of the reasons i'm going into healthcare.




lower school parent testimonial
sending our son to gilmour was the best thing that we have ever done for him. it is like a light switch went off and he is a completely different kid when it comes to school and beyond. he now comes home happy and excited each day.




parent testimonial
i am incredibly grateful for this wonderful family that we have found at gilmour. i cannot say enough about the teachers and coaches. we have three children and private education has been a financial sacrifice, but gilmour has been worth every single penny.




parent testimonial
in the end, our daughter continues to trust her mentors and has far exceeded her own expectations academically, athetically and personally. we are forever grateful to the entire gilmour academy team for giving our child an opportunity to be her best self.
