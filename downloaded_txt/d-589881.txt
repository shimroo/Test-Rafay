if you have been recently tested, 
				  and are hiv negative, but still may be at risk for hiv visit
				  prep.org 
				  for information on how to avoid your risk of becoming hiv positive and information 
				  about pre-exposure 
				  prophylaxes. (prophylaxis comes from a greek word meaning to guard against 
				  and describes a form of protection from infection or disease.)
if you hare hiv positive, hiv treatment 
				  works. (see side bar for more information) and use  the widget above to find resources in your 
				  area.
with prep and treatment as prevention, we have an 
				  unprecedented opportunity to achieve the vision of the				usa national hiv strategy : "the united states will become 
				  a place where new hiv infections are rare and when they do 
				  occur, every person regardless of age, gender, race/ethnicity, 
				  sexual orientation, gender identity or socio-economic 
				  circumstance, will have unfettered access to high quality, 
				  life-extending care, free from stigma and discrimination." (
				  aids.gov )
no matter what your status is, we are all hiv = 
stop the stigma
