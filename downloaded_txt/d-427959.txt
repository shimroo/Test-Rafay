leading health education accreditation
as a leader in health education accreditation for over 40 years, abhes has been nationally recognized by the u.s. secretary of education as a private, non-profit, independent accrediting agency since 1969. it has been at the forefront of advancing the quality of health education programs throughout the country.
abhes enhances the quality of education and training and promotes institutional and programmatic accountability through systematic and consistent program evaluation. its key is to assure the quality of the programs it accredits, and assist in the improvement of the programs. this quality-determination is accomplished by rigorous and systematic evaluation based on valid standards.
the goals of abhes focus on three key areas: recognition, resources, and service; all of which it believes are essential and paramount to achieving its mission.
abhes’s diversity and inclusion statement demonstrates its belief that a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is essential to a well-educated healthcare workforce.  see abhes’ press release regarding its dei statement.
