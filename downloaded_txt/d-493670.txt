   auction type differences

   




  what is the difference between a "timed auction", "simulcast", and "live" auction?  timed auctions: auctions are online and bidding occurs and lots will close in order of lot #simulcast: timed auction with on-site bidders and live auctioneer. live: no online; live auctioneer and bidding is done in person. 




   do i need to be online until the auction closes?

   




  you do not need to be online until the auction closes for "timed or simulcast auctions". the platform that we utlize allows you to set a maximum bid, so if other bids are tendered the system will automatically increase your bid to the maximum. if the item is won for less than your maximum you will purchase the lot for that amount and not your maximum bid. you will be notified by the platform if your max bid is exceeded, but we caution bidders not to rely upon these notifications as they can be delayed due to technology. you do have to be onsite for live auctions.
