end of covid-19 prevention regulations requirements




  dear scusd community,


  calosha guidelines requiring contact tracing ended on 2/3/25.
  scusd will no longer require reporting of covid-19 for students.
  per cdph guidelines, for purposes of school attendance, covid-19
  should be treated similar to other endemic respiratory illnesses
  like flu or cold. per calosha, staff will continue to self-report
  positive covid-19 cases to covidreport@scusd.edu. health
  services staff will monitor cases for any outbreaks per cdph
  guidelines.
