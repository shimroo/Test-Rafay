a home from home for your wheels




an individual bike locker offers the highest level of security and are what most cyclists want. we offer hire lockers in some locations. please see the map for more details.
while multi-bike units are superior to open access parking, they are still shared with other users.
lockable cages and compounds are suitable for most locations, especially if they have a quality secure 2-tier or rounded a rack inside, as well as good lighting and visibility.
open shelters offer weather protection for short-term parking but should have good visibility and lighting.
racks and stands are adequate in buildings or for short-term parking outside.

at cycle-works we specialise in stylish, secure and innovative secure cycle parking and related infrastructure, designed to promote cycling.  since 1996 we have been working with local authorities, architects, contractors for commercial, residential and corporate projects, hospitals and healthcare practices, schools, colleges, universities, transport organisations and employers across the uk and ireland providing secure cycle parking and infrastructure solutions.
 
as a team of regular cyclists, we understand how most cyclists use cycle parking facilities and this is evident in our innovative cycle parking solutions.


we are a small but perfectly formed independent company, and have just celebrated our 21st birthday, starting in 1996.  the original goal was to raise the profile of cycling, and this remains our aim today. since then we have grown to supply a wide range of secure cycle parking and related infrastructure.
 
our products are instantly recognisable and most are designed in house, meaning there is plenty of scope for customisation to suit your project requirements. being a small independent company means we can provide a unique and personable service to you, ensuring we provide the best products for your project.
 
our goal is simple – to provide the best products for each project. this means providing quality, innovative and secure cycle parking solutions and related infrastructure. by doing so, we are helping to raise the profile of cycling by having more quality cycle parking facilities available for cyclists to use.


we pride ourselves on our knowledge and expertise, ensuring we provide the best range of product for your project.  by keeping up to date and in the know of recent developments, industry advancements and changes in regulations, we can better understand and fulfil our customers’ requirements.


where possible, we use local raw materials and always consider the impact we have on the environment. we try to avoid travelling with an empty van, and always avoid unnecessary trips in our vans and cars.  we prefer the train and bike, and cycle to as many meetings and site visits as possible.
 
we believe that cycling is important to encourage a sustainable future and as passionate cyclists we believe cycling should be encouraged. not only is it good for our personal health, it is also good for the environment – reducing our carbon footprint one ride at a time.


we’re a fun and diverse team of passionate cyclists. we believe that as regular cyclists we understand the importance of secure and innovative cycling solutions, so much so that all of our designs are created in house with fellow cyclists in mind.


we are proud to be associated with many different leading industry groups:
