arlington family connection is an organization of local parents dedicated to connecting families with children ages six and under while providing support and enrichment.
it takes a village to raise a child. and that village starts with connections. at afc, we want to help get you connected to other parents and families who are right now living many of the same experiences as you. we want to help build your village by meeting people and providing resources. join us today and get more connected.
