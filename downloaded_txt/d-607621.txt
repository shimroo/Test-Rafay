equations play a crucial role in modern mathematics and form the
basis for mathematical modelling of numerous phenomena and processes in
science and engineering.

the international scientific-educational website eqworld presents extensive
information on solutions to various classes of
ordinary differential,
partial differential,
integral,
functional,
and other mathematical equations. it also outlines
some methods for solving equations, includes interesting articles,
gives links to mathematical websites and software packages, lists useful handbooks and
monographs, and refers to scientific publishers, journals, etc. the website
includes a dynamic section equation archive which allows
authors to quickly publish their equations (differential, integral, and other)
and also exact solutions, first integrals, and transformations.
the eqworld website is intended for
researchers, university teachers, engineers, and students all over the world. it contains
about 2000 webpages and is visited by
over 3000 users a day (coming from 200 countries worldwide).
all resources presented on this site are free to its users.


''need the solution for the generalized abel integral equation of the second
kind? stumped by the fitzhugh-nagumo equation, which can describe heat transfer
and the voltage across a cell membrane? check out eqworld ...
eqworld gathers solutions that had been squirreled away in handbooks, journals,
and other sources. the site includes ordinary and partial differential equations ...''

''... eqworld provides general solutions to many types of equations that
  scientists and engineers are likely to encounter. the website also includes articles and
  reading lists.''
