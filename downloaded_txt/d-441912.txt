the noah chang memorial foundation

the noah chang memorial foundation is proud to partner with redondo sunset to help further the game of baseball and softball for the children in our community. our son noah discovered his love of the game while playing at redondo sunset. we believe this was only possible because of the amazing parents, families, coaches and volunteers that are a part of this organization. we hope that our gifts can provide for those families in need and give their children the opportunity to play and enjoy this beautiful game. to donate and learn more about the noah chang memorial foundation please click here.
