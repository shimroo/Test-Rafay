meet the talker team













we help brands + agencies
spread the word 






 



ideas + inspiration 



two heads are better than one, right? our news and research team brainstorm ideas and story angles with “talk value” — working with you to build a narrative that’s a perfect fit for your brand. 





 



media-ready news stories 



we produce topical and engaging content that publishers want to use. people stories, not product promos. news copy, not press releases. newsworthy insights that earn coverage. 





 



insights + opinions 



research is a powerful storytelling tool. together with talker research, we use online polling to explore topics, gather opinions and tell original, interesting and newsworthy stories. 





 



earned coverage 



your story is distributed via our proprietary newsfeed, with additional outreach by our dedicated media team. regularly picked up by news, consumer and specialist sites, we guarantee earned coverage. 





 



visual + social assets 



bring your story to life! we design eye-catching visuals including infographics, animations, interactives and social media assets. everything is packaged for the media, ready to use. 





 



reusable content + data 



don’t be a one-hit wonder — you can keep the conversation going by publishing your research findings, sharing your story across your own channels, and amplifying your content.
