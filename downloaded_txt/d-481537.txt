shelley

  

music runs through shelley ruffin's life with all the depth and breadth of the mighty mississippi coursing past her hometown. a southern girl steeped in delta soul, she's carried a melody in her heart since her formative years, advancing an almost genetic predisposition to the art form. born and raised in memphis, tennessee, shelley is the granddaughter of a '30s-era big band leader, guitar/banjo player and songwriter who regularly opened for guy lombardo. the rich musical landscape of the city focused around historic beale street--her maiden name, interestingly, is beale-- immersed young shelley in sounds and styles unconcerned with the demands and categories of commercial music. shelley’s early years were heavily influenced by musical greats such as patsy cline, bonnie raitt, anita baker, stevie nicks, marvin gaye, stevie wonder, michael mcdonald, elton john, earth wind & fire, and elvis.  “i can’t be still and sing,” she smiles, recalling that early exposure to “the king”.  “my previous band members teased and called me “shelvis” because i grew up in memphis, loved elvis, and he was my first live concert!” from an early age singing and performing was always a constant for shelley, be it in church choir, competitive ensembles or just around the house with family back in memphis. music has always had a big presence in shelley’s life, from her grandfather’s big band career, to memories of her dad singing soul/blues music with her as a child, to her step-dad singing with opera memphis, to her younger brother’s, timmy jones, current career as an award winning studio and touring drummer.  “our home has forever been filled with music.  it’s just always been there…there is always a song in my head.” after moving to the music scene in nashville, her first gigs came singing backup for a music city r&b singer.  she then connected with a friend and memphis-based songwriter and performed at songwriter nights all over nashville and eventually progressed to headlining her own shows, doing live radio and tv.  with career highlight experiences that include performing at the ryman auditorium, the blue bird cafe, tootsies world famous orchid lounge, nissan stadium, vanderbilt stadium, wsm radio and fox 17 morning show, just to name a few, it wasn’t long before the music industry recognized shelley as a very serious and talented member.  shelley has spent years perfecting her trade, through live performance and studio work, learning the ropes and honing her style. the sounds she gravitates toward have a common thread; a distinct soulful flavor. there’s no doubt she has been influenced by southern gospel, r&b, rock and country. she loves blending styles and adding her own interpretation of all the singers that influenced her love for music.  she always points to her early hero, patsy cline. “she had a real bluesy vibe that was very different from what was going on around her.  people felt and believed what she sang and i am drawn to those same things. the soulfulness that comes from inside you, getting lost in the song you’re singing, singing from the heart….that’s what i love.” a large part of shelley’s appeal and distinction has always been just that, singing her songs with the emotion and feelings that connect her listeners with their own life experiences, shelley’s music moves listeners emotionally, whether it’s in a small listening room like the bluebird cafe, at a festival like booms day, or large venues such as nissan stadium.  “connecting”…that is successful singing to shelley, “that is what music is really about to me”.  she says “i think it is important for listeners to be able to be taken back to a certain place and time or to look at their current life situation and connect with what they hear on a personal level.  i am personally drawn to music that moves your heart and stirs your soul.  but, i also think it is just as important to provide music that makes people cut loose and have a little fun.  music is really magical like that, it can pull your heartstrings, make you smile, cry, laugh, or even dance like nobody is watching.” shelley, both live and in the studio, has been blessed and honored to work with many of nashville’s finest music industry legends. she has been accompanied by these world class musicians whose awards and credits are far too many to list. on guitar: brent mason (musicians hall of fame), erik halbig, jeff king, audley freed, rich herring, and jack daniels; keys: michael rojas, chris nole, and gordon mote; pedal steel: bruce boutin and mike johnson; bass: mike chapman (musicians hall of fame) and kevin grant; fiddle: jimmy mattingly and larry franklin; drums: lonnie wilson, steve turner and andy hull; background vocalists: judy rodman, carol chase, lisa gregg, micah roberts, michael black, john wesley riles, and rodney ingle; harmonica: jelly roll johnson; the memphis horns; and the nashville symphony strings; and, never forget the man behind the sound board, ronny palmer. there are many, more who are not specifically mentioned that are every bit as talented and important to the quality of shelley’s product. she thanks each and every one of you from the bottom of her heart.  shelley’s nashville music history can’t be told without a special mention of one of the nicest and most talented people in the industry, the late mike chapman. mike was not only a great friend and family man, but also just happened to be one of garth brooks’ “g men”; the five musicians who played on all of his original studio projects. mike played bass on albums that have sold over 160 million copies, including over 30 #1 hits. he was also the first person to produce shelley in the studio. unbelievable to work with and a great mentor, mike and his wife, connie, introduced shelley to the nashville music scene. their friendship and mike’s talent will never be forgotten. the world lost a great bassist and friend with the passing of mike. (songs noted with an *mc on shelley’s “songs” page were both played on and produced by mike). “music is my passion, without it i feel like there is a huge void inside of me. it is and always has been a huge part of my family, and will always be a part of me.” “if you sing a song today you will make a better way…” earth wind & fire
