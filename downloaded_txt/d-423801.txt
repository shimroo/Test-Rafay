*results may vary. minimum purchase required. some restrictions apply and discounts may not be used for online purchases. 

when you enroll in a medical weight loss clinic program, the length of your program will be determined by you and the staff based on the amount of weight you want to lose and how quickly you want to lose it. your actual weight loss will be determined by many factors, including, but not limited to: your medical circumstances, the plan you choose, adherence to the meal plan and use of nutritional supplements. your goal and program duration information will be given to you in writing at the time of enrollment. as your program progresses, the rate you lose weight may change and you will have the opportunity to discuss this at every daily visit with your weight loss consultant, where changes to your meal plan and/or program can be made.
