inside out is a dynamic documentary 
                unit producing long-format radio programs and multi-part series. 
                highly experienced reporters turn a topic inside out to give it 
                context, perspective, and understanding. a unique emphasis on 
                the sounds and voices of a story, combined with first class narration 
                engages the listener and brings them to the heart of the story.  (documentaries are now also available as a podcast.)
