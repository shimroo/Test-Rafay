crystal clearselector epv recordingscrystal clear steps up on v recordings with a brand new ep, boasting a vibrant, razor-sharp collection of cuts that perfectly balance jungle heritage with more contemporary neurotic themes. we open up with the title track 'selector" alongside the legendary bryan g, delivering reese drives and grizzly horn swipes for a sizzling introduction, before 'earthquake' sees amoss join the project for another fiery fusion of synthy madness. from here, more high energy ideas as minor forms joins the party on 'bones', a silkier original that takes us down a new  avenue; with kathryn brenna's euphoric vocals giving us a killer closer on the gnarly grinds of 'slow it down'. killer work for sure!...read more exclusivedisco techthe reworks vol 4discodatafter rapidly releasing volumes one to three in his popular 'the reworks' series at the tail end of 2024, disco-tech continues his push towards re-edit scene domination by serving up part four in the continuing project. the sweden-based producer has delivered a typically diverse and smoothly revised collection of cuts, confidently striding between straightened-out, head-nodding dancefloor soul ('amazing happiness'), soul-fired mid-tempo headiness ('talking about slick'), stretched-out and lightly dubbed-out sade rearrangements ('feels like heaven'), house style disco chuggers ('the stuff'), heavyweight disco/swamp-funk fusion (the appropriately titled 'foot stomp') and slo-mo conscious soul tweaks ('city blues', which definitely makes us wanna holler, and the similarly minded 'what we love')....read more demi riquisimo6 years of semi delicioussemi deliciouslast year, demi riquismo decided to mark five years of his semi delicious label by delivering an ep containing tracks he'd recorded, but never released, during the imprint's first year. to celebrate reaching six years, he's put together an expansive and essential collection of some of the imprint's previously vinyl-only gems. naturally, the quality threshold remains high from start to finish, with our picks of a very strong bunch including the organ-rich, revivalist garage shuffle of jive talk's 'uk gary', the big room-friendly hedonism of aldonna's trippy 'inner elation', the disco-tinged tactility of kassian's 'midnight district line' and demi riquisito's own colourful and nostalgic 'rocking you internally' standing out. that said, baby rollen's 'deep asleep' - a loose-limbed exploration of larry heard flavours and undulating acid lines - may well be the best of the bunch....read more variouscrosstown rebels present spirits viicrosstown rebelsdamian lazarus unfurls the latest edition of crosstown rebels 'spirits' compilation series, once again serving up a varied and interesting collection of cuts from a blend of rising stars and established producers. in the latter camp you'll find uk scene stalwart dino lenny, who impresses with the driving, ever-building dub disco darkness of 'i have sampled father', and the surprise hook up between timo maas and inamo on the deep, shuffling and creepy tech-house headiness of 'le tourbillion'. some of the finest material is provided by the lesser-celebrated artists involved, with share's deliciously bass-heavy and percussive 'oh please (feat def ef)', john monkman's atmospheric 'colours' anad enamour's warming and gently dreamy 'jackpot' standing out....read more alaricosonoraprimal instinctfollowing last year's carnal fever ep, alarico returns to primal instinct to release his latest album. sonora is a collection of two years of recording and live performances - and reflects a wide range of techno flavours. "iruka" and "caresses after lies" fuse breathy vocals and resonating, melancholic bass tones with insistent drums, making for soulful but club-focused tracks. "boiler" and "stingray" both dispense with the sound of the human voice, focusing on robust kicks, hissing percussion and detuned riffs. "i used to like god" offers a leftfield perspective on alarico's sound, with staccato drums, stuttering samples and incessant claps colliding. in contrast, "ashes of regrets" resounds to moody chord sequence and an ominous, rolling groove....read more prince palmerlucky charmbobby donnyfollowing a low-key digital release last year, prince palmer's bobby donny label debut returns to platforms in expanded form. alongside the three tracks featured the original release - the pleasingly loose-limbed, revivalist garage-house bump of 'serious play', the more stripped-back and rhythmically swinging deep garage-house workout 'get down' an d the fizzing, jovonn-esque 'wake up mix' of 'sleeping city' - we get a trio of additional treats. label boss frits wentink doffs a cap to the sound factory era of nyc house on his vasquez and tenaglia-inspired rework of 'airlift', roy jenkins boosts the bass and adds additional rhythmic swing on a solid revision of 'serious play', and prince palmer serves up bonus cut 'polygon island', which sits somewhere between burrell brothers style new age house and chunky new jersey deep house....read more
