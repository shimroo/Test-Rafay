 commercial landscape & seeding services seeds of life is experienced in commercial landscape design and installation.  we understand plants and how to design a site that is functional, aesthetically pleasing, and practical to maintain. we achieve this by using trees, shrubs, perennials, ornamental grasses, turf areas, and native grass/wildflower areas that are hardy for that area and conditions for each specific type of site. we have installed sites up to 45 acres on many sites. we have landscaped churches, schools, homeowner associations, commercial, retail, industrial, restaurant, and military sites.
