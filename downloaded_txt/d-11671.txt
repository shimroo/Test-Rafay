chicago’s retro dinerfamous since 1984

 









 























since1984ed debevic’s is chicago’s most famous retro-themed diner. quirky servers in flashy costumes serve up great burgers, jumbo wieners, cheese fries, huge salads, milkshakes, and ice cream sundaes with a side order of sass! don’t expect this diner to be a “please” and “thank you” kind of place. the servers pride themselves on snarky remarks and even drop their trays to do choreographed dance numbers on the soda counters!
