twin births: a growing trend in low-income countries
the number of mothers giving birth at an older age is increasing in many countries in sub-saharan africa and southern asia. this leads to a higher likelihood of multiple births, which are mostly twins. a study by the max planck institute for demographic research (mpidr) has found that the rate of twin births in low-income countries could increase significantly by 2100 even if the spread of assisted reproductive technology such as ivf remains slow. the findings call for better maternal and perinatal care in these countries.  more

understanding the increase in stillbirth rates in germany amid european declines
the stillbirth rate in europe has been steadily improving over the last few decades, but there are some exceptions. in germany and belgium, rates have significantly increased since 2010, while other european countries have seen declines or stability. researchers from the max planck institute for demographic research (mpidr) have investigated how factors like increasing maternal age and multiple births may have influenced these trends and differences across europe. the analyses indicate that these factors explain only a small portion of the variations.  more
