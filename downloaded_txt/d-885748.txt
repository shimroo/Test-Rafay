charles bibbs contemporary visual artist entrepreneur and philanthropist
internationally acclaimed artist charles bibbs, whose work is featured in museums, galleries, organizations, and homes of many collectors, displays a deep sense of spirituality, majesty, dignity, strength and grace in his images, that is done in a combination of realistic and larger-than-life interpretations of contemporary subjects that are ethnically rooted.
born in san pedro, california, and raised in harbor city, california, bibbs managed to work an eight-hour job, and use his god-given talent in his spare time. but in 1991, bibbs decided to leave his management position of 25 years, to form his own publishing and distribution company, b graphics and fine arts, inc. today, bibbs is one of the top-selling artists in the country, and his company has grown to be one of the leaders in the african american art print market.
bibbs strongly believe that we are the âkeepers of our culture,â and as such, have spent much of his time serving on boards of museums and art organizations to support the art community. he has lectured, and conducted panels and workshops in major cities, including the charles wright african american museum in detroit, urban league of pittsburg and the riverside metropolitan museum. he has a sincere passion for supporting the youth, and as such, has mentored, taught and conducted numerous workshops for young aspiring artists.
in his quest to preserve and develop the visual arts, bibbs founded images magazine, the first national publication dedicated to contemporary african american art, art 2000 visual arts association, art on tour, the inland empire music and arts foundation, co-founder of the creative quarantine, an artist and residence program. in his professional artist career, bibbs owned 6 art galleries, including the popular 626 art gallery at studio b, located in the historic art district of los angeles downtown.
bibbs continues to receive recognition and appreciation not only for his distinctive style images, but for his philanthropic spirit. through his art, he has supported numerous scholarship fundraisers, and youth programs, and made substantial contributions to organizations nationwide, including the naacp, united negro college fund, associated black charities, morehouse college, howard university, pnc bank, tom joyner hbc scholarship foundation, national urban league, alpha phi alpha and delta sigma theta.
bibbs is profiled in many publications, ebony jet, upscale, ebony male, just to name a few, and has interviewed on numerous radio and television programs including the tavis smiley show, steve harvey radio show, and tv one studio. his work has been shown on the sets of many popular television sitcoms and movies. in 2008, bibbs created the âblack madonnaâ image for the fox searchlight film, âthe secret life of bees,â and was the first visual artist to be hired to create for a fox searchlight film.
