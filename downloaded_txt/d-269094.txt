wonderful stitches320 decorative stitches for needlepoint





this classic needlepoint reference  is finally available again, and this time in a full color edition. wonderful stitches contains a lavishly illustrated collection of 320 decorative stitches ranging from small, exquisite diaper patterns, such as ginghams and roses to more elaborate, multicolored, fancy stitch motif combinations.  also included is an original, simple method of stitching that can duplicate the triangles and squares used in hundreds of early american patchwork quilt designs. another unusual section of stitches simulates lace, as well as some blackwork, a 17th century technique done on elaborately embellished costumes of the period.  the final chapters not only continue the collection but reveal how borders are created as well as how to create an endless array of new original patterns.this new edition can be ordered through lulu. you can also see some preview pages at our lulu store.
