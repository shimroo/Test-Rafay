wright tavern



























welcome to the wright tavern!



our vision for the wright tavern is to create a gathering place, an educational center for meetings, events and reenactments, where refreshments can be enjoyed and one can become immersed in the history of the wright tavern.


























in the center of concord, massachusetts, stands a building that was built in 1747 and has witnessed significant events in the founding and progress of the united states. today, we have completed major structural repairs and stabilization project.  while there are many more improvements needed for the building, it is now “open for visitors.”   the project to repair, restore, renovate and manage the wright tavern for the public is being led by the wright tavern legacy trust. first parish in concord currently owns the building. the trust is an independent, non-profit trust that has leased the building from first parish and is leading the effort described below. we, the trust, seek your support to help us realize our vision and aspirations for this building and enable the wright tavern to take its rightful place in telling the stories of concord’s history and the founding of the united states. our vision and plans are to create the wright tavern into an active gathering place and tavern operating within an interactive museum. the building is open for guided tours and for meeting space rentals.  you can contact the concord visitor’s center and schedule a tour of the tavern. you may also contact us if you are interested in hosting a meeting, event, celebration or a special tour for your group.  see the contact page to get in touch with us or reach out at info@wrighttavern.org.  when you think of a place to get together with friends, remember what people said in colonial america:“let’s meet at the wright tavern.”
