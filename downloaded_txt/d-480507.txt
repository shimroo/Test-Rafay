welcome to st. martha parish




hello and welcome to st. martha parish in downtown sarasota, in the diocese of venice, florida! we are a diverse community which is open to new spiritual gifts. we hope that when you visit, you will experience the joy of redemption in the sacraments of our church, celebrated here and in the word of god proclaimed. most of our priests are pallottines, the spiritual sons of st. vincent pallotti, who teaches us to constantly revive our faith and ignite our love and help others to do the same for the infinite glory of god.
 in the bible, st. paul wrote a long time ago to the christians in ephesus:
“… preserve the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace: one body and one spirit …,
one god and father of all, who is over all and through all and in all”
(eph. 4: 3, 6).
united people build peace, but people united by the peace that jesus gives become peacemakers. we look forward to having you among us and help us to build the kingdom of god!
with prayers for god’s blessing to you and your family, 
fr. george suszko, s.a.c.
pastor
