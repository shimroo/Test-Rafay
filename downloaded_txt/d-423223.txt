meet jeffrey
while watching tv at the tender age of 6, jeffrey's great grandmother, mary, appeared in front of him and spoke. what made this incident unusual is that mary had been dead for over 23 years.
this incident was jeffrey's first psychic experience and was the beginning of his life work as a psychic. other psychic experiences followed that were both visual and audio. he not only could communicate with the dead but he could also predict events and information about people. he did not label his ability but he knew it was different. in fact, he repressed his ability in fear that his peers would think him a freak.
he wasn't always successful in hiding his ability. occasionally, he would blurt out indiscriminate information such as baseball game scores or health information for his friends and family. he never revealed too much information so people wouldn't get suspicious. however, his predictions were so accurate that people took notice.
