progress update



i've been making good progress with the pending orders. like i mentioned in my previous post, the orders with multiple icons (and there are several of these) are taking longer just because of the sheer volume of work.  i apologize  for any delays.if you're concerned about your order, as always, please feel free to email me.  i hope to make a considerable dent in the work list this weekend.

checking in



i'm still here!  just wanted to touch base in case anyone was watching here for anything.  i'm still not accepting any new orders (sorry).  all old orders have been completed and accounted for on my end.  if you were expecting one, and haven't received your icon...please contact me.  i've had a few emails bounce back, so i want to make sure everyone is getting what they paid for.cheers.

bounced orders



it's come to my attention that a large number of orders that i sent out a while ago were bounced back to me without my noticing.  as a precautionary measure, i've started re-sending orders i suspect were affected.  if you've placed an order anytime within the past 3 months and have yet to get your icon, just send me an email, because chances are, it may have gotten caught in this snafu.i'm really sorry for any problems this may have caused.

back on track



hey all!after a few intense weeks of playing catch-up, i'm pretty much caught up. i've been having some email issues with a few orders. i'm not sure if the problem is our servers. so, please make sure that once you receive your order you send me a reply confirming receipt.on other news, for all you techies out there, i've just switched to adobe cs3. which means i'm working all orders on the coolest illustrator software yet. i'm still stumbling my way around things, but i'm set on mastering it pretty soon. this of course is good news for all our clients, since i'll be using a few goodies that ship with the new version of the program on their orders.

a dent



i made a pretty solid dent in the backorder today and sent out about 1/3 of the icons that i had pending.  a few more days like this (where it's raining non-stop and i'm stuck inside) and the backorder will go away very quickly. a few of you have rather large orders (3-5+ icons).   because of how long it can take to complete the entire set, let me know if you'd prefer to have the icons delivered as i complete each one.  a few of you have already contacted me about this...no need to email again if we've already discussed this. and once again-  a big thanks to all of you who have shown infinite patience as i work through all this.  as always, never hesitate to drop me a line if you have any questions.

more pointless delays



sorry, but once again the gods have interfered and decided to delay my iconize me work even further.  my graphics tablet pen decided to stop functioning the other day.  without the pen, i can't draw the orders.  i ordered a new one that evening, but it was past their shipping deadline.  and now with the weekend here, it look like it will be at least monday before it arrives. as always, please feel free to email me with any questions or concerns:  paulsahner@gmail.com

orders and delays



hi everyone,i'd like to thank all my customers for their patience right now as i work through some delays.  currently, my workload is only allowing me 1-2 days per week when i am able to work on iconize me orders-  which simply isn't enough to get all orders out within the standard "2-week" period. i know some of you have been waiting a while-  i really am sorry.i can understand how frustrating it can be to purchase something blindly on the internet.  if you are uncomfortable with waiting any more i would be more than happy to issue a full refund at your request.  otherwise, just hang tight, and i promise to get everyone's icons done.   if you're under a time constraint and actually need the illustrations for whatever reason (as a gift, etc)-  please email me and i'll see what i can do about expediting your order.things will calm down for me in may and i'll be able to devote a lot more time to getting everything complete.again, thank you everyone for your orders and patience.  if you have any questions, don't hesitate to email me.

iconize, blog, and dvg



i've been working hard to send out icons that have been ordered in the past few weeks.  i hope people are enjoying them.  if you haven't received your order yet and are concerned, please feel free to email me. my order page is still open at iconize me!, so anyone who's interested in finally getting an icon can do so.if you've never been the blog before, or never really paid much attention to it, then you may not have noticed i revamped it's design a bit.  the overall design is actually mimicking my own personal site.  but, whatever.  i think it's a much-needed improvement.  i'm going to try to post here more...about iconize me, dvg and anything design-related.and what about dv graphics?  well, it's been throughly ignored for nearly a year now.  i've just been so busy that i've been unable to post anything new to it.  also, it's hard to find things that are worthy of being posted there.  my person work goes on my personal site and deviantart.  designs-in-progress go on the partners in design blog.  and everything else has been posted to this blog or iconize me!.  i'm going to try to get some desktops or icons created to post on dvg eventually. the site is still getting a few thousand hits a week, and for some reason, november and december of last year had record hits-  so it's far from dead.

domain problems



i have no idea whats going on-  but i'm having some domain issues.  i couldn't say for how long it's been going on or for how much longer it's going to be happening, but i'm going to wait it out until tomorrow night-  at which point i'll start taking more action.  if you really want to get to the various dvg sites, you can do so through here:iconize me!:http://s106475891.onlinehome.us/iconizeme/dvg:http://s106475891.onlinehome.us/
