boston dance alliance’s 2024 year in review
         
 

as we dance our way into a new year, we wanted to take a moment to celebrate the strides that boston dance alliance made last year with this one-page year-in-review for 2024.
it summarizes not only the number of dancers we supported last year across our five program areas but also the accomplishments of so many members of bda’s dance community.
in 2024, we were also happy to see an increase of more than $100,000 in fiscally-sponsored bda members’ access to resources to advance their dance work.  for more on this and other financial highlights from last year, please see the second & final part of bda’s 2024 year-in-review.
 

we’re honored to support all of you in your journey in dance and to see all of that you’ll bring to life through dance in 2025.
 
let’s make moves!

aaron myers, executive director

 




a gift for bda’s future celebrates a dance community member
  
 

boston dance alliance received a $150,000 donation from the estate of christine hamersley (l.), a dance enthusiast and adult
dance student who lived in duxbury, mass. the donation, arranged by hamersley’s sister barbara bollin, will support the purchase of a new portable dance floor and establish a fund for bda’s annual open audition & dancer health day initiative, which will be named for hamersley. bollin says hamersley was a beloved figure in the boston dance community, known for her warmth and inclusivity, and for welcoming dancers of all backgrounds to the jeannette neill dance studio, where she studied for decades.
hamersley also created and managed a regional dance affinity facebook group that became a platform where dancers and
organizations alike made connections and found professional opportunities. the gift will fund critical resources for local dancers, including a new professional grade portable dance floor that bda will offer at below-market rates to dance companies and
organizations hosting dance events across greater boston. it also will support and expand bda programs that manage open-call auditions each year (allowing dancers to find work with regional choreographers) and offer dancer health and wellness resources through a bda partnership with spaulding rehabilitation and its director of dance medicine lauren elson, md, a bda board member.
bda executive director aaron myers says the donation, which elson helped to facilitate, will be structured to provide support in perpetuity and honor christine’s spirit of kindness, inclusivity and passion. “these gifts to boston dance alliance create a legacy of support for the greater boston dance communities and its artists,” myers says. “that they also honor a cherished member of our community makes it even more special. boston dance alliance takes great pride in celebrating and carrying on christine’s remarkable dance legacy for many years to come.”



news
what’s new in the boston dance world


dear bda community,
with the lunar new year this week and the beginning of the year of the snake, i’m drawn to reflecting on the wisdom, elegance and renewal that the snake symbolizes in some asian cultures.
at bda we’re all about sharing long developed wisdom with the community and continuously learning as our dance ecosystem evolves. we’re committed to finding innovative ways to support dancers & dance lovers throughout all stages of their life, letting go of practices that no longer work and adapting to new ones.
i’m excited to enter this new cycle with you. i’m looking forward to all the new ways to see the greater boston area dance!
warmly,

carmen s. rizzo, membership & operations associate



congratulations to recipients of the festivals & projects grants!
in a time when connection and community feel more essential than ever, festivals and cultural projects serve as powerful reminders of what brings us together. mass cultural council awarded 740 grants totaling $1.85 million through festivals & projects in fy25.
we are also thrilled that fy25 festivals & projects grant recipients underscored mass cultural council’s equity and inclusion goals:

76% are offering their program free to the public.
59% have not received mass cultural council support in the last three years.
46% will bring programs to under-resourced communities.
32% are bipoc-centered organizations.

notably:

98% of eligible bipoc-centered applicants received funding
94% of eligible first-time or returning applicants received funding

the efforts to expand support to organizations that have been underrepresented in the past is seen and vastly appreciated.

welcome to the bda community!

madison florence is bda’s newest fiscally sponsored artist and we are enthusiastic about her new project coming up: finding space. the concept started as a multipart series focusing on women in stem and was in development when the pandemic began in march 2020. over time, the focus on space grew and representing more identities became important in telling this story since many people shared and share similar plights.
finding space is now in progress with the goal of telling the history and current stories of people who identify as women, people of color or bipoc, queer, trans, nonbinary, parents, and all who have contributed but have not received the recognition for their work or had to fight harder for it. this piece is currently in process with plans to arrive at an evening-length performance in winter of 2026.
