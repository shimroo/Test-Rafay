don‚Äôt add the sauce to the pasta, add the pasta to the sauce. the hot sauce continues to cook the pasta, intensifying its flavor. simply drain your pasta one or two minutes earlier than usual to prevent overcooking and then add the pasta to the pot where the sauce is cooking. üçÖ #rightwaytopasta #sangiorgiopasta #sangiorgio #pasta #pastalover #cookingathome #cookingtips #pastagram #pastaaddict #dinnertime #dinnertonight #cookingram #cooking #cookingtime #food #foodstagram #pastahacks #hacks
