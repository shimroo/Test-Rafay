what we do
as a member-led network connecting over 250+ civil society organisations worldwide, we champion a network approach to peacebuilding. concretely, this means we support and empower each other to drive locally-led and locally-owned peacebuilding. we do so by creating vibrant and collaborative learning and exchange spaces.
