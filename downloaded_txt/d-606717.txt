preparing


                        tomorrow's teachers to use technology
                        2001-2005

widening


                              the pathway to a teaching credential

                            the teaching and learning interchange
                            developed a research-informed model for
                            supporting pre-credential classroom teachers
                            to acquire both subject matter competence
                            and knowledge of teaching pedagogy and
                            classroom management. the interchange
                            content is aligned with the californiaâs
                            k-12 student academic content and teacher
                            performance standards that were in effect
                            during the development period from
                            2002-2005.


collaborations

                            technologies and video streaming as the
                            medium for distributing content-based
                            instruction, inquiry into effective
                            classroom practice through case study, and
                            to facilitate access to new teacher
                            mentoring. these technologies supported the

                                technology standards for teachers and
                                the iste national educational technology

outcomes

                            the over-arching goals of the tli project
                            was to make the technology tools transparent
                            while supporting new teachers to acquire the
                            essential skills necessary for effective
                            teaching; to provide a mechanism to
                            distribute/share learning among
                            participants, mentor teachers and experts
                            and to provide means for participants to
                            collaborate and meet without the barriers of
                            time and place.
