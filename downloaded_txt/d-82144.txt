aboutnewground
get 100+ yearsof innovation on your side









1913-1940s
we started as a st. louis-based fixtures and equipment company for the financial industry. we became a national presence as a design and build firm named the bank building and equipment corporation of america.









1950s-1970s
we invested in architectural innovation. we introduced drive-up windows for banks, designed howard johnson's iconic orange tile roof, and created the celebrated western savings bank branch in phoenix, ariz.









1980s-90s
we led the way in the digital revolution, opened our first canadian office, brought digital signage to banking, and became the first environmental design and merchandising company for financial institutions.









2000s-2010s
we relaunched as newground with offerings across strategy, design, build, and interiors. we entered the international market with a prototype for santander bank and opened our chicago office.









2019-2020s
we expanded into retail and hospitality verticals with clients that include starbucks, dior, oil changers, and choice hotels. we opened offices in vancouver, b.c., and denver, colo.









today
newground international plans, designs, and builds innovative workplaces and retail locations that turn heads and accelerate growth — across verticals.
