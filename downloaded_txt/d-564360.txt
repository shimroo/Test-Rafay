hello everyone and welcome to our home

since time immemorial the people of soboba have lived within the present day san jacinto valley and surrounding areas. the soboba indian reservation, home to both luiseño and cahuilla people, is nestled in the foothills of the san jacinto mountains near the city of san jacinto, ca.
today, the soboba band of luiseño indians is a federally-recognized tribal government that exercises our right to self-governance and self-determination. the results of exercising these rights can be seen in both our tribal government and our business enterprises. diversification within our many business enterprises have allowed us to support the well-being of our tribal members by providing a wide range of services through tribal government programs. this is seen through our tribal administration such as the soboba fire department, public works, cultural programs and many others.
we welcome you to learn more about the people of soboba – both our rich history and current progress – and see how we have supported not only our tribe, but our surrounding communities as well.
