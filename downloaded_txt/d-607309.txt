"quiet, calm deliberation disentangles every knot."from board president, catherine weatbrookdear seattle g&s society members,pirates of penzance was a fantastic show and i’m immensely proud of the team that put it together and made magic happen right as the theatre world opened after the global pandemic. we loved seeing so many of you there and being back in the theater. the voices, the orchestra, the sets, and the lights were a spectacle worthy of great adoration. the resounding feedback that this was the best show in decades. that makes our hearts happy. we did receive some other feedback that downtown seattle is not the welcoming destination it used to be, but at least that is not due to our pirates!it is a tough time for theatre across the country, though, and seattle has some special challenges. we need to find a new way. we are actively searching for new partners and options. we have identified at least one potential partner that brings a rich history of artistic production, strong staff and leadership, and their own dedicated performance spaces. this partnership would both ensure the future of our g&s productions as well as open up new opportunities and audiences with which to share the beauty and joy of light opera and musical theater. we are actively exploring the options there, as well as other options, and you will be among the first to know if the stars align in this way. as a board, and as your president, we are working hard to secure the future of this company and the g&s productions we all love so well. we have an amazing production space in crown hill and a rich history upon which to draw, and it is my pledge to you that we will build a bright future for seattle g&s, to 70 years and beyond.i look forward to seeing you at a theater near you again. soon.all my best,catherine
