brighton beach memoirs
here is part one of neil simon’s autobiographical trilogy: a portrait of the writer as a young teen in 1937 living with his family in a crowded, lower middle–class brooklyn walk-up. eugene jerome, standing in for the author, is the narrator and central character. dreaming of baseball and girls, eugene must cope with the mundane existence of his family life in brooklyn: formidable mother, overworked father and his worldly older brother stanley. throw into the mix his widowed aunt blanche, her two young (but rapidly aging) daughters and you have a recipe for hilarity, served up simon-style. this bittersweet memoir evocatively captures the life of a struggling jewish household where, as his father states, “if you didn’t have a problem, you wouldn’t be living here.”april 4, 5, 11 and 12 at 7:30 p.m.april 6 and 13 at 2:30 p.m.

a fine family
a fine family is the story of… well… a fine family, perhaps much like one you know. this particular family is gathering for a meeting the day before a memorial service. the most eccentric family member, who apparently is falling apart, is the only one who knows what the meeting is about, and she hasn’t arrived yet. the aggrieved hostess refuses to ask for help, despite her spouse’s pleas. her know-it-all sister is convinced she can fix everything with exercise, another family member sidesteps responsibility with charm, and still another does his best to hide in plain sight. the whole family plays their “assigned” roles like only a family can.this musical comedy provides an opportunity to laugh at yourself and people you know without pointing fingers. fortunately for all of us, love wins in the end.april 25, 26 and may 2, 3 at 7:30 p.m.april 27 and may 4 at 2:30 p.m.
