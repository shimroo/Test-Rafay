heckmondwike, the point of origin of the largest tattersfield family branch
header image: the tattersfield bridge, which once spanned the lancashire and yorkshire railway line at dewsbury moor, as it appeared in the early 1980s. the line is disused and the bridge has apparently been removed or filled in. the spen valley greenway cycle path now crosses under the point where the tattersfield bridge once stood.
