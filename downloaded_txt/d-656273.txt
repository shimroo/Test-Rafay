junk  syn discard, scrap, molt





























i am finding it extremely satisfying to scavenge through jars,boxes and drawers. hunting and gathering cast off bits and trinkets to attach to chain links and pieces of forgotten jewelry...changing and rearranging for pleasures sake. i really don't think of these pieces as jewelry, accessories would be the tag i would choose. not precious,but very dear.
only at screaming mimi
