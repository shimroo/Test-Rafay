this site is a project about a preventable bizarre problem everyone has 
that was discovered to cause still-believed-harmless mental breaks for office workers 
fifty years ago.
 
 
if you did not take  first-semester college psychology 
this problem of the physiology of sight, subliminal sight, 
sounds like unbelievable science fiction
 
confined at home using a computer, tablet, or 
smart phone on-line, 
visual subliminal 
distraction is something you should learn to avoid.
 
 
the failure to use ''peripheral vision blocking protection" 
when working 
long hours from home, on social media, or playing  video 
games 
with


'vision startle reflex' causing movement nearby


created
from 
family, roommates, pets, or big screen tvs,

 can create visual subliminal distraction 
leading to


anxiety, paranoia, and in severe situations, thoughts of suicide.
 
what is the proof of those psychiatric outcomes?                                                   
this project searched for activities with mental breaks.                            
then examined each activity for the                                      
                     
"special circumstances" creating visual subliminal distraction.
qigong from china & kundalini yoga from india,                 
 recorded for 2,400 and 3,000 years respectively,      
                        
each produce the same symptoms of mental distress.     
 
that exposure happening subliminally in the brain                   
below reason and conscious thought is experienced as 
anxiety& panic attacks, depression ideation,        
 racing hearts, fear to the point of trembling.
 
since this arises from a physical situation,
 it can be experimentally created to safely produce 
light early outcomes.

current news reports cite 

former congressman patrick j kennedy as saying 
calls at suicide hotlines have increased by 800 percent
durin the virus lockdown.

 
 
the massive increased use of digital view-screen devices 
on-line,
during enforced confinement will increase the likelihood 
of family or sibling disputes when those users make
the "mental break causing deign mistake" explained here.

an outbreak of grisi siknis 
(jungle sickness) after hurricane frederick 
among moskito indians of south america shows close 
confinement 
of family groups produces the symptoms of a 
visual subliminal distraction episode.
in their culture is is believed to be caused by 
satanic possession.
 
there is circumstantial evidence this problem, happening as a 
severe episode, is the unrecognized source 
of the mental event which causes student 
disappearances/deaths and some mass shootings.
family annihilation murders are a suspected outcome.

anyone can accidentally make this "mental break causing 
design mistake" 
where students, home computer users or video game players 
spend long hours 
using deep mental investment while there is vision startle 
reflex causing movement 
nearby in their subliminal 
peripheral vision. 
 
if there is enough 
subliminal distraction exposure to cause psychiatric symptoms such as
panic/anxiety attacks, depressive episodes or believed 
psychotic behavior
the mental event  will be diagnosed as mental illness.
 
unaware of this problem requiring only education/avoidance
but no treatment to remit, 
psychiatric professionals will insist on beginning drug or 
talk therapy treatment.
 
in 2002 my wife of then 33 years had a apparent psychotic break when 
her office
in the payroll department of the university of alabama was 
changed eliminating 
cubicle level protection. 
 
she had severe reactions to drugs she should not have been 
given,
began to decline from them, (denied by her doctors) and died 
in 2010.
 
i learned of this phenomena as a 22 year old engineering 
student in 1966.  
but i had never seen the episode happen 
before. 
connie heard voices and hallucinated guilt for 
impossible delusional  crimes.
observing her experience, mistaken for mental illness, 
forms the basis for this project. 


connie's page
 
 
systems furniture design engineers have successfully dealt 
with 
this preventable office worker mental event for fifty years.
cubicles supply peripheral 
vision blocking protection to prevent 

visual subliminal distraction 
 thus preventing an uninvestigated panicked episode of 
confusion.
 
 
i discovered the entire mental health establishment 
around the world is unaware engineers 
discovered and solved the problem fifty years ago.
 
no one screens for it before diagnosing mental illness. 
 
although today there is a multi-billion dollar annual 
industry including
herman miller, steelcase, knoll, haworth, and others 
selling cubicles and installing systems furniture in 
open-plan offices
to prevent the office worker mental break,
in nine years searching i found only one psychiatrist at 
tufts university aware the problem exists.
 
he, like everyone aware of the problem, believes it 
limited to incorrectly designed high traffic offices.
it has not occurred to any of those geniuses that it is 
a problem of a 'conflict in the physiology of sight.'
it can happen anytime someone creates all the "special 
circumstances' to allow it, not just in offices.
today computers and view-screen devices allow anyone to 
do that.
 
while you can suppress the concentration breaking vision 
startle reflex when your brain assigns 
a zero level of attention to safe but distracting 
movement in peripheral vision, the trigger for the vision startle reflex,
you can't stop subliminally seeing anything in your vision field.
 
that fact of the physiology of sight,
you can't 'stop seeing' anything in your conscious or 
subliminal vision field
 defines a conflict.
 

although your conscious mind is unaware of it 
your brain continues to 
undetectably subliminally see 
vision startle reflex causing repeating threat movement 
then reacts by attempting to execute the consciousness 
forced blocked startle.
 
 
this action is explained and defined as a
visual  subliminal distraction.
 
do you have depressive episodes?
panic or anxiety attacks?
have you been diagnosed as bipolar?
 
 
learning about, then avoiding visual subliminal distraction 
will not interfere with any psychiatric 
treatment you now have. 
 
without treatment of any kind, ... 
by only avoiding the "special circumstances" 


for subliminal distraction,
... which engineers have done in business offices for fifty years ...

if
your psychiatric symptoms ...

panic/anxiety attacks, depressive episodes, thoughts of 
suicide, 

are from subliminal distraction and not mental illness, 
they will stop.
 
 
 
 
 
 
to understand this problem you must 
realize that when 
design engineers discovered the mental breaks visual 
subliminal distraction caused in 1964,
they had not created a new phenomena, 
a unique harmless mental break 
limited to incorrectly designed offices.
although they still believe that to this day.
 
critical to understanding this project, 
what they actually did was create the "special circumstances" 

to reveal that visual subliminal mental breaks existed.
 
 
subliminal distraction mental breaks have always existed acting 
through history. 
 
 
with that in mind a second investigation 
searched for recorded episodes of mental events 
then examined those situations for the possibility
 of subliminal distraction causation.
 
the first two such activities are qigong & kundalini yoga.  
 
 
as each participant concentrates while performing the katas 
of the exercise,
 others around them in the group supply threat-movement 
in peripheral vision 
copying the "mental break causing design mistake" 
engineers discovered.
 
volumes written over the centuries 
give the psychiatric outcomes of the two exercises' mental 
breaks  as
panic, anxiety, paranoia, depression, and thoughts of 
suicide.
 
today computers and digital view-screen devices require the 
same 
mental investment as office workers use.
 
thus anyone can make the "mental break causing design 
mistake"
if they allow vision startle reflex 
causing movement subliminally detectable nearby 
as they concentrate for hours with full cognitive investment 
to a level 
they are no longer aware of anything happening around them. 
 
 
again ... this project explanation  begins with the 
link 
 visual subliminal distraction.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visual  subliminal distraction mental events are not mental illness, 
but the derangement and hallucinations of a severe episode 
cannot be distinguished from mental illness. 
 
acting to avoid visual subliminal distraction will do nothing to prevent mental distress 
caused by
brain injury/disease or parasites, serious neurological 
deficits (birth defects),
substance abuse, and environmental toxicity factors.
 
 
before you dismiss this project with an eye roll, 
 verify the basic facts of the physiology of sight 
explained here. 
(first-semester psychology, the physiology of human 
sight, subliminal sight, peripheral vision reflexes.)
 
 
 
 
understand:                                                                                                                                
this is not a theory, speculation, or internet hoax.
when visual subliminal distraction caused mental breaks for 
office workers, 
engineers solved the problem using peripheral vision 
blocking protection by 1968.
 
today there is a multi-billion dollar annual industry selling 
cubicles, 
and installing systems furniture in open-plan offices to 
prevent
the "office worker" episode.
 
although successfully preventing the problem,
that is done without a full complete understanding of the 
potential for it.
 
everyone aware of it believes it harmless, unique, limited to incorrectly 
designed offices.
 
today computers and other digital view-screen devices allow 
anyone to make the 
'mental break causing design mistake' 
creating the office worker exposure situation in homes and 
schools
engaging long hours of deep cognitive investment to work or 
study 
where there is subliminally-detectable vision startle reflex
causing movement nearby. 
 
exposure requirements are strict enough so that serious 
outcomes are rare. 
this project posits there  is circumstantial and 
direct evidence this is the long sought
cause of college suicides.
 
the "light psychiatric effect" created from the office worker 
experience, 
spontaneously remits without treatment or after effects with appropriate rest from 
exposure. 
 
others at risk for this problem engage behaviors which copy 
the design mistake. 
 
that would include students, home computer users on social 
media,
writers, editors, investigative journalists, anyone performing 
knowledge work
 without peripheral vision blocking protection provided 
office workers.
 
 
this phenomena can be 
demonstrated, 
then the "special circumstances" experimentally 
replicated
to show the psychiatric symptoms of
anxiety leading to depressive ideation.
warning
 
 
from the exposure situations in offices, subliminal 
distraction can cause a panicked episode of confusion sometimes so 
severe as to cause hallucinations.
 
the light office worker episode is known to spontaneously remit without 
treatment or after effects with appropriate rest from exposure. 
that may take a week or more for long term  
exposure victims.  
 
if you did not take the psychology course which explains 
the physiology of human sight and how peripheral vision reflexes are created by 
subliminally detecting threat-movement nearby, this project is unbelievable. 
 
there is nothing to buy, no medication or treatment of 
any kind to learn about visual subliminal distraction, then take simple 
precautions to avoid it when you use computers and other digital view-screen 
devices long hours with peripheral vision reflex causing movement subliminally 
detectable nearby. 
 
 
qigong for 2,400 years and kundalini yoga for 3,000 
years as well as lgats and hospital intensive care units create all the "special 
circumstances" to do that

today. 

(lgats = large group awareness training seminar)

 
no one in mental health services or research has 
wondered why 'waving your arms and legs in unison' with a small group 
too many hours in a compact time frame performing qigong exercises causes a mental break. 
in fact unless you are an serious acolyte of the exercise you 
would not be aware that the qigong mental break happens.
 
see investigation methodology
for unrealized history of subliminal distraction,
 


the office worker experience appeared on an episode of 20/20 
downtown.  abc is no help. anyone have information on date? 


can anyone name the two interviewers in the episode segment?
 
 
the psychiatric distress from subliminal distraction 

is the only mental event with a known cause 
which has been prevented. 
it was done by engineers not doctors.
 



no one has seriously in-depth investigated this problem.

mental health services and research are unaware it exists.

 



in the first nine years searching i found only one psychiatrist at tufts 
university 




who said he had seen the office worker episodes when he was in 
residency. 



dismissive, believing they are unique happening only in offices he 
has refused to comment further.


 

 
the office worker experience
 

there  is no magic so that the presence of desks, 
chairs, and filing cabinets cause mental events.

 
the problem is repeating subliminal
undetectable 
failed attempts to visually startle from reacting to threat movement 
nearby when office staff move in peripheral vision as the worker concentrates to a level that they are completely absorbed 
in the job, unaware of anything happening around them. 
 
engineers solved the problem by designing the office 
cubicle to block peripheral vision for long concentrating knowledge workers.
 
engineers' "in the box thinking" prevented them from 
realizing the potential of the problem.  they failed to anticipate the 
invention and use of computers would allow visual subliminal distraction 
exposure to migrate into homes and schools. 
 
the physiology involved is taught but insufficiently
explored or explained in first semester psychology lectures on how 
peripheral vision reflexes are created subliminally. 
 
 
while your brain will assign a zero level of attention to safe
peripheral vision reflex causing threat-movement nearby,
thus blocking knowledge of it from your consciousness,
which stops, blocks,  the conscious concentration 
breaking visual startle reflex, 
you can't 'stop seeing' anything in your vision field. 
you still subliminally detect that movement, 
the normal process to cause a vision startle reflex, 
 and can't prevent
your brain from reacting by attempting to force the startle. 
 
this creates the subliminal 
appreciation of threat without your
conscious mind being aware any thing is happening to you. 
 
 
after conscious knowledge of movement in peripheral vision is 
suppressed, 
every time threat-movement is subliminally detected 
the attention grabbing pulse of apprehension 
which triggers 
the vision startle reflex is still generated 
remaining subliminal in the mind below 
thought and reason.
 



defined as a 'visual subliminal distraction,' ...  over hours daily 

for successive days that subliminal 
appreciation of threat 

will begin to color contemporaneous thought. 

 

that psychiatric outcome can be experimentally proven 

by coping the physical situation, optimizing it, for a quick, 

few days to a week or more onset of 
anxiety and depressive ideation.

that visual subliminal distraction effect will spontaneously remit without 
treatment or after effects with appropriate rest from exposure, typically 
another week's scrupulous avoidance. 



see "warning"
 
all that is needed is normal sight and the ability to 
suppress the vision startle reflex. 
test if you have that ability with this
demonstration. 
                                                                                                     
habituation of conscious sight
 
although there is a multi-billion dollar industry developed 
since 1968                
to prevent it in offices by selling cubicles and                                        
                  
installing 'systems 
furniture' in open-plan offices,                
                     designed to block peripheral vision,            
                                                            the public, mental health services, and research
                                                                 are unaware 
such a problem exists.
 
systems furniture engineers and their employers, office 
furniture manufacturers 
believe they are preventing a flood of suits by keeping 
knowledge of the problem proprietary.
forum post accusing me of 
being an attorney trying to get information for a suit. 
 
i have been unable to find any practitioner who screens for 
it before diagnosing mental illness. 
 
long hours of casual indiscriminate computer use in locations
 with repeating 'vision startle reflex' causing movement 
subliminally detectable nearby, 
pets, family members, roommates, mirror 
reflections, oscillating or ceiling fans,                                                           
 
                                                    
and blinking lights on on the computer swept through peripheral vision with a 
head turn,
but 
without protection  provided for office workers,

peripheral vision blocking,
allows the problem to migrate into homes and schools rather 
than just offices 
allowing anyone to create the "special circumstances"
for visual subliminal distraction.
 
 
 
while computers and digital view-screen devices
are featured on this site, the problem was discovered and 
solved
before they existed. 
 
if you have not already done so, 
perform my demonstration of the habituation of conscious 
sight in peripheral vision 
to understand why visual subliminal distraction cannot be 
consciously experienced 
as it happens in the mind below thought, reason, and 
consciousness.

without the supervision of an office and the interaction with office staff 
to detect an altered 
mental state and declining mental facility, 
the mild believed-harmless office worker experience 
can 
build to a severe episode when exposure is in a student dorm or home.
 
evidence of it appears unrealized in news reports, about mass shootings, 
college suicides, and in incidents 
creating civil disturbances, police shootings.

although a very few will accumulate enough exposure for 
the full mental break,
this site collects evidence that at lower levels of 
persistent exposure, 
psychiatric symptoms can be produced.
 
 
everyone has visual subliminal distraction exposure everyday.
that level of single isolated incidents is normal, and 
harmless. 
trouble begins when someone copies the "mental break causing

where they work, use a computer on social media, or play

are you prepared  for a simple explanation, and 
revelation?
 
what is visual subliminal distraction?
 
 
visual subliminal distraction is a normal feature of 
everyone's physiology of sight. 
all that is necessary to allow the "special 
circumstances for the mental break 
are full normal sight and the ability to suppress the 
vision startle reflex. 
 
that means that everyone who ever lived had the 
physiology to allow visual subliminal distraction. 
 
all that is needed is one workplace,    
one study area,    or 
today ...     one computer 
workstation.
this has been true through history.
 
historical 'culture bound syndromes' demonstrate that 
too-small, & single-room living arrangements
promote subliminal distraction.
 
the subliminally functioning brain system which would 
have evolved to prevent early humans being a meal for a predator 
goes haywire when the situation is created so that the suppressed, 
blocked, startle 
is attempted a 
massive number of times in a compact time frame. 
 
 
this project begins searching history for events with 
mental breaks that can be investigated 
for the "special circumstances" for subliminal 
distraction.
 
 
those activities are qigong, kundalini yoga, lgats, icu 
psychosis, 
and some culture bound syndromes.
 
qigong, and kundalini yoga supply a 2,400, and 3,000 
year history of these mental events.
certainly other high risk activities would have caused 
the problem through history,
as long as the activity fulfilled the  "special 
circumstances,"
and subliminal distraction lasted long enough.
