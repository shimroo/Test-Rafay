here is a quick guide that will help you find the best memory care facilities in your area:

determine the level of care needed. do you need a dedicated memory care community, or a memory care unit inside an assisted living facility?
do you have the budget needed for memory care? note that medicaid generally will not cover your loved one’s care at a memory care facility. most facilities are private-pay.
have you located at least 2-3 facilities near you that provide memory care services? if so, you should schedule tours so you can determine which facility is best suited for your loved one’s needs.
after you’ve toured the facilities, see which ones provide better care for your situation and which ones are within your budget.
make sure to visit each memory care community more than once at different times. try to talk to staff and residents.
