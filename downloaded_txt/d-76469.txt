questacon! 

 

we got our science on, at questacon.

rodd built a martian landing strip at the lego curiosity exhibit.


we also contributed sections to the mosaic.


there was only one school group visiting, so once they passed through, we mostly had the place to ourselves.



this is going to be the cover of our first album. (can you tell which one of us always runs 5 degrees hotter than the other?)

and oh yeah, i got up the courage to do the 6m free fall that i chickened out on when we visited fifteen years ago.

i’m so proud of myself! even though i look like a flattened oompa-loompa at the end. 😂

i definitely earned some beer at bentspoke!

we went to see the brutalist last night, which felt appropriate.

happy valentine’s day 

 

i took my valentine out for fancy cocktails and then to see postmodern jukebox in canberra. ❤️ (effie passero blew the roof off every time she opened her mouth. her voice is astonishing.)

early train from central 

 

it appears the 7:12 to canberra hasn’t been affected by the industrial action. we’ve passed a lot of commuters on platforms though that are clearly in for a bad day…

tragedy in munich 

rodd saw the news but didn’t want to tell me, knowing i’d be upset. i probably rode my bike down that street a dozen times. this is terrible. 😢

controversial quilts 

 

“the american quilter’s society refused to show two artworks in an exhibition centered around the color red after claiming they could be controversial… one quilt could be interpreted as depicting female anatomy, while the other references abortion access.” (link courtesy of inarticulatequilter.)
what absolute cowards. i actually went to that exhibition when it toured australia at the sydney quilt show last july. i saw the “your mother. your daughter. your sister. your grandmother. you.” quilt and felt it was both beautiful and powerful… but also, without the sign giving it context, it’s just a quilt made of red squares. i also saw quilts inspired by the covid pandemic, school shootings, and climate change, and many of them were way more overt than this one.
although to be fair, i don’t remember seeing the “origin” work. feels like i’d remember that. 😜

aubrey/maturin novels 

 actually, master and commander is a domestic fantasy about a codependent life partnership! olivia wolfgang-smith on the queer subtext of patrick o’brian’s aubrey/maturin series…
okay, i saw the movie version but don’t remember much about it. i certainly didn’t think i was interested in reading the books… until now. 😂 (link via metafilter.)

3d-printed overlocker waste tray 

 

i bought my singer overlocker many years ago (as an aldi special buy!) and while it’s a great little workhorse, it doesn’t have a lot of fancy features… like a waste tray. for those who are unfamiliar, these specialised sewing machines use multiple threads to finish the edge of fabric and keep it from fraying. they also have a cutting blade that trims the edge as you go, and on mine, the bits of fabric and thread just fall straight down onto my sewing table. it’s annoying and messy.
recently i had a thought: “i wonder if anyone’s designed a waste tray for it?!” of course they have. i sent that link to my friend bobbie, who also printed my pegboard spool holders, to see if he’d print one for me. “what colour do you want?” he asked. i figured red would match the logo nicely.
and here it is! fits perfectly. how cool is that?
