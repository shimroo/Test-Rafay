every fish story
                         begins with
                         the perfect hook.







own your next catch.
and you'll never have to tell the story of the one that got away.
there's a feeling you get when you're going fishing. you get on the boat and the only thing between you and the fish is water. each time you cast, the sound of nature drowns out the noise, you feel a rush of anticipation - it's all about that tug at the end of the line - so set the hook!
                        
get an owner hook and clear the deck.
