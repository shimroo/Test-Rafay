australian science and technology heritage centre





1999 - 2006




on 3 may 1999 the australian science and technology heritage centre (austehc) of the
university of melbourne was formed to sustain the academic, heritage and research activities of the australian
science archives project.


 


on 1 january 2007 the escholarship research centre was established as part of the university of melbourne library, to continue the work of the australian science and technology heritage centre. the centre has collaborated on many significant public knowledge projects with researchers from within the university as well as with a broad range of external clients from other major universities, government departments and community organisations. the centre was conceived as a bold experiment in interdisciplinary collaboration, as a way of achieving the universitys vision of a linked-up triple helix, to build new relationships across the university that would enable the emergence of research infrastructure based on the principles of the scholarly ideal.

about us


on 3 may 1999 the council of the university of melbourne declared the formation of the 
australian science and technology heritage centre (austehc) in the faculty of arts. 

austehc will continue the academic, research and heritage activities of the 
australian science archives project (asap) which was established 
by professor r.w. home in 1985. the centre will encompass asap's original objectives and 
continue to develop new programs that foster the preservation, promotion and development of
 the heritage of australian science, technology and medicine. asap's popular online 
information resources, notably bright sparcs, will form 
the key focus of the centre's activities.

asap's 14 years experience at the local, national and international levels provides a solid
 foundation for the centre's success. the important network of associations with academic, 
government and private organisations and individuals will be maintained and developed 
to further enhance the centre's crucial role.  austehc will:

establish the infrastructure, through research, development and implementation, 
to undertake collaborative projects and activities relating to the history and heritage 
of science, technology and medicine, within the university of melbourne and with external 
organisations and individuals;
create and provide access to authoritative information resources dealing with the 
history and heritage of science, technology and medicine, primarily with an australian 
focus, to support academic scholarship, secondary and primary education, and general 
community awareness;
advance the pursuit of knowledge in the history, archival, museum, heritage studies and 
information management disciplines through teaching, research and development.


the significant corporate archival and records management projects undertaken by asap over 
the past few years has led to the formation of a separate company, asap information services pty ltd.  
the separation of this commercial work from the academic, research and heritage activities 
will enable the centre to maintain a strong focus on its fundamental goals.

along with asap's director and founding staff member, gavan mccarthy, austehc has retained 
an essential core of asap's staff with distinctive expertise and knowledge as archivists, 
researchers, teachers, historians, and www-developers.  austehc will continue the self-funded 
tradition established by asap and work to enhance its position within the university of 
melbourne and augment its strong links with the 
department of history and philosophy of science.


austehc was located at:

australian science and technology heritage centre
