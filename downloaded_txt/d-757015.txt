studio fallout presents…



teachers’ lounge















join us for a special night celebrating the incredible creativity of our educators at “teachers’ lounge” presented by studio fallout. 🎨🍎 let's honor their passion and dedication through the lens of art. mark your calendars and stay tuned for more details!


























“perhaps the most vibrant collage maestro since max ernst and single-handedly responsible for an entire generation’s graphic style, winston continues to stomp the upturned face of the man, endlessly.   ~ frank kozik“following that time-tested tradition of montage, collage and random image appropriation, winston smith takes this medium one step further than his precursors, max ernst and marcel duchamp.”   ~ robert williams"winston smith's collage art is a cutting socio-political commentary on the late 20th century. irreverent in style, each unique piece is bursting with color and kinetic ideas."  ~ h.r. giger

“what always struck me about winston’s work is his ability to make a profound comment purely by reshuffling found images in a way that is both humorous and pointed. winston’s recent work is more beautiful than ever making his visual puns that are harsh indictments of the american dream as an ideal even more jarring.” – shepard fairey
