special hours: sunday, february 16th: 4 pm to 12 amopen monday through saturdaymust be over the age of 25 parties of no more than 6


























since 2004, our sophisticated space has begged to be occupied by the connoisseur and the novice alike.  we offer a few classic cocktails (and a few house-crafted ones), a handful of beers by the glass, and wine by both the glass and the bottle. but the stars of our menu can be found along our interior. our shelves currently house over 1,500 unique aged spirits. come sip your favorite or let us help you find a new one!
















more than 6 guests?our lounge was created with the small intimate group in mind, where good food and drink can be enjoyed along with quiet conversation and jazz standards playing softly in the background. it’s why we only allow as many guests as we have seats, and standing at the bar is discouraged. while reservations may be limited to groups of up to 6, please note that we do have several options for larger groups which can be arranged by calling or emailing our booking coordinator. reach out today to check availability.














private bookings















private partieswe offer a variety of party options. with two spaces, our main floor can accommodate up to 70 guests and our lower level up to 40 guests. with passed appetizers and an optional tasting (either passed or from a booth), this is one event you’ll never forget. 















private tastingsour most popular experience for corporate entertainment and bachelor/bachelorette celebrations, let us entertain your group with the proper balance of knowledge and humor. this 90 minute experience starts with a cocktail and some passed bites while you mingle before sitting down and navigating through a guided flight of 6 tipples. 















vip roomdo you need a space to kick back and enjoy our full menu, but want something a bit more private, or the flexibility to entertain a few more friends than can be accommodated in our lounge? this room will serve you well.
