untitled theater company no. 61a theater of ideascelebrating 30 years of performance!untitled theater company no. 61 is a theater of ideas: scientific, political, philosophical, and above all theatrical.our shows mix tragedy and comedy in a manner inspired by classic absurdism, while often incorporating music, puppetry, technology, and physical theater.  early defining events include our havel festival and our ionesco festival, in which we produced their full works.  though we now produce only original work, their responses to the absurd and terrifying moments of their history are a continuing inspiration as we try to navigate a contemporary response to our time.
