“what our clients say



“mrs. habeeb was very professional, friendly, honest and most importantly got the job done efficiently and with no difficulties.  she worked well with us and also with the selling broker.  we love the house that we bought.”
bonnieest




“tina was incredibly responsive and accessible during the entire process.  not an easy task since i travel a lot and my availability was extremely limited. we purchased a home  through a relocation company. again, not an easy process  we encountered many many challenges dealing with the real estate   agents and relo company. tina was calm and professional yet extremely persistent in moving the process along. in the end we purchased the home of our dreams at a great price.  less than 18 months later, we are refinancing to take advantage of lower interest rates and the home has appraised out at a higher price than we paid- and this is in a down market!

we would definitely use tina again and highly recommend her!”
linda frazier




““i have known and worked with tina for over 10 years.tina is an outstanding individual who is committed to providing her clients with excellent advice and outstanding service. i have always admired her dedication to her profession and her vast knowledge of the real estate industry"”
vivian ota




“i have worked with this realtor for years. she is very involved, caring, and always there when needed. tina assists in every detail of the sale and whenever something unexpected comes up, she takes it in stride with great knowledge and responsiveness. she is very much an advocate in the   buying/selling process and always has me and my family's best interests at heart. i really can't say enough good things about her.”
pat tovey




“tina has been incredible in helping us find a house.  she is professional and does her homework.  i am confident that our purchase will be well researched and that we won't overpay for the home we find.”
