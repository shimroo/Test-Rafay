|here's to the night- eve6]god, all i want to do is scream; scream, cry and pound on the walls till my knuckles are bloody and raw. it just seems completely utterly unfair as the circumstances play out in front of me. but then when is life ever fair to anyone; you have to 'roll with the punches' 'take the good with the bad'. sometimes that shit just doesn't seem to work very well for those damn hard headed people such as myself. and it sucks in a non-life-affirming-way.

|stay-sarah bettens]got bored, took some quzzies.. should really be doing my homework or finishing fanfiction..oh well.you are 40% abnormalyou are at medium risk for being a psychopath. it is somewhat likely that you have no soul. you are at high risk for having a borderline personality. it is very likely that you are a chaotic mess.you are at medium risk for having a narcissistic personality. it is somewhat likely that you are in love with your own reflection.you are at low risk for having a social phobia. it is unlikely that you feel most comfortable in your mom's basement.you are at low risk for obsessive compulsive disorder. it is unlikely that you are addicted to hand sanitizer.how abnormal are you?you are a seeker soulyou are on a quest for knowledge and life challenges.you love to be curious and ask a ton of questions.since you know so much, you make for an interesting conversationalist.mentally alert, you can outwit almost anyone (and have fun doing it!).very introspective, you can be silently critical of others.and your quiet nature makes it difficult for people to get to know you.you see yourself as a philosopher, and you take everything philosophically.your main talent is expressing and communicating ideas.souls you are most compatible with: hunter soul and visionary soulwhat kind of soul are you?your 2005 song ishung up by madonna"every little thing that you say or doi'm hung upi'm hung up on you"you'll be rockin' in the new year in your croch-o-tard!what hit song of 2005 are you?you are lightningbeautiful yet dangerouspeople will stop and watch you when you appeareven though you're capable of random violenceyou are best known for: your poweryour dominant state: performingwhat type of weather are you?you are strengthyou represent both fiery energy and steadfast will.you are innocent and naive - yet unafraid and undaunted.perhaps you don't have the most powerful physical strength...but your mental powers make up for any amount of muscle.your fortune: lately, you have been a pillar of ethics and moral strength.and while things may be difficult, your faith in yourself will come through.you may need to conquer the animalistic nature of yourself or others, with gentle force.although this may seem like the darkest hour for you, victory is near.what tarot card are you?

[feel the rhythm 
|all hail the heartbreaker- tsc]i can honest say that i've never felt this way before.
i had a feeling that those looks you gave me were real, but what i ripped your heart apart at the seams maybe then you know who i feel.
i will sleep another day, i don't really need you anyways. what the point when my dreams are reflected with words you use to say. i breathe in a moment as long as i keep my distance.
so don't got worrying about me, it's not i think about you constantly. so maybe i do, but that shouldn't affect your life anymore. i knew it the moment you walked into the door. 
i'll be the giver and you'll be the taker, i guess thats how this ones going to go. i'll be the giver and you'll be the taker. i guess thats ones going to go.you've got my down on my knees and i'll proclaim all hail the heartbreaker.
 
winter formal sucked in a non-life-affirming-way to say the least. crushed hopes, broken high heels and soberity.. oh my.
