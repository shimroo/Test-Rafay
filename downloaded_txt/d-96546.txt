detention hotline









for 30 years, we have promoted justice and equality for lgbtq and hiv-positive immigrants, winning major victories in the courts and in congress.










act now: asylum is under attack



as president trump takes office, we are witnessing in real-time his renewed efforts to oppress lgbtq people and immigrants—the very communities immigration equality serves.
but the more president trump tries to deport, detain, and dehumanize queer immigrants, the harder we will fight back.  
with your support, we can keep giving free lawyers to lgbtq people fleeing violence—to help win them asylum, safety, and freedom. please make a gift today.
