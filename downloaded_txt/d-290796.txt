. . . our symbol and our purpose . . . 



the symbol of the bible for today centers around an open bible. this signifies that the principles of the 
bible are the exclusive principles which form the foundation of the bible for today. the shield pictures "the shield of 
faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked" (ephesians 6:16). on the left of the shield, the darkness is seen encroaching; on the right of the shield, the light is controlling. down the center of 
the shield is a sword, representing the "sword of the spirit, which is the word of god" 
	(ephesians 6:17). it is the spirits "sword" of "the word of god" which pierces and divides between 
the light and the darkness. 
the overarching purpose of the bible for today is to proclaim and to defend the principles of the bible (philippians 
1:7). we believe the bible is plenarily and verbally 
inspired of god (2 timothy 3:16-17), 
and consequently inerrant and infallible! we feel that biblical principles must 
not only be proclaimed positively, but also be defended against all infiltration 
of anti-biblical heresies or aberrations.
