 alaska zooa boreal forest zoo

 

we are proud of our zoo which sits on 28 acres of natural boreal forest located on the lower foothills of the chugach mountains. our trails wind through the woods, providing visitors the opportunity to connect with nature.

  
   

  




 


“in the end, we will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught.”
