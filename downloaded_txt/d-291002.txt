welcome to hotelguide.networks' directory of hotels and hotel reviews for san francisco, california!

with winter chill offset by surrounding waters and with summers also cool and breezy, san francisco never ceases to invigorate. the city of seven hills -- actually, there are more than 40 on fewer than 50 acres -- is best known for nob, russian, telegraph, twin peaks, mount olympus, rincon, and lone mountain. crooner tony bennett may have left his heart in san francisco, but john steinbeck once called it "a golden handcuff with the key thrown away." rudyard kipling declared "san francisco has only one drawback -- tis hard to leave," which may be why millions of annual visitors vow to return. relatively small with a gold rush past, the city of fewer than a million residents sits on a tip of land surrounded by san francisco bay and the pacific ocean. before gasoline engines, san francisco hillsides, too steep for horse-drawn carriages, could be negotiated only by steam-powered cable cars, creating a legacy now preserved as a national landmark with about 40 cars operating on three lines connecting nob hill to fisherman's wharf and the financial district to van ness avenue. 

among the world's 300 remaining carousels, san francisco boasts four: at yerba buena gardens, san francisco zoo, golden gate park, and pier 39. other icon attractions range from golden gate bridge, the palace of fine arts, and the largest chinatown outside asia. additional neighborhoods of note include little tokyo, the colorful mission district, the psychedelic era's haight street, upscale pacific heights, and the bohemian north beach. offshore awaits alcatraz island, once the site of america's toughest maximum security prison, and a great vantage point for a city skyline view. at&t park, known as the "miracle on third street," stands as a major league ballpark with stunning views of the bay bridges. san francisco bay's 33,000-plus hotel rooms range from one-of-a-kind historic hotels like the fairmont san francisco and intercontinental mark hopkins san francisco to new luxury properties such as the 549-room hilton san francisco financial district, with its spa and seven fifty: a taste of the mediterranean restaurant.
