18fxxx tutorial






hello shane,
                          saw your bootloader page on sunday, wired the max232 circuit monday morning at 09:00 am and had downloaded my first program into an 'f876 by 09:15!!! by the end of the day, i came to realize that this is by far one of the best time savers i've come across in the last 5 years!
thanks for an extremely detailed description and once again, thank you for making petr kolomaznik's small and powerful bootloader available.
