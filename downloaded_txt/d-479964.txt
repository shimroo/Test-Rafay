1968 z/28 first generation site






























this site is dedicated solely to the 1968 z/28. our goal is to educate, promote, and help others better understand this car and it's numerous qualities. the core of the site is the 1968 z/28 national registry. the objective of this registry is to document all known 1968 z/28s still in existence (there was originally 7,199 built), even if they are not drive-able anymore. this information in turn will help all interested parties to better grasp every facet of the cars, whether it is drive train combinations, interior/exterior colors, as well as all available options offered.
