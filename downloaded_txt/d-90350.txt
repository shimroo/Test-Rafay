my daughter, jinni, works at the studio on weekends, helping with photography and doing inventory.



...and then there's me. this business is not making money right now, so i have taken a lot of extra work beyond my weekend duty in the air force.
the last three years have been crazy:
fighting california wildfires.
almost a year in texas and nevada.
overseeing 9,000 covid vaccinations.
two combat deployments.

apparently, i'm famous!
somehow, i find time each day for customer service via email and text message.
-gary.



when you mention that you once co-hosted a nationally-syndicated tv show watched by 70,000,000 people each week in china, people probably think i am making it up but...

if you're looking to buy hand-painted chinese artwork or japanese calligraphy at discount prices, you've come to the right place. all artwork here is fair trade, and created by independent chinese, korean & japanese artists.
while this artwork is of the highest quality available, my prices are much lower than those of most art galleries, around the world & even inside china, japan & korea. the reason is, all these artists are my personal friends that i have developed while living and traveling in china and japan. there is no middle man because all the artwork is mounted in my workshop just outside beijing.

if you are looking for...
custom chinese character or japanese kanji symbol calligraphy wall scrolls, asian dragon artwork, birds & flowers, asian philosophy art, paintings of horses, cats & kitten art, southern chinese peasant folk art, or any kind of chinese scrolls.
...i have something for you.

there are 1206 ready-to-ship chinese/japanese scrolls and paintings for sale on my website.
and, a billion combinations of custom japanese & chinese calligraphy wall scrolls.

customer reviews...

-dr. kimhi zamir.
kefar saba, israel



great scroll
hi gary, just to let you know the scroll i received are just what i wanted, even better! great service.
-christopher handbury.



exceptional quality and service.
gary,
your efforts in helping me complete my projects have been above and beyond. i want to thank you, your translators and your master
caligrapher for the exceptional work. because of the great experience i even bought 3 paintings (it's costing me a fortune in framing but the
result will be worth it). i look forward to doing business with you again.
-dennis p breene md



better than what i expected!
this is amazing. i got my two custom wall scrolls, inner peace and taichi chuan, yesterday. the hand writing is good and the materials are high quality. i had seen similar wall scrolls before but these are well worth the money and worth hanging on the wall.
thank you for bringing these on the net,
-kenny kong.



great product, great service
i've purchased four scrolls from gary and his team over a few years, and they are always of the very highest quality. orders are filled quickly, and they are packed very carefully. this is important with scrolls, because it is so easy to damage them in transit. i really appreciate the total care the art work receives before it gets to me.
best,
-quentin mcandrew.
