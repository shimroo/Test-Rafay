find your perfect excursion

from scalloping, scuba diving, to swimming with the manatees, we have a host of tour options to cater to your idea of an adventure. experience a guided tour in one of our local underwater spring fed caverns, or level up to technical dive training. for the not so adventurous, manatee swim tours are for all ages and actually do not involve a lot of swimming. we provide wetsuits and swim noodles, so guests can float quietly on the surface of the water. we passively observe these gentle giants as they mosey around our beautiful bay! we also offer eco tours daily, where you will see a variety of birds, occasional dolphin sightings, and other florida wildlife!
