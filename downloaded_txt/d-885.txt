welcome to
      dream moods!you are entering
      the mysterious and fascinating world of dreams, where the rules of reality do
      not apply. we hope that dream moods will help you make sense of your
      dreams and achieve a better understanding of them. we are dedicated to
      help you find the key to unlocking and interpreting the meanings to
      your dreams. in understanding your dreams, you will gain a clearer
      view on your personal relationships, an uncensored view of your real
      feelings and a better
      perspective on life issues. 
 
        
we realize that your dreams
      are unique; no other individual can have your personal background, your emotions,
      or your experiences.  thus, your own dreams can only be connected to your own
      "reality". with this in mind, it is
      important to draw
      from your personal life and experiences when interpreting a dream.
 
        

once you have an understanding of your dreams, it has
            the power to unify the body, mind, and spirit. it provides you with insight into your own self and a means for
            further self-exploration. you will gain a better understanding and discovery of your true self. 
so stay awhile -- explore, discover, have fun, make friends, and find out
      what's in your dream?!
