    grey-cat.com is the online home of christine and judith bush since 1996. we have shut down our server in nevada and are in progress moving to amazon web services. the multiple blogs hosted at this domain will be restored as a static archive, as evernote has absorbed most of judith's notetaking over the past few years. you may visit her public naturalist notebook or her flicker stream. for more information about judith bush, visit her linkedin profile.
