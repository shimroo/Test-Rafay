branch brook park alliance is a public/private partnership with essex county and the department of parks recreation and cultural affairs
​we champion a masterwork of landscape architecture, conceived by frederick law olmsted sr. and designed by the olmsted brothers. the centerpiece of the first county park system in america located in the renaissance cities of newark & belleville, essex county branch brook park now enjoys new life. together with a community of friends, we restored the park’s historic design and are refreshing it for today's lively use.
