corporate history and overviewfounded in 1964 simpson sales company has been representing manufacturers from the shooting sports industry for 59 years and is the only company to win the national shooting sports foundation rep agency of the year award twice, recognized by shot business magazine. these awards exemplify the strength and drive of our sales force. we have represented lines on our shooting sports side such as browning and winchester firearms and mtm for 30+ years.a teamwork effort assures that our group works together to pull product through distribution as well as direct sales channels. our reps have the training and expertise to handle sales meetings, training sessions, in-store promotions and consumer events. in addition,  they have vast experience in structuring incentive programs at the account level to pull product off the shelf.ssc was also one of the first rep groups to recognize the need for le/gov/mil dedicated sales reps. our le division is dedicated solely to the channel and covers all of the southeastern states ms, al, tn, ga, sc, nc, fl, va, wv and ky. we have a database of dealers and agencies that we work with and are able to make an immediate impact on new products with law enforcement agencies and dealers. on our le side, we represent brands such as eotech, bergara precision rifles, dead air silencers, under armour tactical, shadow systems, combined tactical systems and primary weapon systems.our strategy as le/mil reps is to create the demand from the end user and distributor side. we attend local sheriff and chief shows, tactical shows, fbinaa shows, and other national and regional events to display the product. we make calls directly to the agency and do both classroom style presentations as well as live fire demonstrations. we work with agencies to write bid specs that will secure our product during the bid process. we also work directly with dealers to train employees, merchandise, manage all day to day tasks, structure incentive programs, work in store promotions, travel with dealer reps, write orders and maintain stocking levels/inventory where it applies.we believe there is no other rep group in the southeast that more completely envelopes the shooting sports and le/mil/gov sales channels as densely and as deeply as simpson sales company. we have the coverage and expertise to represent our manufacturers completely and professionally.
