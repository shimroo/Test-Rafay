so what is linkpendium, anyway?
linkpendium is a 10,000,000+ resource directory to everything on the web about families worldwide and genealogically-relevant
information about u.s. states and counties.  we cover both free and subscription sites, with a strong emphasis upon free resources
provided by libraries, other government agencies, genealogical and historical societies, and individuals.
we are particularly proud of our unique indexes to online biographies.
how do i use linkpendium?

the family discoverer search engine at the top of this page covers 2,800,000 of the pages we index, and is the fastest way to
explore genealogical and family history on the internet.
the city or county or family surname navigation tools in the right column let you jump directly to a linkpendium page of resources.
    this is a faster way to reach the same pages you can find by following the links below.
the locality directory below lets you follow links to resources for the u.s. states and counties that interest you.
the surname directory below lets you follow links to resources for families worldwide that interest you.  by following the links, you will see many possible variations on your family name.
important: the locality and family surname pages include many resources that could not be included in the search engine.when you are trying to break down a genealogical brick wall, always use the locality
    and family surname pages in addition to the family discoverer.  ;)
