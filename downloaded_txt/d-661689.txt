yes, we are the factory…

we custom build windows for your home in our norcross factory using cutting-edge technologies. 
 
no middle man means you can get your windows factory-direct at the lowest possible price.












u.s. window factory offers you replacement windows:








premium quality
engineered for the georgia climate, our windows far exceed energy star standards. we use only virgin vinyl that will never yellow, fade, crack or corrode. see our windows.








more for le$$
buying factory-direct means no shipping cost or middleman markup, two of the biggest elements of our competitors’ selling price. we won’t be undersold.








broad selection
we offer a large range of options from custom shapes to an unlimited pallet of exterior colors and interior wood grains—all displayed full size in our factory showroom.










unbeatable service
we complete your window or door installation in record time, and we can replace broken glass in hours not weeks. our crews are always as close as your phone and at your door as fast as atlanta traffic will allow.








lifetime warranty
we only use the very best components; therefore, we proudly offer a lifetime transferable warranty. if you have a problem, it is our problem. see our warranty.








outstanding reputation
our factory and showroom are at a new location to better serve you, after 18 years in norcross. atlanta homeowners recognize us with the best reward: their referrals to friends and family. see what folks say.
