5. tec-9, tec-dc9


								the tec-9 and its variants differ from conventional handguns because its large-capacity detachable magazine helps provide a level of firepower "associated with military or police, not civilian, shooting requirements," according to firearms expert leonard j. supenski. the weapon is "completely useless" for hunting, is never used by competitive or recreational shooters and "has no legitimate sporting use," he says.
