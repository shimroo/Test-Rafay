the process 



the 5 steps to safer digging, also known as the blue stakes process, is the way to safer digging in the state of utah.  by following these steps it will help keep you and your family safe as well as protect vital underground utility facilities from being damaged. 






submit a locate request








 

















1
notify
notify blue stakes of utah 811 at least 3 business days prior to excavation. give specific dig site location information.





2
wait
once your locate request is submitted to the member facility operators, wait until the legal date / time as shown on the locate request. 





3
confirm
referencing your locate request, verify that all markings for your dig site are present prior to excavating. if not, submit a no response notice.





4
respect
use hand tools and dig carefully 2 feet on either side of the markings. request new markings if they are destroyed.





5
dig carefully
be aware of your surroundings and be careful when digging.  be a safe-digging partner and respect the utilities and the markings.

quick ticket entry training 











thank you for your interest in training for quick ticket entry access. there are a few things to keep in mind before proceeding:quick ticket entry training is for professional excavators who submit many locate requests each week, with simple and clear marking instructions for each request.this is for professional excavators who have experience in providing the required detailed descriptions for the location instructions in utah on their requests.the training does not teach you how to word the locate descriptions for marking.this training will provide instructions on use of the quick ticket entry application, along with the additional options that are available to quick ticket users.the training can take up to 1.5 hours to complete.the training must be completed within 30 days of enrollment. if not, the account will automatically be disabled.do you qualify for quick ticket entry training? 














yes














no
