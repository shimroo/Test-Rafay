the reason why china bans sportsbook except macau

many countries in the world ban gambling because it has relation with the crime and one of them is china. china bans sportsbook exclude macau which is known as the new “mecca” for gambling in the world. the reason why china ban caused by one of the famous cases such as cheung tze-keung. he was known as the crime boss as well as the gambler with the famous nick name of “big spender”. tze-keung sadly made the nick name on his own for himself based on the armed robberies’ string and also the kidnapping activity that earned more than millions of dollars.
the story was about “big spender” kidnapped the son of one of the wealthiest man in china named li ka shing back in 1996 along with walter known whom he lost about $178 million. though he tried so hard to hide his true identity, he was caught in macau right after losing the game about $200 million on the casino floor. tze-keung planned to kidnap stanley ho who was the famous magnate of the casino. however, the authorities could stop the plan and he was arrested at that time and imprisoned.
his gambling habit along with his will on crime led him to his demise literally and financially. actually, not only because of that reason china bans soccer prediction and other related activity but crime is definitely something they want to avoid because it can make the country poor since china has the largest population in the world.
