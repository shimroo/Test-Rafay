1.18 billion in energy poverty despite rising electricity access 


since 2000, the number of people worldwide with access to electricity has increased from 75% to 90% by 2020, a significant improvement. despite access, electricity often does not work, is unreliable and/or too expensive to use.  for too many people, access to electricity has not brought significant benefits to their daily lives. at least 1.18 billion people live in energy poverty and are unable to use electricity - 60% more than the 733 million people who lacked access to electricity in 2020. according to the world bank, there are 447 million people who do not have access to electricity, even though they are officially electrified. some people cannot use electricity, because they do not have access to services or appliances, or they cannot afford their bills.
