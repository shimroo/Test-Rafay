after decades of a self-imposed moratorium on investments in school construction, rhode island has undergone two transformative bonds to fund needed to renovating and modernizing our school facilities.
east providence high school was one of the first newly designed and constructed school facilities under the new rhode island school building authority initiative program. the $190 million east providence high school was completed under an all-union project labor agreement, on time and within budget. this project is also an example of how minority and women owned businesses are expanding their presence in rhode island, exceeding the 10% mbe/wbe requirements by an additional 9%.
with additional school construction successes in cranston, pawtucket, and providence, nine additional school districts will be looking to take advantage of available funding from the state, as well as the temporary bonuses that increase state reimbursement aid. this scale of construction will not only offer once-in-a-lifetime investments into the state of our schools, but will create thousands of new job opportunities for the residents of these communities.
on tuesday november 7th, residents in 8 school districts (barrington, bristol-warren, cumberland, east greenwich, lincoln, middletown, north kingstown, south kingstown) will be asked to vote to approve these bonds, to fund new schools and improvements in their school districts.
