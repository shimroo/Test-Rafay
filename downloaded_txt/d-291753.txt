 approximately two thirds of a personâs body weight is water. blood is 63% water  the brain is 75%  muscles are 75% the lungs are 80%, the heart is 75%, the liver is 85% the kidneys are 63% and even the bones are 22% water. 

the benefits of drinking plenty of water:

 the average adult needs 10 to 12 cups of water per day for digestion, perspiration, breathing and elimination of waste. 1/3 of our basic water intake is from the fruits and vegetables we eat, leaving a deficit of at least 6 to 8 cups of water a day, which must be added to ensure health and avoid dehydration. strenuous physical exercise demands even more water intake.
(an exercise session can deplete your bodyâs water by 2-5 litres.)
