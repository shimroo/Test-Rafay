the society functions as a non-profit, non-denominational, non-political organization, incorporated under the laws of the state of north dakota. its aims are educational and social. its purpose is to bring together people who are interested in discovering the common history unique to germanic-russian ethnics and to preserve the many elements of their rich heritage.
the society collects, lists, and catalogues published materials and personal documents that tell of the european migrations and exodus to the united states and canada and also of the pioneer life on the plains. these materials can be read and researched in our library at 1125 w. turnpike ave., bismarck, nd 58501. this library at our international headquarters in bismarck contains many books and magazines dealing with our ancestors.
