managed it services


we get it. “managed it services” sounds boring. but what it enables is nothing short of extraordinary. without a strong digital foundation, even the most impressive ventures can topple under the stress of success. we’ll make sure that your network and devices are set up with all of the right protections and systems from the start. we’ll help keep overhead minimal while giving you a complete it department, a solid it infrastructure, and cybersecurity protection.




cybersecurity


these days a company’s reputation can crumble with a data breach. cyber attacks are constantly evolving. what was a threat a year ago may not be the same threat today. and cybersecurity isn’t just one service. it’s a set of services that stack together to provide broad protection from a wide range of threats. each layer requires knowledge, tools, and certifications. leave this to us, while you and your team focus on growth.




on/off boarding


your people are your greatest asset. great talent is hard to find, and you need every new team member to have great technology experience from day one. making sure they have the right devices, loaded with the right software, passwords and cybersecurity protections is time-consuming. we provide training sessions for all the systems your company relies on to get work done. we make sure your new employee is ready to go, with minimal work from you.




conference room av


hybrid working is now the norm. collaboration technology - in a conference room or a home office - has taken center stage. virtual meetings need to work every time, with clear audio and video to help your team connect, create, and move forward. the solution is the right technology for your collaboration spaces. with the right av solutions, you can all be equal participants whether you’re in the office, abroad, or on the go.




compliance


compliance is a snore, right? well for lots of bigger companies, it’s a necessary evil. it’s important for them to trust that their data is being handled correctly and securely. whether your destination is hipaa or soc 2, we’ll help to make sure your it infrastructure has the same level of compliance as your services and products. give your clients and the regulators confidence that you’re checking off all the right boxes.

tell us about your needs










tech superpowers faqs




my business is just starting out. do i need it this early?



absolutely. even if you don’t have many team members yet, it and technology will help you grow your business, but the earlier you set your standards and protocols, the less you’ll have to change things down the line. by getting it right from the start, you won’t have to drastically change things later when your policies and procedures are more ingrained or rigid. 




what industries do you specialize in?



over our 30 years in business, we’ve worked with businesses in a wide variety of industries from nonprofits to healthcare. in 2022, we returned to our roots and rebranded as tech superpowers. with that rebrand came a renewed focus on partnering with startup ventures and it services in boston. if you’re a new organization looking to get things right from the start, we want to work with you! 




what are your prices?



you won’t see a single price on our website. and that’s intentional. your company is unique, and we believe every client deserves a custom package to fit their needs. we don’t use cookie-cutter solutions or a “good, better, best” tiered system of support. every package we put together is custom-tailored to your organization and designed to scale with you as you grow from startup to success.




we already have an it department. how can you help us?



it support comes in many different forms. it’s not just a team of technicians sitting at a help desk ready to solve your computer problems. we’re here to help you with technology, whether it’s auditing your current cybersecurity protections or helping you get a new product study off the ground with ipad deployments. technology can help your business grow in many ways, and we want to be the catalyst that helps you transform your technology from a liability to an asset.




our current it provider is too expensive. can we save money with you?



we’re not going to be the cheapest managed services provider in town. and we’re ok with that. we provide excellent service and have a proven track record of success. as we see it, the key to success for your growing organization is an investment in the right technology, people, and processes to help your business scale. that requires more than the bare minimum in investment, but gets you the infrastructure to grow, processes that continue to work at scale, and reduction of cyber risk.




how do we know you’ll be a good fit for us?



we don’t. and we don’t know if you’ll be a good fit for us either. we turn down roughly 50% of new business to keep our organization small and focused. when we onboard a new client, we do it with 100% confidence that this partnership will work for both sides and that they’re getting the best service possible. how do we know whether our technology solutions match up well with your organization? contact us, and we’ll set up a time to sit down with you to discuss where you are, where you’d like to go, and how our boston outsourced it can help you get there.
