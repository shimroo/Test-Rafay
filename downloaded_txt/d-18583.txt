credit card faqs


find information on discover cards, how to apply for a credit card online, and more.










what is a credit limit for a credit card?





your credit limit is the maximum amount of money you can charge on your card for purchases, balance transfers, etc. when you apply for a credit card, the bank or credit card company uses a variety of information to decide what credit limit they can offer. as you show responsible credit use, credit card issuers may increase your credit card limit.






what credit score do i need to apply for a discover credit card?





each discover card has its own credit score requirements. for example, the discover it® card is usually a good fit for people with established credit. but the discover it® secured credit card is designed for people looking to build a credit history or rebuild credit with responsible use.3 other factors, like income, may also influence your eligibility. no matter what card you choose, cardmembers earn discover card rewards on every purchase.






is discover card accepted everywhere?





discover is accepted nationwide by 99% of places that take credit cards.8 you can earn rewards with discover when you shop in-store or online, order take-out, fill up your gas tank, and much more.






how can i improve my chances for approvals and higher credit limits when i apply for a credit card?





credit card companies consider several factors in their decision to approve your application, including your credit history and credit score, your income, and more. one of the simplest helpful credit habits is to make at least the minimum payment for all of your bills on time every month.






what are the different types of discover cards?





the discover it® platform offers a suite of credit cards featuring common benefits we’re committed to providing to every customer, including cash back rewards, security features to help prevent credit card fraud, and more. however, rewards and some extra benefits may vary from product to product to be sure we can give different customers what they need.
 
discover it® cash back: earn cashback bonus® rewards at different places
 
discover it® miles: great for vacations or staycations
 
discover it® chrome gas & restaurants: eligible purchases earn more for gas and dining out
 
discover it® secured credit card: build your credit history3
 
discover it® student cash back: students earn rewards at different places
 
discover it® chrome for students: students earn rewards at gas stations and restaurants
 
nhl® discover it®: rep your favorite team while earning rewards






what is the best first credit card to have?





the best first credit card will typically be one that’s meant for someone new to credit to help them responsibly manage and use credit for the first time. if that sounds like you, a secured credit card may be a good option. for students new to credit, there are student credit cards designed more specifically for their needs and financial situation.
 
however, you may also have an established credit history through another form of credit, like repaying an auto loan, and credit card issuers may approve you for other types of credit cards with more perks and better rewards even if this is your first credit card. depending on your credit history and what you’re looking for with your first credit card, you may find you have more options to choose from.






how can i prepare to apply for a credit card?





if you’re thinking about getting a new credit card, you may want to start by checking your credit score. different credit cards require a different credit rating for approval. some cards are only for people with excellent credit or good credit. other cards are great if you have fair credit or are building or rebuilding credit. typically, the higher your score, the more credit card options you’ll have.
 
a credit card comparison can help you choose the one that’s best for you. it's also a good idea to take advantage of pre-approval tools to see what offers you might qualify for. with discover, checking to see if you're pre-approved is fast, easy and won't impact your credit score,7 remember, a full credit card application may impact your credit score.






how many discover cards can i have?





you can have two open discover credit cards at one time. with discover, you can earn rewards on each eligible purchase, from cash back rewards for groceries to miles for travel purchases.






how can i view introductory credit card offers and find the best new credit card offers for me?





you may receive credit card offers in the mail, by email, or online. to find the best fit, compare rewards, sign-up bonus or new member offers, benefits–such as security features to prevent fraud, apr (including introductory rates), fees, and credit limits. look for rewards programs that line up with your spending habits. if you know you’ll use credit for groceries, gas, dining, or travel, you may be able to find a card that helps you earn more rewards in those categories. and look for welcome offers for new cardmembers that don't require a minimum spending amount.






how can i apply for a credit card from discover?





you can apply for discover credit cards at discover.com or by calling 1-800-discover (1-800-347-2683). keep in mind that you must be at least 18 to apply. if you’re under age 21 or applying for a secured credit card, you’ll have to apply online. all discover credit cards, including student cards, earn rewards on every eligible purchase—you can choose a credit card that earns cash back or miles.






how does a credit card work?





a credit card works by providing you with a revolving line of credit that you can access as needed. every month, you’ll receive a statement telling you how much credit you've used and the minimum payment due if you choose not to repay the full balance. if you pay the statement balance in full by the due date each month, you won't be charged interest. otherwise, your unpaid credit card balance accrues interest based on your apr. you can often earn a percentage of your eligible credit card purchases back as rewards, like miles or cash back.
 
when you apply for a credit card, the credit card issuer will pull your credit report–which may result in a hard inquiry–and use it, along with other information you provide, such as your income, to decide whether to approve your application and what your credit limit may be.






what’s the easiest discover card to get?





there’s no easy credit card to get. credit card approval isn’t guaranteed and depends on many factors, like your credit history and income. if you have an established credit history and good credit score, you may find you can get approved for many cards. however, if you’re just starting your credit journey or want to rebuild your credit history,3 discover it® secured credit card may be best for you. similarly, students with limited or no credit history may find that a discover student card fits their financial needs. and remember, every discover credit card earns rewards on purchases.






what are the benefits of discover cards?





discover offers many benefits across our line of products. all discover cards offer rewards, either cash back or miles, on each eligible purchase. plus, only discover automatically gives unlimited cashback match to all new cardmembers: we'll automatically match all the cash back you've earned at the end of your first year.1 also, discover has no annual fee on any of our cards. we’re also serious about protecting your personal information, with benefits that include online privacy protection, free social security number alerts, $0 fraud liability guarantee, and more.
