				what is a cookie bouquet?			

do you know someone who has never tried a cookie bouquet?
they’re only the most scrumptious treat!

cookie bouquets are perfect edible gifts for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions to express a sweet congratulations and make a loved one smile. introduce a friend or family to a cookie bouquet, and they’ll fall in love with all of our desserts.
after all, no one can resist the cute shapes and designs made from our delicious buttercream frosting! each handmade cookie is individually wrapped and carefully arranged by hand so they stay fresh during delivery. choose a colorful box, basket, tin, or bouquet for your gift and watch how quickly it gets delivered! unlike other bouquets, cookies can be frozen to be eaten at a later date too, in case the recipient is out of town. every cookie bouquet can look a little different, plus you can create an arrangement of all your friend’s favorite flavors, like chocolate chip, peanut butter, m&m, traditional buttercream, and more!
what’s better than biting into a soft, homemade cookie that was thoughtfully picked out for you? sharing a cookie bouquet with everyone! order a fresh assortment of custom cookies to be delivered for a large party, work conference, or casual get-together—we’ll make sure there will always be enough goodies to go around! no matter what circumstance, everyone loves a good cookie. and our handmade cookie bouquets are irresistible, down to the last crumb!
