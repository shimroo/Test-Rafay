strategic blending of the art and science of entrepreneurial innovation

crafting a brand strategy through extensive testing to be the ideal solution to a customer's needs.
deploying the latest in technology to reduce operational costs and scale for growth
isn't afraid of asking for directions




â
weâve been successful because we blend both old and new school approaches to differentiate our companies in markets that tend to only focus within their generational comfort zone. companies are often either run by younger owners that never consider traditional marketing approaches like radio or tv, or by older owners who are intimidated by new technology, and then miss out on opening new markets, cost reduction, and scaling for growth.


it's not old vs new school, but old +â new school





we understand what you've gone through.we've started and sold our own companies and had our share of sleepless nights and mediocre success. hitting singles is ok, but home runs can create generational wealth.






a few questions to ask yourself about how prepared you are for growth.

market research: do you have reliable up-to-date external data?
strategic planning: do you have a well-designed and documented marketing plan?
brand development: have you competitively positioned your brand?
promotion: is your communication strategy properly targeted and memorable?
sales: do you have a proactive sales plan in place with a well-trained sales force?
service: do you have customer service policies and procedures in place?
infrastructure: does your internal operation support your marketing?
tracking: do you consistently and accurately measure your performance?
