travisgroom 






						i can't say enough good things about florida weddings. they are by far the friendliest vendors i have experienced. i went into this stressed out and as our on-site coordinator called me my stress went away.  for me, they seemed like friends helping out rather than a cold customer service company. 					


wendy t.bride 






						florida weddings made our wedding far greater than we ever dreamed it could be, with far more ease and timeliness than we ever hoped for, and they did it for far less than we ever expected!					


parker w.groom 






						in one word, "wow!" i seriously cannot say one negative about this company and their services! thank you florida weddings!! you made our day absolutely perfect!					


shannon r.bride 






						it was amazing that everything was included in one package and they did all the work, making it stress free for me. 					


courtney n.bride 






						the team at florida weddings has very well-organized documents to complete and discuss that go though every detail of the décor, ceremony, flowers, pictures, license, location, etc. highly recommend!					


ashely f.treasure island beach wedding 






						we wanted a stress free, affordable, and beautiful wedding and we got exactly that and so much more.					


brook b.bride 






						the easiest professionals to work with! i don't have any complaints whatsoever. everything was so easy, and my wife and i were able to focus on our special day rather then the stress of planning a wedding! cant recommend enough!					


paul k.groom
