                                        i ordered an arrangement for our parents' 50th wedding anniversary. there was a mix-up with some of our names on the card (we did have 10 names on it).  i sent a message to the owner, and they were very apologetic and said they would like to send an apology arrangement and card to my parents, along with the original card with the names corrected.  it was delivered to my parents the next day, and the arrangement is absolutely beautiful. i was so impressed with their customer service! :)

                                        thank you for your same day delivery of roses and a balloon for my parents 60th wedding anniversary.
unable to be together, due to my dad being in the hospital,  this delivery really cheered my mom up, keeping his yearly gift going.

                                        the flowers are beautiful!  the driver had an initial problem finding my sisters’s home but a call from rosemary’s solved that issue.  
will order from rosemary’s again.

                                        we sent these as a gift, so we didn't see anything but the picture.  but we were told they were beautiful and they we well received.  they also were delivered on the day that they were supposed to be.  so all good!
