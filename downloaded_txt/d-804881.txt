welcome to the oiml website




the mission of the oiml is to enable economies to put in place effective legal metrology infrastructures that are mutually compatible and internationally recognized, for all areas for which governments take responsibility, such as those which facilitate trade, establish mutual confidence and harmonize the level of consumer protection worldwide.
 


 
 







 

 

the oiml is an “international standard-setting body” in the sense of the world trade organization's technical barriers to trade agreement. oiml publications should therefore be applied, when appropriate, by all signatories of the tbt agreement when developing technical regulations, in application of article 2.4 of that agreement.

what is legal metrology?


legal metrology is the application of legal requirements to measurements and measuring instruments. very often, small errors in either direction average out over a large number of measurements. but biased errors can create considerable financial prejudice and can have serious economic consequences for the end consumer.

this is why legislation on measurements and measuring instruments is required and virtually all countries provide such protection by including metrology in their legislation – hence the term “legal metrology”...

what is the oiml certification system?


the oiml-cs is a voluntary system for issuing, registering and using oiml certificates and their associated oiml type evaluation/test reports for types of measuring instruments based on the requirements of oiml recommendations.

the aim of the oiml-cs is to facilitate, accelerate and harmonize the work of national and regional bodies that are responsible for type evaluation and approval of measuring instruments subject to legal metrological control.
