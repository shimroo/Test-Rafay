invitation:
big bookstores buy little ones.
huge internet companies eat big bookstores. what happens to the soulful voices, the
quirky voices, voices with so much to say but so few books sold? you
want to publish or read off the beaten trail—whether to the right, the
left, or right there in the middle, just not the same-old same-old. but
where do you go? try cascadia publishing house llc or its imprint, dreamseeker books. 
mission:
supporting examination of
faith, history, and contemporary life from an anabaptist perspective, cascadia
publishing house llc is an anabaptist-mennonite publisher serving
anabaptist, mennonite, christian, and general readers. amid ferment,
diversity, and conflict in culture and church, cascadia authors offer
creative visions and bridge conflictual stances. strong sales are vital
to the casadia mission—but mission comes first, sales next.
cascadia llc releases leading-edge theological and
scholarly volumes under the cascadia label and popular books through
the dreamseeker
books imprint. cascadia publishes independently and in
coordination with other presses, sponsors dreamseeker
magazine,
now extended through blog posts by michael a. king and guests at kingsview
& co,
and offers innercircle readers club no-obligation updates and
discounts.
