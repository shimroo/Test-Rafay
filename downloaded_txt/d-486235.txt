we are a true family business putting traditional craftsmanship, exceptional materials and supreme
            comfort at the heart of everything we

          nurtured the next generation, with their sons; scott and wes, and their daughter in law; natalie completing
          the family team of tailors â meeting the highest standards of savile row bespoke tailoring.

a really great experience from start to finish. my first made to measure suit and i am delighted with
                it. scott's high level of professionalism gently guided the whole process. i never felt under any
                pressure but had complete confidence in his knowledge. highly recommended!
barney payne




i was looking to get my first tailored suit, and told myself before my appointment i would only move
                forward if i felt comfortable that i was dealing with people who knew what they were doing - within
                about 2 minutes of arriving i knew i was in the right place. scott and the team did a great job of
                running through what was available and what would suit me best, and were upfront that some styles
                wouldn't fit my body shape. i really appreciated this, it was a session 'tailored' to me, and liked that
                they looked for the right suit and not just to push a sale. the suit came and fitted perfectly - would
                recommend these guys to anyone.
rhys merrifield




a really top tailor. had two made to measure suits, they are quality materials, a nice cut and a
                perfect fit. i'm 6ft 10, so finding a fitted suit is hard, but now i'll keep coming back time and time
                again. very welcoming and professional, family run business. highly recommended.
matt mullen 




highly recommend going here. excellent service, top quality tailoring, only wish i had time to use
                these guys more often... great family run business with a fascinating history of tailoring.
ade collins 




such an amazing experience! geoff and laura are such lovely people and make you feel really special.
                would recommend this location to anyone. we travelled four times over two hours to use this location and
                loved every moment. thank you team!
samantha page




i was lucky enough to be able to use souster & hicks for my wedding suit and three groomsmen too. from
                the first fitting to the last appointment where i picked up my suit, it was a true pleasure. geoff and
                his two sons were hugely attentive, friendly, funny and skilled to the very highest standards. needless
                to say, we were all delighted with our suits and would recommend souster & hicks to anyone who would
                listen. a true gem. thanks chaps.
ross billington




i am just emailing to send my thanks for your assistance and to let you know that i had a wonderful
                experience on saturday, which was lovely to share with my mum. i very much look forward to seeing the
                finished piece!thanks again to all at souster & hicks, and particularly to you, geoff and
                laura.

our tailoring historya fitting tale


over the years we have become one of the most well-known and respected bespoke tailors in the uk. in 1988
              we were the very first bespoke tailors to feature on the bbc programme âthe clothes showâ. in the same
              year, geoff was elected as the national president of the federation of merchant tailors by his savile row
              peers, making him the youngest bespoke tailor ever to hold this prestigious office.
following in the family name, both of the souster sons; scott and wes and daughter-in-law, natalie, work
              in the business as expert tailors, sewing, drafting, cutting and designing. as important as it is to
              reflect on our past and ensure we continue to provide the very best tailoring experience to our customers,
              weâre excited for the future, with scott, wes and natalie continuing the souster & hicks journey â
              providing top quality clothing that ensures our customers look and feel great.

what does âbespokeâ mean in the world of tailoring?



bespoke tailoring is when a suit or jacket is individually created for someone using their own body
                measurements and preferences. these preferences include selecting their own fabrics and linings,
                specific buttonhole colours, choosing the style of jacket right down to the lapel and pocket detail.
a true bespoke tailor makes a suit that is created by hand with the pattern being drafted by a cutter
                which is sculpted around a man or womanâs body shape, then after spending many hours conducting
                fittings, a coat maker and trouser maker hand finish the garment creating a stunning looking suit that
                fits, looks and feels impeccable.
bespoke comes from the verb âbespeakâ, i.e. speaking for something. its use in fashion is mainly linked
                to menâs suits, although recent years we have seen the term applied to womenâs clothing too. bespoke
                suits, shirts and jeans contrast with factory produced, off-the-shelf clothing that is found across high
                streets. once youâve worn a bespoke suit and seen the quality of both fit and fabrics, itâs very
                difficult to go back to wearing a ready to wear suit. get in touch today
