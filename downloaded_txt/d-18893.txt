types of airsoft rifles
before diving into the list, it’s essential to understand the different types of airsoft rifles, their features, and what makes them unique.


 electric airsoft rifles (aegs)


electric airsoft rifles, or automatic electric guns (aegs) are a cornerstone of the airsoft world, known for their reliability, versatility, and consistent performance.  first invented in the 1990’s by tokyo marui of japan, they have become the standard for most airsoft rifles.  many manufacturers now make airsoft rifles based on the original aeg design by tokyo marui.  rechargeable batteries power these rifles and offer various firing modes, including semi-auto, full-auto, and burst, making them ideal for different play styles and scenarios.  a big plus for aegs is their ability to use high-capacity magazines that can store hundreds of bbs without the need to change magazines.  aegs also deliver consistent performance whether you are shooting in sub zero temperatures or intense summer heat.  they are easy to understand and operate, making them perfect for both beginners and experienced players alike.  can’t find what you’re looking for?  check under our submachine gun (smg) section.

budget options: entry-level aegs are widely available and provide excellent performance for the price.



 gas-powered airsoft rifles


gas airsoft rifles are powered by gas or co2, and can be blowback or non-blowback.  they are used as primary weapons in airsoft skirmishes, and are preferred over electric rifles for their realistic shooting experience.  as realistic airsoft rifles, law enforcement and military training personnel use gas airsoft rifles for airsoft training rifles. use our shopping filters to browse our collection of classic and modern assault gas rifles.  we categorize gas blowback submachine guns separately to rifles.

features: high fps and recoil for added realism.
strengths: superior performance and immersion, great for experienced players.

 hpa (high-pressure air) rifles


high pressure air, or hpa for short, are the pinnacle of high performance airsoft guns. these high performance systems run off of compressed air tanks similar to paintball guns. hpa guns are highly adjustable and have less peak performance limitations compared to other systems. hpa guns usually come at a higher price point, but require less tuning to reach higher limits of performance.

features: advanced consistency and customizability.
strengths: less affected by weather, perfect for competitive players.
budget options: entry-level hpa-compatible rifles are now available at accessible price points.



 airsoft sniper rifles


an airsoft sniper rifle is a highly realistic replica of a real sniper rifle.  airsoft sniper rifles are designed to shoot further and with greater accuracy than airsoft rifles or pistols, allowing the shooter to stay behind the front lines and take out opponents from a distance.  sniper rifles are available as bolt action airsoft sniper rifles or semi-auto sniper rifles. 

features: bolt-action mechanisms and high accuracy.
strengths: ideal for tactical, stealth-oriented gameplay.
budget options: affordable options are available for players just starting out as snipers.



 spring airsoft rifles


spring airsoft guns are manually operated and rely on compressing an internal spring to function. each shot requires the user to cock the gun before firing. these guns cannot shoot in semi-automatic or fully automatic modes. for most spring pistols and rifles, a single airsoft bb is fired with each pull of the trigger. however, spring-powered shotguns can fire multiple bbs with a single shot.

how to choose the right rifle
you’ll want to choose the caliber of your hunting rifle based on the kind of game you plan to hunt. your local game and fish department likely enforces restrictions regarding minimum calibers for large game (bullets that are too small can’t ensure a clean kill and cause the animal unnecessary suffering). conversely, you don’t want a large-caliber rifle for small game; there won’t be much usable meat left behind.
in some states, there are also restrictions on magazine capacity for hunting rifles. the intent behind these laws is to encourage hunters to take careful shots so as to maximize the chances of a clean, humane kill — an important skill to practice, even if it’s not mandated by law.
a high-quality scope is arguably the most important part of a hunting rifle. any experienced long-range shooter will tell you that an expensive scope on a cheap rifle will serve you better than a cheap scope on an expensive rifle.
selecting the right airsoft rifle depends on your play style and preferences.

for fast-paced gameplay, consider electric rifles for their versatility and rapid firing.
for realism and power, gas rifles provide an immersive experience.
for precision and tactical roles, sniper rifles are the best choice.
for competitive play, hpa rifles offer unparalleled performance and customizability.

conclusion
airsoft doesn’t have to be an expensive hobby. the top 10 airsoft rifles under $100 listed above provide budget-friendly options for beginners and experienced players alike. whether you prefer the reliability of electric rifles, the realism of gas-powered models, the advanced capabilities of hpa rifles, or the precision of sniper rifles, there’s something for everyone. start with one of these affordable choices to enhance your airsoft experience and enjoy the thrill of the game without breaking the bank!
 
faq’s
is airsoft painful than a bb gun?
compared to other projectiles, airsoft bbs are typically regarded as less painful than paintballs, which are heavier and have more energy, measured in joules. paintballs can leave bigger bruises or welts than airsoft bbs. that said, steel bbs from bb guns are much more painful due to their higher speed and weight.
what is an airsoft rifle?
airsoft guns are replica guns used in airsoft sports. they are a special type of low-power smoothbore air guns designed to shoot non-metallic spherical projectiles (bb) often colloquially (but incorrectly) referred to as “bbs”, which are typically made of (but not limited to) plastic or biodegradable resin materials.
what are the dangers of airsoft guns?
what’s the risk? those who do not wear eye protection are at risk of eye injury, according to the aap. airsoft pellets that strike the eye can cause scratches, painful pooling of blood inside the eye, lens dislocation or blindness. the aap recommends that kids use paintball-style protective eyewear.
what does aeg mean in airsoft?
aeg stands for automatic electric gun, and is a battery powered airsoft gun which is driven by a gearbox and motor. while there are various versions of gearbox available, these simply denote the shape of the gearbox and thus which platform they are designed for.
what is not allowed in airsoft?
no pyrotechnics of any kind are allowed. no tripwires of any kind are allowed. only airsoft replicas are allowed on the field. no “real steel” gear will be allowed, even if it is stowed, stored, holstered, or sheathed.

pros and cons of different types of airsoft guns
airsoft guns are of three different types: electric, spring powered and gas powered airsoft guns. all these three types of guns have their advantages and disadvantages. before you choose a particular type of airsoft gun, you must know whether it is a good choice for you. in this post, we will discuss these three types of airsoft guns and their pros and cons.
electric airsoft guns
airsoft players love electric airsoft guns, and there are some good reasons why they love these guns. if you are new to this sport, most probably you will choose an electric gun. here are the pros and cons:
pros
these guns are easy to use, and fire silently. a high firing speed is the main reason why electric airsoft guns are so popular.
another good thing is that there are a variety of electric airsoft guns. for optimal gameplay, you can use sniper rifles and machine airsoft guns. grenade launchers are also available. this versatility makes electric guns the first choice for new players.
cons
now let’s talk about some of the disadvantages. the main disadvantage is that the batteries do not last very long. you need to change them. keeping some extra battery packs is a necessity.
in most cases, cheap plastic is used to manufacture these guns. this makes these guns rather fragile. when choosing an airsoft gun, make sure that it is made of good plastic.
another disadvantage of electric guns is that they are not waterproof. if these guns come in contact with water, they may malfunction.
spring-powered airsoft guns   
spring-powered airsoft guns are not as powerful as gas-powered or electric airsoft guns. but in some cases, a spring-powered gun can be even more powerful, especially if you are using a sniper rifle. it has not only more power but also more precision.
pros
the main advantage of spring-powered airsoft guns is that they are really cheap. beginners choose these guns mainly due to their low price. they are reliable because you do not have to worry about changing batteries. spring-powered guns are relatively silent, and they provide surprising accuracy.
cons
now we will look at the disadvantages of spring-powered airsoft guns. the main disadvantage is that these guns are not designed for excessive use. if you use them excessively, they will break easy. with every shot, the spring gets weaker.
typically, cheap plastic is used to manufacture these guns, and that is another disadvantage. although these guns are lightweight, they are susceptible to cracks. spring-powered airsoft guns need to be manually cocked, and many users do not like that.
gas-powered airsoft guns
gas-powered guns are powerful, and that is why mainly advanced players use these guns. these guns often resemble real weapons, since they have blowback and recoil. if you are new to airsoft, we do not recommend gas-powered guns. here are the pros and cons of these guns.
pros            
gas-powered airsoft guns not only resemble real guns but also fire like them. if you want to add modifications to your gun, you can. realistic bolt firing is another great advantage of these guns. this feature makes the simulation more like a real war.
cons
but gas-powered airsoft guns have some cons, and many think the cons outweigh the pros. the first disadvantage is that you can not use these guns in cold weather.
if you choose these guns, be ready to carry some cans of gas, and gas is not something very cheap. you must treat a gas-powered gun just like a real gun. regular cleaning and maintenance are essential.
conclusion
whether you choose electric, gas-powered or spring-powered guns, they all have their pros and cons. we hope you have learnt enough about these guns, and you will make an informed decision.







beginners guide to airsoft – the very basics

beginners guide to airsoft
if you’re thinking about getting into airsoft, this guide will help you understand the basics about what you should expect when practicing airsoft.
what is it & do i need a lot of money?
airsoft, its full name is airsoft skirmishing, is a combat simulation where teams are pitted against each other. they’re both outfitted with replica firearms that fire small plastic pellets, usually having a fire rate of around 15 bbs per second, and a muzzle velocity of 350 feet per second (commonly referred to as fps).
you’re usually playing in a realistic area, with additional equipment, a mission, and special clothing. an important objective of airsoft is simulating being on a real battlefield.
unlike similar sports (such as paintball) your monetary barrier to entry is relatively low. for example, you can invest thousands of dollars into a top of the line gun, or find something a little cheaper online to fit your needs. the bottom line is, you don’t need to be a millionaire to play and have a good time.
does it hurt?
if you’re going to be shoot with little plastic pellets, it’s natural for you to be concerned for your health. in general, how painful a hit will depend on how far away it was shot from, as well as where you were shot at. if you’re hit at long range, you might not even notice the hit, but getting hit on exposed skin at point blank is going to hurt, and might even draw blood. also, unlike paintball airsoft does not leave huge bruises, getting shot feels like getting hit with a rubber band. it hurts, but after a moment you won’t really notice it.
in general, airsoft organizers try to mitigate the risk, so, for the most part, you’ll have plenty of protection. injuries in airsoft are less common than injuries in football. that does not mean there are no injuries, but this usually happens in a high-intensity game in dangerous terrain.
do i need to be in shape?
not really! although being in shape and doing exercise will definitely help you out, you can still play at a high level no matter what happens. if you’re too tired, you can always just hang back and defend a position, and if you really need it you can drop out for a moment and wait in the safe zone.
so how do you play?
while the exact rules will vary depending on what the organizers say, there are usually certain rules that apply to everyone.
first off, getting shot means you’re “dead”. you need to be shot directly for it to count, having a pellet bounce off and hit you does not count. it doesn’t matter if it hit armor or skin, you’re still dead.
after getting “killed” you should raise your arms, shout “hit” and go back to your respawn point. you’ll usually come back to the game after a while, so you don’t need to worry about spending the entire day waiting. sometimes there will be “medics” that can revive you, but that’s up to the organizer.
another way of being killed is through booby traps or through airsoft grenades. these grenades detonate a blank cartridge, and if you’re in the radius of the trap you’re out. you’ll be informed of the radius beforehand by the organizers, but it’s usually around 3 meters.
in case you haven’t noticed, there’s little proof you’ve been shot. because there’s little proof of you actually shooting someone, playing properly also means being honest about it and removing yourself from the game. there can be cheaters, but experienced players can usually tell when they’ve shot someone, so it’s easy to find them.
