along the quaint post alley at seattle’s pike place market awaits one of the city’s most beloved restaurant destinations since 1981: the pink door. equal parts italian-american dining, eclectic entertainment and warm, spirited service, we welcome you!








owner jackie roberts offers an unpretentious escape from the everyday with a classic, produce-driven menu, a convivial atmosphere fueled by her warm, friendly staff (her “goodpeople”), and entertainment such as trapeze, cabaret, music and tarot. whether nestled inside the dining room, relaxing in the lounge or outside on the view deck overlooking elliot bay, the mysterious alchemy of the pink door’s food, ambience and service create a habit-forming experience. 



    reservations
  
  find a table


      if reservations are unavailable, we gladly accept walk-ins!


please note: during peak demand, the waiting list may temporarily close.
        







            what is the usual wait time for walk-ins?
          









we intentionally set aside a portion of our restaurant for walk-ins, ensuring plenty of room for those seeking to be spontaneous. it's not uncommon for a guest to drop by and secure a table or find a cozy spot at our bar without a wait.during our peak hours, you may encounter wait times of approximately 30 minutes for lunch and around an hour for dinner. however, please keep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual wait times can fluctuate based on the day's level of activity. there are instances when a table becomes available immediately, while in some cases, the wait may extend to around 2 hours. the wait duration is influenced by factors such as the size of your party and table availability.for an estimated wait time, please feel free to call us  and we'll provide you with more information. keep in mind that sometimes the waiting list may move quicker or slower than expected, but rest assured, we'll make every effort to seat you as promptly as possible.our waiting list operates as a queue rather than guaranteeing a specific seating time. this means your table could become available at any point before the end of your quoted time. please make sure you are near the restaurant as we provide a 10-minute grace period for your return. if you arrive after this allocated time, we will need to reassign your spot in the queue for the next available table.








            does the pink door have a dress code?
          









yes.  our inhibitions are few and we favor individuality. you have a better chance of getting in if you don't look like a tourist from a cruise ship. get inspired! be creative. try to match the aesthetically pleasing ambience we have worked hard to create.  please note: we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.








            do you offer outdoor seating?
          









our outdoor seating area is typically available from may to september when the temperature surpasses 60 degrees, and seattle is experiencing no rainfall. upon your arrival, reservations will be assigned either indoors or outdoors based on availability. if you have a specific seating preference, kindly include it in your reservation, and we will make every effort to accommodate your request.








            can we make a reservation for a large group?
          









during lunch, we offer reservations for groups of up to 12 people, subject to availability. however, during dinner service, we exclusively accept reservations for parties of six or fewer. please note that we are unable to split larger groups between multiple tables.








            what is the best way to reserve a table?
          









we recommend utilizing our online reservation system, which provides access to our complete reservation inventory. in the event that you cannot secure a table for your desired date and time, it signifies that we have reached full capacity for that day. however, it's important to keep in mind that we do not reserve the entire restaurant, and we do welcome walk-ins, based on availability.








            how far in advance can i book a rerservation?
          









you can make reservations up to 90 calendar days in advance.








            what days are you open?
