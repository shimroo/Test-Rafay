same day delivery service
*the cut-off time for taking same day delivery orders may vary. these include peak periods such as christmas, valentines & mothers day when high order volumes mean we may need to cut off early to ensure all currently accepted orders can be processed in a timely fashion. there are also certain locations that may have an early cut-off due to the distance from the delivering florist or that the florist is closed at that time. we strive to update our order calendar with live information relative to the required delivery location and all our phone order staff can provide up to date delivery information during the order process. provide us with as much contact information as possible so that in the unlikely event that we have a delivery related issue we can contact you.



telephone orders
if you prefer a more personal touch when placing your order or have any questions we are more than happy to take your order over the telephone. you can call us on 01228 900 135 during the office hours displayed below.
over 90% of the uk population is covered with the same day delivery service. some rural areas may have an earlier cut-off time for placing the order and in some instances, the network member florist may not be available to deliver by hand. if you are requesting delivery to a smaller / rural area and would like to check that we can deliver to there before placing your order please call us - our staff are here to help and advise.










our goal is provide the best online flower ordering service backed up with first class customer support. the fsd website has been built with the notion that ordering flowers online should be as simple as possible - we hope you agree that we have met our aims.
