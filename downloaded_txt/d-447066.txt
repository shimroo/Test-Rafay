elder’s success derives, in large part, from the ability of its teachers to transmit to the students a strong work ethic firmly rooted in the gospel values.  indeed, it is not enough to work hard; one must do so in pursuit of building the kingdom of god.  thus, elder teaches its students to taste success through selfless service to others, tireless devotion to academic excellence, and an unflinching desire to succeed – all tempered by christ’s teachings.

ministry

compassion is at the heart of all authentic ministry. if our actions are not a result of a compassionate heart, we are but a noisy gong or a clanging symbol. we look first to our elder family, then to the surrounding community, and finally to the world that is home to us all. an elder student is taught to think globally but act locally. he learns, in word and deed, to reflect christ, whose spirit gives us the desire to minister.
