.. the library is fairly small. currently there was a need for recording books with arabic titles for a small community college (with about 75 students) which is part of the school. this is why we needed the handy library software. the librarians at the school library and the secretary at the community college use application roughly about twice a week. we keep backups of the database on regular basis. the good thing about the software is that the database is easy to maintain.

i am running a community library and i installed library software 
pro, which is a fantastic product and i am recommending it to all the new community libraries that are opening because of the uks budget cuts.

the  community television network is a non-profit public access tv station in portland, maine.
we use the handy equipment tool manager to keep track of about 200 pieces of video equipment that we loan out to our access producers for their video projects. the equipment we manage includes video cameras, tripods, batteries, microphones and cables. we selected handy tool manager because it provides all of the features of programs that are written specifically for access stations but at a much more affordable price â a big concern for a non-profit like ours. one staff member administers the program and the check in/out process is done by one of four staff members using a barcode scanner. the program helps us keep track of overdue equipment so we can ensure that nothing goes missing. the program is very reliable and easy to learn and use.

 about autometed ftp clients: 
" excellent remote backup utility i have downloaded and tested several so-called automated ftp programs the last few days and this is the best one i've tried so far. easy to understand and schedule ftp uploads and downloads. documentation is lacking but if you've ever used any ftp program before you will figure this one out in a matter of minutes. "





 about library software: ..like a dream come true..""i have been searching for an easy inexpensive program for the small library we have at florida medical training institute. when i came across the primasoft small library i knew it was just what the school needed. this program is so easy to use it is like a dream come true. when i have to print a report of our holdings for the accrediting agency, it's just click, click click and done. thank you primasoft for providing a program that doesn't need a rocket scientist to figure out how to work it."

 address organizer deluxe a powerful personal information manager : 
" .. to put it bluntly, everyone could benefit from its functionality. address organizer deluxe can be used by home computer users, by small businesses, and by large corporations .."

small library catalog: book automated cataloging (auto call numbers): "
i got it! awesome!
iâm sorry to keep asking for me, but if you can do it, it saves me a ton of work! can the leading space in this generated call field be removed as part of the script? that would be fantastic!

thanks so much for the great help!, michelle p.

 about organizer deluxe: "i am in my 4th or 5th hour of evaluating db db organizer deluxe. first off, so far i have found it to be a very intuitively designed application i believe you may have the market cornered for small business /home users i have found nothing else with the flexibility that is rooted in a "true" database design...."



âafter using flat-file database programs for more than 40 years, i have found organizer deluxe to be 
far and away the best yet, 
especially for windows 7.  this program is intelligently designed, extremely easy to set up and very flexible.  
but, most important, email support by the developer is wonderful â exceptionally prompt and always spot on.â
