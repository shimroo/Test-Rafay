about me (tom nelson)





many related links are on my linktree here.i have an ms degree in electrical and electronics engineering. i was involved in tech and software for many years. in 2005, as an avid bird-watcher, i became heavily involved in debunking a high-profile, but bogus “ivory-billed woodpecker” rediscovery that opened my eyes to the problems with blindly trusting “peer-reviewed science”. then a meteorologist pointed out lots of parallels between that woodpecker debate and the climate change debate, and i have been debunking climate change/energy claims almost daily since then. first on blogspot, then on twitter, then on tens of podcasts on youtube here (and on many other platforms).my podcast guests have included richard lindzen, will happer, marc morano, judith curry, carl-otto weiss, valentina zharkova, christopher essex, henrik svensmark, patrick moore, ross mckitrick, willie soon, susan crockford, peter ridd, and christopher monckton----my podcast is "tom nelson" on spotify, anchor, apple, google podcasts, youtube, rumble, bitchute, pocket casts, podvine, overcast, stitcher, amazon music podcasts, audible podcasts, castbox, radiopublic, etc.i'm @tan123 on twitter here; substack here.------------------------------------------------------------podcast appearance (1hr 4 min): sept 2022, "tom nelson joins cojac".podcast appearance (1 hr 49 min): july 2022 "out of the blank #1155" on youtube, apple, spotify, etc.podcast appearance (1 hr 22 min): july 2022 "coffee and a mike" on spotify, pocket casts, apple podcasts, etc podcast appearance (1 hr 10 min), "#324: there is no climate emergency with tom nelson", april 2022: "tftc with marty bent" on youtube, spotify, apple, google, etc.podcast appearance (1 hr 44 min): mar 2022 "weaponized news" on odysee, spotify, apple, etc.episode title: "co2 is not the climate control knob".podcast appearance (1hr 17 min): mar 2022 "out of the blank #1047" on youtube, apple, spotify, etc. podcast appearance (1hr 49 min) "109. is co2 the climate control knob? w/ tom nelson": mar 2022 "the bitcoin standard podcast" on youtube, spotify, apple, google, etc.climate skeptic twitter space archive here. started june 2022, 1+ hours each, free-flowing climate skeptic discussions."why you should be a climate skeptic"; my 18 min video"a few climate skeptic thoughts"; 1.5-min video twitter live 1 (29 min); twitter live 2 (29 min)--- some background: jack hitt of the new york times wrote about my ivory-billed woodpecker work in his book “a bunch of amateurs” (see excerpt here):https://twitter.com/tan123/status/547051178190991361key sentences from hitt: “when you watch a real amateur assault on an academic and government fortress, it’s not hard to understand the pleasure..amateurs are more likely to see what is actually there because there’s no money, no power, no prestige (at least not immediately) attached to seeing anything else. amateurs mainly just want to know.”

guest post by david motes- "gw driven by plant evapotranspiration reduction, not co2 ghg.  solution- more plants".   





"david motes is a 43-year professional chemical engineer residing in houston, tx.  his 23 page engineering paper as a guest post is titled: "global warming driven by plant evapotranspiration reduction, not co2 ghg!  solution- more plants".  the paper is summarized as follows:  anthropogenic global warming (agw) is quantitatively driven by co2 induced plant evapotranspiration reduction (per), not co2 greenhouse gas (ghg) effects.  david uses consensus science facts and diagrams from co2 ghg proponent sites such as the ipcc, nasa, noaa, and the international energy agency to quantitatively prove the scientific fact that per is a significant driver in agw.  conversely, co2 ghg theory remains a largely unquantifiable, problematic theory.  by example, 10 co2 ghg theory problems are quantified and graphically presented.  his focus was on engineering quantification versus hereto date presentation of ghg data and theories.  increasing plant life is less expensive and substantially more effective than just reducing annual fossil fuel co2 emissions (contributes only 1% of existing atmospheric co2).  his paper, engineering quantification, and science is well worth reading and further research" click to view a pdf on docdroid.com.

some initial thoughts on parler





--quite a few climate skeptics are already on parler, including anthony watts, marc morano, tony heller, joe bastardi, chris martz, ben pile, james delingpole, jwspry, dr w uddin, jonathan jones, pierre gosselin, kirye, chris horner, willie soon, andrew montford, and more. i'm following all of the above people; you could scroll down here and quickly click to follow all of your favorites:
https://parler.com/profile/tomanelson/following

--parler's technology is behind twitter's tech now, but the chance for us to communicate in a place that isn't radically anti-conservative is wonderful. having a viable competitor could encourage twitter to be slightly less biased.

--i haven't found any tweetdeck-like tools for parler yet. parler search is currently limited to users or hashtags.

---even though i have about 150 times as many twitter followers as parler followers, the number of impressions i get on twitter (left) vs parler (right) doesn't seem wildly different. why?


--1000 characters per post is nice

--info on how to use parler is available on their youtube channel here.

--29-min interview with parler ceo john matze is here.

--4-min video: parler ceo john matze discusses social media's war on free speech and the rise of censorship.

response to don cheadle





(this post was written to respond to don's twitter question here)

don, off the top of my head, here are some things i believe:

1. co2 is a greenhouse gas
2. greenhouse gases have a warming effect
3. human activity has caused atmospheric co2 to increase over the last 100+ years
4. the earth warmed during the 20th century
5. global sea levels rose about 7.5 inches since 1901

6. we can't burn fossil fuels forever without running out
7. alternative energy research is a good thing
8. energy efficiency is a good thing
9. completely destroying the environment is a bad thing
10. i want the best world possible for future generations

some things i don't believe:
11. the earth is a more dangerous place at 61f than at 59f.
12. carbon dioxide taxes can prevent bad weather
13. increased co2 causes drought

if the hard evidence supported the idea that trace co2 is dangerous, i would be fighting very hard on your side.

co2 hysteria risks making energy less available and affordable for poor people who currently have no connection to stable grid power.  many of 
those people's lives could be greatly improved by a big honkin' coal plant instead of some solar panels and wind turbines.



catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is the most massive scientific fraud in human history.

interesting report: skeptic bob heath goes to a warmist conference








last week, i and some physics friends went to the conference in london at the inst of physics. it was an all-day meeting: “studying the climate: a challenge in complexity”. it was organised by the grantham institute, which describes itself as “an institute of imperial college london” with a mission “--to contribute to, and lead on, world-class research, training and innovation towards effective action on climate change and the environment [which] is more relevant now than ever”. one of grantham’s handouts at the meeting was entitled “9 things you can do about climate change”. one suggestion is to cut back on flying, though obviously no one told the tens of thousands who go off to each cop meeting.

nevertheless, imo, the meeting was even more appalling than one might expect with that sort of marketing. i honestly expected better, even from taxpayers-funded alarmists. the audience seemed mostly to be phd students who presumably only get funding to look into how bad things were, and all the speakers seemed far too deeply into the alarm.  not knowing of our position on the issue, my friends and i were asked about what we thought (probably expecting us grey hairs to applaud their efforts) and we said, in various ways, what a load of rubbish it was. it was worth being there to see the looks on their faces. i do not believe any of them had ever met anyone who didn’t go along with the alarm. even worse, i didn’t find any student who wanted to engage in any debate. in fact, they seemed to have little idea about the concepts of curiosity, scepticism, open-mindedness. what has happened to british physics?

the impression of others who go more regularly to iop meetings was that non-believers were not particularly encouraged to come anyway, since the email alerting iop members only went out a short while before the meeting itself. someone i know then offered an abstract on thermodynamic matters relating to climate (showing yet again why co2 cannot perform the magic ascribed to it) but just one day before the meeting was told that there was not enough time to include him. this was obviously untrue as there was time in the programme for so-called flash talks and two unscheduled pro-alarm talks.

clearly, they had little intention of allowing any view to be expressed with might support “it ain’t us” and when we were allowed to ask questions, even basic ones in regard to temperature lagging co2, they were pretty much avoided. i think speakers included some from exeter and reading universities, high altars to the alarm.  of course no physics was discussed which might lead down to the trail of getting anyone to imagine co2 cannot perform miracles.

i have attended hundreds of conferences in my field, for physicists and geophysicists over the years, have given more talks/papers than i can remember (with a fair few i’d rather forget), and at all such meetings contrary but data-supported views were encouraged. i never went to a conference like the iop one though.

but the worst part -lunch only had vegetarian and vegan options. that should have come as no surprise as one of the nine things i can apparently do to avoid climate disaster is to eat less meat.  i left before the end but am informed it got worse. i really couldn’t bear to be part of it any more.

fighting back against upcoming al gore-produced fraudulent "climate reality" presentations in our schools








11/7/19 update--success! our principal has ruled, correctly, against allowing in-classroom al gore propaganda at our local high school on nov 20: "climate change is not a current curricular standard. as a result, it will not be included in the curriculum for this course, and we won't be welcoming in-classroom speakers on the topic".
-----------------------
on nov. 20-21, 2019, in schools around the world, for ages down to kindergarten, al gore's "climate reality" group plans to give presentations based on gore's highly fraudulent "truth in 10" slideshow. https://www.climaterealityproject.org/truth



i think as many skeptics as possible should check out the map here. if a presentation is scheduled at a local school, please take the time to write a complaint letter.  (please let me know via dm, email, or comment here if you do some pushback).



from an email i just sent to our local high school's superintendent, principal, and chemistry teacher:

-------

i found out that a climate presentation from an al gore group (“climate reality”), along with a “climate activism” talk, is scheduled to be given to five mounds view chemistry classes on nov 20. https://realityhub.climaterealityproject.org/events/item/348/45804



the presenter was part of a group personally “trained” by al gore when he was in minneapolis in august 2019.  the stated goal of that training is to "shape public opinion, influence policy, and inspire your community to act at this critical time”: https://www.climaterealityproject.org/training



from climate reality’s mission statement: https://www.climaterealityproject.org/our-mission

"the earth is facing a climate crisis, driven by fossil fuels.

at climate reality, we’re here to make urgent action a necessity. in politics. in business. in every aspect of our lives. everywhere.

urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and speed the global shift to renewables. urgent action to halt the trump administration’s radical fossil fuel agenda"



i view the proposed presentation (given by al gore here) https://www.climaterealityproject.org/truth) as politics masquerading as science. i personally don’t think this presentation or “climate activism" belongs in mvhs chemistry classes, but if that happens, i’d like to ask for “equal time” in those chemistry classes to correct some of that misinformation.



i have a great interest in the scientific debate around climate change; i’ve been sanity-checking these issues almost daily in great detail for about 12 years. i do have about 35 slides (graphs etc) that i’ve pulled together in the last few days, with more planned.



i agree with [another parent] who wrote about the nov 20 presentations:



"the kids should be given both sides and let them use their critical [thinking] skills to decide what they believe. i would be happy to support...you can include me as concerned parent.  i could also attend the class to support your cause”.



thanks!

tom



background: from this al gore tweet, i found out that his “climate reality” group will be making basically the same climate pitch all around the world on nov 20-21, including in high schools and in classes for students as young as kindergarten:



https://twitter.com/algore/status/1189212066898415616



here’s one key misinformation-packed slide from al gore's spiel. look at all the horrible stuff allegedly caused by ~400 ppm co2!

martin,



this is all about mann's famous "hockey stick" graph of the climate of the past 1000 years. science published a paper a couple of months ago by a mainstream climate researcher that raised questions about the uncertainties involved. the contrarians--including some extremists--have been on mann about it for years. there has been at least one dustup over an irresponsibly published anti paper in a disreputable journal. grl is quite reputable but not hard to get into. i've been considering yet again whether it's time to get into some of this. this paper this week is not the time, but i'm guessing the time should be soon. there's another contrarian angle on the ipcc case for human-induced warming coming up that might pair with this.



dick



richard a. kerr senior writer, science phone br> fax br> rkerr@aaas.org 1200 new york avenue, n.w. washington, dc 20005



>>> "martin enserink"  01/26/05 09:46am >>> all,



i was appraoched by a former colleague who is now the publisher of 'natuur en techniek,' a dutch monthly magazine. they are publishing a 12-page take-out about a paper that will be published in grl shortly, which attacks what is apparently a central graph in the kyoto treaty, produced by climate researcher michael mann.



the grl paper (written by two canadian climate skeptics) and this dutch magazine story all but accuse mann of scientific misconduct, and they take some swipes at nature as well.



the magazine seems to think they're onto something huge, and they're trying to get international attention. a canadian newspaper has agreed to print their story, and the wall street journal apparently is interested. (i have attached an english translation of it.) dick: you're a much better judge than i am as to whether this is a interesting, or a big deal. so i'm just forwarding the story, which is embargoed for tomorrow -- do with it what you think is best.



seperately, the natuur en techniek editor is asking whether science is interested in somehow cooperating in the organization of a meeting about this topic later this year, organized with the royal dutch meteorology institute. they also wanted to know if i would chair part of it. eliot, dan: i assume we are not, but i thought i'd check. (i certainly am not going to chair a session about a topic i know little about.)



cheers, martin

dick lindzen on cold and heat extremes






gavin schmidt and richard alley made some comments on extreme weather here. 



dick lindzen (via email) on cold and heat extremes:



"gavin and alley both seem pretty ignorant.  extremes of both cold and heat depend on advection by baroclinic eddies.  this should get weaker in a warmer climate (assuming polar amplification which is another dicey matter).  alley is assuming that one just adds the change in global mean temperature to any current extreme.  marc shouldn’t be so defensive.  he’s not dealing with experts.  on the other hand, perhaps it should be noted that the reduction in extremes is ‘consistent’ with global warming."

hillary clinton tells thrilling tale of obama/clinton planet-saving heroism at copenhagen 2009





from this december 2014 lcv speech (17 min mark).

president obama and i went to the global climate conference in copenhagen in 2009. we ran into a solid wall of opposition from countries like china, india, and brazil.  the president and i literally had to crash a secret meeting between them to force real negotiations.  we marched right by startled chinese security officials. i had to duck under their outstretched arms. we got into the room--you should have seen the looks on the leaders' faces because they'd been dodging us all day and the president said wow, we've been looking for you.  persistence paid off..we did hammer out an agreement..

obama emphasizes threat to public health as part of climate change [scam] push 





obama emphasizes threat to public health as part of climate change push | us news | the guardianmurthy said the issue was “personal” for him, since he once lost an uncle to a severe asthma attack. “we have more people exposed to triggers that can cause asthma attacks, and more asthma attacks mean more days of school missed. they mean more days of work missed. they mean more costly trips to the doctor,” murthy said. “and they most importantly mean more scary moments for parents and for children.” in a background call with reporters ahead of the event, administration officials identified the elderly, children, minorities, the sick and low-income individuals as being at particularly high risk levels for injuries caused by extreme weather.

warmer is better; 17th century--global cooling caused "famines, wars and political upheaval"





historian reveals climate change lessons from 17th centuryin his book “global crisis: war, climate change and catastrophe in the seventeenth century,” parker surveys the broad impact that long, harsh winters and cool, wet summers have had on human populations across the globe. parker uses firsthand accounts and scientific evidence to examine how changing weather patterns caused famines, wars and political upheaval during that time. the book won the society of military history’s distinguished book prize and a medal in 2014 from the british academy for “a landmark academic achievement … which has transformed understanding of a particular subject.”

judith curry pulls no punches: draft climate "statement is an embarrassment to the aps"





draft aps statement on climate change | climate etc.jc reflectionswell, their paragraph on climate science is a rather astonishing take on the aps workshop.  their paragraph on climate change seems to come from the guardian.  their statement on climate action reiterates their rather crazy statement in 2007apart from the issue that no one on the popa seems to understand any of these issues beyond a superficial level (after koonins and rossner departed from the popa), and that their statements are naive and unprofessional, here is my real problem with this.  this is an egregious misuse of the expertise of the aps.  their alleged understanding of issues like spectroscopy and fluid dynamics are not of any direct relevance to the issues they write about in this statement.  the statement is an embarrassment to the aps....jc message to aps popa:  no one cares about your political preferences in the climate change debate.  you have demonstrated that you bring nothing intellectually to the table (once koonins and rossner left).   you simply have no business issuing a policy statement on climate change. you have embarrassed the aps membership.

freeman dyson: it would be crazy to try to reduce co2





check out what much-decorated scientist freeman dyson says about carbon dioxide and climate change:

3:20: "first of all there is man-made climate change ...it's a question of how much and is it good or bad..we don't understand the details.  it's probably much less than is generally claimed. the most important thing is that there are huge non-climate effects of carbon dioxide which are overwhelmingly favorable which are not taken into account. to me that's the main issue--the earth is actually growing greener..it's increasingly agricultural yields, it's increasing forests, it's increasing all kinds of growth... that's more important and more certain than the effects on climate.

5:20: co2 is "enormously beneficial both to food production and also to biodiversity, preservation of species and everything else that's good.  the remarkable thing is that these effects which have nothing to do with climate...are so much easier to measure than the effects on climate and so much more certain"

9:15: [on warmists] "there certainly is an enormous religion in which there are lots of true believers who think that climate change is evil and that we're going to run into big catastrophes if we don't do something drastic. that's a sort of belief system which exists...i don't understand it and i don't pretend to understand their motives."

11:00: "the real world is far more complicated than the models...i don't think any of these models can ever be predictive"

13:45 on sun's effect on climate: "the correlation is certainly there. exactly how the activity of the sun influences the climate is not completely clear. something to do with cosmic rays...probably an effect on clouds"

15:15 "co2 is so beneficial in other ways, it would be crazy to try to reduce it"

16:40: "average temperature of the earth..is a very poorly defined thing anyway"

18:50: "carbon dioxide will increase. we will continue to burn oil and coal; probably it does us good. the earth will get greener as a result"

19:30: "[people from asia] don't feel pessimistic at all...this sort of mood of doom and gloom...only is particularly in the academic communities, particularly in the western societies...the media have gone alone with it, but i think the general public has a lot more common sense." 

20:20: dyson brought along lomborg's book "cool it".  dyson says "i think it's the best general summary i've seen, in a way...i think he's very sound"

21:45: "man-made climate change certainly is real..question is how much and whether it's good or bad...i would say it's on the whole good..it's not as large an effect as most people have imagined".

22:00: "i'm an optimist...everything i look at has improved compared to the 1930s"

climate change -- just a data problem?unfortunately, the statistics we use to understand global climate phenomena are telling a tragic tale, and we must find a way to change these trends. i believe that a large part of the solution to this process involves using mass production methodologies to roll out efficiency at a rapid and global scale. ... jason trager is ceo and co-founder of persistent efficiency, maker of the stick-on energy sensor. he is an energy scientist and sustainability engineer with a phd in mechanical engineering from uc berkeley.

the mask slips on the climate scam





the mask slips on the climate scam | power linewe’re always told that revenue from emissions trading or a carbon tax will be used for energy and climate change adaptation purposes.  but inslee has let the mask slip and made obvious that it is a lie.  liberal politicians especially are drooling for a carbon tax as a new revenue source. it isn’t going to be rebated to taxpayers.  it isn’t going to be used as a bargaining chip for a decent tax reform.  it’s going to be used to pay for more government goodies.inslee isn’t the first to let the mask slip.  in california, jerry brown is planning to use emissions trading funds to pay for his high-speed-rail-to-nowhere project, on the ludicrous grounds that high-speed rail will reduce emissions.  (the opposite is likely the case.)  no one should fall for the carbon tax trap.

baffling stuff from washington gov. inslee: he's selling anti-co2 policy as being about kids' lungs and education, not agw





washington governor puts focus on climate goals, and less on debate - nytimes.comthe deeper reason he is pushing for tough new air-quality policies is to combat worsening health problems, like asthma in children, that are caused by pollution. “it’s not the flowers,” he said. “it’s kids’ lungs.” ... “you don’t even have to allude to climate change,” mr. inslee, a first-term democrat, said in an interview. “one can support this simply on the fact that you want to support the education of your children.”
