our mission



								the mission of this site to further the study of eschatology and preterism. eschatology is from the greek eschatos, 
								âlast,â and signifies the study of âlast things.â eschatology is far and away the most difficult and challenging discipline of 
								biblical study. the usus loquendi of the prophets was highly figurative; their speech was veiled with poetic 
								exaggeration and metaphors; they wrote in signs and symbols. without a working familiarity with their method, the prophets are 
								difficult to apprehend.
							







					this has caused widely divergent interpretations of their writings. however, through the application of sound hermeneutical principles, 
					we believe that the message of the prophets can be objectively ascertained, and that it is best understood by that school of interpretation 
					called preterism. read >>>___________________

vaccine-passports and the mark of the beast
resisting the temptation to interpret ancient prophecies by 
				contemporary events


						 in this article we look at the book of 
				revelation and the âmark of the beast.â we will conclude that, 
				although vaccine-passports adopt coercive techniques similar to 
				those depicted in revelation, the imagery of revelation was 
				fulfilled in the generation it was written.

the five deaths & resurrections of scripture 

including the "first resurrection" and "second death""




 
 






death and resurrection are probably the single most 
								 compelling topics of scripture. in a very real 
								 way, the whole relevance of the bible and 
								 christianity is rooted and founded in human 
								 mortality and the prospect of life after death 
								 (or the lack thereof). in this article, we 
								 examine the death and resurrection of man to 
								 determine what the bible teaches about these 
								 topics. weâll look first death, then at 
								 resurrection.

the dragon, the beast, and the restraining angel of 
				revelationtwenty


in this article, we discuss the identity of revelationâs dragon, 
				beast, and binding angel of chapter twenty. we will conclude 
				that the latter of these refers to claudius caesar in 
				combination with the jus 
				gladii, and the 
				religio licita, which we also identify with the ârestrainerâ 
				of ii thessalonians two. the dragon and beast we will conclude 
				refer to rome and the persecution under nero caesar. along the 
				way, we solve many of revelationâs other riddles.

preterism 101:
the foundations of fulfilled eschatology




				as more and more people become 
				serious students of âlast things,â the number of those 
				investigating preterism is constantly increasing. hence, there 
				is a recurring need to set forth the âfirst principlesâ of the 
				preterist interpretation of scripture. in this article, we will 
				look at the foundations of fulfilled eschatology.

ii peter 3:10-13 and the day of the lord
 

ii peter 3:10-13, with its prediction of 
				the heavens and earth dissolving in a conflagration, stands as 
				one of the major texts relied upon by futurists as proof that 
				christ's second coming has not occurred. 
				in this article, we look at this passage and decide that 
				it refers to the overthrow of world powers in the first century 
				as christ assumed the government of the world and put all 
				enemies beneath his feet.

				________________why i am a preterist




 


this study examines the three 
						categories of end-time scripture - time texts, 
						characters & events, and symbolic imagery - and 
						shows that, alone and together, they testify that the 
						second coming is an event scripture unequivocally places 
						within the first generation of believers.

exposition of revelation twenty—twenty-two
 
rev. 20 â 
				revival of the persecution, blessed state of the martyrs, 
				resurrection of the dead 
the events of 
				this chapter conclude the judgments begun in chapter 17. the 
				battle of gog & magog (vv. 7-10) that brings the defeat of the 
				dragon is the same battle that witnessed the defeat of the 
				harlot in chapter 18, and the beast, false prophet, and kings of 
				the earth in chapter 19.  they are the same battle; 
				both describe the persecution under nero.  the martyrs and 
				confessors who perish under nero and the jews rest in paradise 
				pending the general resurrection.  following the defeat of 
				his temporal enemies, christ vanquishes the last enemy, hadean 
				death. read >>>

commentary on matthew 
						chapter three
the eschatology of 

john the baptist  





 1- in those days 




				we learn from luke that this was the fifteenth year of tiberius 
				caesar (lk. 3:1). roman emperors dated their reigns by calendar 
				years, or from january 1 to december 31 following their 
				accession (the ânon-accessionâ method). augustus caesar, who was 
				the reigning emperor when jesus was born, died august 19, a.d. 
				14. thus, the first regnal year of tiberius would have been the 
				calendar year a.d. 15, making his fifteenth year the calendar 
				year a.d. 29.
