salisbury ridgerunners
the mission of the salisbury ridgerunners snowmobile club, inc. is to provide a safe family environment, and advance the general welfare and safety of snowmobilers, hikers, cross country skiers and all winter sports enthusiasts. to achieve this, we provide the new york state snowmobile safety courses, for all ages beginning at age 10, and the new york state snowmobile safety course.



about
in 1969, a few members got together to discuss their new found freedom, "the snowmobile". now hunters, outdoorsmen and loggers have a new way to give them access to the great outdoors. from these humble beginnings, a dream, vision and countless hours and years of dedicated services later, the modern snowmobile club evolved.
today, we have 116 plus miles of well maintained trails, an extensive fleet of grooming machines and a very capable volunteer staff of workers. our club offers a full modern clubhouse facility and boasts the largest membership in nys. we have land holdings of 100+ acres, a grass and snow racetrack, the largest poker run in the area and a legal gambling license.
