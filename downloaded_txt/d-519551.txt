increase funding for worker protection agencies
chronic underfunding of the federal agency charged with protecting workers means labor traffickers are able to operate with impunity because they are pretty sure no one is watching.  that has to change. the u.s. department of labor must have the resources to hire, train and deploy inspectors who visit job sites and make sure workers are being treated fairly.

strengthen worker protections



human trafficking training
compassionate, committed individuals that care are the most powerful resource there is to prevent and reduce human trafficking. however, to leverage this power, we must ensure we are armed with the knowledge necessary to do the work.
