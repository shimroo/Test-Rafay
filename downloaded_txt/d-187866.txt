a safe, smart, and healthy start



since 1998, arapahoe county early childhood council has served as a hub of support for young children, families, and early childhood providers in our community. with parenting classes, in-home support, and navigator services, we meet arapahoe county kids and families where they are and give them the tools they need to thrive. more than that, we lift up and support early childhood programs throughout the county, offering one-on-one coaching, scholarships, and professional development for providers.
