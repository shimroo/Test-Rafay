google is well known for searching the web, but the

		some time. i have almost forgotten about mapquest.


thanks for visiting:
      i have published this web site to provide a place for useful information 
      to my friends and colleagues.

hentzenwerke publishing 
      has printed copieds (as well as downloadable e-books in
                  pdf format)  of
      what's new in 
      nine: visual foxpro's latest hits. 
have you heard that visual foxpro 9 was released by 
      the end of 2004? have you purchased the latest version and been trying to 
      figure out all the new features? want a head start to understand all that 
      is new from developers who have been working with the product for more 
      than a two years? 

      all the chapters were posted electronically before the book and 
      vfp 9 were released so you could have learned about the many new features 
		in advance.

      check out all the nitty-gritty details about the new report designer, the 
      xml features, enhancements to many of the ide tools including the new data 
      explorer, sql enhancements, new data types, customizable property sheet, 
      hooks to redefine the native ide dialogs, anchoring, better intellisense, 
      stronger remote data integration, the usual improvements to the language, 
      a new version of installshield express, and much, much more.



hentzenwerke publishing 
      has printed copies (as well as downloadable e-books in
                  pdf format)  of 

      deploying visual foxpro solutions.
      ship it! music to your ears or words that cause a cold 
      sweat as you realize you now need to deploy the solution you have worked 
      on for so long? have you planned the deployment? do you have the proper 
      language in your contract with your customer? do you have the proper 
      install package? do you even know what features your installer needs or 
      how to use one of the many installers? 

      what media is the package going to be shipped on to the client? how will 
      it be distributed? is the customer even ready? what happens after 
      setup.exe finishes? do you have the support infrastructure in place? how 
      are you going to handle updates and changes? 

      theres a lot to think about, and deploying a solution requires careful 
      planning. these questions and many more are answered based on real world 
      experience within the pages of this book.



hentzenwerke publishing has printed copies (as well as downloadable e-books in
                  pdf format)  of 

                  megafox: 1002 things you wanted to know about extending visual 
                  foxpro, the much anticipated follow-up book to 
                  kilofox.this is not a second edition of kilofox with one more tip, this is a completely new book based 
                  on the integration of vfp applications with other 
                  technologies.
      answers the how do i. questions every programmer has about using visual 
      foxpro with other programs, tools and applications. contains hundreds of 
      specific how to descriptions, each containing numerous tips and tricks.
      
with its native data engine, rich 
      object oriented language, and capabilities to produce com servers and 
      consume web services, visual foxpro is the single most flexible 
      programming tool available to a software developer. but nothing stands 
      alone anymore. this book will show you how to extend the scope and power 
      of visual foxpro as a development tool by integrating it with other 
      software and technologies. 
the 
      widely-anticipated sequel to 1001 things you wanted to know about vfp (kilofox), 
      megafox both extends coverage of topics in that book such as data driving 
      and reporting and introduces brand new topics such as email, intellisense, 
      charts and graphs, pdf technology, sql server, com/dcom, xml/ado, and 
      designing for extensibility.
