today is a lazy kind of day. i've been feeling a bit tired lately; stave it off all we want, but age will still get to you eventually. don't worry, though! it's just the seasons changing.i remember when the kids were younger, dressing them up for halloween. things sure do change, don't they?i cooked with onions this morning (greek salad omelette) and now my eyes are a bit watery. what a lingering smell!!i'm going to go write a bit and then perhaps have a nap. maybe some kidlets will show up at the door. kids are the window to youth again, aren't they?at any rate, i apologize for being behind on my e-mail. things have been hectic around the home (renovations!!). you should all know that i greatly appreciate them and try to answer as many as i can. take care!
