 welcome to psychology at cmu. with nearly 30 award-winning faculty and almost 150 people in total, we are a vibrant community whose research continues our department’s 100-year tradition of studying the deeper mechanisms and processes underlying human behavior and its social and neural bases. innovation is in our dna: our department has been at the center of helping create new scientific initiatives in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, neural-nets, the role of behavior and medicine and, more recently, university-wide efforts in brain research, artificial intelligence and the science of education.
we are mindful that research should have real-world impact. we have helped to create several successful companies, to build science-based cognitive tutors, to develop the emerging fields of health neuroscience, to better understand how distraction in the classroom affects learning, and to conduct longitudinal clinical trials focused on understanding the social and psychological mechanisms that predict and maintain physical and psychological well-being.
we are also proud members of the larger pittsburgh community. intellectually we share many collaborations with our neighbors at the university of pittsburgh and the university of pittsburgh medical center. personally, we love living here. pittsburgh is an amazing city that offers a quality of life rivaled by few other places in the world.
