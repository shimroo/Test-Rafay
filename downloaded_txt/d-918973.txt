peter pig 15mm figurespeter pig is one of the world's leading 15mm figure manufacturers.  we make 6000 different figures and models.  these are distilled into   1800 (15mm) packs. every range has an associated set of rules. also, there are related 15mm scenery ranges to accompany the figure ranges.  in these days of wandering measures of sizes into 18mm, 12mm and other sizes close to 15mm; peter pig has remained true to the 15mm ideal.  these other sizes are often an attempt by a manufacturer to create a market  for just their peculiar size. it is also used by sculptors who cannot work well with the 15mm size restriction and so need extra size in order to create acceptable sculpts. peter pig will continue to do 15mm wargame figures.  we will also constantly return to each range in order to carry out updates and additions. thus we have  15mm ranges with longevity and future potential.
