as s collector of “old beer stuff” for many years, i’ve accumulated various and assorted beer related items. i buy, trade and sell items from a large variety of breweries. my personal favorite is stegmaier brewing company of wilkes-barre, pa. who distributed a wealth of advertising spanning nearly 100 years.
i’m always looking for items that are different or unique from steg. i’m a member of ecba. if you have any special interests or just want to stop by for a beer chat, drop me a note. thanks for visiting and happy hunting.
come back and visit now and then. i’m always updating the steg photo gallery and my “for sale or trade” pages.
in addition to my beer collecting, i collect old pennsylvania fishing licenses and phillies baseball cards. also, i enjoy bowling, and am an avid fisherman. if i don’t respond right away to your mail it’s probably cause the “gone fishing” sign is posted.
