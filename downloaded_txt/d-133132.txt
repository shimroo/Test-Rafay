welcome to space1999.org! we see you're using internet explorer.  we strongly suggest downloading firefox.  we think you'll like it better:

      · firefox blocks pop-up windows.

      · it's more secure against viruses and spyware.

      · it keeps microsoft from controlling the future of the internet.

      · it's better for web designers and developers.

      · features like tabbed browsing make reading webpages easier.


click the button on the right to download firefox.  it's free.
