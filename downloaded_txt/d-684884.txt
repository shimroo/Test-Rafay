news






















the scenemaster 6 has been retired, and we are happy to introduce the new scenemaster 8 based on the time proven iq512 and shoebox dimmer technologies. turn any space into a performance space with this portable 512 channel dmx memory console that integrates all the easy-to-use control capability of the iq512 with 8 channels of 10a dimmers in a single easy to carry package.

 

upgrading some lighting to 0-10v controlled leds? if you already have 0-10v theatrical controls, but discovered the control signal isn’t being pulled down all the way, we have the solution. check out our new mtx-htl signal converter.



we are excited about the improvements we are making. if you would like to hear about them as they are released, please share your email or follow us on social media.
