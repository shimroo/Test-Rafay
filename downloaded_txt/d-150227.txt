	 katie's place to host its first farm fest
    


katie's place will be holding its first ever farm fest on november 19, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.  it will be located throughout dare to care charities' 90 acre recreation center and camping facility in blue ridge. the event will have craft and food vendors, a petting zoo (complete with llamas), live bands,a  rock climbing wall, bounce house, fire truck, rummage sale, and much more.

the mission of katie's place is to improve the quality of life for people with special needs by providing them with the opportunities to pursue the rewards of self-satisfaction, growth, and community in a rural, farm-like setting. ultimately, katie's place plans to develop a farm where participants will look forward to each day and interact with animals and nature on a continuous basis. to date, the program has hosted several respite retreat programs, which are aimed at giving both adults with disabilities and their families and caretakers, a few days of relief from the challenges of everyday life.

through this event, katie's place hopes to raise funds to begin its day-support program, which is scheduled to begin in january. since there are insufficient programming and housing options for developmentally disabled adults who live in the roanoke valley region, those people with intellectual disabilities often find themselves with few options of living meaningful and fulfilling lives. this event therefore seeks to raise money to provide daily guidance and events for participants at the farm, including such activities as raising organic vegetables and animal husbandry. 

farm fest is currently looking for vendors who would be interested in setting up a table at the event, and also people who would be willing to donate their gently used items to the rummage sale. because katie's place is a 501(c)3 organization, all contributions are tax deductible. for those people who would be willing to volunteer their time and resources to this event are encouraged to contact us for more information.

those who are interested in obtaining more information about this even can call amy baker at dare to care charities (540) 947-5697 or on her cell at (540) 892-4394.

for more information about katie's place in general and its initiatives and goals, visit the web site at katiesplacefarm.org. people can also call amanda carr at the advancement foundation (54) 345-1292, or email her at amanda.carr.katiesplacefarm@gmail.com
