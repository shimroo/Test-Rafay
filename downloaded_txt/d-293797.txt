    haida gwaii



it all begins with an idea.












haida gwaii is the ancestral territory of the haida nation. this storm battered archipelago of 150 rocky islands off british columbia’s west coast is tricky to access at times, which only adds to its allure. with its diverse plant and animal life (the area is nicknamed canada’s galapagos), and monumental poles and longhouses, there is something new to learn for everyone. the islands are home to dramatic landscapes, abundant wildlife, and some of the world’s richest heritage, home to more than 500 archeological sites.

    lowriders
  


it all begins with an idea.


in the mid-twentieth century in southern california, colorful painted classic cars would cruise the boulevards. from cadillac el dorados to chevy impalas, these lowriders were rolling art installations with chrome rims and white wall tires, with the cars meant to be driven "low and slow" as they hugged the pavement. set on hydraulics, the cars would be able to, in the flip of a switch, become lowriders one second and street-legal vehicles the next.

    scrambling the past to make way for a $55 million development



in marin county, california, not too many years ago, a “treasure trove” of coast miwok artifacts was dug up and reburied to make way for a new multi-million dollar housing development.developers of the rose lane project had a problem: their housing site was also the location of a rich archaeological record of the land’s previous inhabitants.


in marin county, california, not too many years ago, a “treasure trove” of coast miwok artifacts was dug up and reburied to make way for a new multi-million dollar housing development.developers of the rose lane project had a problem: their housing site was also the location of a rich archaeological record of the land’s previous inhabitants.according to one of the few archaeologists who briefly studied the site, the archaeological record on-site was “staggering.”the san francisco chronicle wrote that there were,“…600 human burials, tools, musical instruments, harpoon tips, spears and throwing sticks from a time long before the introduction of the bow and arrow. the bones of grizzly and black bears were also found, along with a ceremonial california condor burial.”all of that was dug up, moved nearby, and reburied.the developer claims they did nothing wrong because the removal and reburial of all the remnants of this rich coast miwok site was overseen by the federated indians of graton rancheria.but now, you can buy a 4-bedroom home with “peace, luxury, amidst suburban charm” on rose lane for around $5 million.
