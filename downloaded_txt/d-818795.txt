our new website - openletters.info 

january
26, 2009 cfaba.org announces the launch of openletters.info
this is the new central location where we are
posting the "open letters" we have written to various companies,
organizations, political entities and even government agencies. for
more about what
is openletters.info click here. 

but, in summary let us just say that unfortunately
at times companies, organizations,
political leaders and even government agencies provide bad service or
have other bad business practices. and sometimes after we have tried
all other methods to resolve the issue we still need to write
them a letter. it is our policy if we have to
write a letter it is going to be written as an "open letters". an open
letter means that we can share it with our members and anyone else we
wish to, it is not private.
so, this is the place you can now look to find the
open letters we have found it necessary to write.

we have received some interesting responses to our
question 09 on our candidate questionnaire that reads, “what is your
position on the legalization of homosexual marriage? 
[ ] support, 
[ ] oppose, 
[ ] i don’t know, 
[ ] other 
[ ] more.” 
those responses have been like some of the following:

“marriage is based on religion, it’s status should
be determined there, not by government.”...
