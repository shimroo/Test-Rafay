what is enlightenment and how do you find it?
 
the experience of oneâs true state of total emptiness is indescribable. no pleasure or fleeting happiness or excitement i have experienced before even comes close. nothing i can say will compare, experience it for yourself.

the original works of sri ramana maharshi
translated by michael james

these translations are generally more accurate than the ones published by sri ramanasramam.
ramanaâs three most important works are shown here in boldface.
go here for translations of ramanaâs works by other translators including vicära saá¹graham (self-enquiry).
äá¹ma-viddai: the science of self-knowledge
appaá¸·a päá¹­á¹­u: the appaá¸·am song
aruá¹äcalaramaá¹aá¹: arunachala ramana
äkäá¹ma paã±cakam: five verses on oneself, the one
näá¹ är: who am i?
årä« aruá¹äcala aá¹£á¹­akam: eight verses to arunachala
årä« aruá¹äcala navamaá¹imälai: the necklace of nine gems for arunachala
årä« aruá¹äcala padigam: eleven verses to arunachala
årä« aruá¹äcala paã±caratnam:  the five gems to arunachala
uá¸·á¸·adu näá¹padu: forty verses on what is
upadäåa kaliveá¹bä: the extended version of uá¸·á¸·adu näá¹padu
upadäåa säraá¸¥: the essence of spiritual teachings
upadäåa undiyär: teachings in an undiyär song of thirty verses




itâs âi am iâ not âi-iâ

every time you see âi-iâ in a ramana book, itâs a translation mistake that distorts the meaning.

recognition, an inversion of consciousness

recognition and liberation are attained by turning the attention toward the subjective pole and away from the objective content of consciousness. the effort must be to attain a consciousness without objective content. such a consciousness may be likened to a light in a space that contains no objects.
