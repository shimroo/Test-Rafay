brazen_artistdo you even care anymore you fuck?arg. you sit and toy with me, and the minute i start to get over you you fucking show back up and fuck with my head.what the fuck is your fucking problem?do you know i wasn't sober for three straight days because of you, you fucking asshole?! why do you keep doing this to me? how do you fucking tell someone that you love them and then pull this shit?!fuck you. fuck you and the horse you rode in on. fuck her. fuck every lie you told me. fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck!sd;fjadkfjha;diughafkmg;kadhf;kjahdfkma;flkgha;fngkajf;adhi have nothing left for you to take. you've taken my heart, my pride, and my sanity. what more could you fucking want? what did i ever do to deserve this from you?i hope you realize you are dead to me now. my heart is full of pain, but he is helping to finally heal that. let me have some peace. let me find happiness. stay away from me and my heart.i would have loved you forever. in one day i would have been more to you than she ever could have been in a year. i gave you so much and you took it all.so let me heal. stay away. stay away from me, from my heart. get out of my head. stop invading my thoughts and dreams. leave me the fuck alone. go away, go away, go away. please, please, please just go away. this pain is unbearable.i want to crawl into a hole so deep and far from sober that i'll never have a clear thought again. why can't i escape you?love is misery.oh, btw to anyone reading this - ignore it. i'm not going to explain and i really don't want to be cheered up about it. just ranting.i still love the rest of you.
