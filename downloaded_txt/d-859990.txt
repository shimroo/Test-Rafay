many forum members know by now that after 19 years, i decided to stop with my the freedom man forum. for personal reasons, but also because of the lack of interest from most members. i believe that social media has taken over, and it isn't easy to compete.
however! we managed to save all data from the forum, and we can now keep the forum online with a new provider but in a different way. the forum will be for reading and info only, and posting is not possible anymore, nor is registration for new members.
the future will have to decide if the forum will be active again for posting etc. for now, i think we can enjoy the thousands of exciting postings we have had over the years!
thanks,
ed aka the freedom man

vince treanor's incredible book behind the doors. the story of a legendary band's road manager, to be published december 2022! 
this inside story is a must read for doors fans. vince treanor was the doors' road manager between 1967 and 1972, and has written in great detail and from a very personal viewpoint about his years with the legendary american classic rock group. vince took care of the band's equipment, built stage amplifiers for them, recorded live concerts, captured the doors on 16mm film in 1969, and became a central figure in the doors history.
