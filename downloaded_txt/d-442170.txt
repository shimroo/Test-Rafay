country church i attend. sometimes i even get to combine the two - like
when we have a western-themed vacation bible school.

home on the range
here's yours truly and willy when willy was 26 and before his health began to fail. willy's
registered name is "birchwoods king supreme," but that's a bit of a mouthful, so he was usually just called willy. i have no idea who gave him that nickname originally.






willy at work (play?)
during the time i had him, we've had hundreds of folks of various
sizes on willy. some of the more advanced students developed their sense
of balance and the way a horse moves by doing some basic equestrian vaulting
moves. (vaulting is probably best defined as "gymnastics on horseback").
here's a picture of jenny doing a bareback exercise that i call "the swan." (see
the "willy & company" page for some of willy's other friends.)




where it all began
yep, that's yours truly forkin' his first bronc at the ripe old age of 28 months.
