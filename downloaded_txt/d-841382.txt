recruitparents.com is here to help you get through boot camp. the recruitparents.com roadmap includes information about recruit training (boot camp), schedules, terminology, expectations, and perhaps most importantly, venues to talk with other parents-novices just like you, as well as "expert" parents who've been down this road and experienced the same uncertainties and pride.

		i feel more pride, more compassion, more respect...for my son. being here on this site has been the difference. i read how all the other parents have gone [through] and are going through this change and i find that i'm gaining strength through these very people. we are all in this together and i'm very happy about that. i hope that you find the peace and comfort that i have found here with marineparents.com.
