how scouting has changed

for the first time in its 100+ year history, the iconic program of the boy scouts of america is open to young women as well as young men, all of whom will have the chance to earn scouting’s highest rank, eagle scout. young men and women can go places, test themselves, and have one-of-a-kind adventures that can’t be found anywhere else.

what can i learn from scouting?
in scouting, boys and girls start with their best right now selves and grow into their very best
                    future selves. it’s fun, hands-on learning and achievement that puts kids in the middle of the
                    action and prepares them for today – and for life. scout me in.

scouting spotlight





i absolutely love watching my son and his friends enjoying themselves so intensely. i am even more thrilled about the skills and character that they are developing by being in scouts. they may be having a blast creating new games with just a rope, frisbee and soccer balls, but i see teamwork and creativity. i’m thankful that we have the boy scouts of america helping guide our boys through the essentials of life, creating a solid foundation at an impressionable time.
