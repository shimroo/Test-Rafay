gilbert south carolina area homes services for buyers and sellers
a lot of real estate agents would love to sell your home and charge you a 7% commission when it sells. i founded my company all about serving u real estate services on the principle of serving others and helping them keep most of their hard-earned equity. in contrast to the typical 7% listing agent, i enable you to sell your home for just 1.5% listing side fees. we decide on the buyer's agent fee at the time of listing. this listing model saves you anywhere from $6,000 to $9,000 for a $300,000 home.
p.s. did i mention that i will market and sell your home and save you over 30% to 50% in listing commissions?????
