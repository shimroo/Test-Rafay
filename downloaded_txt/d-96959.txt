emergencies



if you are in urgent need of medical care, please call 911. if you require health care advice for a non-urgent concern, call healthlink bc at 811.






territorial acknowledgement



before canada and bc were formed, indigenous peoples lived in balance and interconnectedness with the land and water in which the necessities of life are provided. health disparities persist, which are due to the impacts of colonization and indigenous-specific racism. healthy lands, healthy people. island health acknowledges and recognizes these homelands and the stewardship of indigenous peoples of this land; it is with humility we continue to work toward building our relationship.
