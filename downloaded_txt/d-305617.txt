i used to standardize most images on these pages to 640x480 pixels
 [then1000x800 more recently]
[and even larger most recently]
and use jpeg format with 50% compression
this gives an average 30-40k file size
[or 80-120k +++ file size more recently]

(thumbnails created here are much smaller, 3-5k)
