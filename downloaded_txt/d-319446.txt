about"this machine kills fascists": while not blunt force trauma protest art, buckfast superbee are a dual-headed beast — an unholy marriage of angular riffs, acerbic lyricism and neck-twitching rock n' roll angst combined with poignant commentary on a frayed society's empty ideals. riled by a human experiment that seems all but over, the native san diego band employs its only weapon — music — against an all-time-low social/political climate that celebrates consumerism, misplaced nationalism, and capital over intelligence, discourse and empathy. in this realm, buckfast superbee not only serves as a necessary call to action but a hard-edged aural reminder: always challenge the status quo...and yourself.  - written by dustin lothspeichtimothy joseph - vocals, guitarderek dutt - guitarkevin stram - bassdanny king - drums
