our campus


a welcoming and accepting culture driven by our 12 benjamin values permeates the school community across each of our campuses. the 10-acre lower/middle school campus, located across from the intracoastal waterway in north palm beach, florida, serves students in grades pk3 through eight. a sprawling 50-acre site in palm beach gardens, florida, is home to our state-of-the-art upper school campus, serving students in grades nine through 12.

we believe that to be extraordinary, students need to be inspired by many experiences. every day our students find countless opportunities to fully immerse themselves in academics, art, athletics, performance, and the pursuit of challenge, creativity, healthy competition, and balance. our campuses and facilities offer incredible opportunities for students to find and explore their passions.

our traditions


benjamin’s heritage of timeless education is built on proven principles that are constantly strengthened and improved upon to meet the evolving needs of students, graduates, and society. 

our graduates balance confidence with humility, competitiveness with a collaborative spirit, and critical thought with emotional intelligence. their commitment to applying their knowledge and skills with impact is complemented by a strong set of morals as they go on to collectively contribute to the world with confidence and enthusiasm. 

at benjamin, students realize they can reach higher. every day, they are encouraged, guided, and shown by example how to advocate for what’s most important. 

as a result, they gain more than just knowledge. they gain the understanding that real gratification comes from putting their intelligence, skills, and talents to use. it is the unmatched feeling of reward that comes from applying what they know in tangible, positive ways that drive them, wherever their continuing pursuits take them.
