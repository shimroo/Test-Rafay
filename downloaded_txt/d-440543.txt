knowledge is power, and staying ahead is all about staying informed. 
the ecommerce and payment processing landscape is in the midst of multiple disruptions — technological, economic and social. this promises to impact payment systems in the coming years. 
emerging payment opportunities














social & live ecommerce
“social ecommerce” is selling goods/services directly within social media platforms like tiktok. it meets consumers where they are, allowing them to make a purchase immediately and seamlessly on social media rather than redirecting them to a business' website. result: more convenient on-demand action.










digital currency
use of digital currencies (including central bank digital currencies) and stablecoins / cryptocurrencies continue to grow. consumers are demanding freedom from central bank or government controls including cross-border payments and remittances, loyalty and rewards and digital-wallet integration.











biometrics & metaverse
consumers are already familiar with using biometrics (e.g. finger, face or iris to access  smartphones). now, they're ready to use them for payments over the internet to making shopping more convenient and secure. 86% are interested in extending the use of biometrics as long as their privacy is respected.


























emerging technologies changing ecommerce landscape and offer new business opportunities 

many of these emerging opportunities are tied to the increasingly digital world we live in — a trend that is accelerating with artificial intelligence and ever expanding digital economy. as our personal and professional lives continue to move online, so does more and more of our economic activity. but more than that, the essential nature of online commerce is evolving, largely to accommodate shifting consumer preferences and disruptive technologies. for a new generation of shoppers, this is  an exciting opportunity but also a challenge to adapt to for business decision makers. 





						"at paymentonline.com we see .new technologies that offer faster, more convenient, more seamless or more personalized commerce experiences. as always, consumer preferences lead the way, and businesses that want to navigate a potentially challenging online commerce landscape need to adopt and adapt to lead mindful of these emerging trends in their favor to stand and make strong gains."

live ecommerce: streaming meets shopping

live ecommerce allows customers to buy products that they see on screen during livestreaming events. the purchase is convenient and quick and is often completed in one click using “buy” links or qr codes shown on screen. it's growing rapidly, thanks in part to the appealing mix of shopping, entertainment and social interaction that it offers. in fact, sales driven by live ecommerce could account for as much as 10% to 20% of all ecommerce by 2026, or roughly $55 billion in sales in the us alone in 2026.




						"paymentonline.com has embraced live ecommerce to allow our clients engage customers and drive sales. earlier this year, the company held a live shopping event on instagram. during the 20-minute livestream marketplace, products were presented for auction sale. this was a big success for our participating clients, resulting in as much as 85% sales increase."
