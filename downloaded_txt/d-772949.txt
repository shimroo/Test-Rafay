	 temporary blog fix
	 
    
so as i dont really like screwing around with css, this is a temporary fix to the annoying problem of posts and comments chopping off at the bottom.

the annoying thing about this is that i cant figure out how you easily comment. i think you click on the number that's next to the title of the post. that number appears to be the number of comments.

lame.

    potato harvest   originally uploaded by merideth. and what's in the mud? well in our backyard, potatoes are in the mud. and tonight when i went to make stew and found that i'd forgotten to buy potatoes, b. suggested that i go out and dig up one of the plants in the garden. okay. rootling around in the dirt outside the house. that's almost like a house project. it's on the house property. i need a tool to do it. close enough!so check it out. all those potatoes came from one plant. it was like an easter egg hunt with dirt and tools! in other words, awesome.and we have 2 more plants that we put in for the winter crop. so the fun hasnt ended. ok. clearly i need this bullsh*t rain to stop so i can get on a real project. pity me.

	 really, really...dont.
	 
    
you think you're tired of my writing about rain? you're one fifty zillionth as tired of it as i am. but i have to write about it because, folks, that is all that is happening.

so, with no actual work going on at house made, i decided that the next best thing i can do with my time is research. (beth says i should have been a library sciences major with my love of the research. oh that's just in case you had some doubt about just how big a dork i am.) annnyyway. so i was poking around the historic chicago initiative's website, wishing that the bay area had an equivalent when i came across this great list of dos and don'ts when restoring/rehabbing bungalows. it's a pretty common sensical little list but looking around my own neighborhood shows me that the sense is not, in fact, common. if you'd like to bury your head in your hands and cry "noooooo" to the computer, check out the first don't image under "front porch, entry ways, and doors."

now all of you, get out there and inform your neighbors! question their trim choices! point out shoddy pintucking! and mock the brochures full of characterless crap windows they want to install. it's for the good of all really.
