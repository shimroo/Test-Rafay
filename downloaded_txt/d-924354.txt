welcome! this site is all about the who. 
inside you'll find close to 19,000 pictures spread over 1,000+ web pages about the 
world's greatest rock band - the who! 
use the navigation buttons on the left column to find info about their 

music, 

videos, 
books, 
magazines, 
posters and various other related information. 
the first ever recordings by the who - "i'm the 
face" and "it was you" !!!




(click on the pictures above to hear a sound sample of each 
song.)
in 1964, the who went through several name changes after 
evolving from the detours. first they were the who, then 
the high numbers and back to the who again...
before, they recorded "zoot suit" and "i'm the face" (as the high numbers), 
the who recorded these (2) two songs on may 11, 1964 and june 4, 1964, 
respectively.  
as you can quickly tell from the sound sample, this version of "i'm the 
face" is very different than the one you are so familiar with. the 
sample starts from the middle
instrumental section of the song to demonstrate the flavor of the differences. "it 
was you" is pete townshend's very first song! it was released by
the naturals in 1964
and chaos & co in 1966, but never 
by the who. hopefully these recordings will see a 2020 official release. you can 
read all about the acetate story
here. enjoy!

about... the site is made up entirely of my personal collection. what started with a cassette 
tape of  who are you (pictured left) at the end of 1978 has grown to  
more than 6,800 of the who /  
the who solo records, cds and tapes. 
why? i found the who to be a "unique band" - different 
and so much better than anything else i've ever heard. as i listened to their 
music, the more i was drawn in. at some point,  i was listening to "the who music" almost exclusively. 
i began buying more...  i initially started "collecting" in order to have every released 
who and who solo song available. "the illustrated the who discography" (pictured 
right) 
became my collecting 'bible'. 



  

i soon learned that 
not every who record or cd was "created equal". albums that 
i thought were "bad", were merely "bad pressings", which could be found 
elsewhere (i.e. from other countries) with much better sound quality. (good 
sound quality helps you enjoy the music. bad sound quality is a 
distraction and hurts the music.) in the process of seeking out the best  
recordings <of the who> from around the globe, my collection began to grow. eventually, it 
became a matter of, "another cool picture!" 

since 
all recordings by the who are not created equal, i have added  
audiophile sound quality reviews under each 
album section to help you decide - what's the best source for you.

my collection, while quite large, is by no means "complete". as with any 
collection, there's always more to be collected. please come back from 
time-to-time and look for  updates as i'm adding to my collection almost daily ... oh... 
and if you want to buy all of it... make me an offer i can't refuse.
