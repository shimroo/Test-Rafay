4/11/06 - thanks to "k-1.c-1." for this.a friend of mine worked on patrick stewart's recent british tv show and passed this along. he says they changed a lot when they shot it. this was the pilot.  "this" is an early draft of the pilot of eleventh hour: man without a shadow written and created by stephen gallagher.  the pilot episode was later renamed eleventh hour: resurrection.  eleventh hour is an amazing british sci-fi-ish thriller starring patrick stewart and ashley jensen.  this is an investigative thriller set in the present and deals with current science/environmental issues.  you must check out the eleventh hour web site where you can find not only the teaser trailer, but also video synopsis of the first four episodes.  i would so love to see this out here in the colonies a little faster than it took for dr. who to make it out this way.
