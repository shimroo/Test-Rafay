wasn't the sabbath just a reminder of freedom from egypt?


here is the old testament text from which this common question arises: "the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord your god. in it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. and remember that you were a slave in the land of egypt, and the lord your god brought you out from there by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the lord your god commanded you to keep the sabbath day" (deuteronomy 5:14, 15).the key to understanding this passage as it relates to sabbath keeping ...
