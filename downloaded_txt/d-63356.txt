change takes time



the pacific coast federation of fishermen’s associations (pcffa) is the largest commercial fishing trade association on the u.s. west coast. since its founding in 1976, it has led the fishing industry in protecting the rights and fighting for the livelihoods of fish harvesters and their fishing-dependent communities.commercial fisheries today face new and complex challenges that threaten our resources, the future of family fishing businesses, and wild seafood production.  pcffa is undergoing some changes of its own to modernize and adapt to these changing times, and we can’t wait to tell you more about it. 



and a little patience



we recently embarked on a project to launch a revamped website, new social media channels, and a robust communication platform to deliver crucial and timely updates on commercial fisheries issues.however, some unexpected technical challenges have set us back. please rest assured that we are diligently working to complete this site and our social media sites to keep us all connected. our goal is to serve as a vital resource for the fleet, showcasing pcffa’s advocacy efforts and celebrating the cultural and economic contributions of commercial fishing to california and beyond.
