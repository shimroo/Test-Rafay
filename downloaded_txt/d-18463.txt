provocative sol items













from the wds archives of del sol review, the ho-ho jan pehechan ho lives again.  who are they?  what do they want from planet earth? gina and a son who? test your dates with this film.









 wds profusely thanks reviewer levi asher for saying what we've all wanted to say for years, namely, that the vollmann emperor is naked to the point of nausea: 

"i have tried hard, so very hard, to appreciate vollmann, a wildly original postmodernist obsessed with history and human aggression who is considered a great intellect by several people i respect. i've eagerly bought his thick, intimidating books, and i have put in solid time trying to read them. i will not try anymore.

william vollmann is, in my opinion, the david blaine of literature. it's all an endurance act. can a skinny kid with pimples and glasses really write a seven volume chronicle of the settlement of north america, follow it with a 3,300 page history of human violence and then toss out an 800 page rumination on the eastern front in world war ii? yes, he can. but if you take the "wow" factor away from william vollmann, does his work stand up?"  thank you, levi! omg, thank you!









past blast into the foghorn cosmos and watch him get abused by a psycho-chick. web del sol's new mascot says howdy to all his fanz. doo dah, doo dah. "i say, i say, wds gives me the fantods, i do declare!"
