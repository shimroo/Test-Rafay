welcome
to the home page for echowyn shelties. shelties have been my passion since
my first sheltie "nicholas" was acquired as a pet in 1985. since that time,
i have immersed myself in the study of the breed, breed related activities
(training, showing, club associations), and interaction with others that
are interested in the breed i love. 
echowyn shelties, as
a hobby, is dedicated to beautiful, healthy, intelligent companions. above
all, shelties are companions - all other activities are just further proof
of the versatility of the breed.

 last 
							shows of the year for us we travelled down to 
							alabama to the cotton cluster. we had an amazing 
							weekend, and brought home new
							
							champion echowyn all in a dream! paisley picked 
							up 3 majors under specialty judges (mark mcmillan, 
							marcia bittner, & guy jeavons) to finish and
							ian 
							picked up a major (guy jeavons) and 2 pt. win 
							(dianne hawes). sadly we also had to say good-bye to 
							casper who had been suffering from acute renal 
							failure. 

the fall was 
							spent picking up minor points at local shows on ian 
							and paisley. player came out of retirement for a few 
							shows and picked up a some grand champion points 
							and enjoyed showing off in the veterans class.

we've only 
							done a few shows this year so far, but have been 
							proud of ian and paisley that have picked up 
							multiple major reserves. at the assa national in 
							fredericksburg, ian,  
							echowyn obsidian went third in his 9-12 futurity 
							class, and 
							
							paisley, echowyn all in a dream, was third in 
							the large bred by exhibitor class. 

ian and 
							paisley are now both pointed. ian picked up points 
							in concord under kathy wilkins and won both days in 
							richmond in june. paisley picked up her first point 
							in richmond.

we have 
							litters planned later this year out of
							
							paisley and
							heidi.

for fun, 
							i've updated the photo
							family tree of 
							echowyn shelties

welcome! we're always
happy to have other sheltie lovers stop by. this page is a work in progress....and 
seriously in need of an overhaul!
i am adding content to these pages as i get the opportunity and adding
to my experience as a fledgling webpage creator in the process. my hope
is that one day - both will amount to something!


in these pages you'll
find an  
introduction
to our family and home. the dogs that make echowyn shelties proud have
their own individual pages that can be accessed from  
the
dog page. that's where you can find out what's 

available,
what breedings are 
planned.  i've also included a page of candid
photos that are  
just for
fun.  puppies, past & present can be seen in the  
puppy
gallery.

if you are seeking
information about shelties, please check out the links on the  
sheltie
info page. i have listed links to primary resources and links to  
clubs
with web pages.  there is also a short article on  
training
puppy ears. i hope to add 
other articles such as choosing a breeder, crate/house
training, and puppy development in the near future. on the  
links
page, i have shared with you many of the resources i've found on the
web, as well as a list of other  
sheltie 
homepages. 
i treat
these pages as my internet scrap book, sharing with you the dogs we are
proud to love and be loved by. please treat the images on these pages with
respect. most all of the photos and graphics are copyrighted by the original
photographer/artist. i have provided links on the links page to the sites
where these  
graphics
and more can be properly obtained. some of the drawings and backgrounds
are my own and represent dogs special to me. please ask before taking these
for your own use. thank you for your cooperation.


please, look around,
have a pleasant stay, and come back soon!
