few professions are more challenging, or more rewarding, than a career in aviation. it opens up opportunities for women to fly to new heights in an atmosphere that has become more diverse in business aviation over time. women in corporate aviation exists to promote career opportunities for women, provide a networking hub and highlight role models and leaders in the profession. we celebrate our delightful differences, unique contributions and exceptional abilities as women in the careers we love.

        what members are saying    



 

“wca has helped me immensely throughout my career. while i still feel as though this is just the beginning, i cannot fathom this adventure without the advice of the friends i’ve made through this extraordinary organization. in addition, i have been awarded scholarships that have not only motivated me to try new things, but have also propelled me further than i’ve ever thought possible. my hope is that i can pay it forward and do the same for others throughout my career.”


sarah gursky





 

“i originally joined wca because of the amazing scholarship opportunities that are provided every year. i was the lucky recipient of the cae cj3 scholarship in 2014. since winning that scholarship and finishing college, i have become a lot more involved in the “behind the scenes” operation of wca – and i love it! the women who are part of this organization are incredible and i am humbled to be a part of their group. i received a ton of encouragement and support to branch out and start the mentoring program, seeing it grow and help women in all aspects of aviation has been amazing!”
