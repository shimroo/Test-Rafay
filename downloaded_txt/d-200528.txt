 membership

thank you for considering a membership with the colorado rifle club. to learn more about membership and the work bond, use the membership tab at the top of this page.
the ranges are open to members only, in daylight hours, and except during tournaments and special events. there is a separation between ranges conducting simultaneous activities. driving time from denver is about one hour. we are close to most shooters, but removed from urban pressure.
when accepted, new members must attend an orientation so that they may become familiar with the facility and club safety rules and procedures. this is required so that we are sure you are safe and also so that you can take full advantage of the facilities.
