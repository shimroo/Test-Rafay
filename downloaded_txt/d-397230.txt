rita picone troia began her love for nature in a suburb of philadelphia, pa. rita graduated from chestnut hill college in philadelphia and began teaching english at the high school level. after many years, her passion for plants and flowers brought her into her own greenhouse. retiring from teaching in the early 1980's, she began her own business, bringing happiness to others through an appreciation of nature.
