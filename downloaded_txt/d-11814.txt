the story of cabo san lucas’s least publicized beach







the story of cabo san lucas’s least publicized beach cabo san lucas, los cabos, baja california sur, mexico los cabos is home to many beautiful beaches, but there is one that never seems to be mentioned despite the fact that its location borders the entrance to the cabo san lucas marina. there are several names used, but i most commonly hear is playa coral negro or cannery beach. the beach skirts in front of the old cannery—once the most productive in all of latin america. on weekends, particularly sundays—locals’ day off—the beach fills.   tourists taking land’s end tours on sundays may be mildly surprised to see older kids scrambling around the rocky outcropping at the far end of playa coral negro en route to playa del amor (it’s generally advised you reach lover’s beach by water). it’s rather a shame more people don’t visit playa coral negro, since its location is central to the history of cabo san lucas. more than 50 years ago, what is now often referred to as a city was little more than a small fishing village. the now-abandoned cannery was once the center of commerce. review by beto haro romero www.loscabosmagazine.com/2014/04/beachcombers/ first published february […]
