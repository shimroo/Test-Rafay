the world is a marvellous place, and i have been privileged to live, work and travel in many of its countries, seeing its sights and meeting wonderful people. looking at the tens of thousands of photos i have of these places i thought i should share some of the views seen and events experienced during almost 60 years of travel. the 20,900 photos and over 570 videos on this site are only a small selection of the world as iâve experienced it over those years. some places visited recently, but others many years ago - each photo and video shows the date it was taken. also shown is the history of the countriesâ national flags.this site was originally only about australia, especially its outback - hence the name ozoutback: the largest number of photos and videos here is still from australia.experience our planet as iâve seen it...ludo kuipers,
