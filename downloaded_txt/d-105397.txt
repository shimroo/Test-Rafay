 just returned from an outstanding bike tour of sicily with experienceplus. tour leaders were knowledgeable and friendly. the routes were varied and took us on little-used roads to lovely villages. car traffic was extremely courteous and safe. the ancient history in sicily was largely unknown to us and very interesting. history, excellent food, good routing and terrific guides: that‚Äôs what we look for in our biking.read moreread less

 my third organized ride with experienceplus. biked coastal croatia and dalmatia for 12 days. tremendous experience, i highly recommend experienceplus co. it was for me a 5 star event from beginning to end, they exceeded all of my expectations again. already planning two other trips with them. having had other experiences with big name companies, i can say with no hesitation experienceplus is unbeatable in every aspect from initial planning to the quality of bikes, tour leaders, the generosity at dining events, to the last hugs and ciao ciao‚Äôs, with watery eyes in most of the participants. i really don‚Äôt think it can get any better. bravo experienceplusüëè.read moreread less
