we find common ground for the common good.



we humanize, we depolarize, and we work collaboratively to advance durable, positive change.



























what we do 



we are bridge builders, trusted counsel, and valued friends who cultivate relationships between companies, advocates, and their funders. we understand the unique cultures between these entities and, therefore, tailor our approach to allow companies and advocates to step outside their echo chambers and connect on a human level to they can hear what needs to be heard, not what they want to be heard.














for nearly 30 years, we have humanized relationships between companies and civil society advocates, enabling them to progress from conflict to collaboration to progress positive social and environmental change.




























we are pioneering experts at helping companies engage their critical stakeholders well before this practice was coined ‘stakeholder capitalism.’ from our founding, we have been committed to depolarization, enabling business and society to flourish.
















we understand nuanced stakeholder dynamics and the importance of engaging beyond the “usual suspects.” our brand is built on the trust and the  relationship capital we have built over a quarter century. we’re here to work in partnership with you, with integrity - every time.
















we anticipate emerging material risks by understanding evolving stakeholder expectations of companies,  enabling business and civil society to move past differences and find ways to scale positive impact.















how we do it 




we help businesses identify, prioritize and constructively engage with their highest value stakeholders around challenging issues – before, during, and after conflicts arise.we envision a depolarized world where business and civil society collaborate responsibly to enable life to flourish. we are a mission driven non-profit that guides companies and stakeholders to engage constructively to achieve positive impact - financial, social, and environmental.

who we are 




mission: “we build trust between companies, advocates, investors and philanthropists to advance business as a force for good.”




our three pillars:  to uphold future 500’s mission, our team will advance three strategic pillars to position us to scale our impact:
















workplace: we will nurture an empowering, diverse, inclusive, and supportive culture. our aim is for each team member to have a sense of belonging, respect, and that their work is integral to the organization's success. individuals are able to leverage their unique strengths,  to realize their career goals in pursuit of our mission.
















excellence: we will be recognized as leaders in stakeholder engagement. we are critical friends and trusted bridge builders, adept at depolarizing conflict between corporations and stakeholders and enabling constructive advancement of positive solutions leveraging the power of business as a force for good.
















impact: we will identify internal project goals, and strive to tangibly measure and quantify our impact – directly, indirectly, and qualitatively via the stakeholders we engage.
