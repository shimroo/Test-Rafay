“they say that the things in your life today are things you once prayed for, and holland diane in this doll shop is one rejoicing reminder of all the prayers that have been answered in my life. the shop is messier, everything takes longer, my eyes are wrinkler, and my body is more tired, but lord, thank you for all of this. i see her looking at the tree lights and the dolls as i softly tell her stories of the woman who knew who she was so many years ago. i tell her how my mom made sure in her passing that we could live this life and come to work together and be happy. she made sure we wouldn’t miss a moment, and i want to drown in gratitude every single day we live them.”

tribute to jonathan green



aug 11, 2023




the pain of losing jonathan last december was unlike anything i've ever felt. it was the collective embrace of our community, and the strength we found in one another during the event that brought a glimmer of healing.

the joy of giving and receiving dolls: celebrating the magic of sharing



jun 10, 2023




we recently enjoyed hosting altyn, a passionate 12-year-old collector, at our doll shop. little did he know that we had a surprise in store for him—a "doll show" where he could choose anything his heart desired.

shopping at grandma's for the nursery



aug 16, 2021




this past weekend, derek closed his ceramics studio, and i closed the doll shop, and we worked on the nursery. it was one of those weekends where you find yourself taking a deep sigh and thinking, "we should do this more often." so derek painted while i helped update his website. it wasn't until recently that i started dreaming of things like how i might like a nursery. i found some inspiration photos on the internet that had large giraffes standing by, protecting the crib. i knew i didn't need to go out and purchase one as i had the best place to go.
