see the progress
with modern office space, outdoor workstations, entertainment and dining options, arizona center is proud to be part of the culture and vibe of downtown phoenix.
in 2021 the first upscale select-service boutique hotel, ac hotel phoenix downtown, opened at arizona center. the hotel’s purposeful design focuses on creating synergy with arizona center’s live work play mantra by including a unique indoor-outdoor lobby lounge and bar that overlooks the heart of arizona center and its retail amenities.
a new 28-story residential tower, palmtower, is now underway on the property. the tower will have 354 apartment units, a 17,500-square-foot amenity level with an outdoor pool and indoor-outdoor common space, as well as six floors of above ground parking and ample bike parking.
stay tuned for more to come!
