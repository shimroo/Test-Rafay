meet our '25 lineupmeet our 2025 lineup! 
after a complete product redesign in 2024, we've further taken our pontoon lineup to the next level. with more layouts, color combos, and options than ever before, viaggio is proud to have a complete product offering for almost any budget! 
our family to yoursfrom our family to yoursbeing a family-owned company, our priority is to keep your family safe. that's why each of our boats (from entry level to high-end) feature the same heavy duty construction, while maintaining the unparalleled value we offer at viaggio. we'd rather you focus on the other things . . . like optimizing your time together on the water. overhead_diamante 






our first viaggio was built in 2020, but our history begins long before that. we’re family owned by a team with a long history of success in manufacturing-rich elkhart county, indiana. from owning and operating the number one living quarters horse trailer manufacturer to various other industry-leading recreational vehicle manufacturers and parts vendors, our team knows what it takes to not only build quality products, but also build and maintain quality relationships.
viaggio marine took this manufacturing experience (with a focus on quality, service, and value) and applied it to our cutting edge viaggio pontoon boats. after considering the bold angled lines resembling a v, we only felt it fitting to name this newly-developed product “viaggio,” the italian word for journey. we proudly build our pontoon boats with the finest craftsmanship and strongest construction in the industry. so whether you’re young or old and whether you’re seeking a boat for cruising or performance, viaggio marine manufactures a complete lineup of heavily constructed, bold looking boats that can do it all!
viaggio
[vee-ah-g-oh] (verb), italian word for journey or voyage
