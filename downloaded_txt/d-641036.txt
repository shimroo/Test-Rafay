for a kinder community






faithful friends animal society was born out of a moral imperative to expose the mass killing of cats and dogs entering delaware’s publicly funded shelters. for two decades, our advocacy has vastly improved outcomes for shelter animals, saving thousands of easily adoptable, trainable, and treatable pets from certain death. with an unflagging commitment to our mission, we continue to advocate for reform, save lives, and reduce pet relinquishment through our local programs and services.












faithful friends animal society is a private, nonprofit animal welfare organization with a no kill shelter and community veterinary clinic. all animals in our care stay with us until placed into new homes. we are funded through donations, grants, and fees for services. we allocate the majority of our budget (about 82%) for community programs and services.
