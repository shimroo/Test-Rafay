  updates


















 
may 2006
i recently discovered ccg maker.  it's not a pbem tool, more like a design tool.  it will assist you in creating beautiful magic style cards for games.  i added a link in the 'tools' menu.
							
							todd zircher (remember him from the v_map days?) has created a pbm-ish "virtual miniatures" space called 
virmin 
(catchy!). it's not really pbem but it does sort of relate to gaming online.
							i don't think anyone has done any work on a pbem aide for borderlands (eon).  well, i have just finished a cb gamebox for it.  
                             it is located here (the zip has much useful information in pdf format to assist you in getting started).  
here's a little something: i made a tiny cyberboard gamebox called dipchooser.  it will randomly draw flags out of a "hat" to create the player order for pbem diplomacy games.  i'm not sure that cyberboard is the best way to conduct diplomacy games any more (i would give that to jdip or some other judge program), but
							 dipchooser is still useful because it creates a nice graphic of the period flags coming out in random order. 
 download it here
.
tristan koehler, the fellow who built the first (licensed) ogre cyberboard gamebox, has outdone himself.
							his new ogre on mars gamebox is outstanding-- a visual treat (see a picture).  if you wish to 
							download ogre on mars, visit tristan's ogre page.  beware, many popups.  the ogre on mars idea, is 
							based (partially) on my old (circa 2000) ogreluna variant.. yay!  i hope i can convince tristan to make a lunar landscape some day, as i recently rediscovered the special
							counters that cisco serrett drew for the lunar variant.  tristan's ogre page, by the by, has much good supporting documentation for ogre via pbem and just pbem in general.
							
							courtesy of the javascript 
                              rss box viewer, i have added message feed pages 
                              added for cyberboard ml, vassal and virtual wargame 
                              club yahoogroups. this can be a useful feature if 
                              your network doesn't allow acccess to yahoo. see 
                              the menu, bottom left. i will continue to add to 
                              these as i discover new relevant feeds.

the csw chat room hosted dale larson for a discussion 
                              of the next stage (version 4.0) of his popular pbem 
                              utility cyberboard. the 
                              transcript is here.
the cyberboard 
                              open documentation project has resurfaced, 
                              this time using a wikki engine. please contribute!
february 2006
the virtual wargamers club has stood up a website, 
                              a yahoogroup, 
                              and a 
                              wiki. their first "virtual convention" 
                              was a success. another one is in the works for july.
december 2005
the cyberboard design olympics concluded. see the 
                              winning gameboxes here. congratulations to the winners!
september 2005

                              correction on the previous entry: "the 3.0 release 
                              has a few nasties in it that i'd rather not have 
                              propagate." -- dale larson
                              the current (3.1) version is at this 
                              link

                              august 2005
the final version 3.0 of cyberboard is 
                              now available at: 
cyberboard 
                              version 3.0 (it's about a 1.3 mb download)
important! the final version upgrades 
                              your files so they will no longer load into the 
                              v3 betas or v2.0 software.
the software has no time limits. feature-wise (and 
                              bug-wise) it is essentially the same software as 
                              beta 7 but has much the internal debug code and 
                              the time limits removed. i feel the software is 
                              stable enough to go gold even though some nuisance 
                              bugs still need to be dealt with. 
----------------------------------- 
cyberboard 3.0 new features: 
 a revamped user interface including:



dockable trays and markers. 
                                - tabs that allow direct selection of open windows. 
                                - new xp menu style with icons. - customizable 
                                tool bars. - assignable hot keys for menu items. 
                                - compatible with new winxp user interface. 


 65536 color (aka 16 
                                bit color) support. along with the new ui framework, 
                                this was a large chunk of the work for this release.


 greatly improved color palette 
                                window:


the first 3 x 8 area from 
                                    the left are standard colors along with a 
                                    grey scale 


the next 6 x 8 area are 
                                    the custom colors that can be set in a variety 
                                    of ways. 


the box to the right of 
                                    the 6 x 8 area is the current color mix created 
                                    by changing the bottom hue picker and the 
                                    saturation/value picker on the far right. 
                                  


the 48 custom colors are 
                                    saved with the gamebox file. 


you can double-click on 
                                    a custom color to adjust it using a color 
                                    setting dialog. 


 the message history window 
                                    is now stand-alone and can be docked.


 message history text is 
                                    now color coded. 




 playing boards can be rotated 
                                by 180 degrees during play.


 playback functionality is greatly 
                                improved:


the default hot key assignments 
                                have been changed: 


f2 - previous move 
                                f3 - next move f4 - next history 
                                entry f5 - close history playback f6 
                                - toggle automatic playback 


the spacebar can be used to 
                                do "next move"s instead of f3. 


you can hit the "next move" 
                                command before the current move is totally played 
                                back. with this you can blast through moves if 
                                you don't want to see the animated playback. 


you can turn on an option that 
                                causes the "next move" command to automatically 
                                load the next history record when at the end of 
                                the current history record. 


you can turn on an option called 
                                "automatic playback (f6)". when you 
                                hit the "next move" command cyberboard 
                                takes over and steps moves all the way to the 
                                end without you having to hit any keys. you hit 
                                the next move command again to abort the playback. 
                              


 new game files by default render 
                                locked objects underneath other non-locked pieces 
                                and markers. for backward compatibility reasons 
                                upgraded games render locked objects in their 
                                current postions in the drawing order. this option 
                                can be changed in the board properties dialog.


 all three zoom levels are available 
                                in the player program.




march 2005

as you might have noticed.  there's 
                            some other folks out there doing a far superior job 
                            to my own humble efforts in archiving cyberboard gameboxes.  
                            i have resources, but no time.  therefore, i 
                            encourage you to visit limey 
                            yank games when you get a chance.  these 
                            guys are religious about it.
 
the big news is the cyberboard design 
                            olympics, being run by andy and fritz of limey yank 
                            fame. click on the logo to go to the discussion board 
                            and enter!

                            . 
 
game 
                            turn  (an open source pbem toolsuite) 
                            shows some promise. i've been following the development 
                            of this on csw but haven't really played around with 
                            it enough to feel very comfortable using it.
 
hexwar.com 
                            is a play for pay site set up by decision games.  
                            very nice interface.  a bit pricey for me (personally) 
                            but i love what they are doing.  try out their 
                            napoleon at waterloo game, it's free. bruce wigdor 
                            has also set up the wargameroom 
                            pay for play site using a java based engine of his 
                            own design-- the modules are customized for specific 
                            games, notably the gmt card driven series and up front 
                            (ah). 
 
i've seen a lot of webified games 
                            hitting the internet lately-- mostly family or euro 
                            style games but also some grognard things like blue 
                            max over at youplay.it  this is a neat trend.  
                            many pbem sites try to be all things to everyone-- 
                            i much prefer a site that focuses on a subset of games 
                            that it can present really well, such as aaron marriner's 
                            no frills amarriner.com 
                            or jim mccann's consimnet.  
                            there's almost a glut of tools available now, so i 
                            really think that the community is better served by 
                            sites that focus on administering a focused subsection 
                            of gaming.
 
june 2004
 
trying out a new 
cyberboard portal 
                            page   hope this is helpful.  
                            do me a favor, comment on it in the bbs if it needs 
                            something.  we are also adding a temple 
                            of mars section based upon the old emporium page, 
                            and will start populating boardgame geek's pbem 
                            wiki for a mirror of some of the pbem educational 
                            material that has been developed over the years.  
                            moved games on screen to the "defunct utilities?" 
                            page.
 
feb 2004 
 
fixed the gtl link, finally
 
jeff fisher's excellent gtl utility 
                            is now on site.  look 
                            here
 
 
opponents wanted bbs  inaugurated


                            i found another guy's cyberboard site was using this 
                            freebie (alas, ad-driven) bbs/weboard thing. it's 
                            not too intrusive, and feature we could use here.  
                            so what the heck? drop on in and post to our new opponents 
                            wanted  section (in the 
                            menu bar above). 
 
cyberboard file portal 
                            inaugurated

 i am kicking off a newer style of collating 
                            all the numerous cyberboard file distribution sites 
                            into a script i call a "file 
                            distro portal ". i hope this is helpful. 
                            this portal script is nothing more or less than skip 
                            franklin's list with a few extras added, presented 
                            in a different format. 
here's the old 
                            site link , it's still up
