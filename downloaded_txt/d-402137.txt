what will you and your child find in a music together class? rainbow colored falling leaves, cows sitting in the old oak tree, tyrannosaurus rex, shining stars, rockets to the moon, trains to the beach. you will hear happy village harvest dances, korean lullabies, cuban rain forest songs, jazz, classical, oldies and goodies, music from around the globe as well as original compositions written for music together classes.  you'll find drums of all sorts, bells, triangles, shakers, scrapers, kitchen instruments, scarves, stretchy dancing ribbons - instruments galore!
you will find high energy movers and quiet observers all intently involved in their own way in the exciting musical happenings around them, whether it's a rousing israeli wedding dance, or the glorious sounds of big ben's bells and chimes played on resonator bars.
music together classes provide a true family music experience, as siblings can attend the mixed age classes together. moms, dads, aunts, uncles, grandparents and best buddies are all invited to attend.
