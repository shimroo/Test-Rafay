why gemstone professionals  gemval





your website is a priceless time saver for us! instead of making a research on current gemstone pricing using numerous online resources, every time i need to know how much a particular gemstone is currently worth, i just pop its parameters into gemval system and get an instant result. this is the best resource to learn a gem price within minutes! 

							michael huber

for pricing, this is a tool that i consider indespensible. the only way i know how to tell near the value... sometimes i check gemval before bidding and always before listing. when i list, i always include a statement, saying according to gemval, this stone is valued at approximately $----. i hope to see your website every time i boot up my computer... don't know what i would do without it... 

							terry ells

hello, first of all i wanted to state that i absolutely love your website. being an amateur collector i have very limited resources to find the value of gemstones, so this has become a wonderful instrument in logging and getting a rough estimation of my collection... thank you so much for aiding in my fascination with the incredible world of gemstones.

							joy fussinger

this is very helpful in guiding me in determining the value of my stones. i noticed that a lot of prices i find online are a bit higher than the appraisal i received here. however this is a great site and very very beneficial to me.
