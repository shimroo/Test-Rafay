what people say

“so i looked up a private investigator that could help me follow my husband as i had suspicions he was playing around behind my back.
i am really happy i found pinnacle investigations for many reasons but mainly because they were fantastic and caught him red-handed. i was kept up to date during the surveillance last night and they sent me a report straight after with photographs showing everything.
i want to say thank you and i hope other people in my position pluck up the courage and contact this agency because they can help, they will help and you do not need to continue living this way.
