welcome to hyde heath
 
      !

in the countryside of the chiltern hills in the heart of buckinghamshire, 
    hyde heath has  
many fine services and activities to offer - plus a full 
    social life centred on our village hall.




 
 
 




we 
            have one of the smallest churches in bucks plus a
        
baptist 
chapel - neither of them far from our 
            village pub, the plough.

        day to day needs, details of which are here


 
 
 


bus services operate to many surrounding schools indeed the area is 
            known for its high quality of educational facilities. for the commuter, 
            there is an excellent service to london from amersham on either the 
            metropolitan line to baker st or on chiltern railways into 
            marylebone.
