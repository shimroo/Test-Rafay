general information and resources
welcome to the grants information collection (gic), a funding information network partner of candid (formerly the foundation center). the gic is a library collection located in madison, wi where visitors do their own research.

grants research

onsite research

for non-uw-madison affiliates: we currently have at least one computer workstation that does not require a login. our other workstations require logins. if you do not have a uw-madison netid and password, please contact circulation support with the date you plan to visit to request a guest netid. receiving a guest netid may take at least 24 hours, and requests are processed only on weekdays.
