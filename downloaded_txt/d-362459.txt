                                        flowers are beautiful.  left flowers outside by door.  not sure if deliverer rang doorbell or knocked on door.  at any rate, my mother didn't hear it, so flowers were left outside overnight.  i brought them in this morning when i went over to my mother' house.  flowers appear to be okay.

                                        thank you for taking care of this for me. the representative i spoke with was very compassionate and i appreciate it. i did ask for a picture of the attachment to be emailed to me and that did not happen, so i was a little disappointed. however, if the occasion happens again, i will give you a call for assistance.

                                        the blossom shoppe provided two amazing flower sprays for my wife's memorial.  the quality was good and they have lasted for two weeks.  the also brought the flowers to the church on schedule and were very professional.

                                        our family was so busy making arrangements for my father, that we had forgot to get flowers. we contacted the blossom shoppe at the end of the day before the service. they were able to have them ready for us in a timely manner. the spray was beautiful and complimented his military service. i recommend blossom shoppe!
