about us
what band can perform the 
						most iconic rock songs of all time? what band can play 
						the most challenging hits that other bands would never 
						dream to attempt? and what band has been thrilling 
						local, national and international audiences for over 30 
						years?
the answer is tampa bay's 
						stormbringer band.


boasting the very same 
						members for the last 21 years, stormbringer effortlessly 
						delivers air tight renditions of hit songs like queen's 
						bohemian rhapsody, pink floyd's the wall and bon jovi's 
						livin' on a prayer. a stunning concert act that also 
						possesses a rockin' catalogue of non-stop party and 
						dance songs, the band provides crowd pleasing music to 
						perfectly match any large event.
stormbringer features 
						soaring lead vocals, crisp four-part harmonies, 
						thunderous drums, dramatic keyboards and crunching 
						guitars in their hundred-plus song repertoire. but the 
						band has another amazing distinction that sets them 
						apart from the others. stormbringer is employed by 
						rock's biggest artists to back them in concert when they 
						don't use their own band. legendary classic rock heroes 
						hire stormbringer because the music is reproduced and 
						performed with spot-on accuracy and jaw dropping 
						precision.
