berkeley castle
the berkeley family welcome you to berkeley castle; their ancient fortress home where they have lived since the late 12th century.
the most remarkable thing about the castle is that for nine centuries, the building, the berkeley family, the archives (which go back to the 12th century), the contents, the estate and the town have all survived together.
its place in history is significant, not just because it is still intact, but because the berkeley family and their home have played an important part in the power struggles of so many centuries.
