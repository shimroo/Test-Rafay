what do we do?we maintain and develop internationally competitive research programmes in pain and consciousness, respiration and hypoxia, intensive care, simulation and human factors training.we operate as closely associated university and hospital divisions providing the framework for teaching, research and anaesthetic services. we run nationally and internationally recognised teaching programmes in a range of anaesthetic related areas (e.g. primary trauma care, regional anaesthesia, and anaesthesia in the developing world).read the history of the nuffield division of anaesthetics.
