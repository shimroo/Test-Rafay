our missionthe bcscc is committed to exploration, research, investigation and also to maintaining databases on cryptozoological animals from all over the globe. in this we involve our membership which is both broad and international in scope. we pride ourselves in conducting ongoing fieldwork in a number of different locations in british columbia as well as across the face of the globe. without fieldwork there is no practical reason for our existence and so it is that we are resolved to continue to work actively – wherever we need to – in a bid to locate and catalogue unknown animals of every kind.

our organization



founded in 1989 by writer james a. clark, scientist dr. paul leblond and journalist john kirk, the british columbia scientific cryptozoology club (b.c.s.c.c.) comprises a broadly-based membership of enthusiasts dedicated to the investigation of various animals as yet unidentified by science. we are actively engaged year-round in many different aspects of exciting fieldwork.

take action



club members have participated in a variety of cryptozoological ventures. one of our most important ventures involved bcscc members teaming up with cryptosafari to search for the mokele-mbembe in west-central africa. at present members of the bcscc executive are also part of the autonomous caddyscan project. in british columbia, we have teamed up with various investigators to conduct sasquatch field investigations.
