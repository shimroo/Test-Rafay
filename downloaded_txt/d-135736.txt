multi-factor authentication (mfa) is a security technology that requires multiple methods of authentication. the goal of mfa is to create a layered defense that makes it more difficult for an unauthorized person to access your account. when you use mfa, you login using your username, password, and a third factor - either a smartphone app (duo) or a hardware token. even if your password is compromised your account will remain secure. it is likely that you may already be familiar with mfa for handling personal accounts such as online banking, social media apps, google, etc. at caltech multi-factor authentication is already required for certain groups and applications and for new caltech accounts.benefitsone of the easiest and most effective ways to keep your account secureaccount remains protected even if password is compromisedquick setup process, simple to use, and free when using the duo mobile applearn more about multi-factor authentication (duo) & office 365. if you already meet the requirements and are ready to enroll in mfa for office 365, please review the mfa self enrollment page for the next steps.for questions, review the mfa (duo) faqs page or contact the imss help desk at 626.395.3500, help@caltech.edu, or https://help.caltech.edu (request type: imss > duo/mfa help).
