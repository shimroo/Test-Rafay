﻿the results showed that lps inhibited sod1 expression and pdtc markedly enhanced sod1 abundance in the lung (0.05). injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function introduction acute lung injury is a major causes of acute respiratory failure characterized by oxidative stress, inflammatory response, neutrophil accumulation, diffuse endothelium and epithelial damage, air-blood barrier disruption, and the subsequent infiltration of peripheral inflammatory cells into lung tissues [1, 2]. although a large number of studies have focused on the pathogenesis and therapies, very few therapies for acute respiratory failure have been shown to be effective. therefore, investigations around the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of acute respiratory failure may have a significant impact on…
