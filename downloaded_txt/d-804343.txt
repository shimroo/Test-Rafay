mitten tutorial - step 6





step 6last instructions were to knit 16 rows of stockinette stitch for the body of the mitten.next you will begin decreasing for the mitten tip.decrease for mitten top:1.    (k6, k2tog) 4x – 28 sts2.    knit3.    (k5, k2tog) 4x – 24 sts4.    knit5.    (k4, k2tog) 4x – 20 sts6.    knit7.    (k3, k2tog) 4x – 16 sts8.    knit9.    (k2, k2tog) 4x – 12 sts10. purl 2tog across – 6 sts, break yarn, gather up.this is the almost finished mitten that just needs seaming up.and that's all for the left mitten.the right mitten is about the same, the only difference is the shaping of the thumb gusset.for those of you who want to jump ahead, here are the instructions for the right mitten - no pics, yet.   i'll be back with those pics as soon as i get to that point in my knitting. right mitten:cast on 32 sts and rib for 22 rowsknit 4 rows in st st increasing by 1 on first row. 33 stsbegin right thumb gusset:row1: k29, pm, m1, knit to end of round – 34 stsrow 2: purl to marker, m1, slip marker, p to end of row.rows 3-11:  repeat last 2 rows 4 times more.keep increasing every row until 44 total stitches.next row:  purl 28 sts, (remove marker) turn and work the next 13 sts for thumb as in left mitten.mitten body & mitten tip: same as in left mitten.

mitten tutorial - step 5





hope no one abandoned their mittens!step 4 (continued):after you knit your 12 thumb rows your mitten should look like the pictured below.step 5:next row: k3, k2tog across row 8 (12)sts,turn purl back.    then knit 2tog across – 4 (6)sts.break yarn leaving a 1 yard length, gather up thumb tip and seam up thumb. picture below is the thumb already sewn up.now i'll show you how i avoid a hole at the "crotch" of the thumb.with the wrong side facing you go thru the left stitch purl bump andthen go thru the right stitch purl bump.after you've done that, purl to the end of the row (going to the left)on the right side knit 15 sts and pick up one stitch at the "crotch".and knit to the end of the row.don't forget to mark this row.you now have 32 sts on the needle and you are ready to knit the body of the mitten.knit for 16 rows for body of mitten.

mitten tutorial - step 4





is everyone still with me?i thought i'd give you a few days to complete step 3. step 4:after you have 44 total stitches your mitten should look like thisand you just finished a knit row.next purl row - purl 29 sts and turn.      don't purl past the marker.this is what it looks like after you turnnow you are ready to knit the thumb.thumb: edited july 4th - changed # of rows to 12knit 13 sts, marking this row as row 1 and knit 12 total rows on these 13 sts.this is the beginning of the thumb part with a marker.any questions?

mitten tutorial - step 3





now we will begin the left thumb gussetrow 1:  knit 4, m1 (make one), pm (place a marker), knit to end of row.above picture shows how i m1 (make 1).  i lift the stitch with the left needle and knit into the back of it so as not to leave a hole.knitting in the front and back of the stitch to increase does not work - it does not leave a smooth increase line and does not look quite as nice.above picture is the first row knit to the end with the marker in position.you can see i have 5 sts at the right because i m1 and 29 sts on the left.row 2: purl to marker, slip marker and m1.   to make one on the purl side, lift the stitch as above andcome in from behind to purl this stitch.   we don't knit it because we do not want any purl bumps on the right side.  it's a wee bit tricky but there are only a few more rows of this type of increase.rows 3-11:  repeat last 2 rows 4 times more.keep increasing every row until 44 (50) total stitchesyou should end up with 15 sts on the right side of the marker and 29 sts on the left side.let me know if you get stuck anywhere and i'll see if i can better explain.or if i miscalculated the row counts.mostly it is the number of stitches at the end that matter.
