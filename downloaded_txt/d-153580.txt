this webring
site is run by aaron williams.



this page is still under heavy construction. right now it's mostly a
bunch of links. this page is being updated on an almost daily basis. just
wait until i get some time alone with colorworks!
(note: due to the way spg treats its customers i will be switching to a
different package. any suggestions would be welcome. i am now looking at
sx paint.) if you have any suggestions
for additions to this page or any other, send me email.
this page is best viewed with netscape
navigator for os/2. due to a bug in ibm's web explorer, pages on this
site will not load properly. complain to ibm.

the web server for this site is still under development. it is written
entirely in java. i hope to make
the source code available in the near future.



this page will cause
to close.

anything marked with (local) will be serviced by aaron's java
web server.
