cardiff
theosophical society
mission statement
 
the
dominant and core activity of cardiff theosophical society
is to
promote and assist the study of theosophical teachings
as defined
by the writings of helena
petrovna blavatsky,
william quan
judge, alfred percy
sinnett and their lineage.
 
this
mission statement does not preclude non theosophical
activities
but these must be of a spiritual nature
and/or
compatible with the objects of the society.

the blavatsky
message
a brief
introduction
 

 
objects of
the theosophical society
 

 
1. to form a nucleus of the universal
brotherhood of humanity without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or
colour.
 
2. to
encourage the study of comparative religion, philosophy and science.
 
3. to investigate
unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man.
 

 
 
theosophy has no dogma, no priesthood 
or diploma elite and recognizes no spiritual head. 
all ideas presented at meetings are for
consideration.
 
ब्रह्मविद्या कोई हठधर्मिता, कोई पुजारी है
या डिप्लोमा कुलीन और कोई आध्यात्मिक सिर पहचानता है.
बैठकों में प्रस्तुत सभी विचारों पर विचार के लिए कर रहे हैं.

tekels park to be sold to a developer
concerns are raised about the fate of
the wildlife as 
the spiritual retreat, tekels park in
camberley, 
surrey, england is to be sold to a
developer
 
tekels park is a
50 acre woodland park, purchased 
 for the adyar theosophical society in england
in 1929. 
in addition to
concern about the park, many are 
 worried about the future of the tekels park
deer 
as they are not a
protected species.
 
confusion as the theoversity moves
out of  
tekels park to southampton,
glastonbury &  
chorley in lancashire while the
leadership claim
that the theosophical society will
carry on using  
tekels park despite its sale to a
developer
 
anyone planning a
spiritual stay at the
tekels park guest
house should be aware of the sale.
 
theosophy talks of a compassionate attitude 
to animals and the sale of the tekels park
sanctuary for wildlife to a developer has
dismayed many theosophists 
 
no need for a diploma in finance and
even someone with a diploma in astral travel
will know that this is a bad time economically
to sell tekels park
