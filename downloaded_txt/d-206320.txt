about us 



our mission 














read more











all of the volunteers behind the save the dals organization have their own unique story to tell as to why they stand behind this cause and organization.  however, we all share one common thing: we are all in love with and addicted to “spots,” and other dogs. 







our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome dalmatians and other dogs. we pull dogs from shelters, and owners who need to relinquish. then place them in new, permanent, loving homes. 












adopt a dal who needs a furever home 



dalmatians benefit from obedience training, exercise, love, and affection.  they are often referred to as “velcro dogs”! keep in mind: over-worked parents with young children may not be in a position to handle the additional workload of a dalmatian.

most frequent questions and answers 










is a dal the right dog for you?

dalmatians are a great breed for the right people.  when puppies, they are sooooo cute. but the puppy stage doesn’t last forever. dals rapidly grow to an adult weight of on average 45-70 pounds of muscle and energy. unless you are prepared to deal with an adult dog (considered “large breed”) of this size, the dalmatian is not for you.  













history & devotion to family

dalmatians are wonderful, fun-loving dogs who do well in the right environment. they want inclusion in family activities, whether it’s jogging, hiking, or laying around watching tv. historically dalmatians were bred to run many miles each day with horse and carriage.  therefore, their exercise requirements are lofty. they also functioned as guard dogs for the horses, carriage and its occupants, and they have retained this protective nature as a breed.













how to take care of dals?

they should be fed twice a day (breakfast and dinner) with high-quality wet & dry dog food mixed with water (preferably that doesn’t contain corn, soy, wheat or organ meats); and if they are stone-formers they may require a prescription diet (see below).   daily exercise is necessary to keep the dalmatian from channeling its energy into destructiveness. obedience training and socialization is also invaluable.their short coats shed all year round so grooming with a brush helps cut down on the shedding. their ears should be checked regularly and cleaned when appropriate to prevent ear infections. nails should be trimmed routinely as well.
