welcome to physics & optical science






welcome to the department of physics and optical science! 
we offer programs leading to both undergraduate and graduate degrees, and our department’s relatively small size empowers students to interact one-on-one with faculty members to achieve success with their coursework and research endeavors.
at the graduate level, the department offers a master of science in applied physics with research concentrations in applied optics or biophysics. our optical science and engineering program, ranked at no. 8 in the country for optical science, has both m.s. and ph.d. degrees. due to the interdisciplinary nature of this research area, many of our graduate students have backgrounds in various engineering fields, as well as physics.
