                                            we had a great purchasing experience and andy, elaine, ruby and cameron were friendly, very helpful and knowledgable. we have purchased a brand new rv and also rented a site from leisure time. cameron did an excellent job with the demo and he knew all aspects of the trailer. the staff and campers are very friendly and made us feel welcomed and a very clean campground. we would recommend this campground and sales. thank you for a wonderful experience in purchasing an rv and setting up our trailer on the site.

                                            we are both retired and in january decided to investigate purchasing a park model trailer. during our google search we came across leisure time park and trailer sales. we contacted ruby who was enthusiastic, provided details on various models and guided us through all phases to ownership. scott recommended a great site by the pond that became available and was helpful in working through some requested upgrades that arrived and were installed ahead of schedule.

                                            recently bought a travel trailer from leisure time sales and found the sales staff very easy to deal with, hosest and straight forward. the trailer we bought, a trailmanor is not a well known style of foldable trailer. the service staff was great - they took the time to learn about the trailer and understand it's unique properties, they gave us a great orientation to the trailer, made sure we were comfortable and ready for what would be a long tow back to our home in bc including installing at last minute the wdh. i recommend checking them out if looking for a trailer.
