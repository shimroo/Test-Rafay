introducing materia viva: a new era in interior design





we are thrilled to unveil the newest addition to our product line: materia viva. officially debuting at the milan design week 2024, materia viva is set to redefine the standards of interior wall coatings with its innovative and nature-inspired composition.
what is materia viva?
materia viva is a revolutionary mineral powder coating designed for interior use. crafted from hydraulic lime, aerial lime, carefully selected aggregates, and rheological modifiers, it offers exceptional workability and versatility. when mixed with materia viva deco powders, it creates stunning, modern decorative effects.
combining materia viva with natural materials like cocciopesto, conchiglia, pomice, or sughero grains allows us to rediscover and reinterpret the traditional decorative finishes of italian and mediterranean architecture with a contemporary twist.
explore the endless possibilities with materia viva and transform your interior spaces into works of art!

discovering wall2floor and novacolor finishes that enhance the contemporary heritage






a heritage is the legacy of the past that bears witness to a cultural identity considered essential for the protection of what will come tomorrow. 
for this reason, it is extremely important to promote awareness of the heritage that concerns us closely. 
technology and the environment are the promoters of this mission of which firenzecolor and novacolor italia are spokespersons: “let’s go bold” is the event designed to enhance the novacolor products that contribute to developing and preserving the contemporary heritage that surrounds us.
the absolute protagonist of this event will be wall2floor, the microcement system that symbolizes the state of the art in terms of innovation for continuous systems for horizontal and vertical surfaces. in fact, the multilayer mineral coating achieves seamless, monolithic continuous finishes capable of satisfying aesthetic and functional needs. wall2floor translates with modern and traditional architectures, offering solutions in line with the most demanding projects.
the focus will then go on the archi+ argilla and calcecruda mineral plasters. we will also discuss metallic effects such as metallo_fuso liquid metal finish as well as the concrete effects of archi+ concrete.

 





learn, share and experiment in a full immersion of novacolor craftsmanship






there is no theory without practice and there is no practice without theory. but what would happen if these two stages of learning were amalgamated into an appointment in which fun was the master?
the experience and knowledge of novacolor master applicators is about to take to the field in a day dedicated to decoration. artisans and color fans will be able to meet and put into practice their creativity and skills!
novacolor products will act as muse during the live performances, with a particular focus on:

wall2floor, the microcement continuous coating system for floors and walls
archi + argilla and calcecruda, clay and lime-based mineral plasters
metallo_fuso, decorative coating for interiors based on metallic powders
archi+ concrete, a wide range of concrete effect plasters, coatings and paints.

mynor cornejo is the founder and master artisan at luxedecorativo. after many years of hands-on learning from various masters in the decorative arts, mynor decided to realize his dream of creating a company where he could express his creativity freely.a strong characteristic of mynor is his “can-do” attitude as he often states “any problem has a solution”. his enthusiastic approach to life and business makes him a great communicator and someone who is willing to go above and beyond to satisfy his clients. in addition, he refers to himself as a student of life as he believes in constant learning for both his personal and business life.mynor launched luxedecorativo in 2019 and his goal became to provide the highest quality  in decorative finishes and to provide his clients with a white-glove experience. with this approach, mynor believes a successful project is the result of a great collaboration between the interior designer, architect, builder, and homeowner.
