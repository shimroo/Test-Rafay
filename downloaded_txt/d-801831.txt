fitness bikesthink versatile here.these bikes make good casual bikes, but they’re a little faster and sleeker than hybrids: good for a workout, good for commuting, or for taking longer rides. you’ll lean over slightly on them.learn more


hybrid bikeshybrids are good all-around, casual bikes. you sit upright, the seats are comfortable, and they’re easy to pedal. and with a medium sized tire you can go off pavement or cut across the grass if you need to.view bikes


road bikesthey’re light and fast. great for workouts and long rides. take them on group rides, charity rides and triathlons. the performance is a blast!view bikes








dual sport bikesthink rugged here. fat tires. suspension. we carry a nice light-duty mountain bike. it’s a great urban bike, but also fine for the occasional foray to the woods.view bikes


gravel bikesgravel bikes are road bikes too, but they ride differently from sport bikes. think smooth, stable, and comfortable. although they excel on dirt roads, they also make great touring and commuting bikes.view bikes


cruiser bikesyou see cruisers a lot around the beach. they have big comfortable seats, fat tires for a plush ride, and big wide handlebars. perfect bikes for, guess what? that’s right. just cruising around.view bikes


kids' bikeswe’ve got everything from itty bitty balance bikes for your 3 yr old to 26" bikes for your 11 yr old.view bikes
