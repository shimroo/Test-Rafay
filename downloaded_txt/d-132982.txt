hang in there my friends.

amidst it all

the completion cycle.

i am trying to stay focused to complete the last 10% of a long, saturnian rebuild of sacred structures decimated by covidy times and slowly resurrected and rebuilt as the ‚Äúfourth job‚Äù in the midst of it all. we are grateful for this farm - stamina is required wherever our dharma unfolds.

how many of my friends on the path relate?
leave a üî•if you in the completion cycle big time and i will give you a üî•back. 

how are you dealing with the array of challenges? how are you drawing on deeper inspiration to sustain?

long, projects for me bring humility and compassion‚Ä¶ necessity of befriending of my self and  trusting in the yogic process of inner and outer fire-keeping or tapas.

i do love all the forms and ways of yoga and i love embodying and sharing prana flow live and with soul friends around the world online weekly.

it is true - one‚Äôs practice is a refuge to rise and keep going.

the hub i am building i can share with you in this coming cycle! 

i can offer you a free class pass for some prana flow yoga nourishment. 

dm me if you interested in our local winter solstice and new year live and online coming up.

always loving hilary‚Äôs sacred shala ‚ù§Ô∏èalways loving @yogamovesutrecht 

love all ways
baby shiva

rip sharath joisji ü™∑
may we live love everyday as we never know when our last steps and breath may come‚Ä¶

these recent videos reposted from beloved teacher @nieveslahuerta are treasures. thank you dear.

i am sharing here  to honor the divine humanness and loving spirit that sharathji embodied even with the responsibility of the legacy of global ashtanga community.

his heart was bright on his last walk up the mountain. i have no other details but it is meaningful to witness. our heart is with his family and students who were with him during cardiac arrest and those honoring his legacy around the world. his soul departed on the mountain - a stairway to heaven and a dance of his soul‚Äôs light.

sacred tears fall..

oh dear moonset lovers! 

if you are unable to see the moon,  i am sharing with you our morning meditation with the full moon setting over the pacific ocean in todo santos, baja california.

there is a wisdom transmission just for you in being and breathing with the beautiful vision and mantra:

om som somaya namaha 

just three slow rounds of receiving our breath flow breathing us all can make a shift or save and enjoy the full 20 minutes until the moon sets in the sea.

i enjoyed sharing this meditation this morning spontaneously with 300 plus beings from around the world. 

enjoy your meditation. you can
focus on the moon as descending into your crown and pouring healing, regenerative energy cultivated in meditation -soma- slowly down your central channel into your palette, throat chakra and heart and nourishing your being as ancient nervous system regulation and food for the soul.

we are here with the @todosantoswellnessfest at the inspiring  @masolastodossantos 

grateful for @anapau.dominguez for bringing us here with @mcyogi @djdrez for a special gathering including free classes for the people in the main plaza.

join us this weekend if you are local!

ü™∑ü™∑ü™∑

all love and compassion as we navigate the journey ahead.

if you enjoy lunar practice and are interested in a full-spectrum lunar practice, you can try a lunar class with our free class pass in bio.

drink the moon - the sublime free elixir for all.

ü™∑ü™∑ü™∑

thank you for the mantra om som somaya namaha by kapil koli
