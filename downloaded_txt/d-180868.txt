our storysince 1999





since 1999, we have been serving northern arizona as the standard of quality and professionalism.

 

when patrick first opened the studio, he was set on creating a inviting space for our clientele. over the years our space has grown to also include our piercers, our implant-grade body jewelry and a vast collection of decorative adornments from all over the world. today, we are proud to serve not just our little mountain town but all of northern arizona as the oldest professional tattoo studio in the region. no matter how much flagstaff changes, we will continue to be the welcoming space you have come to know us as over the last 20 years.
