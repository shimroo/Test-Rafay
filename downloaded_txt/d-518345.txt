mission statement
it is the hope and desire of the ichf to promote the 
    international growth and quality of cardiac surgery, particularly in 
    children and young adults.  its focus is to remain humanitarian in 
    perspective, avoiding political, economic, and religious overtones.
goals

the gradual shift from previously sponsoring indigent children and 
      young adults, as well as those without access, to undergo free open-heart 
      surgery in selected centers in the u.s.a.
training and mentoring of medical and non-medical individuals in 
      all aspects of the care and support of the open-heart surgical patient; 
      both in the united states donor program and the developing host program.
recruiting and sponsoring u.s.a. open heart surgery teams to 
      facilitate the development, support, or augmentation of similar teams in 
      the host country.
eventual establishment of u.s.a. based central headquarters to support 
      clinical, educational, research and logistical systems.
to promote the concept of the disease specific product line of total care for 
      cardiac related diseases.  this includes incidence, prevalence, 
      prevention, promotion, screening, database development, diagnosis, and 
      treatment.  treatment strategies emphasize medical, interventional, 
      and the gradual implementation of more complex cardiac surgical procedures 
      in both lower and higher risk patients.

programs & projects






from 1980 thru 2000, over 50 patients from over 13 foreign 
		countries underwent free open heart surgery in the united states at 3 
		different medical centers (st. joseph's hospital, syracuse, n.y.; 
		university of massachusetts' medical center; st. vincent hospital, both 
		in worcester, ma)
over 25 selected and sponsored health care personnel have received 
		additional basic and specialized medical training in the united states 
		in the above mentioned hospitals.
on-site surgical missions (both solo and team efforts) have 
		initiated, augmented, or updated programs in south korea, vietnam, 
		ecuador, tanzania, dominican republic, guatemala, mexico, china, 
		mongolia, india, peru, grenada, senegal, russia, and myanmar; and 
		established de novo programs in haiti and mauritania.

		totaled 64 countries over the past 38 years.
