      sailing facilities
      
       bmbs owns it's sailing water at carnaby lake,
      a 90 x 80 metre man made lake which is available for sailing all year
      round. we have a membership of over 250 who participate in most model
      boating activities, these range through scale electric, steam, yachting,
      fast electric and ic power which includes a multiracing section. the
      society is affiliated to the model powerboat association and model
      yachting association which enables members to compete at other clubs
      regattas in addition to our own club and open events.
model truck facilities
       more recently we
      have developed part of the site to accommodate 1:14 scale model trucks and
      diggers. this facility continues to develop and expand month by month.
rock crawling facilities
during 2017 we developed a 1:10 scale rock crawling and
      trailing track which is adjacent to the trucks. this facility also 
      continues to develop and expand month by month.
short course track
we also have a 150 metre short course (off-road)
      truck/buggy track which is adjacent to the rock crawling hill. this is for
      1:10 and 1:8 scale buggies only.
model train layout
opened in november 2023 we now have a, 80 foot long train layout for
      sm32 (16mm) and 'o' gauge locos.

carnaby
      lake is well equipped with excellent facilities,
      these include on site parking adjacent to the lake, a clubhouse with mains
      water and cooking facilities, flush toilets, a central concrete landing
      stage with raised racing podium for power boaters and yachters plus
      a  second smaller concrete landing area
      with a good sized harbour and semi permanent course for exclusive use by
      scale sailors. all the above facilities are accessible by disabled people.
      a row boat and chest waders are also available to enable the rescue of
      wayward models.
