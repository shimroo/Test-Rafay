hi4y vision: a world where all children, regardless of their economic and cultural environment, have opportunities and choices to pursue their dreams. 

for 100 years, hands in 4 youth, home of camp vacamas, has been lifting up at risk and underserved children, giving them experiences they never dreamed were even possible.hands in 4 youth understood in 1924, and continues to understand today that exposure to experiences outside of the classroom, including sleepaway camp, can be just as important as learning calculus or memorizing time tables.today, hands in 4 youth builds on its 100-year history with a year-round calendar of programming, from summer camp to school-year retreats, to daily after school enrichment programs.we are proud of our legacy of making memories and changing lives.

what our kids think



camper spotlightsummer is a wonderful time for creating memories and changing lives.  at hands in 4 youth, we never let a day go by without being kind to children and making them the center of our purpose.  please take a peek! 








jacob, age 8, west milford, nj
this was jacob’s first summer at camp.  he started off a bit shy but soon blossomed and had an amazing time.  he made friends and was eager to try new activities every day.  he is the youngest of 2 children. 








naima, age 8, brooklyn, ny
with both uncles as former campers, naima has been dreaming of attending camp since she could walk and talk.  after completing her first camp session in the summer of 2014, she convinced her mom immediately upon arriving home to send her back for the third session.








kevin, age 10, brooklyn, ny
a child of russian parents, kevin has already attended camp two summers.  generally shy, his friends at camp allow him to be himself and show his true personality.  kevin boasts about having many friends at camp.








salonae, age 12, bushwick, brooklyn, ny
salonae first learned to swim at camp in lake larriwien, and has been an enthusiastic and model camper for three years.  counselors frequently enlist her to help first-time campers learn about the wonders of camp.








menelek, age 14, harlem, ny
menelek has attended camp for three years.  as the youngest of three children, he enjoys the independence that camp gives him.  at nearly 6 ft. in height and frequently mistaken as a junior counselor, menelek is really just a big teddy bear who flourishes at camp.








gwendolyn, age 8, staten island, ny
gwendolyn first came to camp in the summer of 2014 and was the only child to attend all three trips, turning her into a camp veteran.   she was such an amazing camper, she became like a mini staff member.  she got along with all campers and was always excited to participate in activities. 








giovanni, age 9, bushwick, brooklyn, ny
this was giovanni’s first summer at camp and he enjoyed it so much he was the first camper enrolled for 2015! he started off reserved but quickly made friends and became a star camper.  








jaliyah, age 7, bayshore, ny
jaliyah is a second generation camper; her mom is a camp alum who attended in the 1990s.  as a middle child she’s had to watch her sister attend camp before her but will also orient her little brother when he enters camp.  jaliyah’s mom is very grateful that camp vacamas is creating memories for her children as it did for her.
