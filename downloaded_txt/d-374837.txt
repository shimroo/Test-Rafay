world stage 2020 — september 24th
the next chapter in the long, storied history of jim peterik’s world stage is being held on saturday, september 24th at pfeiffer hall, north central college in naperville, il.
think of this as the “show that could” after being postponed from the tradition january date due to covid limitations. once again, jim peterik gathers together a group of his stellar musical friends for another all-star rock fest.
this year’s lineup includes the ides of march; mark stein, legendary lead singer and hammond organist of vanilla fudge fame; jennifer batten, who served as michael jackson’s lead guitarist for four world tours including the iconic superbowl performance; toby hitchcock of pride of lions; colin peterik who will be premiering his new album; chicago music icon yvonne gage; and riley pettrone.
add the phenomenal world stage band and a possible surprise guest and you’ve got the recipe for a spectacular evening of rock’n’roll.
tickets are available at finearts.northcentralcollege.edu.
