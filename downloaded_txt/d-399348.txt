v-book












i’ve been making valentine-related art for a while now, and every year i get a few frantic last-minute requests to express-mail a set of cards to someone…. so this year i compiled an e-book of cards and activities you can download and print from home!
twenty-four pages (15 b&w, 9 color) for $8. includes classics like the svu valentines, as well as a few silly new things like a hannibal you can build to store your hanni-tines. more details here!

a-ha!

i just made some art that will be featured in my good friend alan partridge‘s new stage show touring the uk and ireland. this strange man and disembodied arm will serve as a tantalizing sneak preview, but the finished pieces will be projected behind steve coogan as part of an elaborate bit about mills & boon romance novel covers.
