workers world fought gay oppression before stonewal by leslie feinberg years before the 1969 stonewall rebellion, the leadership of workers world party understood the need to fight oppression as a many-headed hydra.i joined workers world party (wwp) in buffalo, n.y., in 1973, drawn to its ranks by my rage at the israeli occupation of palestine and the bloody cia-orchestrated counter-revolution in chile. the first person in the branch leadership that i “came out” to as transgender in late 1973—jeanette merrill—listened to me very intently. she responded, “i don’t know much about your oppression, but i know oppression when i hear it.” my comrades in the buffalo branch quickly made discussion and understanding about my oppression an important part of branch work. they demonstrated to me that comradeship is different than friendship or family. it is a powerful relationship among people who unite on a solid platform of political principles and who fight against each other’s oppression as though it were their own.****a metis birthday celebration turned into death ceremony, it may not be just an unfortunate tragedyon the eve of 25th november, nima a metii (cross-dressing effeminate male, age about 25 years), who celebrated her birthday with few friends and friend's of friends in kumarigal near baudha in kathmandu, died yesterday afternoon around 2 pm, 25th november, at the teaching hospital. the hospital told that nima died with "methyl" that may have contained at the alcohol they drank in the 25th night. nima was rushed to the hospital just before 2 mp after started vomiting, the doctors at the emergency unit told that it was too late and nima died soon after. then at the evening other people who were at the party and drunk same alcohol started getting sick and rushed to the teaching hospital and were cared for methyl. they were treated by ethyl agent to neutralized methyl.  3 metis were released yesterday after the treatment, 6 others were in serious condition and teaching hospital told us to look for other hospital as the condition may get worse and need icu support. ***metis, victims (of political change?) in nepal by sunil pantafter the recent peace deal between the nepal government and maoist, like every other nepalese, métis (cross dressing effeminate males) also were in expectation that their rights would be ensured and they would also enjoy freedom and safety. but the situation and hate crimes they faces from many angles everyday makes them believe that the situation for métis has become far worse than before. before, most of the violence against métis were committed by nepal police but recently many métis were victimized by men who called themselves maoist. on night of 24th november 2006, four men, tow of them were in combat dress came to the métis room at lazimpat where few métis share a apartment building and the group of métis were abused physically, verbally, beten badly, threatened not to become métis anymore. their mobile phones, money, jewelries were also looted.  those 4 men, who claimed themselves from maoist party, told métis to come and collect the phones at maoist office either in kalanki or in kupondole.

memorial to transgender transsexual suicide victims november 21stmost people are familiar with the terrible violence committed against transsexuals and the transgendered. every november 20th we hold vigils in honor of the transgender day of remembrance. this is the least we can do. however we also need to honor an even larger amount of transgendered which are the victims of suicide. there are literally thousands of transgendered and transsexuals who take their own lives each and every year. they too should be remembered with their own day which is november 21st. please think about these victims, not only that day but every day.the national suicide rate is 3 per 100,000 people. the transgender transsexual suicide rate is 31% of our group. over 50% of transsexuals will have had at least one suicide attempt by their 20th birthday. even more self harm themselves daily either by cutting or self mutilation.

two orissa girls defy norms, get marriedkoraput: two kondh women from orissa's koraput district have defied all norms of their tribal society to live as ˜man and wife" after tying the knot recently. bateka palang, 30, wed her bride, 25-year-old maleka nilsa of ghumuru village in bandhugaon block in a traditional ceremony at dandabadi, a remote village in narayanpatna block, in the presence of family. the village has given its grudging approval ”the elders have asked residents not to talk about it to outsiders for fear of shame ”to the relationship that was formalised after all the usual wedding rituals, including dowry changing hands. villagers said the women who wed were cousins and their relationship had developed when bateka used to visit her would-be wife's home. "about four years ago, i had gone to my cousin's home and found a nice friend in maleka. she was caring and loving. gradually we started spending more time with each other but we had never thought that one day we would get married," bateka said.  *****pakistan's ground-breaking transvestite"darling, you are sooo naughty," purrs an elegant sari-clad woman glowing out of primetime television.going by the name of begum (lady) nawazish ali, she hosts an eponymous talk show that has taken pakistan by storm. flirting and skirting her way through politics, society gossip and plain old sexual chemistry, begum has become the most popular icon to inundate pakistani fantasy in a while.

revisions likely in birth certificate policyspurred by a 2002 city law forbidding discrimination based on gender identity and expression and reform sought by gender rights advocates, the city's department of health and mental hygiene is considering an amendment to the policy governing changes to a birth certificate, making it possible for transgendered people born in new york to alter the gender designated on the form. however, in testimony before the board of health on monday, advocates agreed in recommending a number of significant changes to the amendment currently under discussion, and some maintained that the overall approach contemplated is inappropriately based on what they termed a "medical model" inconsistent with an emerging ethos of gender self-identification.everyone who testified at the monday hearing, however, agreed that revision in the current city policy is long overdue and congratulated the health department on its work in moving toward reform. *** intersex produced by: dheera sujana group of women talk of their experiences with a rare condition - intersexuality. they are women who have the male xy chromosome. one was forcibly raised as a boy. one only found out about her condition accidentally when she was a teenager. and one was kept in the dark about it deliberately by doctors. about one baby in 20,000 infants is born intersex. often these infants can be clearly seen to belong to one sex, but a small percentage of them are born with ambiguous genitalia and in the past, doctors made a unilateral decision about which sex they thought the child belonged to. sometimes they even performed surgery without properly consulting or informing the parents. that practice has been banned in the netherlands but although medical personnel and lay people are more open to variations in sexuality these days, people with an intersex condition still find the subject very difficult to bring up. this program was produced by dheera sujan of radio netherlands and airs as part of our international documentary exchange series, crossing boundaries.

transsexual prepares lawsuit against thai armybangkok- a thai transsexual man is preparing to file a lawsuit against the army for rejecting him for conscription on the grounds of his "mental disorder," news reports said thursday. samart meehcharoen, 22, said that the army's rejection statement, issued two years ago, had deprived him of career opportunities, as a private firm had recently turned down his job application citing his "mental disorder," the bangkok post reported.   "i cannot accept it, because i don't have a mental problem. i'm a normal guy who feels like a woman," said samart, who wears his hair long and has undergone breast-enhancement surgery, though he has stopped short of a sex change.    if the administrative court accepts samart's case, it will set a legal precedent in thailand, which still practices conscription to fill its armed forces.***four convicted in st. maarten attack on gaysfour french nationals were convicted thursday of beating two gay american tourists in this dutch caribbean island and given prison sentences of six months to six years.the tire iron attack seriously damaged the brain of one of the victims, an employee of the cbs news show "48 hours."three citizens of the island's french half -- glen cockly, micheline delaney and allan daniel -- and a man from the nearby french caribbean island of guadeloupe, michel javois, were found guilty of public violence and grievous bodily harm by judge jan bosch.

is there anything gay about them?vikram seth might have signed the letter for decriminalisation of homosexual act. but the ground reality is still very different. recently, baguiati residents nisha singh and nisha upadhyay committed suicide. the reason was the refusal of society to accept their same-sex love.  in the past two years, this is the fourth such incident in the state where couples have ended their lives. so, how difficult is it for city lesbians to stay afloat in such an unsympathetic environment? ****postal workers refuse to deliver 'anti-gay' mailcanada post plans to go ahead with the delivery of controversial booklets this week, despite protests from vancouver postal workers who refused to distribute the mail they called "homophobic.""it hasn't gone out today because of all the attention and we wanted to make sure other mail wasn't disrupted," lillian au, communications manager for canada post's pacific region, told ctv.ca.
