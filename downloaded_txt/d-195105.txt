stars of hope
in response to tragedies such as mass violence and natural disasters, we use art-making in the form of a star to give hope, show compassion, and promote healing. through stars of hope, communities devastated by disaster paint hopeful messages, inspirational words, and colorful designs on wooden stars as part of their personal and community’s collective healing process.
