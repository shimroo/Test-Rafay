totally desperate losers love me





i've been hanging in new york the past week seeing friends and shopping up a massive jewish princess storm at bergdorff.  i see a new chloe handbag in my new future that the desperate loser who sat on the phone with me yesterday for 10 hours and a ton of paid mails. i know 10 hours is a long ass time but this shmuck was so needy for me he had to stay on with me the entire day.  i went about my day forwarding to my cell i went out to lunch and back and the submissive desperate loser stayed on the phone.  at $3.00 a min i really didn't mind since i knew that it was all my money and he needed to be drained by the jewish princess. know one knows a good day of financial domination like a little j.a.p.  i rock!

super geeks are coming out in the heat like crazy! i know i really haven't been writing much but you know it is like summer and i do need to get out and play. i do have my phones with me and on so i can talk shit to you dorks at nearly all times and places. don't be too shocked if i'm with my hot boyfriend or some of my girlfriends.super snazzy maniac and i had a really awesome hour long debate whether i am jewish or just pretending to be. now, i can understand having that conversation with me but, don't you think the fuckadoodle should at least know his own shit to back it up. dick wad didn't even know a lick of hebrew. now of course it can only get better then that. i get this barely audible freak calling me,he has a thick accent and tells me he's indian. he gets on web cam and he is most definitely not a man of indian decent but a total arab. as soon as i called him out on lying he went crazy on how jews are the devil! ha ha ha!! 3 hours later and $$$ he told me he was obsessed with me. he keeps emailing me and begging me to come meet him and marry him. ewww gross grody! can you even imagine! kisses,your favorite jewish princessnew callers who click on it will get 3 free minutes.

jewish princess cock therapy session with my sissy nurse





i've been having a crazy summer partying with all my friends who are visiting or on break.  like every night has been a jewish princess party.  i get together with the rest of my jap crew and do what we do best and jap out.  i got like a really bad little sunburn over the weekend at a july 4th beach party and i was in need of some aloe attention.  i found the hottest guy at the party and told him if he rubbed my backside with alo in the places i missed i would give him a little jewish princess surprise.  surprise !!! dork got to touch me! i knew this sissy loser was staring at me all day while i pranced back and forth at the party. he kept asking for my phone number so i decided oh fuck it and i gave him my niteflirt number.  as if i would talk to him after that for free!i had a really nice session of cock mock therapy with my little sissy prissy nurse.  just what the doctor ordered for a new nurse on staff! the slutty nurse had the little most like totally little belly button dick you've ever seen. hysterical!!!! look at this shmuck!!

groveling loser niteflirt mail





shmuck rick sent me this email totally worthy of me putting on my blog.  i did already snatch a few grand from the shmuck but like the groveling mail gawd what a loser.  jacko the wacko is afraid to call me so since he is such a pussy i've been manipulating him through paid mails which is really costing him way more then he could dream. i had a dream of a new kooba bag and now i can make that dream real after my paid mail sweep.  every jewish princess needs her own set of designer handbags.kissthe jewish princess of niteflirt"princess melissa,i am sooo sorry that i have not produced in giving you my paychecks after stating that i would, but when i went to take a picture of my paystub to show you that you were getting the entire worth of my paycheck, i found out that my digital camera was broken, so i had to buy another one. i know i probably do not deserve it, but please princess melissa, give me a second chance to show you that my paycheck belongs to you. i will do anything, even if it means giving you my personal information for you to use against me if i should fail to hand over my paycheck to you from here on in. if you give me another chance to prove myself to you, starting this thursday and every thursday afterwards, i will deposit my paycheck into the bank of jappy princess. but working in the automotive industry, and the economy the way it is, i'm jumping at the chance to work overtime when they offer it, so i can give you even more of what you deserve, my money, or should i say your money. i'm sure my deposits will pale in comparison to what you are accustomed to taking or receiving, but hopefully your greediness will make you happy knowing that you are taking all (100%) of my pay, leaving me with nothing (0%), and definately being shallow towards me by not giving two shits if i have no money to pay my bills. the only bills that are allowed to be paid are the jewish princess melissa's bills. even if it means maxing out credit card after credit card, just to keep you happy. even when i go thousands and thousands into debt, i'm sure you won't be satisfied, and demand me to apply for even more credit cards so you can make me go even deeper into debt. until i am hundreds and hundreds of thousands and beyond in credit card debt, hopefully then, you will be at least a little happy. in the end, jappy princess melissa is satisfied, and the big fat loser (me) is screwed!!!rick "new callers who click on it will get 3 free minutes.
