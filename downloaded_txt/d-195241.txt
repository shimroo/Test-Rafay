history of autism partnership
providing effective services to individuals with autism since 1994




may 4, 2011 



  autism partnership was formed in 1994 to meet the tremendous need
  for effective services to families with autistic children.


  based upon our founders’ extensive and unique experiences in
  providing behavioral treatment to children, adolescents and
  adults we have developed a comprehensive program that provides a
  variety of services.


  our directors were intimately involved in the treatment program
  developed at the ucla young autism project during the period of
  1975-1987. our current work incorporates the knowledge gained
  from the university research clinic and combines it with our more
  recent experience delivering services in community based
  settings. as knowledge about effective behavioral treatments
  continues to advance, we have also made innovations to increase
  accessibility to greater numbers of children in a variety of
  settings. we have extended the application of this specialized
  teaching methodology to children who are older. while it is clear
  that the optimal time to begin intervention is at the preschool
  age, there are many older children who have greatly benefited
  from intensive behavioral treatment.

the autism partnership method:
social skills groups




september 16, 2020 


the purpose of this book is to provide an overview of the autism partnership method for designing and conducting behaviorally based social skills groups for individuals diagnosed with autism spectrumdisorder. 
the book is divided into three sections: 1) introductory information, 2) running behaviorally based social skills groups, and 3) curriculum. within the first section the reader will find overviews ofapplied behavior analysis, social behavior, autism spectrum disorder, the autism partnership method,and research evaluating the use of social skills groups. the second section provides the reader with direction in developing, running, and evaluating their own social skills group. finally, section three provides an extensive curriculum, with detailed programs and goals, for running a behaviorally based social skills group.
“i cannot imagine that any practice would want to run social skills programming without the benefit of this amazing book. it is extraordinarily comprehensive and sophisticated, yet written in a language that is easy to read and understand. it contains a wealth of practical materials, as well as the philosophical underpinnings for how to use them and why. i love the real-world examples of intervention that is overly protocol-driven. leaf and company challenge all levels of aba practitioner to ask “what’s the point?” of any given exercise and “what are we trying to accomplish?” autism families should hope that their loved ones have the benefit of social skills programming informed by this book.”
lorri shealy unumb, j.d.  ceo, the council of autism service providers
“this new book from autism partnership offers an excellent blending of theoretical, research-based and practical advice for designing important lessons within group contexts for individuals with asd aimed at promoting and expanding social skills. the book provides a consistent model coupled with explicit lesson recommendations dealing with a broad array of social skills that are of particular relevance to school-aged learners.”

february 26, 2019 


this new book, written by ronald leaf, ph.d, justin b. leaf, ph.d, and john mceachin, ph.d provides insight into the past, present and potential future of behavior analysis treatment in autism. written in the spirit of progress and flexibility, clinical judgement presents a thoughtful and encouraging history of those who paved the way in pioneering applied behavior analysis and explains how and why the field was able to develop as it did. part 2 then goes on to examines possible regressions in the field, despite its foundations of progress and innovation, while part 3 emphasizes the importance of clinical judgement in practice, both today and in the future. both inspiring and controversial, clinical judgement is a fascinating and enjoyable read for any aba practitioner.

companion series dvds
a work in progress companion series booklets and dvds




march 28, 2012 


in 1999 we published, a work in progress, a manual containing strategies and programs that we had developed over that past 20 years. it is now 2012 and we have (finally!) made some more progress. our approach and programming efforts have continued to evolve over the last 13 years. we have continued to try to blend a natural, child-friendly approach to teaching while remaining determinedly systematic. we have developed new approaches to solving challenging behavior problems as well as teaching communication, social and recreational skills. a work in progress received positive reviews from parents and professionals alike. however, we would often hear, “if we could just see the programs in action, that would be even more helpful!”  we have taken the feedback and developed a work in progress companion series which combines written booklets on various teaching strategies along with actual demonstrations of our work with students on dvd. we have selected a few of our favorite programs which illustrate the use of behavior methods to teach a variety of skills to students of all ages.
we hope that parents and teachers will find this series a helpful companion and extension to a work in progress. we are also excited to announce that all of our proceeds from a work in progress companion series will go directly to the autism partnership family foundation!  this foundation was developed for three purposes:   to provide services to families with limited resources; to fund research that will investigate new strategies and programs that truly make a difference in the lives of children and families; and to disseminate information about evidence-based treatment and provide resources for training parents and professionals

sense and nonsense in the behavioral treatment of autism: it has to be said





may 11, 2011 


by autism partnership: ron leaf, ph.d., john mceachin, ph.d. and mitchell taubman, ph.d.
with contributing chapters by: danielle baker, m.s., jennifer styzens, m.s., b.j. freeman, ph.d., doris soluaga murtha, m.a., andrea waks, j.d.d., toby mountjoy, sandy slater, ph.d., david rostetter, ph.d., tracee parker, ph.d. and andy bondy, ph.d.

“leaf, mceachin, taubman and their colleagues provide the interested lay reader with a guidebook on how to think about some of the ‘too-good-to-be-true’ treatments for autism, and the questions one needs to ask to identify which techniques have a sound grounding in empirical research and which are based on hunches, hypotheses, or not yet validated clinical experience.” – sandra l. harris, executive director, douglass developmental disabilities center, rutgers, the state university of new jersey

a renowned team of professionals sift the sense from the nonsense in assessing the approaches to the treatment of autism. in a field exploding with alternative treatments, choosing the best course of action for the child with autism can be a daunting task. the authors offer compelling practical evidence of applied behavior analysis (aba) as the most reliable approach to education, and provide a much needed antidote to other treatments lacking empirical data. the aim is to empower parents and professionals to ensure that their children receive quality educational programming. in supporting the notion that every individual must be approached according to their needs, goals and progress, this is a book written with knowledge and compassion for children, parents and professionals who deal with autism on a daily basis.
topics include:

aba as a scientific method
alternative treatments for asd: what is the science?
home vs. school: which side are you on?
asd and the iep
how realistic is the aim for recover?
sense and nonsense about inclusion
the road map to successful integration
