			  margareta hallin we may know primarily as an opera singer with a very successful career. with rich personal experiences as a musician, she began composing in the mid-1980s. as a composer, she was self-taught, but emphasized important encouragement from, among others, composer eberhard eyser. on this cd we find the first recording of the chamber opera den starkare, together with songs for one or two voices and clarinet or piano, all performed by soprano christin högnabba, mezzosoprano matilda wahlund, clarinetist magnus holmander and pianist stefan lindgren.

laura constance netzel's (1839-1927) compositions were printed under the pseudonym "lago", although the newspapers already in 1883 wrote that behind the brand hid "a french-inspired composer, who is born finnish, but married and living in stockholm". 
here victoria stjerna, violin, andreas lavotha, cello, christin högnabba, soprano, and pianist stefan lindgren present a selection chamber music and songs by the finish/swedish composer.
