the avoda experience
there are many jewish summer camps, but there’s only one camp avoda. we are located on the beautiful lake tispaquin in middleboro, ma, just about an hour south of boston. at camp, our balanced program doesn’t just define what we do – it’s what we are. over 90 years strong of brotherhood, leadership, spirit, and tradition. our campers experience new adventures, take risks, practice jewish values and best of all be themselves.

testimonials from avoda parentsthe longer you stay at this place, the more you learn about yourself, what you value, and who your true friends are.
-ethan g.camp avoda provides my sons with a safe place where they can try new things and be themselves. the opportunity to develop a jewish community at camp is a game changer for families who live in areas with small jewish communities. 
- jen m. (avoda parent)sam had another awesome summer at avoda and would not trade the experience for anything. you and your staff truly run a wonderful program in a very special place. – mike, boston, ma and by the way, it isn’t just camp – it is avoda! i have seen the difference in what my daughter experienced (and she was happy) and what alex did. there are too many differences to even go into in detail but the family feeling, the bonding, the surprises, the spirit, the fun, the energy, the support, the big brother program (brilliant!), the music, and on and on and on – what you have created is really very special. – lisa, weston, fl. – lisa, weston, fl. “on visiting day,  i started throwing a frisbee around with my son, and others joined in without hesitation or question and everyone interacted with each other so naturally--there is something very special and unique about the size and culture of avoda that seems to break down the normal barriers of age.”avoda parentjoe and i loved everything about max’s experience – how much fun he had, how engaged he was in all of the activities and how much it already means to him – he clearly found his home at avoda. all of the communication from you and the rest of the administration has been great and throughout the summer we loved looking at the photos!- sue, needham, ma and by the way, it isn’t just camp – it is avoda! i have seen the difference in what my daughter experienced (and she was happy) and what alex did. there are too many differences to even go into in detail but the family feeling, the bonding, the surprises, the spirit, the fun, the energy, the support, the big brother program (brilliant!), the music, and on and on and on – what you have created is really very special. – lisa, weston, fl.
