a welcome from dg nomie
greetings, members of district 7620!
it is with great enthusiasm that i welcome you to rotary year 2024-2025!  this is the year that we display to our communities “the magic of rotary” by rotary international stephanie urchick.
the entire district leadership team is prepared to help each club president and its members soar in the coming year.  it will be an “historic year” with opportunities to share rotary far and wide.  let’s get to work!  happy new rotary year 2024-2025!
as we move forward, i am not dictating specific projects but rather encouraging clubs to increase their activities and collaborate effectively. remember, while we are part of a district, our strength and vibrancy originate from individual clubs. further down this page you will find the six priorities that our district will focus on this rotary year.
together, let’s harness our collective abilities to create “the magic of rotary” and forge a path that others will follow for years to come. thank you, and i look forward to a year of shared successes, and greater impact!
best wishes,naumaan “nomie” hamiddistrict governor 2024-25

district priorities





outward-facing engagement:we aim to elevate rotary’s visibility and impact in our communities, setting a standard of leadership and service. continuously invite other leaders, friends, and family to your events, showcase meetings and events that you are proud of. maintain the good, enhance the weak, and create new projects/fundraisers. do it with others!



strengthening networks:this year let’s support our own by utilizing the services offered by fellow rotarians. from real estate to printing services, our district is rich with resources that can benefit all members, use your space as a networking tool to help the youth in mentorship, and adults in partnerships. let’s talk about our jobs, let’s talk about our lives, let’s connect people together with our networks.



enhanced collaboration:i urge every club to increase interactions with other clubs. ag’s will organize official district governor visits by areas to enhance the exchange of diverse ideas, opportunity for collaboration, and greater community impact. i expect at these area visits not only shall there be rotarians, but also leaders from other organizations, as well as community members. from the district level, we have already collaborated with our neighboring district for the district conference in october, and for ryla. i have engaged in conversation with academic institutions like the carter school at gmu, the universities at shady grove, and university of maryland to further our collaborative efforts.





welcoming new members:we should aim to create a welcoming environment for new members to integrate and share their skills. with a diverse array of clubs in our district, there’s a place for everyone to thrive. i am asking each club to sponsor 2-4 new members where the club pays for their dues the first year! this isn’t only about numbers, it’s an opportunity to involve new skills and talents, as long as we let them step up to the plate. let’s start asking the questions as to why people want to join? what do they expect out of their membership? what’s important to them? what projects would they like to work on? we all need to feel valued and heard, this will not only increase our retention rate, but add a greater impact on the amazing work we already do as rotarians!



boosting foundation contributions:contributions to the rotary international foundation make a significant impact both locally and globally. i encourage all to witness the projects funded by our efforts to appreciate the breadth of our influence. i am asking for each rotarian to make at the minimum a $25 contribution to the rotary foundation. if you are unsure how to do it, just ask!



living the rotary action plan:i firmly believe we can champion the rotary action plan where together we see a world where people unite and take action to create lasting change across the globe in our communities and in ourselves. we shall aim to increase our impact, expand our reach, enhance participant engagement, and improve our adaptability.
