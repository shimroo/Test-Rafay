the new york timesob-gyn; pap wars: whose calendar to believe?by linda villarosafor many women and their doctors, the yearly pap test to detect cervical cancer is considered a necessary ritual. never mind that several years ago, the american cancer society advised women age 30 and older that screening every two to three years was enough if they had already passed three consecutive tests. or that last year, the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists and the government agency that sets standards for preventive screenings followed suit. but many patients and doctors do not know about the new guidelines, and many others do not agree with the recommendations. read more >
