douai abbey is a roman catholic monastery of monks of the english benedictine congregation, under the patronage of saint edmund, king and martyr. founded in paris in 1615, and uprooted from there by the revolution, we settled in douai in flanders before finally returning to england in 1903, settling at woolhampton.douai monks serve in parishes throughout england and wales. at the monastery we welcome guests on retreats or courses, as well as those who seek space for quiet or study. there are facilities for conferences, and for youth and chaplaincy groups. our library and archive houses a rich resource for study and research. throughout the year the abbey church hosts concerts of religious music.the primary work of the monks, however, is the regular celebration of the liturgy in the abbey church, which is open to the public. while this website explains our life, history, and vocation in greater depth, you are always welcome to come and see.
