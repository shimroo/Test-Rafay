	 abuse by debt collectors growing
	 
    


abuse by debt collectors growingpa. consumer protection bureau reports 3,240 complaints in '06, the most of any industry trackedsunday, october 15, 2006by patricia sabatini, pittsburgh post-gazettebill collectors aren't exactly known for their genteel ways.take the case in which a collection agency telephoned a woman's 5-year-old daughter, ordering her to tell her deadbeat mommy that she'd better pay her credit card bills."another customer had 12 messages at the office in one weekend. another had 36 calls in one week," said david sumner, senior deputy attorney general with pennsylvania's bureau of consumer protection.such tactics are considered harassment and violate state and federal regulations intended to protect consumers from overzealous debt collectors, he said. abusive practices such as repeated phone calls or the use of threatening or obscene language also continue to sully the debt collection industry, mr. sumner and other regulators say, even though a majority of collection agencies are reputable firms that work within the law."we believe the mistreatment of consumers by debt collectors is a serious problem," said tom kane, an attorney with the federal trade commission's division of financial practices.complaints about debt collectors have risen in recent years at the state and national level, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of overall complaints. still, it's hard to know if the increase is because bill collectors are getting worse, or simply because more people are complaining.in pennsylvania so far this year, the consumer protection bureau logged 3,240 complaints about debt collectors, the most of any industry. the tally outpaced the broader categories of telecommunications (second with 3,155 complaints) and buying services (third with 2,827), a segment that includes such things as gift certificates, coupons, rebates and contests.while some gripes come from people searching for a loophole to skirt their debts or who simply don't like being reminded they owe money, many complaints are prompted by bill collectors stepping over the line, regulators said.sometimes, the problem lies with a "rogue" employee at an otherwise reputable company."if its an upright company, it will discipline the employee or let them go," mr. sumner said.in pennsylvania, complaints are often about bill collectors calling too often or taking aggressive actions, such as contacting a neighbor, relative or boss to pressure payment, mr. sumner said.under state law, which essentially mirrors federal regulations, debt collectors generally can't discuss the debt with anyone other than the debtor or the debtor's attorney.bill collectors also can't use threats of harm or obscene or profane language, and may not contact the debtor before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. or use the telephone to annoy.collectors also are prohibited from making false or misleading statements, such as implying that the debtor will be arrested, or that the creditor will file a lawsuit when it can't or doesn't intend to do so.threats about garnishing wages also often violate the law, mr. sumner said, since the state allows garnishing in only special cases, such as for child support and back taxes.experts advise consumers contacted by a bill collector to write a letter requesting verification of the debt. mistakes are made, so the collection agency simply could have the wrong person."i pity the john smiths of the world because they probably are getting collection calls for other people," mr. sumner said.consumers who don't believe they owe the money should dispute the claim by certified mail within 30 days of receiving the collection notice.consumers also can stop a debt collector from making further contact by writing a so-called "shut-up" notice demanding that communications cease. the approach doesn't make the debt go away, however, and could push the creditor into suing."that's a powerful tool, but probably best used when the consumer doesn't owe the debt," mr. kane said.consumers who believe they've been victimized by a debt collector can file a complaint with the state consumer protection bureau or the ftc, which rely on tips to build cases against offenders by establishing a pattern of abuse.consumers also have the right to sue within one year of the alleged violation.of course, many problems can be avoided by contacting creditors directly to work out a repayment plan at the first sign of having difficulty paying a bill.even so, consumers who fall behind shouldn't have to endure lies and abuse, regulators said."we expect companies to be reasonable in their debt collection activities. we don't want to hear they are harassing people," mr. sumner said."it's a legal business and they serve a role. we're just asking that they comply with the law."(patricia sabatini can be reached at psabatini@post-gazette.com or 412-263-3066. )

	 debt collector threatens murder again.
	 
    


saturday, october 14, 2006      derekwanted criminal joined: october 12 2004location: united statesonline status: offlineposts: 1005              posted: october 14 2006 at 3:53pm | ip logged                      i have been given the honor of guest authoring a blog entry on normie's blog dedicated to exposing creditwrench ceo billie bauer for the con-man and scam artist that he is.normie, the following post may be a bit lengthy for your blog, so you are welcome to edit it as you feel is appropriate:"in a discussion today with creditwrench ceo billie bauer,the first proof of a con job is that it always starts with a lie. ithere was no conversation between this known and wanted criminal and creditwrench ceo billie bauer today, october 14, 2006. this bil-liar was told to start his so called post by another scam artist who claims to have a blog that is the worlds #1 for something or other but in fact is never read by anybody other than his debt collector buddies, all of whom are known and wanted criminals. the proof of what is said by me is posted on another blog.once a person is proven to be a liar then nothing else he has to say is important because it will all be nothing but more lies.mr. bauer claimed that consumer reporting agencies (experian, trans union, and equifax) search court records for civil money complaints that have not yet been tried,this is also a lie. it was also not stated anywhere that the credit bureaus search court records for civil money complaints that have not yet been tried. what was said is that judgments sometimes show up on credit reports even though they have not yet been tried. the fact that a judgment has been filed can and sometimes does show up on credit reports.somehow, this scumbag seems to think that just because he is a debt collector people are going to take whatever he says as the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. the sad fact is that debt collectors are known to be liars, cheats, thieves and general all around scumbags. lest anyone doubt that fact just look around the internet and see what honest hardworking ameicans have to say about them.and if that isn't good enough then just look at the multitudes of newspaper articles by reputable journalists and radio or tv stations have put out about these criminals.and if that isn't good enough then you should stop and ask yourself why is that so many states have had to pass laws requiring debt collectors to post huge bonds and get state issued licenses to collect debts in their respective states?the reason is that so many debt collectors have collected huge sums of money for banks, merchants and credit card companies and never returned money to those companies who trusted them to deal with them fairly and honestly only to find out they were being cheated out of tons of money or not being paid at all.even that hasn't been enough to stem the tide of thievery so the bigger banks and credit card companies have stopped referring their delinquent accounts to debt collectors long ago and now only sell their receiveables to large buyers capable of buying many millions and even billions of dollars worth of delinquent accounts in bundles at a time. they are known as brokers and their business is to buy in bulk and break up the bundles and sell them to the smaller companies in bundles they can afford. and of course, they make huge profits with little or no risk because there is always somebody out there willing to buy those little bundles in the hopes of getting rich by making your life miserable.so now you know the whole story. never, never, never trust a debt collector any further than you can throw him. and never, never, never believe anything they say on the internet or off of it because you will be fed a line of bull if you do. the only thing they know how to do is prey on your gullibility.and report these lawsuits against consumer credit reports as judgments. this is completely false since such an action would effectively deny the consumer the right to due process of law to have the complaint tried in court and determine if there is any liability by the consumer to pay the debt at all. this isso obviously wrong that it isn't even funny. debt collectors often attempt to effectively deny consumers the right to due process of law but there is no possible way that the appearance of a judgment on a credit report would deny the consumer the right to have the complaint tried in court to determine if there is any liability by the consumer to pay the debt at all or not. neither judges nor juries pay any attention to what a credit bureau might have to say about a defendant's liability or lack of it. once again, this criminal is proven to not only be a liar but now proven that he knows nothing about the law at all or how it operates. yet he expects, no, demands that you accept whatever he says as being the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. but the truth is that everything he has written is a total fabrication and that he has no knowledge or understanding of anything.additionally, the false reporting of a debt as a judgment on a person’s credit bureau report when in fact the matter has not yet been before a judge, is a clear violation of the fcra and facta.another loony tune. credit bureaus and debt collectors alike scoff at the law routinely for the simple reason that they make untold millions of dollars doing so and if the poor debtor wishes to complain about it he has to file a lawsuit which in federal court costs $350.00 up front which is a sum of money that many simply can't afford even if they could find a knowledgeable and competent attorney to take the case. so they normally get away with anything they want to get away with.     after all of the proof above that what you may have read or may contemplate reading is nothing but false and mis-leading information, nobody really needs to know much more than that.people who author blogs and other online material are expected to publish accurate information and if they don't then they suffer by reason that nobody pays any attention to what they have to say nor even bother to visit the website or blog.that's why the blog that is being touted as an expert source of information has no visitors other than other debt collectors. one visit is more than enough to cause you to understand that it all a bunch of hooey.and then he threatens reprisal by murder again.derekexpert member joined: october 12 2004location: united statesonline status: offlineposts: 1006
