about the artistfor thirty years i have been seriously painting full-time and it is still difficult to explain to anyone why. i don’t do it for money. i don’t do it for fame, either. i just paint. i love the process of painting. i love to capture the beauty and amazement of things i see for those who may not have noticed or for those who notice and want a tangible memory of their own.
