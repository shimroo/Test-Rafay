today’s marketers face an unprecedented data dilemma. your customers have entrusted you with their information for marketing purposes. however, uniting that data and deriving actionable insights to create personalized customer connections is a challenge in today’s post-cookie world. a data strategy that ties directly to your bottom line is no longer an option — it’s a requirement for sustainability and growth. 
meet nxtdrive™ — rrd's solution to this dilemma.

nxtdrive cleans, enhances, and uncovers opportunities from your brand’s first-party data
our continuous learning cycle helps optimize customer engagement — and deliver high-performance marketing.

unite your customer data

clean, usable data is the cornerstone of modern marketing. however, first-party data often gets scattered across multiple systems, which can lead to inaccuracy and a lack of actionable insights. this makes it difficult to maintain and utilize effectively.

activate marketing intelligence

using rrd’s advanced platform, you can create ideal customer audiences with enhanced and enriched data. nxtdrive empowers brands to engage the right customers at the right time, utilizing a diverse range of one-to-one, scalable solutions.
instead of inefficient, generic marketing, you’ll have true omnichannel print and digital media strategies to reach your audience effectively. integrating media activations helps you better leverage each channel — and unlock the full potential of your data.



learn and optimize marketing performance

how many dashboards does it currently take to understand your customers, marketing campaigns, and campaign performance? siloed data and fragmented performance management can be challenging. nxtdrive’s integrated cross-channel measurement and coordination delivers a unified view, eliminating the need to manage multiple platforms. this makes it easier to optimize your marketing performance.
