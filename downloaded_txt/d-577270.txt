are you being gaslighted and made to feel crazy? 
feel ignored, unheard, and dismissed? 
do you feel alone, like you don't matter? 
is your partner lying about an affair? 
are you being singled out and bullied? 
join our community as we expose and heal from the sociopathic style of relating. 















the sociopathic style™ is an ongoing educational and research project created by its founder, marion trent. in working with victims of sociopaths, marion identified a relationship style that undoubtedly has touched millions of people. all we have to do is look at the news headlines of the day to see that reports of sociopathic behavior in our society are dramatically on the rise. these news items focus mainly on the perpetrator.

marion began her focus on the victims of sociopaths whose stories didn’t make the media, but whose numbers are in the thousands and possibly even millions. a central theme she identified in all of the victims was a significant drop in vital life energy with attendant fear and depression, a serious shift to low self-esteem and self-doubt, a loss of sense of direction in life and a serious questioning of spiritual values.
