 in a nutshell...
what we do

we specialize in providing software solutions for lot service companies that offer dealer services, such as monroney window label and ftc buyerâs guide printing, as well as media collection services like vehicle photography, video, 360â° images, and more. our comprehensive suite of products covers all the software, services, and processes needed to efficiently manage and operate your dealer lot services enterprise.
at the heart of our system is weblot, an enterprise back-end that acts as a centralized hub. it offers administrative access for managing all data and configurations related to your dealers, their vehicles, window sticker designs, third-party export logs, website inventory modules, and more. it also allows the creation of logins for both your employees and dealers. dealers and their staff can log into a simplified back-end to manage their inventoryâno contracts, costly training, startup fees, or monthly group fees required.
most vehicle data collection, monroney label and ftc buyerâs guide printing, and media collection (photos, videos, 360â° images) are handled through our free, best-in-class mobilelot smartphone app. for users who prefer an external digital camera for photos, our free companion windows software, weblot photo match, streamlines the process of matching and uploading images.
lastly, for vehicle data syndication and aggregationâwhether to third-party classified sites, dealer websites, or importing vehicle data from another systemâour server-based robotics reliably automate the inventory online (iol) processes. this automation frees you up to focus on what matters most: running your business with peace of mind.
   ...and psst, dealers and dealer groups, we can serve you as well :)
be sure to review the product pages for detailed information on each of our offerings, as well as additional add-ons and services. when you're ready, getting started is easy. you can create your weblot account anytime, 24/7. afterward, simply give us a call at your convenience, and we'll provide expert assistance to help you maximize your account and get up and running quickly.

monroney labels with qr code to vdp

do your dealers frequently update vehicle prices? would they like customers to scan the window sticker for today's current price?
with weblot, not only are fully customizable window labels easy to design and implement, but you can also include features like qr codes that direct customers to your dealer's vdps*, carfax® highlights, vin or stock barcodes, and much more.
now featuring optional extra-large qr codes for cold climate "drive-by pricing" and vehicle details. this allows consumers to scan a code for pricing and vehicle information without having to leave their vehicle (if the lot layout permits).
*dependent on the dealer website providers ability to retrieve a vdp or search result via stock number or vin. contact us to verify functionality with the vdp provider.
