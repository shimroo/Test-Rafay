 (un)welcome returns? re-naturalisation rights of german jews in germanynicholas courtmansince 1949, the federal republic of germany has allowed former citizens, whose citizenship was revoked by the nazis due to their jewish faith or ‘race’, to reclaim it. yet, over the past 75 years, there have been significant changes regarding which german jews – and which descendants – can enjoy that right. this talk tracks those developments, from the restrictive, often antisemitic decisions made in the 1950s, to attempts to uphold those regulations in the following decades, through to the 2021 reform of the german nationality act that finally redressed such exclusions.register to join this event27 mar 2025 17:30 - 27 mar 2025 18:30

hitler’s mein kampf: reflections 100 years onlisa pinethis event is also the lbi summer lecture 2025
hitler and the history of the nazis remain extremely popular topics and ones that never cease to attract people’s interest, even fascination. it is crucial to comprehend the nature of mein kampf, the mindset of its author, adolf hitler, and the ideology he espoused that brought untold tragedy to millions of people – death, destruction, genocide and war. the book presents a dangerous set of ideas, regrettably ones that still have followers today, one hundred years after mein kampf was originally penned…register to join this event10 jul 2025 17:30 - 10 jul 2025 18:30
