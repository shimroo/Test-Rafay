project for awesmoe 2019 - 







once again, it's the time of year where everyone tries to be extra awesome in this month. you never know exactly who's watching! [santa?]

so for this year, i've gone and talked about the project for awesome 2019 video as the chace numata scholarship. it was started as a return back to the erie community for the outpouring of respect from the fans, teammates and alumni.

in november of 2019, the erie otters of the ohl hosted a scholarship night where they featured their neighbor erie seawolves efforts. they designed a jersey that looks like a baseball jersey most commonly worn in upmc park next door. i thought the design looks really nice and melds the two teams well with a non clustered design. i'm sure they are going to be a huge collectors item that people will want to grab quickly.

you can check out my video i've done for this year's event, but of course, you should pretty much consider donating to the scholarship fund.

game of the week - new york rangers vs washington capitals (9/11 anniversary game)





it's once again on that somber memorial of all the people lost on 9-11 that i decide to continue simulating the new york rangers and washington capitals nhl video game. i'll switch off on which team i use to control in the player 1 category and hope for the best. i've tried to get as many great goals in with some exciting highlights as best i can. it's a supplement to the "game of the week" feature on twitch.tv which can be later seen by the youtube channel community.
you can watch the broadcast here on the uploaded youtube channel here.

national hockey league playoffs 2019 - 





well, it's that time of year again where we whittle down the remaining playoff teams to we get one night were hockey fans relentlessly boo commissioner bettman and envy the captain awarded the stanley cup.
last year, i stopped doing the playoff beard, it resulted in the hometown team and 2x defending stanley cup winners losing in the second round. sure enough, i think i need to do it again this year. it worked!
in 2019 we have a bunch of teams that have never won the stanley cup versus a few teams that have won it in the past looking to build on a dynasty (like 80s oilers and islanders). it took a little more time for a couple of teams that have been trying for years to put the right combination of players together. which team is built to go the long haul of 16 more wins and hoisting the cup (and a future banner)? we'll examine which teams are likely to move on to the next round.
western conference

nashville v. dallas 
could this be the year of the nashville predators? "smashville" as they are marketed as, don't have very many famous names on the roster (other than p.k. subban). they are a defensive juggernaut where pekka rinne is the stalwart goaltender. i predict they will stop the dallas stars run into hockey relevance. it's been a while since we've seen the dallas stars in the post season. even with a few appearances (2), the dallas stars have been post-seasonally struggling since 2007-08.
prediction: predators in 6

st. louis v. winnipeg
is this the year that the st. louis blues finally make a run to the stanley cup finals? they are the chicago cubs of the nhl and the lovable losers. they seem to have stuck with this generation of players. from o'rielly, tarasenko, peron, and schenn and their goaltender jake allen. i don't know how the new "finnish flash" patrik laine will have an answer for all the experience. outside of little and byfuglien, i don't see them holding off this kind of a challenge. it was just another unfortunate bad match-up for them. and once the jets make the first run exit, look for coach maurice's firing.
prediction: blues in 5 

colorado v. calgary
who knew that the colorado avalanche were so good? they were the quiet team that hung in there and clawed their way overtop their western rivals ducks, kings, blackhawks. look for mckinnon, rantanen, and captain landeskog to get more experience together in the playoffs and learn to win like so many other teams have grown into their playoff potentials. calgary is another team that is in the trial and error period of gathering together a corps of young talent in the draft and pairing it with the right players to support them. look for giordano, monahan, and gaudreau to put it together and play well throughout the playoffs.
prediction: flames in 6

vegas vs san jose
the vegas golden knights and their fans have never known what it's like to not be in the playoffs. from their historical 1st run to today, they are certainly a force to be reckoned with. they will surely rival the "shark tank" in northern california as far as over-hyping of expectations. the sharks were in the finals the year before vegas and they know the grind is real. this might be the "leave it all on the table" before they have to tear it down for a major rebuilding process. burns and thorton and pavelski are in their twilight years. send them off with respect!

prediction: vegas in 6

eastern conference

tampa bay v. columbus
the curse of the president's trophy rests on the broad shoulders of the tampa bay lightning. they've built their franchise from the doldrums of expansion teams to one of the best teams as a perennial playoff performer. you can thank the columbus blue jackets coach john tortorella for that. he raised the franchise's first stanley cup in 2004. they have come close a few more times since then, but it may very well be the last hurrah for steven stamkos as a number of injuries have stalled his career. look for tampa bay to hand the baton of leadership to kucherov, hedman, and point. i'm sorry for the columbus blue jackets yet again finding a bad matchup opening round opponent. unless the blue jackets play a defense-first strategy, i don't see them outscoring. 
prediction: tampa bay in 5

toronto v. boston
it always seems to be the bane of the leaf nation existence that they always run into the boston bruins. i can tell you that they are still not over the playoff collapses to the bruins in recent years. so, it's been a trial and error to build a championship caliber team. the addition of "pajama boy" john tavares, an toronto area resident. while the bruins have refreshed their roster of support pieces since they last met, marchand and bergeron, rask, chara, krejci are all still there and know how to shut down the maple leafs attack. but is this the year that toronto overcomes their "el guapo"? all of those players are another year older and toronto has the young fresh legs. look for marner, matthews, and tavares to start their first chapter in a long career of playoff game heroism.

prediction: toronto in 7

carolina v. washington 
out of a renewed storm of interest in the hockey team, these "bunch of jerks" are facing the defending stanley cup champions. the "ovi-train" alex ovechkin is going to be the "russian machine never breaks". i really don't have much to say here for this prediction other than i don't give much of a chance to the hurricanes this year. the capitals are still the strong team they always were the whole season, but this time, they have the defending championship pressures and fans with even higher expectations.

prediction: capitals in 4

pittsburgh v. ny islanders
the penguins have been a streaky team this year, but when their backs are up against the wall, they find a way to come through in the clutch. draw penalties, cycle in their offensive zone, and supporting their goalies with blocked shots. those will be the key to victory. malkin has been abused all year physically, but reached the milestone of 1,000 points in his career. he's already on record by hoping that he faces the blues in the playoffs. the islanders have found a very good defensive first system having hired coach trotz who figured them out as the capitals coach. look for a really really really crazy crowd on long island. 

prediction: penguins in 7
