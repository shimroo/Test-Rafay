hello, my name 
	is john schaefer.since retiring in 2008, i have found my 
    passion: spreading the symbol of christianity through custom wooden 
    crucifixes!
each crucifix is hand-made and 100% unique.  because each is 
    one of a kind, it comes complete with a signed certificate of authenticity 
    (including series number, photo, and description)


i can also make crucifixes for special order.  order 
    them for weddings, anniversaries, confirmations, first communions, and 
    funerals.  you can even send wood from an old piece of furniture, 
    special tree, or building and i can make a crucifix that will preserve 
    special memories!i also do repairs and restorations on family heirloom 
	pieces.


contact me with special requests!
