the microsoft xbox 360 console: powerful gaming in a box





gone are the days of drab, underpowered gaming consoles with limited features. the microsoft xbox 360 is here! it doesn't matter if you are a serious gamer or a mere hobbyist, the xbox 360 that microsoft launched in november 2005 is suitable for all players. it claims to have taken into consideration all the facets of ultimate gaming experience with this much-improved version of the original microsoft xbox that came out in november 2001.check your budget. depending on what you can afford, you may start with the very basic core system composed of the light console, the wired controller and the composite av cable; and when your budget allows you to purchase other peripherals one by one for the enhancement of your total gaming experience, maybe you'd want to change your wired controller with the wireless model, or maybe you'd want to add in the xbox live headset for amplification of sound effects to a mind-boggling level far above what your normal tv speakers could provide.on the other hand, if you are one of those to whom "money is no object," you may just go ahead and buy the entire microsoft xbox 360 system, where everything is all in (i.e., the console with premium chrome finish, a wireless controller, the xbox live headset, component hard drive-av cable, the ethernet cable that allows you to connect with the other players, and the hard drive that contains an array of original xbox games and allows you to download even more games. since the xbox 360 allows up to four wireless controllers operating on one console, it lets you play with three other players simultaneously for that added fun and challenge in live competition.the microsoft xbox 360 gives you total digital entertainment. you may amplify and enhance your music and movies to a soothingly soft or to a ripping loud volume. connect to the internet and instantly stream your music, digital home movies, photographs and graphics or any other files stored in your hard disk, memory and other digital media that are microsoft windows xp-based pc that you want to share with others.when attached to your tv, the microsoft xbox 360 takes advantage of the high-definition tv resolution in its full color and size that makes the game movie-like. its anti-aliasing capability renders the animation flawlessly smooth and non-jerky, and the characters seem as though they are jumping out of the wide screen! when you are connected to the internet via the ethernet card, you have the xbox live headset, a facility that allows you to voice-chat with other players, thus combining active gaming with socialization.there are games that are rated "must-have" because they are simply sensational with the microsoft xbox 360. these include "dead or alive 4," "call of duty 2" for the best wwii shooter, "king kong" for great effects and "need for speed most wanted" for racing fans. for some odd reasons, some games that run with excellent audio and video effects using the first version of xbox don't run as well in the xbox 360; these include "madden nfl 06," "nba live 06." this must be given immediate attention by the microsoft people because it is a source of great disappointment for hardcore gamers and, in some cases, could be a deal-breaker.pressure is on for movie makers and game programmers/manufacturers to properly and visibly indicate the appropriate rating of their products on the packaging to provide guidance for buyers. in this regard, it is an added attraction to parents that the microsoft xbox 360 has settings that allow them to control how it is used by their children. the box has family settings which enable parents to shield their children from unsavory or unwholesome contacts. family settings perform two functions on the xbox 360 console-to allow or restrict access to offline games and/or dvd movies, and access to online contact and content via the xbox live environment.esrb is the regulating body that takes care of rating the propriety or impropriety of a game or movie based on age. esrb's restrictions on games are ec (early childhood) for children below 6 years old, containing no inappropriate materials at all; e (everyone) for children younger than 13, and these have minimal violence and comic mischief but are substantial for character building. some xbox 360 games with an e rating include ridge racer 6 and nba 2k6.the rest of the esrb ratings are: t (teen), which may also contain minimal violence, mild-to-strong language and/or suggestive themes; m (mature 17+) containing mature sexual themes or more intense violence and language; ao (adults only, for players aged 18+), which may include more graphic sexual themes and/or violence; and rp (rating pending) for games that have not been officially released yet.with the safeguard placed by the family settings of the microsoft xbox 360 console, the parent feels safe buying the system for their kids. so, whatever the gaming preference of the child - or the parent! -- microsoft xbox 360 promises to satisfy them.   by: mark robbins article directory: http://www.articledashboard.com    mark robbins is a gamer providing valuable tips and advice on the new xbox 360 including information on hardware, games, and xbox 360 accessories.

whats a 3d, whats 3dgraphics, 3d computer graphics





author: harish katt  related to 3dgraphics and 3d  3d is nothing but an depth, some ways like example an paper which has a thin depth with a width and a length (a box which had length and width along with depth value, when talking regarding axis, its an object having x-axis y-axis and z-axis). so a 3d is an dimentional array of axis in 3 directions, thus forming a object, thing, a view of depth,.and here we talk about the 3dgraphics, is making use of an 3 dimentional illusion, like a virtual reality. for example, if we take a real human being. a human being consists of some heigt width and length thus forming a dimension volume, just making the same thing using a computer generated character. if we use that computer generated character in action, like dancing, singing, or some basic action of movement. then it is said to be an 3dgraphics. because it basically a virual generated computer character. 3d computer graphics are works of graphic art that were created with the aid of digital computers and specialized 3d software. in general, the term may also refer to the process of creating such graphics, or the field of study of 3d computer graphic techniques and its related technology.3d computer graphics are distinct from 2d computer graphics in that a three-dimensional virtual representation of objects is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering images. in general, the art of 3d graphics is akin to sculpting or photography, while the art of 2d graphics is analogous to painting. in computer graphics software, this distinction is occasionally blurred; some 2d applications use 3d techniques to achieve certain effects such as lighting, while some primarily 3d applications make use of 2d visual techniques.generally now a days, mostly the 3dgraphics are being used for film and video. and other than these people use for television broad-casting , medical, industrial, science fiction, educational and many more. the way of using computer 3dgraphics give much more real time representation of things to undertand and edcuate by seeing them. with a less implementation of time the final exploration of the thing can be expressed to person, even if he is an uneducated layman.since i had worked at somany places, and found difficult for people to undertand the things. now a days there are somany things and ways to undertand and learn things from internet.you can ask your doubts or any clarificational doubts regarding to the media and 3dgraphics. i help people to educate by knowing the facts of an 3d and its effects of support which helps in a very expressive modes.   i am basicall a 3d lead animator and interest in supporting and giving people about the going on things and helping people.author :  harishsite: www.techno3dmedia.comarticle@techno3dmedia.com      article source: http://www.article99.com

should you use text or graphics with google adsense?





google adsense provides advertisers and publishers with the opportunity to place adverts in both text and graphic format.as advertisers decide to put adsense into their website over banner advertising, the question still remains. which is the best for advertisers and which is the best for publishers?on one hand advertisers may feel that image adverts are more responsive yet less likely to stimulate a sale. on the other hand text adverts may convert more, whilst being less visible to the consumer.text based adverts are considered the least intrusive of the two formats. however does that mean that graphic advertising is better? consumers are used to graphic advertising from signing into free email accounts, and from using other web based services. through being used to graphic advertising they have almost programmed their selves to ignore it. through the adverts being untargeted, the consumer is used to brand advertising which they feel is generally less purposeful. this may cause the consumer to ignore the graphic advert from the assumption that it will be the same.text adverts are not forced upon surfers. through being less obvious some people will not see them at all, however those who do see them, and read them are significantly more likely to click on them. this is for a number of reasons, but the first is that they provide more information. generally, someone who is reading text on a page is not going to be fully satisfied by what they read, and if they check adsense adverts they will most likely read something which will further supplement whatever their intention is next. with an image advert, it is far more of a gamble for the surfer.graphic advertising is often paid per impression. this is because the advertiser may be trying to promote their brand, instead of promoting a specifically useful service. they therefore are assumed to have worse conversion rates, and with this text adverts are in the consumers eyes more effective. however, if the text contained within an advert was placed in graphic format, which would be the most effective? well firstly it can assumed that the surfer will be more likely to view it, however if their were multiple image adverts appearing next to each other they may feel overwhelmed.graphic adverts are also harder to regulate. let’s consider google allowing adverts to be changed frequently and without regulation. the advertiser could claim affiliation from the website they are advertising on, and contain keywords such as “ipod” which cannot be contained within a text advert. although more regulation and quality control could be in place, a pornographic image for example could be made to appear in an advertiser’s adverts unknowingly.text adverts also have a broader market appeal, as advertisers don’t generally have the in house resources to create an image advert, but do have the in house resources to write a text advert. this could mean that a wider array of advertisers find text advertising accessible, through text adverts being less burden on the advertiser, and being easy to change.text adverts are also cheaper for the advertiser to create, where as a graphically designed advert may cost in excess of $200. through removing this fixed cost advertisers may be willing to allot a higher rate to advertising itself; thus benefiting the advertiser and the publisher.text advertising appears to be the preference of the advertiser. they pay a ctr (click through rate) and only receive targeted traffic. this removes risks from businesses that previously had to worry that adverts were not only seen, but clicked on and stimulating sales. as cpc (cost per click) is more relevant to text adverts, advertisers are able to gain exposure without needing a high click through rate to be effective.the big brands are willing to advertise in both formats however the broad market appeal of text inevitably makes it the winner. as flash websites disappear with image adverts, it is becoming clear that text and information is the preference of the website users.you need to have optimized niche website templates for best results. you may find the best adsense templates and blog templates at www.adsensetemplates.com (http://www.adsensetemplates.com). they are offering 100 fresh new templates every month.   by: matthew meyer article directory: http://www.articledashboard.com    matthew meyer. for more information on affiliate marketing see the affiliate marketing section of thefreeadforum.com directory at: www.thefreeadforum.com/infowizards/cat/affiliate-marketing_68_1.html   access diabetic supplies

sxga  super extended graphics array





sxga is an abbreviation for super extended graphics array referring to a standard monitor resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels. this resolution of 1,310,720 pixels is an enhancement of the standard xga resolution that ibm developed in 1990.this resolution is not the standard 4:3 aspect ratio but 5:4 (1.25:1 instead of 1.333:1). a standard 4:3 monitor using this resolution will have rectangular rather than square pixels, distorting the picture and causing circles to appear elliptical.sxga is the most common resolution on 17", 18" and 19" desktop lcd monitors. the majority of these monitors have a physical 5:4 aspect ratio, avoiding any distortion (e.g. the samsung syncmaster 172t, which measures 335 x 275 mm displayable).apple computer referred to displays with this resolution as "two-page displays", because they could be used to display two a4 pages side-by-side at a resolution of 72 dots per inch.[citation needed] sony manufactured a 17" crt monitor with a 5:4 aspect ratio designed for this resolution. it was sold under the apple brand name.any crt that can run 1280x1024 can also run 1280 × 960, which has the standard 4:3 ratio. it's often a matter of tweaking or changing the video driver to be able to run this resolution, as some only offer 1280x1024. displaying any 4:3 resolution on a 5:4 monitor, like a tft with a native resolution of 1280x1024, will look stretched. but, on a tft, displaying any other resolution than the native one is not a good idea anyway, as the image needs to be interpolated to fit in the fixed grid display.a variation is sxga+ which is 1400 × 1050 common on laptops since circa 2003.there is much speculation on the origin of sxga. some believe its use began back in the mid-1980s, as an upgrade from xga 1024×768. at the time, memory was extremely expensive. using 1280×1024 at 8-bit color depth allowed 1.25 mib of video ram usage, fitting nicely with available ram chip sizes.[1][2]    1280 pixels × 1024 pixels = 1,310,720 pixels    1,310,720 pixels × 8 bits/pixel = 10,485,760 bits    10,485,760 bits ÷ 8 bits/byte = 1,310,720 bytes = 1.25 mibfrom wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
