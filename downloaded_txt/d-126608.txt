100 years strong - 1924 to 2024
about the academy of legal studies in business
founded in 1924, the academy of legal studies in business (international) is an association of teachers and scholars in the fields of business law, legal environment, and law-related courses outside of professional law schools. our nearly 1,000 members teach primarily in schools of business in colleges and universities, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
members come from all fifty states, canada, australia, new zealand, ireland, england, and a number of other nations.
the academy provides a forum for the exchange of ideas, and encourages support and cooperation among those who teach and conduct research in the field of legal studies. the academy publishes two top-tier journals: the american business law journal (ablj) and the journal of legal studies education (jlse). members receive hard copies of both journals and have electronic access to them via wiley online library on the members’ only page.

alsb mission statement
the academy of legal studies in business advances legal studies in business education and is the professional home for legal studies researchers and educators, fostering collegial relationships and productive collaboration with researchers, educators, and organizations throughout the world. the academy promotes knowledge of law, ethical behaviors, and an appreciation for justice, in research and teaching, so that students better understand the world in which businesses operate and so that business leaders may better understand their relationship with society and the impact of their decisions.
