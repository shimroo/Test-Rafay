applied physics and materials science
the future of quantum, nano, and multi-scaled science and engineering
theâ department of applied physics and materials science at northern arizona university offers multiple degree paths including a bachelorâs degree in physics, a bachelorâs degree in physics and astronomy (merged major), a masterâs degree in applied physics, a masterâs degree in materials science,and a doctoral degree in applied physics and materials science.
applied physics and materials science are rapidly developing transdisciplinary fields primarily focused on the application of physical phenomena to technology design and discovery of advanced functional materials. this intrinsic link between applied physics and materials science have made applied physics and materials science foundational disciplines for next generation technologies in nano-, meso- and quantum science.



the sense of community i felt while at nau is something i very much miss.
