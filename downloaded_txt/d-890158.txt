happy 60th birthday system 360!
 
my first mainframe was a s/370 model 168 with intel memory.  
it was the early 1980s. we had no security system (used password dataset), 
no scheduing package (used mellon bank before/after cards), 
no tape management system and 3350s.  it was a small to medium shop. 

later in the 1980's we installed 
racf, 
ucc-1, 
a 3081 processor,  
and 3380s. 

i don't know if it was the actual password dataset or a text file with saved passwords but i remember this entry for the master catalog: 
karma - the ethical consequences of one's transmigration through apparent reality.

happy new year! 
tweaked various pages including the main page, 
   dave faq and 
   site faq.

i moved these links to the hopelessly outdated pages: 
   
dave's reference summary
tn3270 page
spf editor

   i should move more there.

happy new year! 
corrected the ipcs web page which i somehow overlaid 
with the mvsintosh page during my 2018-11-11 update. 
thanks to jim ruddy who sent me an email about it. 

thanks to the post in a thread on 
reddit /r/mainframe, 
i saw this walmart contributed github page: z/os-based file access manager.

eheu fugaces labuntur anni
 - i've made a few tweaks here and there since 2013 but nothing big. 

the default font size was increased from 11px to 16px to make planet mvs a bit easier to read.  we are all getting
older! these are only for those web pages using
css as ideally they should be.  this website was 
started in the dark ages before css.

updated the mvsintosh page.

i used  
favic-o-matic to create new
favicons for planet mvs. this is a recent picture of 
my old crt imac running a 3270 emulation program:









2013-09-01


new url for tn3270 for the macintosh on the 
mvsintosh page. 


new 
banner graphic
for the main page of planet mvs.   the picture was taken in 
goblin valley state park 
in utah.  part of the movie galaxy quest 
was filmed there. notice my mainframe geek vanity plate. 





2011-04-09


the mvsintosh page was updated: 
    
existing ftp section includes a link to 
    filezilla (actually also for linux and windows)  
    new terminal (mac shell) section
    new ipad section - even though it's a mac page 
    
updated the ipcs faq page with a new question on how to run 
    ipcs in batch.  also updated my ipcs wishlist page.  i ought 
    to see if my company can submit some of these to ibm via share. 
removed the version number for  spflite off the 
    spf editor page to cut down on the emails about the new 
    version.
removed the outdated links to tn3270 products on the 
    tn3270 page.  you'll have to 
    google that.


ispf tips: 
hx - ispf editor line command displays hex in a vertical format 


edit       ibmuser.dave.txt(xyz) - 01.99                           columns 00001 00080
command ===>                                                          scroll ===> half
****** ********************************* top of data **********************************
000001 everything you wanted to know about hex but were afraid to ask

here is an 
ibm page 
with more information. 

hide x - ispf editor primary command. slick, very slick. 

swapbar - ispf primary command.  as someone that uses a lot of screens (to the point of getting the dreaded "no more screens" 
error daily), cudos to ibm for the   
swapbar 
command.  i need to customize ispf for more than 8 screens!.  i wish the swapbar was in screen number order all the time.  
on some 3270 emulators, you have to tell them to allow you to click on the swapbar label to jump to that screen. 








2010-01-17

saw this top 10 programming
fonts.  his number one font works great with 3270 terminal emulators. 





2009-06-18 - 2009-06-21

finally making my first 2009 updates:


my isp lost my emails so if you sent anything to me this 
year before 2009-04-22 i can't view them. if you sent me anything after that date i have it. 
add new ipcs pages  - this will not teach you how to shoot dumps.
they will only help you if you already know how to use ipcs. 
updated flowerbox page with a contribution that was 
sent to me via email.
added the bob rodgers quote to this page which came from a cole software email
changed spf editor page for:
    spf lite is now at 3.1a http://spflite.co.nr/ (mainly to 
note that this editor is being updated by the developer unlike others). 
dennis mccunney sent me: 
cullen software's text composition document editor (tcd)
(attempts to merge xedit and spf in a java implementation)
http://www.mfsp.com/vmweb/geoff/tcddoc.htm
martien van der burgt's freeware pc-xedit, written in vb6
