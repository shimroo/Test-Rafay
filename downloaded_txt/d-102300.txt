csj natural dog food, herbs and treats for active and working dogs
(and now for cats too!)

csj has become one of the fastest growing dog food brands since 1998 when international sheepdog triallist, ceri rundle, was unable to find an affordable, quality, extruded food that suited her own dogs. the available premium quality foods were too expensive and the cheaper ones a case of false economy with the resultant sloppy stools and /or thin, hungry dogs.
with the help of vets, herbalist and the ukâs leading nutritionist, ceri devised a unique range of natural canine feeds, herbal supplements and treats to meet the requirements of all working dogs and has now become the first choice for many of the top dog handlers in the following sports:
agility dogs ~ flyball ~ gundogs ~ heelwork to music ~ obedience ~ show dogs ~ sled dogs ~ sheepdogs ~ working trial dogs
csj canine feed uses only top quality, natural ingredients, with an extensive range to meet the needs of all dogs of all ages - and all pockets!

tamsin, toby & pheobe - complete tripe!
just a follow up for you. tried 3 types you sent as taste test. that was fascinating to watch - independently they both smelt all 3 and then scoffed the tripe 1st - bingo! 
i was worried they would like different ones. been on complete tripe ever since and haven't looked back. 
dogs calm and happy,walking well and 'bounce' in anticipation of eating every day. thanks nicki and all at csj.tamsin, toby & phoebe
complete tripe!
