“the educational experience of a lifetime” … since 1959 



the summer science program offers teens an exhilarating and inspiring immersion into hands-on experimental science. working in teams of three, 36 or 24 participants and 8 faculty form a supportive “living and learning community” over 39 days. each team completes a real research project, taking and analyzing original data. afterward, they join a worldwide network of 3,700+ alumni of all ages. in 2024 we operated 12 programs:

five in astrophysics: research in near-earth asteroid orbit determination at new mexico state univ., univ. of colorado boulder, georgia college & state univ., and univ. of north carolina chapel hill.
three in biochemistry: research in fungal crop pathogens at purdue univ. and indiana univ.
three in genomics: research in evolution of antibiotic resistance at indiana univ., georgetown univ., and purdue univ.
one in synthetic chemistry: creation of novel macrocyclic compounds at southwestern oklahoma state univ.

the summer science program is an independent nonprofit, dedicated to creating a transformational experience for our participants.  many alumni call it “the educational experience of a lifetime.” 















 







is summer science program for you? 



summer science program is open to current high school juniors who have completed the pre-requisites by summer, and will be at least 15 years old, but not yet 19, during the program. (not a junior yet? we can remind you later.)

				learning science was fun and doing science was challenging, but really, i think the essence of ssp has everything to do with collaboration. being in a room with 35 other highly motivated students inspired me to be an efficient teammate, an optimistic leader, a humble student, and a supportive friend. working with the smartest people i have ever met, i achieved things i never thought i could do. ssp transformed me from a distant individualist to a passionate collaborator. and by doing so, i think it sent me on a path of success.
