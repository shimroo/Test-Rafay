crown point estate planning attorney
provide for your loved ones
if you are married with minor children, you may wish to leave your estate entirely to your spouse to enable them to care for your children. if you pass away without a will in lake county (or anywhere in indiana), however, the state of indiana will give half of your probate property to your children. because your children are under the age of 18, a court-appointed guardian is also required to manage their inheritance until they are adults. through the creation of a will or living trust, kent a. jeffirs, attorney at law can help ensure that your spouse will receive your entire estate to continue caring for your children without interference by the court. in addition to passing down property to your loved ones as you see fit, wills and trusts also allow you to select a personal representative to administer your estate and select a guardian to care for young children.
prepare for the unexpected
although it may be unpleasant to consider, it is important to plan for your financial and health care needs, should you no longer be able to make decisions or communicate your wishes. powers of attorney allow you to name an attorney-in-fact to make either financial or health care choices on your behalf. advance health care directives ensure that you will receive the medical attention you desire if you are no longer able to express your desires. planning for yourself helps you receive the care you want, and saves your family from having to make difficult decisions for you.
