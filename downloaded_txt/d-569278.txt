peter and paul, apostles these two strong-willed apostles are the pillars of the church in the first generation after christ. peter was one of the twelve, one who both offered a glorious confession of faith and later denied knowing jesus. paul once led the persecution of christians, then was converted and helped bring the faith to non-jewish people.

thomas, apostle  though frequently remembered as "doubting thomas," this apostle also demonstrated a willingness to suffer and die with jesus (john 11:16), and finally claimed the risen christ as "my lord and my god!" by tradition, he later worked as a missionary in india. long commemorated on december 21, thomas's celebration is moved to july 3 in agreement with ecumenical calendars.
