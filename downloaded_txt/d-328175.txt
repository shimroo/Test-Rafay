debbie k.

excellent team that did and continue to do the research in scouring the annuity marketplace to meet my needs! great customer service and attention to detail. i did not get the expected ‘pushy sales approach’ and they continue to provide the on-going service and always answer my requests in a timely manner.







david b.
