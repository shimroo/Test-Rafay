what is galactosemia?
galactosemia means âtoo much galactose in the blood.â
galactose builds up in the blood because the body cannot process this simple sugar.

step 1
step 2
step 3





                            when everything is working the way it should, galactose is converted by
                            pathway #1. in this pathway, galactose is turned into galactose-1-phosphate, or
                            gal-1p by the galk enzyme.
                        

                            because of the inactive or missing galt enzyme, gal-1p can't be processed any
                            further. gal-1p clogs the pathway, so galactose can't go where it's supposed
                            to.
                        

                            backed-up galactose overflows into pathway #2, where it shouldn't go. an enzyme that's not
                            supposed to be involvedâaldose reductaseâchanges galactose into toxic
                                galactitol.

words to know in galactosemia
the four gs



                                galactose
                                


                                galactose is a type of sugar found in dairy products and certain foods. it is also produced naturally (endogenously) by the body.
                            



                                galactitol
                                


                                galactitol is a toxic substance produced in people with classic galactosemia. galactitol has been shown to be responsible for a range of health issues.
                            



                                gal-1p
                                


                                gal-1p stands for galactose-1-phosphate. gal-1p is a substance that is typically converted by the body into glucose, which is used for energy. everybody makes gal-1p. but in people with classic galactosemia, the missing or inactive galt enzyme leads to an excess build-up of gal-1p and galactose.
                            



                                galt
                                


                                galt is an enzyme that helps the body convert gal-1p into glucose, which is used for energy. classic galactosemia is the term used for people who are missing or have an inactive galt enzyme. galt is also referred to as galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase.

making the connection
the role of toxic galactitol

                        in galactosemia, galactose is mistakenly turned into a substance called galactitol. galactitol is highly toxic, which means it's harmful to the body.
                    

                        toxic galactitol can build up in the blood, tissues, and organs, including the brain. there is evidence that toxic galactitol is responsible for a range of health issues that people with galactosemia may experience.
                    



 




rare and different
types of galactosemia

                        galactosemia is a rare condition that is diagnosed in approximately 80 newborns in the u.s. each year. in total, it affects 3,000 people in the u.s.
                    

                        there are several types of galactosemia. and while each person's experience with galactosemia will be unique, there are some similar characteristics between each different type.
                    



                                classic galactosemia (cg) (type i)
                                


                                this is the most common form of galactosemia and is caused by an inactive or missing galt enzyme. the missing galt enzyme prevents the body from processing galactose and can cause lifelong health complications, some of which can be life threatening at birth.
                            



                                galactokinase deficiency (type ii)
                                


                                this form of galactosemia is a result of an inactive or missing galk enzyme and may have similar outcomes to people with classic galactosemia.

this is galactose. it's a kind of sugar.
galactose is found in milk, dairy products, and other foods.
your child's body also makes galactose on its own, even if they never eat anything with galactose in it. in fact, every cell of the human body produces galactose from birth through adulthood.
galactosemia is a condition in which the body has trouble processing galactose.
to understand why this happens, we need to look at metabolic pathways. these are chemical reactions that convert molecules in the body.
when everything is normal and working the way it should, galactose is converted by a specific pathway that we'll call pathway #1. in this pathway, galactose is turned into galactose-1-phosphate, or gal-1p for short.
people with galactosemia are missing a key enzyme called galt, so gal-1p can't be processed any further. instead, gal-1p backs up and clogs the pathway, so galactose can't go where it's supposed to. testing for high levels of gal-1p is how we currently monitor galactosemia.
but galactosemia is a tale of two pathways. we've learned that when galactose backs up with nowhere to go it overflows into a different metabolic pathway, where it shouldn't go. we'll call it pathway #2.
galactose travels along pathway #2, but the pathway doesn't normally have what it takes to process galactose. an enzyme in pathway #2 that's not supposed to be involved converts the galactose. this enzyme is called aldose reductase. it changes galactose into galactitol.
galactitol is highly toxic. this means it's harmful to the body. galactitol can build up in the blood, tissues, and organs, including the brain.
there is evidence that toxic galactitol is responsible for a range of health problems that people with galactosemia may experience, such as speech issues, cognitive delays, fertility issues in girls, seizures and tremor.
currently, a diet that cuts out galactose is the only tool we have to manage the condition. but because the body makes galactose on its own, diet alone isn't enough.
