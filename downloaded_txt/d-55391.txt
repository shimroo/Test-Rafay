termsâ &â conditions

zarcrom cannot determine the legal or not legal nature of the sites being hosted. but the level of responsibility of its clients is the same average as that of âcheapâ hostings, and it is extremely rare that problems might occur. however, the provisions of article 6-i-7 of law nâ° 2004-575 dated june 21st, 2004 referring to confidence issues in the digital economy force zarcrom to place a device that allows any person to point out any content that might be abusive within the offenses related to sections fifth and eighth of article 24, law of july 29th, 1881 about the freedom of press, and article 227-23 of the criminal code, including offenses that:

â¢ express approval of criminal acts against humanity.
â¢ promote racial hatred.
â¢ promote and approve of child pornography.

managed hosting
in the r&d area, zarcrom has received the crã©dit impã´t recherche, especially to fine tune the webtone continuumâ® system, which applies a diversity of technologies ensuring the continuity of the internet service for the site, as well as for the whole system in case of catastrophes.

nowadays internet is considered a working tool, whether at the core of a company or between a company and its clients. while a companyâs site and its complementary systems act both as showcase and as circulation system of data to the interior of the company, they are not decorative elements at all, but essential tools for the good operation of the company. although it would be possible to reduce costs suggesting low quality material, overbooking or offering economic solutions to individuals, nowadays hosting has become an essential piece of any organization, and speed, availability, reactivity, safety and power are key factors to success.

the whole r&d area in zarcrom is oriented in that sense through the creation of network solutions, the development of control software, the construction of databases or synchronized web servers, in order to provide more safety, peace of mind and power. a special place is given to e-mail, which has grown in importance every day, while many small and middle companies keep using free, massive systems with no guarantee and no commitment on behalf of their providers.

the processes (services) are clearly distributed in zarcromâs servers. there are specific tasks performed by specific groups of servers, completely isolated from the other groups: e-mail servers, anti-spam gateways, dns, backup servers, database servers, web servers, files servers, applications servers, load distribution, etc. those servers are composed of clusters of several âphysicalâ machines. this allows not only for an almost infinite power range, but also for a powerful fail-over service: if one machine is down, it does not affect the process undertaken.

for customers with a high demand in power, zarcrom provides optimized servers for the high-speed delivery of static files; other machines with different features handle dynamic files. this way, binary downloads (programs, images, flash, videos, mp3...) are performed with great efficacy.

the new standards in zarcrom are sun hostings with massive parallel processors and solaris 10. all machines use 32 virtual processors with an energy intake 2 times smaller than intel servers. in terms of commercial data center offerings that address web, application and smaller database workloads, there is nothing currently in the marketplace that matches the core/thread density of the server farm at zarcrom.

gsrt guaranteed service reestablishment time

attending the needs of the client, zarcrom is in a position to set a deadline to restore the service; beyond that deadline, zarcrom shall pay a penalty specified in the service level agreement (sla). the gsrt is set, for example, to 10 minutes for web tone continuumâ® hosting.

sla (service level agreement)

the sla is the agreement established by zarcromâs commitment regarding the quality of its services, and by the penalties established in case of non-compliance. this quality is measured according to objective criteria accepted by both parties. under the sla, zarcrom guarantees a 10-minute-gsrt under fine or penalty for web tone continuumâ® hostings, and a maximum of two occasions a year.

every contract is the result of an agreement subject to the needs of each company, as well as to the technological solutions to be put in practice at the redundance level (i.e. switches alteon o f5-networks, synchronic replication among file servers, data base servers or applications servers).

history
all basic services a client would expect to find are included: php, mysql, e-mail servers in clusters and load delivery, anti-spam with 40 different levels, including sender authentication, anti-virus, web-mail with business calendar functions, automatic reminder of dates through email or sms, smpt even if the clientâs fai blocks port 25, lists server, newsletter server with detection and automatic deletion of unknown addresses, etcâ¦

but it is on the level of customization of high range services that zarcrom makes the difference, adapting them to the needs of the clients on a technical level (oracle, flex, coldfusion, webdna, weblogic, j2ee, redundancy) as well as on the quality of the service (service level agreement, guaranteed service reestablishment timeâ¦) and on the externalization of the platform. contact us and let us know what you need: you will receive a quick and detailed non-binding response from a competent person.

this is zarcrom: a modern company capable of providing a highly personalized service, great reactivity and avant-garde technical solutions.

reactivity
in october 2015, spam and viruses composed 93% of the e-mail that reached zarcromâs servers, and that means around a million messages received per day...
the intervention of over 40 successive filters with different logics and algorithms, added to the application of individual filters, has reduced the unwanted e-mail in the mail boxes of our clients to 1% of the total volume of the initial spam.
if a client should require 100% spam-free messages, there are solutions based in the intelligent principle of authentification: when e-mail is sent for the first time to a user, the sender is required identification, to verify he is a legitimate sender. once the process is done, the message is sent to the recipient and the senderâs address is definitely authorized. authentification is simple and quick, it is done just once and it conforms to all situations (newsletters, automatic answers, users with double protection, etc.) this service is available in all our types of hosting.

whether it is at the level of solaris 10 (sun hosting) or at the level of firewall solutions, safety constitutes a major constant concern to the engineers and technicians in zarcrom. the networks access is done only through safe gateways...

strenght
with an on-line-support system with updates described in each contract, zarcrom is able not only to transmit the claims to the most competent technician on-line, but also to ensure technical supervision in several languages. setting the time allows to verify the real time response, which will rarely be over 30 minutes. support is 100% free, and really available 24/7. it is faster and safer than e-mail. zarcromâs on-line-support constitutes a reference in the field.

there is also a telephone number available to all clients, with a technician retransmitting the requests. all our servers are also controlled in real time and a technical team is ready to intervene and solve any kind of problem.).


r & d
the costly budgets related to hiring a solaris or linux / freebsd manager are not always afforded by the companies, and even if they are, there are many reasons to outsource this kind of tasks. our outsourcing activity involves optimizing and managing our clientsâ platforms and networks under windows, linux/unix and solaris 10. sophisticated supervision tools are used to control whole systems, sites, operative systems and databases, instantly reporting operative failures to the technicians. the use of webtone continuumâ¢ guarantees the continuity of the service to the subscribed clients, even in case of major failures: file servers, application servers and synchronic database servers self-replicate in real time in order to eliminate the effects and consequences of a physical failure.

one of the services of outsourcing is the complete set up of the systems structure. one project leader is responsible for all the stages in the implementation of a project.

â¢ set up of the preproduction technical environment.
â¢ installation of the preproduction server.
â¢ installation of the production server.

without affecting the structure, zarcromâs experienced technological surveillance cell is constantly detecting internetâs future technological orientations and the latest innovations regarding hosting, and adopting the most relevant solutions after thorough tests. in 2007 zarcrom adopted the massive parallel server technology sun microsystems and solaris 10.

in 2008, zarcrom adopted a promising technology , a database and server side programming language able to replace php+mysql, or .net + ms sql.. much faster than the formers, it is also much easier to work with, a single syntax being used by the scripts and the bases. webdna is oriented to exploit the new ssd disks generation, and it will no doubtly takes its place as one of the top server side scripting languages with php, asp, .net, coldfusion, lasso or ruby. webdna databases are not only ultrafast, but uses an universal format compatible with any previous format

the quality of sun equipment is far ahead from other servers and provides exceptionally long lasting services that rarely present failures. associated with webdna technology, the result is definitely a winner combo.

customized solutions
with over 20 years of experience in the area of web site hosting (since 1995 in the u.s), zarcrom acts at the moment as a reference for french web hosting and one of the oldest in the world. the constant presence of very experienced staff provides completely reliable technical solutions, and guarantees peace of mind and trust to all our clients. through the years, technological evolution is offered to those clients who want it, without meaning an increase in costs.


the small number of calls for technical support is the best evidence of the good performance of the services, and that they correspond with the clientsâ expectations. the responses and solutions, appropriate and professional, are in general provided in few minutes, at any time, day or night, any time of the year. it is also this capacity for immediate reaction that has built a reputation for zarcrom.

all this is possible due to a perfect knowledge of the techniques used and the availability of competent and multilingual staff (french, english, spanish) in three continents, to ensure constant support to the user. the on-line support system, simple and fast, is one of the quality foundations of the support service offered to zarcromâs clients.

all these features, together with its lengthy experience, allow zarcrom to have a privileged vision of the marketâs potential and the needs of the companies.

adaptability
the parallel arrangement of web servers, applications and data servers, through the simple addition of machines, allows responding in a sustained way to a fast upload request. since we use quasi-synchronous load delivery methods, a service interruption related to a failure in the server would be completely invisible to the user. the methods used are multiple and depend on the service requested: it can be a site that must be kept on-line with an availability index over 99.99%, company e-mail with zero tolerance to failure, an internal management system with intranet access where each service interruption implies extra costs, or an advertising campaign that multiplies 10 or 100 times the requests over a system. zarcrom can be flexible and adapt adding the servers required.

this flexibility is a service that helps the client company avoid one-time-investments in a material that will no longer be of use after the specific event, and offers the addition of future investments to their specific needs, and as a consequence, a strong cost reduction.

security
zarcrom is a web site hosting company created in the united states in 1995, at a time when internet was still looked upon with skepticism and mistrust, and when french access suppliers where not as well known as today. zarcrom was one of the pioneers in providing internet site hostings.

looking ahead, beyond trends, and showing off great lucidity, zarcrom anticipated the marketâs evolution when it proposed live streaming in 1996, dedicated servers in 1997 and a feasible and profitable quality policy, while the internet bubble burst in 2000 and many of our competitors disappeared.

as a consequence of its traditional solid kind of management, the zarcrom group has the freedom to work with private capital and reinvest a considerable percentage of the earnings in the constant improvement of services and technologies.

zarcrom has deliberately kept apart from low cost hostings that boast incredible band widths without mentioning they are referring to their internal network, or who set limits to the size or number of simultaneous connections in the database servers. zarcrom personalizes each and every service, and aims at clients who consider the quality of their hosting as the key to the success of their presence on the internet

commitments
you will not find in the zarcrom sites those long charts with dozens of criteria comparing different standard products, as it is customary among massive providers.â 
in fact, zarcromâs offer is not aimed at the massive public, but at organizations and companies to whom their presence on the internet is not just a bundle of functionalities in the shape of âpackagesâ.

zarcrom does not wish sell solutions that may be oversold or underrated in relation to the needs of the clients who have trusted us.
through conversations and precise written exchanges, zarcromâs teams validate the exact nature of the needs expressed by the client, and propose only the technical solutions that adapt perfectly to such needs.
besides, zarcromâs flexibility policy allows for a quick improvement of the solutions implemented, thus constantly adapting to the activity profile of the client.

basic services, like ajax support, ruby-on-rails support, webdna support, java support, .net support, .flv streaming etc.... are available for all customers.

zarcromâs clientsâ portfolio includes several of the most well known french companies in mobile phone and telecommunication services, which have deposited their trust on us. among them are the french ministry of overseas territories, the government of new caledonia, eurodisney and the french social security, as well as south american oil companies, and major laboratories such as astrazeneca and many societies of engineering information services, ssii.

zarcrom is present in major events in several continents, such as the famous angoulãªme international comics festival or the los ãngeles e3 dedicated to video games.

all these clients have particularly high requirements of bandwidth and availability, and zarcrom has always stood out in these fields.
