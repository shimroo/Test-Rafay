forums like the e38 7-series, the e32 7-series, the e23 7-series, the e39 5-series, the e34 5-series, and the e28 5-series are among the most informative and active on the internet. and, you'll find exclusives like the navigation a/v and bluetooth forums that are packed with speciality information and experts to help you find the answers you need. stay as long as you like and come back often. careful, though -- this place can become addictive! don't be shy about posting new messages as there are no dumb questions here.
