kittykat1123the family i work for just got a bit bigger.  baby emma was born this morning!  they called around 4:30 this morning and i went and stayed with the boys while alice & gary went to the hospital... and man were they excited when they got up and found out that their baby sister was on the way.  gary had pictures to share when he got back this afternoon - and she is cute as a button!

kittykat1123finally have a new job, family with two boys, ages 5 and 2, and a baby girl due in the spring.  worked this week on a trial basis and got all the details worked out this afternoon. i had a great time with the boys this week.  i really think this is gonna be a great job.  its fewer hours: 8-4 m&w, 11:45-4:30 t&th, and 8-2 f.  the older boy goes to school 5 mornings a week and the younger goes 2 mornings.

kittykat1123i found out yesterday that the family i work for is moving in june.  to pittsburgh.  there has been a lot of problems with their practice and they are going to be working/teaching at a hospital in pittsburgh.  so the move is going to be a good thing for them.  but it seriously sucks for me.

atlanta trip


feb. 18th, 2009 at 11:08 pm



 


kittykat1123sam and i went down to atlanta on sunday and came back yesterday.  it was so much fun.  we went to the zoo, the aquarium, and the art museum. we also went out to dinner at the melting pot on monday which was quite fun.the zoo was totally cool.  they have giant pandas there.  they were too adorable.  this the youngest one, we watched him climbing around for quite awhile before he settled in for a nap.there were also plenty of other great animals to see, but i liked the pandas best of all. we went to the aquarium on monday, which was really cool, except for the fact that we didn't realize that there would be no school and that the place would be packed with people and their small children.  i had a few moments when i felt like i couldn't breathe but sam was really good at steering me out of tight spots.these guys were my favorite at the aquarium... of course i ended up with the song baby beluga running through my head for awhile... the museum had an exhibit on the first emperor of china's terracotta warriors.  they were absolutely amazing.  i have wanted to see them for a long time now and it was so cool that they happened to be at the museum while we were in town.  all around it was a great trip. sam spoils me.  plus i still have the rest of the week off.  i'm planning on doing some projects around the apartment.  maybe doing a little painting or a sewing project or two.  i've already fixed the sofa, it had developed a bit of a sinkhole in the middle.

kittykat1123the national weather service is taunting me with the s-word.  that's right, they have said that there might possibly be a slight, itsy-bitsy, teeny-tiny chance of snow.  so of course that means that everyone has to flip out and run to the store to by bread and milk.seriously people.  it is not gonna snow.

damn the car - or rather it's tires


oct. 3rd, 2008 at 12:58 pm



 


kittykat1123i went to get the oil changed in the subaru yesterday morning.  figured it would take half an hour or so and then i'd go meet mom for lunch.  well, it turned out that there was a nail in one of my tires.  so that meant i got to sit around while they tried to patch it... which didn't work... and then the tires that i wanted they didn't have there.  so they had to go get them before they could put them on the car.  luckily they offered to drive me home.  i had them take me to mom's office instead and we finally got to have lunch at about 3pm.  then i just hung out at her office reading the cnn website until it was time to go get the car.  they still weren't quite done when we got there so we had to sit and wait some more.  at least they had good coffee.also, i love my parents.  they bought me new tires.  because lord knows i would not have been able to pay for them.  so i got tires for christmas.  then i found out that mom had been planning on getting me a wii for christmas.  damn the tires.  grrr.
