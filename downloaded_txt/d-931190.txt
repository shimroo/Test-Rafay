the way uses gives back and the way they care about the community… i feel like i have another extended family with united south end settlements. my kids are getting everything they need from uses and they not only care about your kids but they care about the parents, too.

larry
uses parent
highly recommend uses. they go above and beyond in making sure the kids have the best care. they treat the kids like their own.

angie
uses parent
uses is caring. i love the way they engage with kids and parents. they’re also very supportive. if a kid likes science or art, i’ve seen teachers go all out with encouraging that passion and seeing the potential in that kid. they’ve been very supportive of my needs, too.
