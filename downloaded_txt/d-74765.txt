about sportshawaii.com
sportshawaii.com is literally a fan based sports page. we are not journalists, professional photographers or media personalities; we’re just fans who know a bit of html.
what started out as a few die hard fans talking sports online in 2002, has grown to a site that generates millions of pageviews annually, the majority of which are generated in the sports hawaii forums. this is where the sports hawaii ohana, or for people on the mainland, the sports hawaii family interact with each other and talk sports.
