flashback radio is dedicated to keeping the 80's music alive!  we strive to keep the hits, and the misses (one's that radio stations missed) playing into the 2020's and beyond.  tune in and see how our music library is fresh and can possibly introduce you to a new song to add to your music library.  our syndicated and original shows brings the music to life!  no boring song after song here.  we will continue to add links to the songs, albums, and artists so as you listen you can experience an added dimension to the songs!  flashback radio has been a labor of love since 2000 and no profits have ever been made.  all donated funds go back into the operation of the station.  we hope you enjoy the station as much as we love bringing it to you.
