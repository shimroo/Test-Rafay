welcome to iowa city boys baseball




iowa city boys baseball serves iowa city youth with an opportunity to learn baseball, teamwork and meet new friends. our league began in 1956 and started with 16 teams and only 2 bags of equipment. in 1960, howard and mary villhauer joined the organization. in 2019 mary officially "retired" from the league as our concession stand manager and secretary/treasurer. we cannot thank howard and mary enough for their life-long contributions to the great sport of baseball.today iowa city boys baseball plays on 8 diamonds in city park in iowa city and continues to work to improve the opportunities for our players, coaches and parents to enjoy youth baseball. we are steadily working with the city of   iowa city to improve our facilities and local businesses to keep icbb a great value.
