what a great fishing trip we had. sandy beach lodge never disappoints us. i would like to give a huge shout out to our god cary scott, the knowledge that he shared with us was incredible. he really knows his stuff, he explained why, what and where. and by the way his shore lunch potatoes are the best in the land. if anybody ever gets the chance to go, this is the guy you want.

it was the best fishing i’ve ever experienced in my entire life and i’m looking forward to going back every year to come.

our group has been going to sandy beach for years. the fishery is great! the walleye fishing has always been good. but for some reason the walleye numbers have seemed to explode the last few years. we were up in early august last year and couldn’t keep them off the hook. even when we would go for pike we were catching walleyes. if your looking for a remote fly-in fishing trip, i suggest contacting sandy beach lodge

for years we have been going to northern manitoba. 2017 we decided to give sandy beach lodge a try. we had just as good fishing as we did in manitoba and it was 1/2 the distance and 1/2 the price. we’re going back in august 2018.
