the design process was easy and the sales person was of great assistance,
i did have to wait a couple months as they were busy, but it was worth the wait, when the time came they did a great job, fast and clean.
the build quality is great, i am happy with my decision.santiagogreat quality and service!!valoriewe’ve purchased 5 sheds from lonestar structures. the last purchase we designed 2 different we studio sheds to match up to buildings we already have. they did call me while they were building it with a concern of a stain i chose and they advised me why a different product would be better- great! i want only what will last. such good customer support. they got everything right, even the delivery hour. i knew from the day i ordered it when it was going to be done and delivered. their driver makes sure the building is exactly where you want it, even if that means moving it over 2 inches. the construction is hands down the best in the area. our next purchase will be a pool shed or dog kennel.melissa i found this company on the internet without any knowledge of who they were prior to my search. i went online and spec’d out a building on their website, talked to them on the phone and placed an order a few days later. everything they said and did down to the delivery was what they said. building is perfect for our needs and looks great.james b.getting our cabin built and delivered to winchester texas was a very easy job for me. i designed the outside online, submitted it for a quote, then did a horrible drawing of the inside, i am not an artist, and they took it and ran with it. i gave my ideas on what i wanted and worked with cynthia thru e-mail the majority of the time and it turned out 99% of what we wanted. just a little miscommunication on a couple of things, but, that could have been solved if i would have picked up a phone. all in all they were very easy to deal with and the delivery of the cabin to our property went smooth! my husband was completely impressed with the driver that delivered it and dropped it. he said he did an outstanding job.
