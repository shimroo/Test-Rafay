on the summer solstice in 1984, in a small college town in southeast ohio, a bunch of fictional characters (who thought they were real people) was released into the unsuspecting community…
(not everyone was pleased.)
the results? a low-budget ($750), controversial 15-part “soap opera” featuring original music, aerial stunt-flying, roof-top chases, underwater dream-sequences, car-chase scenes, kidnappings, psychics, a high-voltage execution scene, plus a sprinkling of sophomoric humor and (occasional) bad taste.

well, most people were having a good time. i guess some peoplejust didn’t have a sense of humor. — scott gordon, the producer.
in 1989 — 5 years after the original production — the ohio arts council funded the production of a one-hour sequel. to get a feel for the scope and tone of the series, watch these opening-titles for “episode 214” — created from clips from the original series …
