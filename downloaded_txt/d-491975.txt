 hong kong in transition: a paradigm shift towards a green and sustainable finance center



				
            this research explores hong kong's economic downturn and the structural shifts in its financial market, questioning the feasibility of plans to integrate the city into a unified greater bay area (gba) and rejuvenate it as a global financial center (ifc). ). it argues that these changes have undermined the balance that once supported hong kong's role as an ifc, making the idea of reinvigorating its traditional financial strengths less viable.

 beyond sustainability in business: the case for regeneration along value chains



				
            how can businesses move beyond sustainability to actively regenerate the natural resources they depend on? as esade’s valentina de marchi explained at the 2024 esg summit europe in madrid, “businesses must regenerate the resources that have been stripped from the planet for profit.” this approach calls for companies to shift their focus from merely minimizing harm to repairing ecosystems and ensuring long-term viability.
