an * (asterisk) before an ace's name denotes those who died during ww2.
            an underlined * after an ace's name is a link to another web site with additional information.
            off-site links open in a new window.
            when the kill count is in question, i posted the highest - lowest numbers i am aware of and ordered them accordingly.
            some countries used different scoring methods. i try to post 
            whatever info i can find on the scores.
            this is an ongoing process and i appreciate all the help i can get (especially corrections .. and photos ;^)
update - i have been extremely busy for the last three years (freedom calls) and have had no time to answer emails.
              i don't see that changing any time soon but i will try to get a few minutes in here and there. if you want to use a pic,
              then link back to the page you got it or name the source and original source if possible. my email still works so if you
              want to send me info or photos, i will, at some point, add the info to the site. i love seeing it all and i will get to it.
              at this time however, duty calls. i'm sure the men remembered on this site would see it the same way and forgive me
              for putting their stories on hold for the time being. i believe what they fought for is at stake and if we do nothing we let
              every one of them down.
