colorado is a great state with adventures, activities, and stories around every corner.  tens of millions of people visit the state every year to participate in skiing, hiking, biking, rafting, festivals, concerts, or just to wander around the downtown shops in quaint little mountain towns.  most visitors have a favorite activity that leads them to visit during a particular season – be it skiers in the winter or hikers in the summer, but colorado has plenty offer every season.  obviously, winter has downhill skiing, but it also has other winter sports like snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling.  furthermore, at lower elevations, mountain biking continues as well as day hiking and other non-snow sports.
