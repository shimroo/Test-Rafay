meet
montrose

simply colorado


this beautiful western colorado community sits at an elevation of 5,794 feet and is nestled within easy reach of a remarkably vast selection of vacation experiences. thus the slogan “stay here. play everywhere.”
with the plummeting depths of the black canyon national park just to the east, the towering and majestic san juan mountains to the south, the expansive uncompahgre plateau to the west, lake-bejeweled grand mesa to the north, and an expansive water sports park right in the middle of town, montrose is literally surrounded by an endless variety of prospects for exploration and adventure.
shake off the road at the montrose rec center, the newest and largest recreational center on the western slope, featuring a 5,000 sq ft, fully equipped weight room and fitness center, indoor walk/jog track, cool-water lap pool with a slackline and drop slide, warm water leisure pool with a lazy river, playground, and zero-depth entry beach, and two-story slide, and so much more.
enjoy your visit to include as much variety as you wish. begin the day with a scenic drive or an exhilarating wilderness trek, throw in some cultural sites or a round of golf, and finish the day at one of our local restaurants or brewpubs (see special offers included in your bag).  families can keep downtime at bay by mixing in a little something for everyone – shopping, fishing, biking, photography, camping, swimming, motorsports – you get the idea!
