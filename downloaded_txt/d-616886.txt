st. david's episcopal church

welcome to st. david’s
st. david’s is home to a spiritual, joyful, and active group of children, teens, and adults, from toddlers to people in their 90s. a few of us grew up in the episcopal church; many come from different faith backgrounds. some of us are from kansas, while the rest are here for family or career. each of us is valued and has a role to play at our church.
as episcopalians, we believe in and follow the teachings of jesus christ, whose life, death, and resurrection saved the world.  we experience a loving, liberating, and life-giving god: father, son, and holy spirit. we work to love god and to love our neighbor through our worship, fellowship, education, and outreach.







we believe that god loves you — no exceptions 
the episcopal church embraces a legacy of inclusion, aspiring to tell and exemplify god’s love for every human being; people of all genders and sexual orientations serve as bishops, priests, and deacons in our church. laypeople and clergy work together in leadership and governance.
come and connect with god and find more meaning and purpose in your life. we’d love to meet you!







our vision
with god’s help, we strive to share the good news that a relationship with god is life-changing, ever joyful, and beautiful.  we do this by working to love god, our neighbors, and ourselves.
