sloan trigg / richton, mississippi wrote in motorhome magazine:
thanks for your recommendations on improving the ride and handling of my 2010 allegro open road. after weighing the coach and checking michelin's load-inflation charts, i was able to lower front tire pressure by 10 psi and rear by 5 psi, which helped improve the ride.
also thanks for suggesting eric's rv in sequim, washington. eric recommended the davis front track bar and roadmaster rear sway bar. adding those resulted in a big improvement in controlling sway in wind and traffic, and i no longer experience coach-body roll on curves. i highly recommend eric's rv, sequim, washington to all motorhome owners.
