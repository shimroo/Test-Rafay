amazing value for a full day tour all over scotland
“honestly the best £57 i’ve ever spent. was such amazing value compared to the other tours i had looked at.
i had a day on my own in edinburgh and decided i should go and see the harry potter bridge but we saw so much more! didn’t realise we covered so much of scotland in one day and took so many great photos. alan was amazing - he gave us a constant commentary all day and he really seemed to enjoy his job. i was a bit worried i might be bored of the long drives or there would be a lack of stops but it was such a jam packed day and plenty of toilet and snack breaks
stopped for some whisky ice cream and a mulled wine on the way home which completed a fab day. will definitely be coming back with my boyfriend and hopefully do some more timberbush tours - would recommend if you have any spare time in scotland!”
