important!
dear hiker,
we are trying to take care of our mountains, and therefore we mark only a few of the paths in order to reduce wear and tear in our vulnerable countryside. we would 
be very grateful for your assistance here in repairing cairns and laying stones in the marshy or wet parts of the trails.  
please be careful when in the mountains. there will always be steep areas in the near vicinity. remember to take a proper hiker's map with you, together with good 
clothing and footwear, and sufficient food.
some routes are cairned. make sure someone knows where you are going! rambling trails starting from sørvågen begin on the main road, approx. 150 metres south 
of the school.

assistance here in repairing cairns and laying stones in the marshy

please be careful when in the mountains. there will always be steep 
areas in the near vicinity. remember to take a proper hiker's map 
with you, together with good clothing and footwear, and sufficient 
food.
some routes are cairned. make sure someone knows where you are 
going! rambling trails starting from sørvågen begin on the main 
road, approx. 150 metres south of the school.

culinary adventures in lofoten
lofoten’s natural resources have formed our way of life and local culinary traditions. a visit to lofoten will not be complete without tasting the exciting fare that lofoten has to 
offer, both summer and winter.

in the summer you can try, for instance, salmon, saithe (coley), whalemeat or fresh 
prawns. you can either get these at a local restaurant or buy them at a local fish shop.

red onions, pine nuts and sour cream.
n fresh prawns are available at local fish shops and frozen ones can be bought from 
foodstores
n smoked salmon is a norwegian speciality that can be served in a number of different 
ways. 
n saithe is very popular in lofoten, served boiled or fried
n halibut and redfish are also delicious fish. smoked halibut is renowned for its mouth-
watering taste
n there are lots of blueberries, cowberries (mountain cranberry) and cloudberries in the 
lofoten mountains. these are often used in a number of different desserts.
winter
the lofoten fishery is the world’s greatest cod fishery. it takes place from january to april and has always been then basis for human settlement in the archipelago. every year, the 
cod come down from the barents sea to spawn along the north norwegian coast, particularly in lofoten where spawning conditions are ideal.
n stockfish is a unique natural product and lofoten is one of the few places in the world where it is possible to produce it. the fish is gutted and hung out to dry in pairs on the 
innumerable fish racks found in lofoten. the aroma of dried cod spreads across the entire archipelago, and they say "you can smell money" when the stockfish is on the racks. most 
of it is exported to italy.

varieties. you can try this dish at most restaurants in lofoten.
n "boknafisk" is fish taken down from the drying racks before it is compltetely dried.
lofoten lamb is known all over norway for its excellent quality. it has less fat and is meatier and more tender than lamb found elsewhere in the country. it also has a slight flavour 
of wild game. local restaurants serve roast lamb, lamb chops, or lamb stew all year round.

safety at sea and in the mountains 
safety in the mountains:
the weather in lofoten is extremely changeable and you should bring wind and rain resistant clothing along both summer and winter. a woollen hat, gloves and 
a scarf may also be necessary during the summer. solid footwear is also essential, preferably with a good grip. periodic rain and mist may often lead to slippery 
conditions and poor visibility. you should not venture into unknown territory without a good hiker's map. these are on sale at the tourist office and in shops and 
kiosks.
common sense in the mountains
1.
do not set out on a long hike if you are not in good physical shape.
2.
tell somebody where you are going and when you expect to be back. 
3.
pay attention to the weather forecast. 
4.
listen to advice from experienced hikers. 
5.
be prepared for bad weather. always take the necessary equipment with you. 
6.
remember to take a map and compass. 
7.
do not go alone. 
8.
if in doubt, turn back in time. 
9.
conserve your energy. dig a snow shelter if  necessary during the winter. 
safety at sea:
the weather in lofoten is extremely changeable, so you should not set out on long trips in small boats, even if the weather is fine. shorter trips near the shore 
are recommended. do not rely blindly on outboards and other technical aids (e.g. cell phones). bring wind and rain resistant clothing along both summer and 
winter. a woollen hat, gloves and a scarf may be necessary even during the summer. solid footwear is also essential, preferably with a good grip. periodic rain 
and mist may often lead to poor visibility, so be sure to take a map along. the maelstrom (one of the strongest tidal currents in the world) and surrounding 
waters are very unpredictable and can be perilous for small boats.
common sense at sea
1.
use only approved boats. ensure that the boat and motor work properly, and that you 
are familiar with the use of all equipment on board. make sure the necessary gear is 
onboard like bailer, oars, oarlocks, rope, anchor, lantern and life vests.
2.
heed the weather and weather forecasts. use the boat only in waters that it is 
intended for. the  maelstrom and surrounding waters should be  avoided by those in 
smaller vessels.
3.
make sure you have enough life vests on board for everyone
4.
show consideration for others and for the environment. take your litter home with you.
5.
be rested and sober when sailing a boat
6.
tell somebody where you are going and how long you expect to be away. take a map 
and a compass with you.
7.
sit still in small boats. when changing places, make sure only one person gets up at once. wear footwear with rubber soles.
8.
be careful with sources of heat in motor boats and make sure you have the appropriate extinguisher on board – and learn to use it.
9.
stay near the boat if it overturns and shout for help.
10.
follow the rules of the sea, and remember to give way in time.
11.
comply with speed limits. reduce speed in the 
harbour.

fishing boat trips


information and booking
all reservations should be made to the boat/company in question. book the day before or by 10.30 at the latest on the day of the trip. all trips subject to 
weather conditions and a minimum number of participants. 
the boats
 all vessels are equipped with the most modern equipment and instruments available for boats of this size.
when on board:
you should wear sensible clothing. even when ashore it may be cold and windy at sea. wear good rain and windproof clothing and footwear. there is a 
heated cabin and a toilet on all vessels. bring food and drink. passengers travel at their own risk, but all vessels have complete passenger insurance 
coverage and have all the required safety equipment. 
"fisherman for a day"
all year round on request.
feel the wooden deck beneath your feet on board an authentic fishing vessel on the vestfjord. the fishermen 
of lofoten take you to where the fish are, and provide you with an insight into their every day life. we fish with 
hand lines. haul cod, haddock and coley, wolf fish and tusk over the gunwale. if the weather is fine, and luck is 
on our side, we might see eagles, cormorants, seals, and maybe even whales. the trips take place in exciting 
waters with tidal currents and open sea. from the boat, you can see abandoned settlements and fishing 
villages. the “carina”, is a 34 foot fishing (long-lines and hand-lines) and touring boat stationed in reine. the 
vessel is equipped with the most modern equipment and instruments available to boats of this size. remember 
to wear sensible clothing. even when ashore it may be cold and windy at sea. wear good rain and windproof 
clothing and footwear. there is a heated cabin and a toilet on board. bring food and drink. passengers travel at 
their own risk, but all vessels have complete passenger insurance coverage and have all the required safety 
equipment. the fishermen of moskenes wish you welcome aboard – to take part in the every day life of the 
fishermen of lofoten.
 
seasick?
seasickness can be both avoided and cured. if you are seasick, or are uncertain about it, you should buy 
seasickness tablets or a seasickness plaster from the chemist's. some say a teaspoonful of ginger helps. 
chewing crispbread or biscuits can help against queasiness. stay in the right place on board: midships, near 
the water line or just aft of midships. there is least movement here. take plenty of clothing with you so that you 
can stay on deck. fresh air helps. being sick once, eases the queasiness.
good luck!
preparing fish and liver in the lofoten way
freshly simmered fish (cod,coley,etc.)
gut the fish and rinse its belly. add 2-3 dessert spoons of salt and one dessert spoon of vinegar for every liter 
of water. cut the fish into slices just under one inch thick, and put them into the boiling water. bring to the boil 
again. remove from the heat and allow the fish to simmer for about 10 minutes.
preparing the liver: peel off the skin and nip the liver into small pieces whilst pulling it off the sinewy threads. 
add pepper to taste and chopped onion. bring the liver to the boil in the water from the fish. stop the boiling by 
adding cold water, repeat this three times. let it simmer for 10 minutes. garnish with raw onion.
bon appetitt!

adventure trips:
through lofoten's nature and culture 
maelstrom - coastal caves - seabird colonies
troll-like mountain formations, deep fjords and abandoned settlements
the fjord ferry 
the outermost of the lofoten islands are characterized by bewitching 
mountain formations, strong tidal currents, and deep fjords and coastal caves. 
since time immemorial, man has utilized the abundant natural resources on 
land and in the sea. for a thousand years, the natural environment and 
settlement here formed the basis of norwegian prosperity and exports. on the 
boat trips mentioned below, we study this fascinating natural environment and 
culture, both past and present. 
nb: don´t forget to bring good, waterproof footwear, warm rain and windproof 
clothing, a scarf and hat, and a packed lunch.
information and booking:
to make reservations, please contact the respective boats/companies directly or the 
tourist office. 
on board the vessels:
you should dress sensibly when going on a boat trip. even if it is warm on land, 
it may be cold and windy at sea. it's a good idea to wear woollen clothing and 
to bring along wind and rainproof clothing. warm footwear is also 
recommended. bring food and drink with you, if you catch anything, you may 
be able to taste fresh fish on board. those taking part do so at their own risk, 
but all vessels are covered by passenger insurance and are equipped with the 
mandatory safety gear. you will find the program on this website. reservations 
must be made by calling tel. 76 09 15 99. payment for trip 1 must be made at 
the norwegian fishing village museum, å, payment for trip 2 is to be made on 
board the vessel.
seasick?
seasickness can be both avoided and cured, but passengers on rafting vessels 
are seldom sick. if you think you might be seasick, or are uncertain about it, 
you should buy seasickness tablets or a seasickness plaster from the chemist's.
daily roundtrips on the scheduled fjord ferry "fjordskyss" in reinefjord
all year round 
tel. (+47) 99 49 18 05
scheduled roundtrip (no guide) in one of the norway’s most beautiful fjords. sheer mountains, waterfalls and tiny farming hamlets. among distinctive 
mountains you will see hermanndalstinden - the second highest mountain in lofoten (1029 m), helvetestinden, spisstinden, bispelua, seiltinden and 
olstinden. you can also go ashore and spend some time exploring one of the tiny hamlets of rostad, kjerkefjorden or vinstad. several of these places are 
good starting points for country hikes, like vinstad to bunes, kjerkefjorden to horseid or selfjord, and forsfjord to munkebu cabin or sørvågen (see also 
mountain rambling). 
booking: tel. (+47) 99 49 18 05
midnight sun tour by boat - reinefjord
may 27 – july 15 (on request, min. 5 full fares)
leaving from reine we sail into the reinefjord where you can go ashore at 
vinstad and proceed on foot to bunes with its fabulous white, sandy beach 
overlooking the norwegian sea and the midnight sun to the north. 
refsvikhula cave and 3000 year old cave paintings
we leave from reine calling also at moskenes, sørvågen and å. we sail along 
the coast to the abandoned hamlet of ånstad and tuv through the maelstrom 
to the lofotodden headland and reivika. we pass through the reisundet strait 
and on to the far side of the island and the abandoned fishing village of hell. 
after a trip out to the seal colony, we go ashore near the abandoned 
settlement of refsvika, from where we walk to the refsvikhula cave 
(kollhellaren), a gigantic “natural cathedral” 115m deep and with over 50 
metres of headroom. inside the cave, mystical human figures have been found 
painted on the walls of the cave by stone age people over 3000 years ago. in 
the summer, the midnight sun shines directly into the cave creating a magical 
atmosphere. a guide will accompany you all the way and there will be a break 
for a bite to eat on the way. participants should be capable of hiking a fair 
distance. the cave is a listed area and visits without authorized personnel are 
prohibited.enquire at the tourist information centre.
sea safari on a rib boat – the maelstrom
we leave from reine calling also at moskenes, sørvågen and å. travelling west 
we encounter the infamous “maelstrom,” one of the world’s strongest tidal 
currents. the maelstrom was first described by pytheas the greek over 2000 
years ago and has since been described and marked on innumerable sea charts 
together with terrifying illustrations and warnings. the maelstrom is abundant 
in fish and has as such formed the basis of settlement for thousands of years. 
we test the forces of nature and if we are lucky we may see eagles, 
cormorants, seals and perhaps even whales. 
don’t forget: warm clothing. enquire at the tourist information centre.
snorkelling 
join us on a trip to lofoten’s fantastic underwater world. the sunshine brings 
out the amazing colours that the underwater landscape has to offer. calm and 
peaceful movement through the kelp will make you feel at one with nature. 
crabs, hermit crabs, starfish and snails live their busy lives down there as the 
fish lie there like a blanket above the kelp. enquire at the tourist information 
centre.
diving 
fantastic natural surroundings, striking mountain ridges, wrecks and tunnels 
are just some of the things you can experience under water in the land of the 
midnight sun. floating weightlessly like an eagle above the coral seabed adds 
the finishing touch to the adventures that will make your stay in lofoten a 
perfect one. diving and snorkelling can be combined. enquire at the tourist 
information centre
biking
lofoten is a fantastic destination for cyclists. cycling offers the freedom and 
time to take a closer look at life in a vibrant fishing village, and to enjoy wild 
and wonderful countryside. breathe in the smell of the sea and hear the 
seagulls cry as you roll slowly by. if you decide to go on a midnight sun ride, 
you will be cycling almost all alone, in complete peace and quiet. guided 
cycling tours are also possible. history and a little exercise have never hurt 
anyone. have a great ride!
booking / rental: enquire at the tourist information centre.
kayaking 
if you are wondering what it is like to paddle in heaven, you should try 
kayaking here. we have fjords and beaches that can take the breath away 
from any of us, whether you want 3 hours on the fjord or a 4 day trip round 
the island of moskenesøya. you can experience nature at close quarters here, 
and an abundance of animal life as you glide through the water. with a kayak 
you can access tiny coves and fjords, and paddle between old wharves and 
boats without any trouble. it is not without reason that lofoten has been voted one of the world’s best kayak destinations.

lofoten islands 


adventure trips:
through lofoten's nature and 
culture 
maelstrom - coastal caves - seabird 
colonies
troll-like mountain formations, deep 
fjords and abandoned settlements
the fjord ferry 
the outermost of the lofoten islands are characterized by bewitching 
mountain formations, strong tidal currents, and deep fjords and 
coastal caves. since time immemorial, man has utilized the abundant 
natural resources on land and in the sea. for a thousand years, the 
natural environment and settlement here formed the basis of 
norwegian prosperity and exports. on the boat trips mentioned below, 
we study this fascinating natural environment and culture, both past 
and present. 
nb: don´t forget to bring good, waterproof footwear, warm rain and 
windproof clothing, a scarf and hat, and a packed lunch.
information and booking:
to make reservations, please contact the respective boats/companies directly or 
the tourist office. 
on board the vessels:
you should dress sensibly when going on a boat trip. even if it is warm 
on land, it may be cold and windy at sea. it's a good idea to wear 
woollen clothing and to bring along wind and rainproof clothing. warm 
footwear is also recommended. bring food and drink with you, if you 
catch anything, you may be able to taste fresh fish on board. those 
taking part do so at their own risk, but all vessels are covered by 
passenger insurance and are equipped with the mandatory safety gear. 
you will find the program on this website. reservations must be made 
by calling tel. 76 09 15 99. payment for trip 1 must be made at the 
norwegian fishing village museum, å, payment for trip 2 is to be made 
on board the vessel.
seasick?
seasickness can be both avoided and cured, but passengers on rafting 
vessels are seldom sick. if you think you might be seasick, or are 
uncertain about it, you should buy seasickness tablets or a seasickness 
plaster from the chemist's.
daily roundtrips on the scheduled fjord ferry "fjordskyss" in reinefjord
all year round 
tel. (+47) 99 49 18 05
scheduled roundtrip (no guide) in one of the norway’s most beautiful 
fjords. sheer mountains, waterfalls and tiny farming hamlets. among 
distinctive mountains you will see hermanndalstinden - the second 
highest mountain in lofoten (1029 m), helvetestinden, spisstinden, 
bispelua, seiltinden and olstinden. you can also go ashore and spend 
some time exploring one of the tiny hamlets of rostad, kjerkefjorden 
or vinstad. several of these places are good starting points for country 
hikes, like vinstad to bunes, kjerkefjorden to horseid or selfjord, and 
forsfjord to munkebu cabin or sørvågen (see also mountain rambling). 
booking: tel. (+47) 99 49 18 05
midnight sun tour by boat - reinefjord
may 27 – july 15 (on request, min. 5 full fares)
leaving from reine we sail into the reinefjord where you can go 
ashore at vinstad and proceed on foot to bunes with its fabulous 
white, sandy beach overlooking the norwegian sea and the midnight 
sun to the north. 
refsvikhula cave and 3000 year old cave paintings
we leave from reine calling also at moskenes, sørvågen and å. we sail 
along the coast to the abandoned hamlet of ånstad and tuv through 
the maelstrom to the lofotodden headland and reivika. we pass 
through the reisundet strait and on to the far side of the island and 
the abandoned fishing village of hell. after a trip out to the seal 
colony, we go ashore near the abandoned settlement of refsvika, from 
where we walk to the refsvikhula cave (kollhellaren), a gigantic 
“natural cathedral” 115m deep and with over 50 metres of headroom. 
inside the cave, mystical human figures have been found painted on 
the walls of the cave by stone age people over 3000 years ago. in the 
summer, the midnight sun shines directly into the cave creating a 
magical atmosphere. a guide will accompany you all the way and there 
will be a break for a bite to eat on the way. participants should be 
capable of hiking a fair distance. the cave is a listed area and visits 
without authorized personnel are prohibited.enquire at the tourist 
information centre.
sea safari on a rib boat – the maelstrom
we leave from reine calling also at moskenes, sørvågen and å. 
travelling west we encounter the infamous “maelstrom,” one of the 
world’s strongest tidal currents. the maelstrom was first described by 
pytheas the greek over 2000 years ago and has since been described 
and marked on innumerable sea charts together with terrifying 
illustrations and warnings. the maelstrom is abundant in fish and has 
as such formed the basis of settlement for thousands of years. we test 
the forces of nature and if we are lucky we may see eagles, 
cormorants, seals and perhaps even whales. 
don’t forget: warm clothing. enquire at the tourist information centre.
snorkelling 
join us on a trip to lofoten’s fantastic underwater world. the sunshine 
brings out the amazing colours that the underwater landscape has to 
offer. calm and peaceful movement through the kelp will make you 
feel at one with nature. crabs, hermit crabs, starfish and snails live 
their busy lives down there as the fish lie there like a blanket above 
the kelp. enquire at the tourist information centre.
diving 
fantastic natural surroundings, striking mountain ridges, wrecks and 
tunnels are just some of the things you can experience under water in 
the land of the midnight sun. floating weightlessly like an eagle above 
the coral seabed adds the finishing touch to the adventures that will 
make your stay in lofoten a perfect one. diving and snorkelling can be 
combined. enquire at the tourist information centre
biking
lofoten is a fantastic destination for cyclists. cycling offers the 
freedom and time to take a closer look at life in a vibrant fishing 
village, and to enjoy wild and wonderful countryside. breathe in the 
smell of the sea and hear the seagulls cry as you roll slowly by. if you 
decide to go on a midnight sun ride, you will be cycling almost all 
alone, in complete peace and quiet. guided cycling tours are also 
possible. history and a little exercise have never hurt anyone. have a 
great ride!
booking / rental: enquire at the tourist information centre.
kayaking 
if you are wondering what it is like to paddle in heaven, you should try 
kayaking here. we have fjords and beaches that can take the breath 
away from any of us, whether you want 3 hours on the fjord or a 4 day 
trip round the island of moskenesøya. you can experience nature at 
close quarters here, and an abundance of animal life as you glide 
through the water. with a kayak you can access tiny coves and fjords, 
and paddle between old wharves and boats without any trouble. it is 
not without reason that lofoten has been voted one of the world’s 
best kayak destinations.
nb: you should never paddle alone in these surroundings, make sure 
that you have the necessary safety equipment with you at all times. 
check the weather forecasts and talk to any locals who paddle in the 
area. remember, there are strong currents and a considerable 
difference between high and low tide. if you are a little in doubt, it is 
also possible to hire a guide or have your whole trip organised. no 
previous experience is necessary. to paddle on your own, you will need

the weather, climate and seasons


the weather can change quickly from calm and clear skies with sunshine or the northern lights, to 
strong gales with rain or snow. maximum temperatures may vary from +30 degrees c in june/july 
to -15 degrees in february, while the average temperatures for these months are from just over +12 
degrees to slightly below zero.
the period with the least precipitation is between april and june, while in october-december we 
have the most rain or snow.
daylight conditions vary greatly in colour and intensity depending on the season and the time of 
day.
the brightest northern lights in the northern hemisphere can be seen over lofoten during the 
period from september to april, while the midnight sun is visible from may 27 to july 15.
it is the gulf stream that determines our climate, and this in turn forms the basis for the cod's 
annual migration to lofoten, and thereby for human settlement along our coast.
the midnight sun
the midnight sun is visible from may 27 to july 15 from refsvika, bunes, horseid, mulstøa, 
fredvang, ramberg, flakstad, vikten, myrland and mountain tops.

lofoten  islands, norway

the borough of flakstad
 surface area: 180 km 
 population: c. 1300
 municipal centre: ramberg
the borough of moskenes 
 surface area: 117 km
 population: c. 1017
 municipal centre: reine


the islands of flakstadøy and moskenesøy are located in the untamed, western part of the lofoten islands. most of the inhabitants of flakstadøy live 
on the outer coast of the island, overlooking the norwegian sea. here, you will find long, chalk-white beaches and extensive agricultural areas. the 
islands are surrounded by strong tidal currents like the nappstaraumen and sundstraumen straits, and the infamous maelstrom.  
glaciers and other forces of nature have sculpted the island landscape, which is among the wildest and most interesting that norway can offer. traces 
of stone age settlement dating back over 5,500 years can be found on the islands. several old place names, such as moskenes, bear witness to early 
sami settlement.  
the inhabitants of moskenesøy live largely on the eastern side of the island, where the best harbour conditions are to be found. earlier, there was also 
settlement along the entire northern coast of the island - the so-called outer coast, but owing to poor harbour conditions and perilous waters, all of 
them have now been abandoned. nusfjord and å are particularly well-known for their old, well-preserved architectural environment.
the lofoten fishery, the fishing village and the rorbu cabin
abundant resources in the north
 when the great glaciers receded from our northern coastlines, the cod began its annual migration from the barents sea to spawn in the waters of 
lofoten. every winter for over 10,000 years, the coastal people have caught the tasty norwegian arctic cod, eating the fresh fish together with the 
liver and roes, or producing stockfish and cod liver oil - used for bartering and trading purposes.
lofoten was of central importance in this productive process. even before the year 1000 ad, substantial trade in fish had begun, and fishermen from 
other parts of the coast travelled to lofoten to take part in the annual lofoten cod fishery, which lasted from january to april. the fish was dried and 
taken home or sold to local merchants.
for several hundred years, fish produce from the north comprised up to 80% of the nation's total exports. in addition to this, large amounts of skins, 
furs, eider down and walrus tusks also came from the north.
the struggle for resources
 many a battle for the rights to these abundant natural resources was fought between kings and noblemen in the north and south. the most famous of 
these was the battle of stiklestad in 1030 ad, between the north norwegian king tore hund with his army of fishermen and farmers, and king olav the 
holy. the fishermen and farmers from north norway, trøndelag and the northern regions of the west country won that particular battle, but 
eventually lost the war over the abundant resources in the north. the royal power of southern norway took over control. in 1120, king eystein 
established north norway's first town in the lofoten islands and built a church and so-called rorbu cabins (accommodation for visiting fishermen). he 
was now able to control trade and taxation while at the same time making it possible for more visiting fishermen to take part in the lofoten fishery.
however, towards the end of the 1200's, the mighty hanseatic league of germany took over most of the trade with the lofoten islands and north 
norway from their offices in bergen. the local aristocracy lost all command of the resources and was soon to disappear. the people were left in a 
state of general poverty, while escalating exports led to an increase in the population of the north.
the lofoten fishermen lived a hard and perilous life. every year many of them were lost at sea in their tiny open boats. stories are told of great 
catastrophes where several hundred men were lost on the same day. and even among those who survived the toils of a stormy sea, the freezing cold 
would also take its toll. the fishermen often sat soaking wet in their boats in the frost and wind. when they came ashore, many of them had to sleep 
outdoors beneath the rocks, in caves or under their boats and sails. "... so the wretchedness that these poor people suffer for their daily bread is 
beyond description. i am quite sure that no-one on earth suffers so much for their meagre sustenance as do these poor, destitute people here in 
nordland," bailiff e.h. schønnebøl wrote in 1591.
free trade - economic growth and the reign of the squires
 for several hundred years, the northerners were forbidden to conduct local trade or to export their produce. after 1750, the hanseatic league and 
other trade monopolies lost their grip and free trade acts were passed. local commerce now became legal, and round about 1900, direct export from 
the fishing villages was also allowed. the local merchants, including squires langås of sund, dahl of nusfjord, ellingsen of å, sverdrup of reine and 
berg of svolvær were to become the first exporters.
after the napoleonic wars, when peace, the potato and the smallpox vaccine had led to a population explosion in southern norway, considerable 
migration to northern norway, including the lofoten islands, took place. in conjunction with freer trade and good fishing seasons, this was to form the 
basis for substantial economic growth here in the north. 
 in the early 1800's, the local merchants began to buy real estate in the fishing villages. these landlords, or squires, were given exclusive buying and 
selling rights, and under the lofoten act of 1816 they were also given "powers of inspection and ownership" over the seas and the fish. they 
determined the price of the fish they bought and of the wares they sold, and were represented on all major public committees and councils. "kings of 
the headland" - nessekonger - was the name given to these new, mighty men of the north.  
their "right of control" over the fishing was eventually diminished by the lofoten act of 1857 which paved the way for free seas, free fishing and 
public fisheries inspection.
the fisherman, the squire and the rorbu cabin
 the word "rorbu" is derived from the norwegian words "ror" (rowing a fishing boat) and "bu" (to live or stay); i.e. the accommodations in the fishing 
village where visiting fishermen lived while they were staying here to fish from their rowing boats. the first permanent accommodations in the fishing 
villages were probably turf huts. the oldest "rorbu" cabins consisted of a wooden room approx. 4 x 4 metres and a "hallway" or porch of the same 
width but often smaller. they had a fireplace and an earthen floor.  
the squires established themselves and grew more powerful throughout the 1800's. in order to bind the fishermen to their fishing stations and thereby 
ensure the supply of fish, this "new nobility" built a large amount of rorbu cabins. these cabins served a number of purposes. the fishermen made 
their food there, they ate and slept there, dried their clothes, baited long-lines and repaired their nets there. as soon as a boat arrived in the fishing 
village, the skipper had to pay a visit to the squire in order to secure a rorbu cabin.
a man from trøndelag who was not able to get a rorbu cabin, told that they hauled the great rowing boat ashore, turned it over and used it as a 
house.
the rent from rorbu cabins and other land dues comprised only a part of the squire's income. since he also conducted trade and fish processing, he 
found it only natural to regard these operations as one and the same. consequently, the fishermen who rented rorbu cabins were normally required to 
deliver their catch to the squire - at his price.
the strong position of the squire as rorbu owner, fish buyer and merchant was in some cases abused, and the fishermen often felt exploited and 
unfree. but even though the squires were intent on earning money, they were also socially aware, helping the resident fishermen's families and the 
visiting fishermen when they could. the fishermen and the squires had common interests: if the fishing went well, the squire also benefited. the 
squire supplied the fishermen with food and fishing gear, and often owned their boats, too.
technology and democracy - the end of the squires  
 most fishermen rowed in teams aboard the second largest of the nordland-type rowing boats - the åttring" - which had 5 compartments. by 1905, the 
first boats with motors and decks had appeared. the fishermen could now stay on board their vessels while still using the rorbu cabins as a place of 
work on land. at the same time, they began to organise themselves in fishermen's unions that worked together with new, radical political parties. the 
power of the fishermen increased, while that of the squires diminished.
 new legislation to the benefit of the fishermen and the fishing industry changed the balance of power. the raw fish sales act of 1936 relieved the 
squires and fish merchants of their right to determine fish prices. since 1938, prices have been set by the raw fish sales association, which is the 
fishermen's own sales organisation. the system of squires disappeared after the war in step with the development of democracy. 
 free trade, new technology and the development of democracy have turned north norway into a good place to live. however, over-fishing, tough 
competition over the fish resources and swift globalization pose a threat like never before. widespread mobilisation is necessary if the environment 
and settlements in the outlying districts are to be preserved.
"fishing village holidays, lofoten"
 environmental and sustainable tourism
we work to preserve our heritage
 - to care for our natural surroundings, our way of life - and our guests.
 we wish visitors an environmentally friendly fishing village holiday - and hope you will show consideration and support, also in the future - 
welcome to lofoten!
over the past few years, the fishing village realm of flakstad and moskenes has consolidated its position as one of the country's most stable and 
attractive destinations. tourism has reinforced local enterprise and restrained the effects of an extensive national centralization process.
 we hope that tourism in our region may be used as a tool for maintaining settlement, our way of life, our culture and our countryside. our 
environment is attractive, but vulnerable. therefore, it is also crucial that use of our cultural, natural and human resources is environmentally 
friendly and sustainable.
ecology and economy  - an important relationship
 in conservation work we must distinguish between, on the one hand, the centrally controlled and industrialised use of the environment - within the 
fisheries, hunting and tourism and, on the other hand, the local population's traditional use of local, renewable resources .
if the resources disappear, the local inhabitants have little or no chance of investing in new enterprise elsewhere in the world. their capital - 
production plants, houses and boats will then be of little or no value, and their self-respect and identity will be lost.
here we see a connection between ecology, economy and identity that should be given a major role in the future conservation of natural and 
environmental resources.
maintaining vital, decentralized human settlement will prove to be the best means of conservation - because the local user, on the basis of his/her 
knowledge and long-standing traditions, will often be the best conservationist: if we are economically, socially and culturally dependent on a 
resource, we will find it easier to take on the role of guardian and protector of it. this applies to the coastal population's and the coastal fisherman's 
relationship to the fish resources, and the villagers' and tourist host's relationship to the surrounding environment - to that which the visitor pays to 
experience.
 in this way, decentralized settlement and local resource control contributes to the conservation of environmental attributes that both the fisheries 
and tourism are completely dependent on.
the struggle for fish resources has been going on for a long time. it started 1000 years ago, - concerning the right to export, and later process the fish 
- and it has continued over the past 50 years, with the right to catch the fish. today, major corporations with efficient ocean-going vessels are 
competing with the local fish companies and the coastal fishermen for the right to the fish.
fishing has always formed the basis of settlement here. the struggle for this resource will determine the continued existence of our small coastal 
communities. we ask visitors to help us take care of our settlements and our environment.

svolvær were to become the first exporters.
after the napoleonic wars, when peace, the potato 
and the smallpox vaccine had led to a population 
explosion in southern norway, considerable 
migration to northern norway, including the lofoten 
islands, took place. in conjunction with freer trade 
and good fishing seasons, this was to form the basis 
for substantial economic growth here in the north. 
 in the early 1800's, the local merchants began to 
buy real estate in the fishing villages. these 
landlords, or squires, were given exclusive buying 
and selling rights, and under the lofoten act of 1816 
they were also given "powers of inspection and 
ownership" over the seas and the fish. they 
determined the price of the fish they bought and of 
the wares they sold, and were represented on all 
major public committees and councils. "kings of the 
headland" - nessekonger - was the name given to 
these new, mighty men of the north.  
their "right of control" over the fishing was 
eventually diminished by the lofoten act of 1857 
which paved the way for free seas, free fishing and 
public fisheries inspection.
the fisherman, the squire and the rorbu cabin
 the word "rorbu" is derived from the norwegian 
words "ror" (rowing a fishing boat) and "bu" (to live 
or stay); i.e. the accommodations in the fishing 
village where visiting fishermen lived while they 
were staying here to fish from their rowing boats. 
the first permanent accommodations in the fishing 
villages were probably turf huts. the oldest "rorbu" 
cabins consisted of a wooden room approx. 4 x 4 
metres and a "hallway" or porch of the same width 
but often smaller. they had a fireplace and an 
earthen floor.  
the squires established themselves and grew more 
powerful throughout the 1800's. in order to bind the 
fishermen to their fishing stations and thereby 
ensure the supply of fish, this "new nobility" built a 
large amount of rorbu cabins. these cabins served a 
number of purposes. the fishermen made their food 
there, they ate and slept there, dried their clothes, 
baited long-lines and repaired their nets there. as 
soon as a boat arrived in the fishing village, the 
skipper had to pay a visit to the squire in order to 
secure a rorbu cabin.
a man from trøndelag who was not able to get a 
rorbu cabin, told that they hauled the great rowing 
boat ashore, turned it over and used it as a house.
the rent from rorbu cabins and other land dues 
comprised only a part of the squire's income. since 
he also conducted trade and fish processing, he 
found it only natural to regard these operations as 
one and the same. consequently, the fishermen who 
rented rorbu cabins were normally required to 
deliver their catch to the squire - at his price.
the strong position of the squire as rorbu owner, fish 
buyer and merchant was in some cases abused, and 
the fishermen often felt exploited and unfree. but 
even though the squires were intent on earning 
money, they were also socially aware, helping the 
resident fishermen's families and the visiting 
fishermen when they could. the fishermen and the 
squires had common interests: if the fishing went 
well, the squire also benefited. the squire supplied 
the fishermen with food and fishing gear, and often 
owned their boats, too.
technology and democracy - the end of the squires  
 most fishermen rowed in teams aboard the second 
largest of the nordland-type rowing boats - the 
åttring" - which had 5 compartments. by 1905, the 
first boats with motors and decks had appeared. the 
fishermen could now stay on board their vessels 
while still using the rorbu cabins as a place of work 
on land. at the same time, they began to organise 
themselves in fishermen's unions that worked 
together with new, radical political parties. the 
power of the fishermen increased, while that of the 
squires diminished.
 new legislation to the benefit of the fishermen and 
the fishing industry changed the balance of power. 
the raw fish sales act of 1936 relieved the squires 
and fish merchants of their right to determine fish 
prices. since 1938, prices have been set by the raw 
fish sales association, which is the fishermen's own 
sales organisation. the system of squires 
disappeared after the war in step with the 
development of democracy. 
 free trade, new technology and the development of 
democracy have turned north norway into a good 
place to live. however, over-fishing, tough 
competition over the fish resources and swift 
globalization pose a threat like never before. 
widespread mobilisation is necessary if the 
environment and settlements in the outlying districts 
are to be preserved.
"fishing village holidays, lofoten"
 environmental and sustainable tourism
we work to preserve our heritage
 - to care for our natural surroundings, our way of 
life - and our guests.
 we wish visitors an environmentally friendly 
fishing village holiday - and hope you will show 
consideration and support, also in the future - 
welcome to lofoten!
over the past few years, the fishing village realm of 
flakstad and moskenes has consolidated its position 
as one of the country's most stable and attractive 
destinations. tourism has reinforced local enterprise 
and restrained the effects of an extensive national 
centralization process.
 we hope that tourism in our region may be used as 
a tool for maintaining settlement, our way of life, 
our culture and our countryside. our environment is 
attractive, but vulnerable. therefore, it is also 
crucial that use of our cultural, natural and human 
resources is environmentally friendly and 
sustainable.
ecology and economy  - an important relationship
 in conservation work we must distinguish between, 
on the one hand, the centrally controlled and 
industrialised use of the environment - within the 
fisheries, hunting and tourism and, on the other 
hand, the local population's traditional use of local, 
renewable resources .
if the resources disappear, the local inhabitants have 
little or no chance of investing in new enterprise 
elsewhere in the world. their capital - production 
plants, houses and boats will then be of little or no 
value, and their self-respect and identity will be 
lost.
here we see a connection between ecology, 
economy and identity that should be given a major 
role in the future conservation of natural and 
environmental resources.
maintaining vital, decentralized human settlement 
will prove to be the best means of conservation - 
because the local user, on the basis of his/her 
knowledge and long-standing traditions, will often 
be the best conservationist: if we are economically, 
socially and culturally dependent on a resource, we 
will find it easier to take on the role of guardian and 
protector of it. this applies to the coastal 
population's and the coastal fisherman's relationship 
to the fish resources, and the villagers' and tourist 
host's relationship to the surrounding environment - 
to that which the visitor pays to experience.
 in this way, decentralized settlement and local 
resource control contributes to the conservation of 
environmental attributes that both the fisheries and 
tourism are completely dependent on.
the struggle for fish resources has been going on for 
a long time. it started 1000 years ago, - concerning 
the right to export, and later process the fish - and 
it has continued over the past 50 years, with the 
right to catch the fish. today, major corporations 
with efficient ocean-going vessels are competing 
with the local fish companies and the coastal 
fishermen for the right to the fish.
fishing has always formed the basis of settlement 
here. the struggle for this resource will determine 
the continued existence of our small coastal 
communities. we ask visitors to help us take care of 
our settlements and our environment.

welcome to lofoten
fresh air, amazing scenery, inspiration, joie de vivre - see, hear and feel. 
your senses will be sharpened in lofoten, mother nature will see to that!
sheer, jagged mountain peaks, with the sea at their feet, form a towering setting for the tiny, 
picturesque fishing villages. lofoten is renowned for its magnificent scenery and traditional 
fisheries culture, for the fishermen's "rorbu" cabins, the northern lights and the midnight sun. 
in lofoten, nature and culture form the framework of your holiday adventure. 
the weather, climate and seasons
accommodation
the cosy fishermen's cabins (norw. = rorbu) often stand one after the other on poles along 
the shore of the fishing villages. most of them have now been refurbished to accommodate 
holidaymakers, and can offer a high standard of comfort. the old, distinctive characteristics 
remain in tact, however, and the rorbu cabins can still tell their centuries old tales about the 
lofoten fishery. a number of other good overnight accommodation alternatives are also 
available, including quayside rooms (sjøhus), hotels, camp sites and youth hostels. there are 
enough beds at your disposal in the "realm of the fishing villages" to accommodate even 
the largest of parties and conferences. 
food and drink
cooking has become an art, and as everyone knows, art is multifarious! we are proud of the 
delicacies of the sea, so sit down at the table with an open mind. try unfamiliar species of 
fish, cod tongues, the semi-dried "hjellosing", or whatever - a culinary experience can add 
that extra something to a perfect day at sea or in the mountains, and there are many exciting 
restaurants to choose from in the area, offering a wide variety of menus. 
holiday adventures
the sea is a source of food and recreation in the fishing villages, and trips on boats of all 
sizes can provide some of the finest holiday activities you can take part in. in addition to 
rowing boat hire, a wide range of organised trips are arranged on fishing boats, rafting 
dinghies and other larger vessels. in this respect, "fiskebåtferie lofoten" is your quality 
guarantee. the abundant birdlife, including eagles and tumultuous seabird colonies, is an 
attraction in itself. among other attractions and activities we might mention several annual 
events like cultural festivals, quayside dances, fishing festivals, art exhibitions, etc. walks in 
breathtaking scenery, fishing in the many lakes and mountain climbing with fantastic 
panoramic views, are experiences that provide peace of mind and unforgettable memories.  
a wide range of interesting museums and galleries provide a closer insight into the history, art 
and culture of the islands. amongst others, you will find the fishing village museum 
(fiskeværsmuseet) and the stockfish museum (tørrfiskmuseet) in å, the telecom museum in 
sørvågen, the toy museum (leketøymuseet) at sakrisøy near reine, the fisheries museum 
and the blacksmith's (kunstsmia) in sund, lofotkunst / galleri "avkroken" in ramberg and 
the glassblower's cabin (glasshytta as) in vikten.
several activity providers offer, amongst other things, trips to the seabird colonies in værøy, 
the maelstrom, the refsvikhula and storbåthallaren caves. click here for details.

attractions and holiday adventures



lofoten  islands, norway 


maelstrom and coastal caves
the area around lofotodden point is characterized by a narrow coastline, steep mountain formations and the strong tidal currents that flow between the 
islands. the sea, the weather and the ice ages have formed deep fjords, craggy peaks and a number of awe-inspiring coastal caves.
 the maelstrom - one of the world's strongest tidal currents
between the islands of vestvågøy, flakstadøy, moskenesøy, mosken and værøy, we find strong tidal currents like the nappstraumen, sundstraumen and perhaps 
the most famous of them all, the maelstrom, known locally as moskstraumen.
the maelstrom (moskstraumen) and the waters to the west of the lofoten headland have been renowned and respected for thousands of years. first described 
2,000 years ago by the greek historian, pytheas, and later by such famous authors as petter dass, edgar allan poe and jules verne, it has also appeared on 
innumerable sea charts accompanied by terrifying illustrations and warnings. this stretch of water, abundant as it is with fish, has formed the basis for 
settlements for thousands of years. whether seen as an amazing natural phenomenon, or as a destination for a fishing trip, the maelstrom will provide you 
with an unforgettable experience.
adventure tours by boat to the refsvikhula cave, passing through the maelstrom. scheduled trips several times a week from may 1 to september 30. also 
available to groups during the off-season, by prior arrangement.
the refsvikhula cave - 3,000 year old cave paintings
a visit to the 50 metre tall and 115 metre deep refsvikhula cave is a journey into the mysticism of the past. this 
gigantic cave is awe-inspiring even to the hardiest of travellers, and the experience is emphasised by the enigmatic 
characters sketched on the walls of the cave by cavemen, over three thousand years ago.the figures were 
discovered in 1986 by archaeology students from the university of tromsø. 
 adventure tours by boat several times a week during the summer. also available to groups during the off-season, by 
prior arrangement. organised trips.
storbåthellaren cave - stone age settlement
the cave south of the village of napp consists of a mighty overhang, 70 metres deep and 22 metres tall. this is the 
oldest known stone age settlement in lofoten. inside the cave there are thick layers of waste left by the stone age 
people allowing us to read their 5500 year history.archaeologists found fishing tackle, spear and arrowheads, 
knives, axes, bone needles, potsherds and ceramics, etc. bone remnants bear witness to a fascinating and varied 
diet and include the remains of many species of fish and shellfish, 16 different animals and no less than 37 species 
of birds. human bones were also found.
fishing boat trips
a wooden deck beneath your feet on board a fishing smack on the vestfjord; hauling cod, haddock and coley, wolf 
fish or tusk over the gunwale - the green mountains of the lofoten wall in the background. the fishermen of 
flakstad and moskenes wish you welcome aboard for a taste of their every day life!
fisherman for a day. fishing trips from å and reine.
adventure tours by boat 
the maelstrom – coastal caves – cliffside nesting colonies – troll-like mountains and deep fjords
boat trips in the reinefjorden on the fjord ferry:
 - the reinefjorden – troll-like mountains and waterfalls (midnight sun).
 - the reienfjorden, daily round trips on the fjord ferry, no guides.
abandoned fishing hamlets and farms
these settlements, now largely inaccessible, tell us a great deal about life in the lofoten islands up until 60 years 
ago.
art and handicrafts
for centuries, the natural surroundings and distinnctive culture of lofoten have drawn artists to its shores to work 
and create. local artists, too, have been inspired by the rugged countryside and fantastic light. there are a number 
of stimulating artists and craftsmen in the region, including a glassblower and a ceramist in vikten, a silversmith in 
nusfjord, a textile artist and metalworker in ramberg, a blacksmith in sund and painters in sørvågen. a fascinating and colourful meeting with the creative 
artists of lofoten, a meeting that will leave its mark on you.
fascinating museums
a number of fascinating museums provide you with a good insight into the local history, from life in the fishing village and the lofoten fishery, to the 
production and sale of stockfish, a journey back to childhood with north norwegian and european children’s culture, the motorization of the fishing fleet over 
the past 100 years and cod and telecommunications – the reason why lofoten was to become such an important part of norwegian and european 
telecommunications history. 
mountain adventures
enjoy magnificent countryside in easy-going or more demanding terrain, 
everything from mountaineering with panoramic views, to fishing in fresh 
mountain lakes.we are proud of our mountains and we want to reduce the 
degree of wear and tear on our vulnerable countryside. we have therefore 
marked and cairned only selected paths and trails which we try to maintain 
by paving them with rocks at certain places. we urge you to follow these 
paths when walking in the mountains.
snorkelling
the sunshine brings out the amazing colours that the underwater landscape 
has to offer. calm and peaceful movement through the kelp will make you 
feel at one with nature. crabs, hermit crabs, starfish and snails live their 
busy lives down there as the fish lie there like a blanket above the kelp.
diving 
fantastic natural surroundings, striking mountain ridges, wrecks and tunnels 
are just some of the things you can experience under water in the land of the midnight sun. floating weightlessly like an eagle above the coral seabed adds 
the finishing touch to the adventures that will make your stay in lofoten a perfect one. 
biking
 lofoten is a fantastic destination for cyclists. cycling offers the freedom and time to take a closer look at life in a vibrant fishing village, and to enjoy wild 
and wonderful countryside. breathe in the smell of the sea and hear the seagulls cry as you roll slowly by. if you decide to go on a midnight sun ride, you will 
be cycling almost all alone, in complete peace and quiet. guided cycling tours are also possible. history and a little 
exercise have never hurt anyone. bikes available for hire at a number of locations in moskenes. have a great ride!
 
kayaking 
 if you are wondering what it is like to paddle in heaven, you should try kayaking here. we have fjords and beaches 
that can take anybody's breath away. you can experience nature at close quarters here, and an abundance of animal 
life as you glide through the water. with a kayak you can access tiny coves and fjords, and paddle between old wharves 
and boats without any trouble. it is not without reason that lofoten has been voted one of the world’s best kayak 
destinations.
 nb: you should never paddle alone in these surroundings. make sure that you have the necessary safety equipment 
with you at all times. check the weather forecasts and talk to any locals who paddle in the area. remember, there are 
strong currents and a considerable difference between high and low tide. if you are a little in doubt, it is also possible 
to hire a guide or have your whole trip organised. to paddle on your own, you should  have a "wet card" certificate.
mountain hikes
 moskenes offers scenic nature experiences in both easy and more demanding terrain in the surrounding mountains. 
join a local guide on the best mountain walks: amazing panoramic views from mount reinebringen, midnight sun trips 
to bunes, or a climb to lofoten’s second highest peak, hermannsdalstinden (1029 m asl). let our guides lead you to our 
culture, nature and geology.
duration: 4 – 6 hours price: from nok 250 (min 5 pers) children under 15: 50% discount 
 booking: audun rasmussen, tel. (+47) 93 49 26 20.
winter in lofoten
enjoy the atmosphere of the famous lofoten fishery and some magnificent winter scenery. adventure tours by boat include both fishing on the seas of lofoten 
and deep-sea rafting. try fresh, steaming cod, liver and roes and other tasty meals after an exciting day at sea. stay in comfortable maritime surroundings. 
and when you have had enough of the sea, there is some great skiing terrain here, with mountain cabins on both of the islands of flakstadøy and moskenesøy. 
the dark season, stormy weather, the mystical light of spring, the delicate flutter of the northern lights above the jagged peaks of lofoten: the fishing 
village realm is also the realm of winter holidays.
geology trails in vikten
among the geological phenomena in vikten, we find the rocks and boulders near the glassblower’s cabin, the local moraines, and a number of other items 
that may be observed when following the two interesting paths known as the morenestien and the tangrandstien.
events
including quayside dances, fishing festivals, art exhibitions, etc.
birdlife
birdlife  in the  lofoten  islands is varied and fascinating. over 140 species have been sighted in 
moskenes and flakstad, many of which are random visitors that occur due to the location and character 
of the islands. 
the weather, climate and seasons
warm, calm summer days, bright summer nights in the light of the midnight sun, north-easterly snow 
storms with katabatic winds, dead calm winter evenings with the northern lights dancing enigmatically 
across the night sky above snow-white lofoten mountains. lofoten offers you the entire spectrum of 
climatic conditions.

attractions and 
holiday adventures




lofoten islands 


maelstrom and coastal caves
the area around lofotodden point is characterized by a narrow 
coastline, steep mountain formations and the strong tidal currents 
that flow between the islands. the sea, the weather and the ice 
ages have formed deep fjords, craggy peaks and a number of awe-
inspiring coastal caves.
 the maelstrom - one of the world's strongest tidal currents
between the islands of vestvågøy, flakstadøy, moskenesøy, mosken 
and værøy, we find strong tidal currents like the nappstraumen, 
sundstraumen and perhaps the most famous of them all, the 
maelstrom, known locally as moskstraumen.
the maelstrom (moskstraumen) and the waters to the west of the 
lofoten headland have been renowned and respected for 
thousands of years. first described 2,000 years ago by the greek 
historian, pytheas, and later by such famous authors as petter 
dass, edgar allan poe and jules verne, it has also appeared on 
innumerable sea charts accompanied by terrifying illustrations and 
warnings. this stretch of water, abundant as it is with fish, has 
formed the basis for settlements for thousands of years. whether 
seen as an amazing natural phenomenon, or as a destination for a 
fishing trip, the maelstrom will provide you with an unforgettable 
experience.
adventure tours by boat to the refsvikhula cave, passing through 
the maelstrom. scheduled trips several times a week from may 1 to 
september 30. also available to groups during the off-season, by 
prior arrangement.
the refsvikhula cave - 3,000 year old cave paintings
a visit to the 50 metre tall and 115 metre deep refsvikhula cave is 
a journey into the mysticism of the past. this gigantic cave is awe-
inspiring even to the hardiest of travellers, and the experience is 
emphasised by the enigmatic characters sketched on the walls of 
the cave by cavemen, over three thousand years ago.the figures 
were discovered in 1986 by archaeology students from the 
university of tromsø. 
 adventure tours by boat several times a week during the summer. 
also available to groups during the off-season, by prior 
arrangement. organised trips.
storbåthellaren cave - stone age settlement
the cave south of the village of napp consists of a mighty 
overhang, 70 metres deep and 22 metres tall. this is the oldest 
known stone age settlement in lofoten. inside the cave there are 
thick layers of waste left by the stone age people allowing us to 
read their 5500 year history.archaeologists found fishing tackle, 
spear and arrowheads, knives, axes, bone needles, potsherds and 
ceramics, etc. bone remnants bear witness to a fascinating and 
varied diet and include the remains of many species of fish and 
shellfish, 16 different animals and no less than 37 species of birds. 
human bones were also found.
fishing boat trips
a wooden deck beneath your feet on board a fishing smack on the 
vestfjord; hauling cod, haddock and coley, wolf fish or tusk over 
the gunwale - the green mountains of the lofoten wall in the 
background. the fishermen of flakstad and moskenes wish you 
welcome aboard for a taste of their every day life!
fisherman for a day. fishing trips from å and reine.
adventure tours by boat 
the maelstrom – coastal caves – cliffside nesting colonies – troll-
like mountains and deep fjords
boat trips in the reinefjorden on the fjord ferry:
 - the reinefjorden – troll-like mountains and waterfalls (midnight 
sun).
 - the reienfjorden, daily round trips on the fjord ferry, no guides.
abandoned fishing hamlets and farms
these settlements, now largely inaccessible, tell us a great deal 
about life in the lofoten islands up until 60 years ago.
art and handicrafts
for centuries, the natural surroundings and distinnctive culture of 
lofoten have drawn artists to its shores to work and create. local 
artists, too, have been inspired by the rugged countryside and 
fantastic light. there are a number of stimulating artists and 
craftsmen in the region, including a glassblower and a ceramist in 
vikten, a silversmith in nusfjord, a textile artist and metalworker 
in ramberg, a blacksmith in sund and painters in sørvågen. a 
fascinating and colourful meeting with the creative artists of 
lofoten, a meeting that will leave its mark on you.

main theme: peat production, and the life and conditions of those involved
the idea of starting a peat museum demonstrating peat production, its history and life along the coast in bygone times, 
turned up for the first time in 1997.
in 1999-2000, an aerial cable was set up from the mountains down to what was to be the museum area. in 2003, the 
museum building was completed. equipment, photographs and other materials have been collected or borrowed from the 
local area.
the basic idea behind the museum is to create a farmyard whose main focus is on peat production, and the life and 
conditions of those involved. peat production is an important part of lofoten’s cultural heritage, and we believe it is very 
important to pass on knowledge about this particular aspect, too.
in addition to the museum building itself, we have relocated and re-erected an old smallholder’s cottage known as 
“albertstua.” we have also obtained a smaller house, a shed and another time-honoured residence which is intended for 
use as overnight accommodation.

how to get to the lofoten islands


the map at right is designed to help you decide which means of transport is most suitable to your 
needs when planning your journey to flakstad & moskenes in the lofoten islands. overseas 
travellers will most likely arrive in oslo or bergen - by air or by boat. from here, you have a 
number of options to choose from on your journey north.
if you click on the various means of transport below, you will receive further information about 
them. please note that the coastal voyage (hurtigruten) is not shown on the map. this is a 
coastal liner that operates daily departures from bergen to kirkenes and back, a journey of one 
week's duration. the vessels stop at stamsund in the lofoten islands, from where there are 
corresponding bus services to flakstad and moskenes.
it takes about 3 hours by air from oslo to lofoten, but you can, of course, travel by other means 
of transport like the coastal voyage (hurtigruten) as mentioned above, the train (approx 22 
hours), or by car, thus spending more time enjoying your journey. there are also express 
passenger boats from bodø and narvik to svolvær, from where there are daily bus services to 
flakstad & moskenes.
otherwise, the easiest way to get to flakstad & moskenes is to take the appropriate means of 
transport to bodø, and catch the  ferry from bodø to moskenes. it is also possible to fly from 
bodø to leknes (widerøe's) - 25 min. flight - and catch a bus from there. motorists may either 
catch the ferry over from bodø, or from skutvik in hamarøy to svolvær, from where they can 
drive the full length of the magnificent lofoten islands all the way to å.

how to get to the 
lofoten 
islands


lofoten islands 


the map at right is 
designed to help you 
decide which means of 
transport is most suitable 
to your needs when 
planning your journey to 
flakstad & moskenes in 
the lofoten islands. 
overseas travellers will 
most likely arrive in oslo 
or bergen - by air or by 
boat. from here, you have 
a 
number of options 
to choose from on 
your journey north.
if you click on the 
various means of 
transport below, you 
will receive further 
information about them. 
please note that the coastal 
voyage (hurtigruten) is not shown on the map. this is a coastal liner 
that operates daily departures from bergen to kirkenes and back, a 
journey of one week's duration. the vessels stop at stamsund in the 
lofoten islands, from where there are corresponding bus services to 
flakstad and moskenes.
it takes about 3 hours by air from oslo to lofoten, but you can, of 
course, travel by other means of transport like the coastal voyage 
(hurtigruten) as mentioned above, the train (approx 22 hours), or by 
car, thus spending more time enjoying your journey. there are also 
express passenger boats from bodø and narvik to svolvær, from 
where there are daily bus services to flakstad & moskenes.
otherwise, the easiest way to get to flakstad & moskenes is to take 
the appropriate means of transport to bodø, and catch the  ferry 
from bodø to moskenes. it is also possible to fly from bodø to leknes 
(widerøe's) - 25 min. flight - and catch a bus from there. motorists 
may either catch the ferry over from bodø, or from skutvik in 
hamarøy to svolvær, from where they can drive the full length of the 
magnificent lofoten islands all the way to å.

what's this ..?
... youll find the answer to this question, and lots more about culture and tradition in lofoten, 
at the lofoten stockfish museum, the only one of its kind in the world!
the museum provides an insight into the production of norway's oldest export commodity, 
stockfish, which was used in foreign trade as early as in the 800s. the museum also shows how 
work at a conventional fish landing station is carried out.
•
landing station for fish 
•
gutting shed with gutting bench, weights etc. 
•
production hall for fresh, salted and dried fish 
•
stockfish loft showing the sorting, bundling, and packing of stockfish/cod heads 
•
quality control - 16 categories of stockfish 
large, heated video room with non-stop 30 min. video (english subtitles) - covers everything 
from the catch, to delivery on the most important market: italy - plus a 5 min. video in various 
languages specially intended for groups. coffee and waffles in authentic maritime atmosphere.
you can also try tasting stockfish: lofotens own "snacks"
we take pride in offering professional guiding in norwegian, english, german, french and 
italian!


did you know that:
·
towards the end of april, an area of 
400,000 m2 of lofoten is covered 
in stockfish - cod hung out to dry 
on racks? 
·
16 mill. kgs of cod is hung out to 
dry on fish racks every year in 
lofoten? 
·
stockfish consists of approx. 80% 
protein? 
·
the weight of the cod is reduced by 
about 80% when it is dried? 
want to know more?
then come and see for yourself!
