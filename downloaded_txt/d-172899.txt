we are  proud to host both the internet's best
online gemological forum
and 
the gemology project: 
a wiki-style database for anyone interested in gemstones and gemology 
 
gemologyonline.com
 is an interactive gemmological
              resource dedicated to a
              better understanding of the
              relationship between man
              and gemstones! we
              explore not only the
              mineralogical aspects of
              gemstones but also their
              lore and legend. our
              main intent is to offer
              credible information. we
              will attempt to answer
any questions relating
              to gems and jewelry 
              that you may have.
