do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
the letters o.t.o. stand for ordo templi orientis, the order of oriental templars, or order of the temple of the east. o.t.o. is dedicated to the high purpose of securing the liberty of the individual and his or her advancement in light, wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and power through beauty, courage, and wit, on the foundation of universal brotherhood.
ordo templi orientis is the first of the great old æon orders to accept the book of the law, received by aleister crowley in 1904 ev. this book proclaims a new æon in human thought, culture and religion. the æon arises from a single supreme injunction: the law of thelema, which is do what thou wilt.
u.s. grand lodge is the governing body of o.t.o. in the united states. it is the most populous and active branch of o.t.o., with many local bodies spread throughout the country.
ordo templi orientis has two constituent rites, mysteria mystica maxima and ecclesia gnostica catholica.

mysteria mystica maxima (m∴m∴m∴) is the initiatory arm of o.t.o.
ecclesia gnostica catholica (e.g.c.), the gnostic catholic church, is the ecclesiastical arm of o.t.o. it confers sacraments including the eucharist of the gnostic mass, baptism, confirmation, and ordination.

many o.t.o. events are open to the public. those who wish to learn more about o.t.o. are encouraged to attend our public events. attendance at a celebration of the gnostic mass is a particularly good choice for newcomers, as it provides an excellent introduction to our symbolism and philosophy. contact a local body near you for more information.
if you are interested in becoming a member of ordo templi orientis, see the membership page for more information. our faq (pdf) answers many common questions about o.t.o. and thelema. if you need further assistance, please write to the webmaster at webmaster@oto-usa.org.
love is the law, love under will.
