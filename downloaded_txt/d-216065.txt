academics

learning is a cooperative venture at tandem friends; the intellectual curiosity of students is paired with an academically distinguished faculty. our strong college preparatory curriculum meets or exceeds admission requirements of all major institutions of higher learning. but there is a difference. learning at tandem friends is a dynamic process of questioning and dialogue. teachers invite a sense of authorship in their students. classroom discussions encourage active thinking, listening, and articulation. teachers constantly challenge students to realize their intellectual potential.

every school offers academic classes, dedicated teachers, classrooms and computers, sports fields, gyms and locker rooms. tandem friends is no different. what sets us apart is the amazing sense of community that exists between faculty and students, faculty and parents, faculty coworkers, and the school and our local community. you can feel it the minute you set foot on campus - a sense of caring kindness and connections to one another.

students spend conservation lobby day in richmond
seven upper school students recently participated in conservation lobby day sponsored by the virginia conservation network in richmond. junior will m, sophomores zeke l, jack j, jude g and nati y, and freshmen brendan s and sean t, with faculty mentors laura douglas and amanda nelsen, spent a very full day there. after breakfast at st. paul's church, they were joined by legislators sen. barbara favola, del. ellen campbell, del. katrina callsen, del. michael feggans and del. hilary pugh kent, who shared brief remarks. students attended in-person lobby meetings at the general assembly building, meeting with del. katrina callsen, del. amy laufer, and sen. creigh deeds. students were allowed to lobby these representatives on issues of importance to them, and to leave a list of their concerns as well. after lunch at st. paul's they heard from fellow advocates, as well as attended interesting presentations by state agencies. the day ended with a tour of both the virginia supreme court and the state capitol. it was very interesting to meet those who cast votes on the issues of import to these thoughtful and engaged tandem students.
