a midair collision between an army helicopter and an american airlines flight from kansas killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft. that was the word from authorities thursday as they scrutinized the actions of the military pilot after the country’s deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century. at least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the potomac river after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the jet late wednesday while it was landing at ronald reagan national airport near washington. the plane carried 60 passengers and four crew. three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.
