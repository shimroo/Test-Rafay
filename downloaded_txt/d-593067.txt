entertainment weekly and katy perry


jul. 26th, 2008 at 5:15 pm



 


aheartfulofyoui wrote to entertainment weekly about their katy perry "i kissed a girl" article. i was a little irritated that they didn't even mention the pro-lgbt people upset about the song, so this is what i sent them:i'm surprised your article on katy perry didn't mention why some people are "put off" by the content of her hit single, "i kissed a girl"-- the homophobic vibes, not the supposedly "scandalous" girl-kissing. ms. perry's been quoted in interviews saying she's never actually kissed a girl (so there goes one of her "oh, no!" life moments). more importantly, the music video for the song features women parading around, decked out in lingerie and male fantasy, without a real girl/girl kiss in sight. and of course, by the end of the video, katy wakes up, happily back in her heteronormative spot next to her sleeping boyfriend. thank goodness! we wouldn't want her to have a real non-heterosexual interaction! it's the same-old, same-old conservatism and homophobia, masquerading as scandal. katy perry may mean well, but her material pushes my buttons, and not because it's "unique" or "shocking".*crosses fingers that it'll get into the magazine after next in the reader's letters section*.funnily enough, too, my dad liked my the letter and got really excited about me sending angry stuff to magazines. i love that my dad's not a republican anymore. it makes my life that much happier.

nobody's talking about mccain's pastor


may. 31st, 2008 at 10:47 pm



 


aheartfulofyoueveryone's talking obama, and nobody's talking about the actually inappropriate (horrendous, in my book) comments mccain practically endorsed, by pastor john hagee.i was researching for my new orleans poetry series, and ran across this. i had no idea that comments blaming hurricane katrina on the "sins of the people of new orleans" were tied to john mccain far more clearly than the reverend's comments are tied to obama. nobody's talking about this:hagee: "all hurricanes are acts of god, because god controls the heavens. i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god, and they are-- were-- recipients of the judgment of god for that. the newspaper carried the story in our local area that was not carried nationally that there was to be a homosexual parade there on the monday that the katrina came. and the promise of that parade was that it was going to reach a level of sexuality never demonstrated before in any of the other gay pride parades. so i believe that the judgment of god is a very real thing. i know that there are people who demur from that, but i believe that the bible teaches that when you violate the law of god, that god brings punishment sometimes before the day of judgment. and i believe that the hurricane katrina was, in fact, the judgment of god against the city of new orleans."when confronted at the inappropriateness of his comments...hagee: "god controls hurricanes and god always punishes unconfessed sin."mccain's response? stephanopoulos: "so was it a mistake to solicit and accept [hagee's] endorsement?"mccain: "oh, probably, sure."stephanopoulos: "so you no longer want his endorsement?"mccain: "i'm glad to have his endorsement. i condemn remarks that are, in any way, viewed as anti-anything. and thanks for asking."that's far more glib than obama was about wright's comments. and wright's comments were far less devastating than the vicious stuff hagee is saying, and continues to say. it makes me sick that someone would say these things in the first place, and no one's talking about this on the news, just the over-hyped "controversy" of the things people from obama's old church are saying.with a very personal attachment to the city of new orleans, now, i'm really upset. not to mention the homophobia and racism brought across by the statements. for something of the opposite, and something a little inspirational to go along with all this, here's what a beautiful young woman said during superlove in new orleans, when she introduced herself. this shows what kind of people are actually in new orleans:"i am a 12-year-old katrina survivor, and i am a strong woman."i think all of us cried and cheered for her. we need more people like her in the world, and less people like hagee.
