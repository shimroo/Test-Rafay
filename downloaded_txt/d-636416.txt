what we do best
at go travel, we offer a wide arrangement of travel services from airfare and tours to luxury cruises and tailor-made vacations. here's a bit more about what we love to do!











customized tours   ---------
we are all different. we have different passions, interests and aspirations... especially when it comes to travel. to some, it's a full-day of sightseeing with an expert historian to some of the most culturally rich ruins and cathedrals in rome. to some, it's an afternoon of shopping in the high-end districts of paris followed by an evening of wining and dining along the champs-ãlysã©es. and to others, it's an immersive journey into china with a combination of touring the great wall in beijing, enjoying tea and dim sum with locals in hong kong, and exploring ancient chinaâs wonders aboard a scenic yangtze river cruise.
at go travel, we understand that every travel adventure is personal and excel at matching you with that "wow" experience that you are seeking. this is true for shore excursions during a cruise tour just as it is true for the longer journey. from customizing your schedule to working with our tour operators to curate your ultimate adventure, from mild to wild, we are here to create for you the vacation of your dreams.

corporate travel   ---------
business travel planning requires expert knowledge in the complexities of organizing seamless travel arrangements while adhering to company guidelines and policies. when traveling for business, that personal touch is indispensable. clients delaying a contract signing date... it happens. flights being cancelled due to poor weather... it happens. but having a knowledgeable agent continuously monitoring your itinerary and making the necessary changes before you know there is even an issue... simply a smart decision. let our team take all the worry out of your corporate travel. ideal for small to medium sized businesses, our dedicated agents can provide not only their specialized expertise, but also the benefit of go travel's global negotiating strength to offer your business the most competitive rates and most favorable amenities. with policy compliance and business travel cost being major priorities, we can provide your company with customized reports to streamline your company's travel spend analysis. at go travel, we are passionate about delivering personalized and unparalleled travel planning while simultaneously maximizing your travel cost savings.
