    the casel weissberg scholars program is the most meaningful honor of my professional life. i am excited that my colleagues and i will provide learning experiences and supports to early career scholars who will advance evidence-based practices and policies to improve the positive development and life opportunities of millions of young people.
  


dr. roger p. weissberg







    the first thing that i would suggest to any district is if you care about outcomes. you need to care about sel. it is the pathway to get the outcomes that we all desire.
  


assistant superintendent







    in partnership with our sel fellows, we can bring social and emotional learning to more communities nationwide so all young people receive the education they deserve.
  


karen van ausdal







    the truth is emotion drives attention and attention drives learning. our country needs social and emotional learning tools now more than ever.
  


timothy shriver, co-founder & board chair, casel







    our sel is strategically placed as a universal strategy to build resilience, cultivate protective factors, like strong relationships with peers and adults, and reduce stigma around mental health help-seeking.
  


dr. susan bunting
former state secretary of education
          






    the vast majority of teachers agree that they can’t teach their students effectively unless they also consider their sel needs.
  


laura hamilton, general manager of research centers, ets







    we need to address inequities in education and we need better pathways to success… [which requires recognizing that students’ social and emotional learning] is just as important as their academic growth.
  


miguel cardona
us secretary of education
          






    our young people already have greatness inside of them. sel creates the conditions for that greatness to shine.
  


byron sanders, president & ceo, big thought







    sel and academics cannot be separated, so when we ignore part, we build more gaps.
  


cassandra tesch, assistant principal, lincoln elementary school, oakland unified school district







    learning should be inherently joyous. it should be a joyous pursuit, enabling all students to have fun and find their passions. it's the purpose of learning.
  


dr. d’andre weaver, superintendent desoto independent school district







    students are more engaged and learning outcomes are much more equitable when every student has affirming developmental experiences, like psychological safety, caring relationships, personally relevant content, and a sense of personal agency.
  


dr. dave paunesku, executive director & co-founder, perts







    there was a time when our future in the district was uncertain. it was the community and it was the families and community partners who came forth and strongly advocated for sel to continue and to be part of the learning journey.
  


school district leader







    articulate the value and importance of social and emotional learning in every space. social-emotional learning is the pathway towards equity, access, and social justice.
  


school district leader







    for me leading and teaching through the lens of sel means supporting students to learn with and from each other and to take charge of their own learning.
  


tyler clark, lincoln elementary school, oakland unified school district







    if we really want all students to leave school having developed certain academic, social, personal, and cultural capacities, we need to think really carefully about whether we as educators are creating the types of experiences that we know from research will help develop those capacities.
  


dr. dave paunesku, perts







    i love having this community of people and access to [casel]. i don't know how i would have even dreamed of doing even the small pieces that i'm doing right now. i just really keep thinking as i'm going through this fellowship of how many other people there are like me out there.
  


sel fellows academy participant







    we often say that we can't jump over the adults to get to the students. and so we really are building up adult capacities so that we can support the development of children and youth.
  


state education agency representative







    learning is a relational process. we are not simply cognitive. we are not simply emotional. we are not simply social. we are all those things simultaneously.
  


dr. robert jagers, vice president of research casel







    there's an 11 to 1 return on investment, so for every dollar invested in programming around social and emotional learning, we see that they're saving 11 dollars. there are lots of reasons people are coming to the conclusion that this is something that we need to be prioritizing.
  


melissa schlinger, vice president of practice & programs, casel







    i want [my daughter] to be supported socially. i want her to be supported academically. i want her to be supported emotionally. and i want to know that there is cultural competency or cultural humility in the staff, that there is an awareness that they know the demographics they are dealing with.
  


parent, washington d.c.







    if you care about outcomes, you need to care about sel. it is the pathway to get the outcomes that we all desire.
  


susana cordova, dallas independent school district







    learning should be inherently joyous. it should be a joyous pursuit, enabling all students to have fun and find their passions. it's the purpose of learning.
  







dr. d’andre weaver
superindentant
          






    a student is not going to care how much you know until they know how much you care.
  


jenifer kuras, director of professional development, palm beach county school district







    the handing of ownership over to the students means that students can move from dependent learners to independent learners. they are advocating for their social and emotional as well as academic needs. this also means that they are increasing their student voice in the classroom.
