“they’ve been called a ‘power couple,’ ‘go-getters’ and ‘the coolest couple on the dance scene.’ but no phrase quite encompasses the extraordinary range of ways in which the kaejas engage with dance and each other.”michael crabb, toronto star














kaeja d’dance continuously pushes the edges of dance creation, challenging the perception of what dance is and who dance is for. we strive to discover inclusive engagement as we create, perform, tour, educate, and interact with communities.

gratitude address​kaeja d’dance would like to acknowledge that we are situated upon traditional territories. our artists, collaborators, staff and team are grateful to be creating art on this land that has been nurtured by recorded and unrecorded human activity for thousands of years. we honour and respect the traditional lands and waterways of the wendat, anishinabek nation, the haudenosaunee confederacy, the mississaugas of the credit first nation, and the métis nation. we are in the ‘dish with one spoon’ territory - a treaty between these nations reflecting a commitment to share the territory and protect the land. we also recognize the enduring presence of diverse indigenous peoples on this land.© kaeja d’dance 2022designed by lee jong & ashley yearwoodbuilt by adriano bertuzzo & sarah caraher
