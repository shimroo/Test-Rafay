"the ci offers an improvement and superiority more dramatic and fundamental than is imaginable with a hearing aid.... how the human ear works is one of god’s most intricate and incredible creations. when we lose it, it’s nearly impossible to replicate through technology. but i feel that through their partnership with phonak, ab’s ci gets pretty close."
—jinming zhang, project manager

"this time my tears were of joy because i knew, because of your cochlear implants, you could hear the music as well as feel it. you danced on that dance floor by yourself for ten minutes, and i watched my boy be a boy."
—sean wilkinson, father to percy

"i was one of the first people in the world to receive an ab ci, and as time has passed, my hearing has progressively improved as the technology improved. as amazed as i was about how much my very first ci helped me, i continue to be impressed that even more doors have opened for me over time along this journey."
