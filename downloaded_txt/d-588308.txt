rules for using my icons:

do not hotlink to my images!  please upload to your own server.
share and alike.  pass them on, pass on the link to this site.
credit is not in any way mandatory, but it'd sure be nice.
i'd also really appreciate it if you'd contact me or use the tag board in the links section to let me know what you thought or if you grabbed any icons.





i hold absolutely no claim to any of the graphics in or on my site (with the exception of my midget pics).  i do not own
copyright to any of the shows shown within this site.  frankly, i wish i did because there would be no need to have a kennedy
sucks page.  she'd still be a figment of joss and mutant enemy's wicked imagination.  as for third watch, again i own no copyright.
if i did, cruz would've been tortured over hot coals for messing with bos's head.  john wells production, warner bros.
television, and nbc are responsible.  the jim henson company and hallmark entertainment are the geniuses behind farscape.
sci-fi is the frelling dogdicks that cancelled this great show.  eddie izzard is owned by...well, eddie izzard.  as well as 
bruce campbell owning himself.  (i just want to be his love slave.)  well, save for the images snurched from various xena sites.
those are owned by studios usa television distribution.  don't sue me.  i have no money.  only a desire to make icons.  all 
graphics were made with paint shop pro 7.0, animation shop 3.0.  all quotes used for images are quotes from each show.
