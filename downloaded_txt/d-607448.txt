your feedback
"this past saturday i took the cpe exam, after having followed your cpe exam success plus course. obviously i don't have the test results yet, but i felt very comfortable taking the test. i liked the hands-on practice tests, which prepare you for the type of questioning the exam uses. also each week gives some theoretical background and rules to refresh your memory, i kept those!
                        above all that i think your client-oriented attitude grabbed my attention. i once wrote a comment to your website and received a response within 1 day. a day prior to my exam you sent me an email wishing me luck. i think that besides the quality of your exercises the level of customer service makes your company stand out. i will most certainly recommend your on-line courses!
                        with kind regards,"  paula cromme
