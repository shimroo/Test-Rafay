    what is the

﻿cauliflower alley club?
 
the cauliflower alley club is pro wrestling’s only 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, and thanks to generous people like you, we are able to assist many people from the wrestling industry who have helped entertain us for so many years.﻿   

about us


 



    we are the ring of friendship
 



   1
  cac mission statement
 to financially assist cac members and non-members that made a full time living in the wrestling industry for at least 3 years, who have fallen on difficult financial times. the executive board may financially assist other people from the wrestling industry that do not meet the 3-year criteria, on a case-by-case request and to be determined by a majority rule of the executive board. moreover, the cac is staffed entirely by volunteers who tirelessly devote their time and energy to the stated cause of the cac. in addition, the cac is monetarily supported by the generous donations made by its members and donors. the cac appreciates these contributions of both time and monetary resources.

 “i will adhere to all cac bylaws and principles and promise to do what is in the best interest of the cac with integrity, kindness, humility, and gratitude to all of our members, peers, past associates, and honorees as we conduct ourselves with these principles to all.”

  cac creed
 let us recognize that the cac was established as a club for wrestlers, boxers, movie people, assorted friends and companions.now, we are the people from the world of wrestling that are dedicated to the belief in the need of a club of kindred souls who enjoy camaraderie, companionship, togetherness and friendship of each other.we believe in the history of wrestling as well as promoting the future of wrestling.we further believe that through our selection of officers and staff (who have given, for free, their personal time, talents and finances) that they will make the correct decisions to build the reputation and membership of the club and continue its business into the future.
