testimonials
what our visitors said




hospitality would be the one word that described our stay here. we drove through vermont during leaf season and stayed at a few b&b's. this was by far our favorite! we will be back. the food was amazing, the gathering area was well kept and cozy, and the room we stayed in was great. it was very clean and the bed's were comfortable! the only thing we wished was that we would've had more time to visit with ken & carolyn.


- matt from south dakota




"stayed here with my wife and two kids. you can come here with confidence. carolyn & ken have created a perfect atmosphere. they greeted us with a fire in the hearth, and big smiles, the inn is comfortable, cozy, well appointed, and conveniently located to killington hiking, gondola, restaurants, etc. beds were comfy, rooms and property were spotless. 24-hr coffee.. just a perfect stay. this was a great stay and showed our kids the difference between a chain hotel and well-run inn. i rarely leave reviews but this was really an exceptional stop. thanks again to carolyn & ken."


- jeff from florida




"we stayed for 2 nights at snowed inn and loved everything about it! the lovely autumnal decorations gave the place such a homely feeling. the owners and staff were extremely friendly and helpful. a delicious breakfast was served each morning and each afternoon we enjoyed freshly baked cookies in front of the wood burning fire in the lounge! this was topped off with a daily dip in the hot tub. thank you for a great stay!"


- gayle from bermuda




"great outside spa with wonderful woodland view. several cozy lounges inside w fireplaces. room was so rustic, spotless and comfy! hosts were beyond exceptional! breakfast and snacks were phenomenal and homemade!"


- thomas from mass




"the property, nestled in killington vt a few minutes from base of killington mountain, was adored my big pines and a small stream rumbling behind it. even with the daily visit of the bear we were at home, comfortable and relaxed. the owners and staff were absolutely great making sure we were perfect and happy. they even sat with you just to have a conversation making you feel like they knew you for years. we definitely will be back!"


- christopher from new york




"snowed inn and loving it! my wife and i stayed over the weekend and everything--from making a reservation to our stay--was top-notch and wonderful. comfortable room, bed, very clean. and a delicious breakfast in a relaxing setting. we felt as if we were staying at a beautiful chalet in the swiss alps. simply wonderful and highly recommend it. we look forward to returning for some skiing. thank you ken and carolyn for the wonderful experience."
