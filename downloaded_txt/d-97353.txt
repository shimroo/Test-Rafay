our storycookemcdermid was founded in 2017 when two preeminent literary agencies, the cooke agency and the mcdermid agency, amalgamated, combining nearly 50 years of experience.we are a full-service literary agency representing authors in many genres in canada, the united states, and throughout the world. this includes literary, commercial and speculative fiction; a broad range of narrative non-fiction; health, wellness and lifestyle resources; as well as middle-grade and young adult books. these books have been adapted into major motion pictures and translated into over 60 languages. we sell directly into canada, us, uk, australia, new zealand, and india, and translation rights in conjunction with 35 co-agents around the world. cookemcdermid also has an in-house film/tv division that sells these rights directly, or works with associates to do so, in accordance with the needs of the project.
