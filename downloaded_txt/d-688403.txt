khimaira
                                farm is a
                                family farm dairy and meat goat operation.
                                nubians are the primary breed, with smaller
                                numbers of saanens, alpines and black
                                boers.  we have marketed milk commercially
                                in the past, and are now concentrating on
                                providing quality foundation stock for other
                                breeders. over the years, there have been
                                khimaira animals that have placed in the nubian
                                top ten breed leaders for milk and fat
                                production, and at the top of their classes at
                                shows.   more
