                                best by vs. sell by: uga food safety expert explains expiration dates
                            

                                checking expiration dates is second nature for many consumers, a routine part of deciding whatâs safe to eat. but those dates often indicate peak quality rather than actual safety, leading people to throw away perfectly good food out of caution â wasting both meals and money in the process. between 30% and 40% of the food supply in the united states is wasted, according to the united states department of agriculture. a portion of that stems from consumer misunderstanding of food labels, said carla schwan, a food safety specialist with university of georgia cooperative extension.

                                        in april, the environmental protection agency announced the nationâs first drinking water standard for âforever chemicals,â a group of persistent, human-made chemicals that can pose a health risk to people at even the smallest detectable levels of exposure. the new rules are part of efforts to limit pollution from these per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or pfas, which can persist in the environment for centuries. supported by a nearly $1.6 million grant from the epa, researchers from the university of georgia college of agricultural and environmental sciences are developing improved, cost-effective treatment systems with advanced technologies for removing pfas.

need to improve your time management? 10 expert tips from uga extension

01/30/25 emily cabrera, jordan powers
    



                                    
                                        the term "time management" is a misnomer. instead of managing time, you manage the events in your life that relate to time. you may wish for more time, but you only get 24 hours, 1,440 minutes, or 86,400 seconds each day. how you use that time depends on skills learned through self-analysis, planning, evaluation and self-control. much like money, time is both valuable and limited.
