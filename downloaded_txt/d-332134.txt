sed's stuff


 
2019-12-20: everything eventually comes to an end.
this website is entering a semi-sleeping state. i have a computer
at home that will serve the important stuff (what i consider important).
see sedcore.eu.org. (sometimes it
does not work. my ip address changes all the time and i don't check
every day. plus the computer may fail to function properly, plus whatever
crap this universe is capable of.) content here will stay here. i probably
won't update stuff much. maybe at some point the private company that is
offering free hosting will decide to remove it. maybe without any notice,
as private companies often do. but who cares...
internet these days has become, well, what humanity in general has become.
obsession of money, fame, porn, and so on, and so on. again, who cares...
so is it some kind of goodbye? maybe.

there is no god. there is no value.

i'm happy, thatcher is dead.
some stuff
the best program is the one you write.
-1. my gpg key
modernity! (writing this 2017-12-10)
my gpg key is: e8610311cdd4c51947a662319ed6edaa1724abb3
some notes on gpg usage.
if you want to trust my key, get in touch with me by email. i do not
control this website, but i control my key (i hope). so we would need to
establish some secure communication channel so that you trust the real me
and not some third-party. how to do that properly? i don't know. i don't
even control my email. (but neither do you with yours!)
so as of today, that key is practically useless. in the future i intend
to use it for people downloading software from here to be sure they
downloaded what i put and not something else. i'm not 100% confident that
gpg is enough, but it makes the life of "bad entities" harder i'd say, so
why not.

0. news
dec 20, 2019: oh my, 2019 is already getting old! what
is happening to me? i'm losing it... anyway, read the top of this
page for some important news, and, goodbye?

aug  7, 2018: oh my, 2018 is already getting old! i
just released a musical fragment for the
classical guitar. ah, there is also my composition number 2 on
the same page. but i don't like it much to be honest.
of course i still work on compose
to write music. at some point in a maybe near future i may well go
away from free.fr and host my tiny presence on this crazy network
all by myself, on a computer sitting safe at home. or maybe not.
because i'm lazier than you, whoever you are. but i'm working on it,
at a slow pace. i will try to use a mini2440 with a modern linux
kernel and write userland programs to do the work (http(s) server,
mail, vpn, whatever). tls is going to be fun. or not. we'll see.
or not.

dec  8, 2017: pulseaudionano,
that little stinky creature, came out of my brain.

nov 24, 2017: let's make some noise.

oct  8, 2017: woo! a new version of my
mini ftp server that works
with recursive directories and whatever-filenames. the problem
is that ftp does not work with "whatever-filenames". they have
to be 7 bits in the basic version and there is an rfc to let it
work with utf8 filenames. what the fuck... a filename is anything
but "/" that is used as separator, and also without 0 as it is an
end-of-string in c, and live with that. this world is insane.
(i am sure some shit committee made it as it is today, for some
"vendor neutral" crap shit, because some, say microsoft, don't
deal with filenames as everyone else. not even sure there is such
a thing as "everyone else". bah, fuck them all. ftp sucks anyway.)
(if you don't understand anything you can be proud of yourself,
you have a life!)

apr 17, 2017: chess is
there! a graphical program to play against the computer chess
program stockfish.

0.5 simple programs
those are simple but efficient programs of mine.
all in the public domain.
first category of the website, because this is very
important. programs must be simple so that you
can create, understand, use and modify them with ease.
a computer is a machine that you program, never forget
that, despite all the propaganda that reaches your brain
on a daily basis.



miniftp-1.c: a small (around
500 lines) ftp totally insecure server. read the source for
details. do not use it! there is also miniftp-2.c
that has more features (recursive directories, arbitrary filenames) but
may then contain more security problems. do not use it either!

compose: a more or less graphical
tool i write (yes, present tense; that thing will hopefully
never be finished) to study/write tonal classical music.

slide-1.0.tar.gz: a slideshow
generator (takes images as input and spits raw video on output)
(more specifically: the input is a "program" describing a slideshow
with images and timing/transition informations).

stuff.

audiotag:
a small tool to visualize big audio files

c programs.

the battery of your laptop is too low.

some documentation to update the
ec firmware of my msi computer.

al zimmermann's programming contests: my
entry for the delacorte numbers
thing. see here for my entry for the scrabble
like contest (alphabet city).

a nfs2 server, for the lulz.

a small bootloader to load linux
on my 486 from the network. i didn't dig the web but i strongly
suspect this thing to be the smallest network bootloader for linux
in this useless universe.

some documentation (with some code) on how to
boot a debian system on an old 486 pc. the linux kernel, the gnu libc,
debian, bootloader, all is a big bag of pain.

a patch for spk3cc4.bin which seems to
be bugged (at least within xplus4 from the vice emulator).

bintree.c a little program to display
binary trees in a x window. tries to be nice looking.

say364.c is a little
hack to speak like a commodore v364. why? why not! i saw a video
on the internet of that v364 thing speak and it reminded me of my youth
and the dictã©e magique (speak and spell) which has a very
similar voice. let's call it nostalgia.

monkey island 2 walkthrough.

ti85.skn a ti 85 skin for the
tilem
emulator.

smokenrg-1.0.c. a little hack to extract
audio files from an nrg file (proprietary format of the nero software).

crack-indy3-last-crusade.c.
a crack for the game indiana jones and the last crusade.
useless. scummvm lets you play, load and save it...
indy3-opcodes.c is a barbarian
disassembler i made because i didn't know i had to use the -n
option of descumm. it's nevertheless a cool disassembler,
because it reads any file and tries to disassemble what it can, not failing
if it gets garbage. (script 204 of room 92 is the guilty one here!)

crack-indy4-fate-of-atlantis.c.
a crack for the well known game indiana jones and the fate of atlantis.
useless because scummvm already bypasses the protection. but many many
years ago i struggled hard to crack this game and i failed. i had to do it,
one day, even if it's a lame crack... (read the source for a bit more
details, but not that much either) (extract_all.c
to suck the scripts out of atlantis.001. you also need
atlantis.000. then use scummvm tools to extract scripts.
you want to look at script 207 of room 81.)

msa.c a little program to extract files
from a msa archive (msa stands for magic shadow archiver). msa
files come from the atari scene as it seems.

anonymize a pdf file.

backup your phpbb3 data.

to print a given scale (like a minor melodic) on the guitar.

text from a quark xpress file.
xpress2html.exe is a windows binary
of it (by n8vi, it's his callsign, dig the web to find his contact).
(xpress2html-win.c and
xpress2html-win.exe to deal with
windows xpress files)
