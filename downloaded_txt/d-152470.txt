harmony ball company :: collections




































		harmony ball company is preoccupied with the marvelous - the rich and the strange - and not unlike
	17th century wonder cabinets, we seek to recreate a sense of astonishment. our goods are
	ingenious, allegorical, edifying, exquisite. each artifact is crafted in crushed marble
	from a special age old formula pioneered in england, or is fabricated from precious metals.
	our sculptural eccentricities are used for diversion and display, but sometimes
	they are studied and become repositories of knowledge and totems for storytelling.
	we invite you to indulge in the small and rare treasures found on our site.
