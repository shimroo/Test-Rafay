 now more than ever



								
glrfcentral posted a article in  acceptance






					now, more than ever, the gay + lesbian rowing federation (glrf) is essential as a safe space for rowers, coxies, coaches, and race officials.  as an individual membership online community, glrf offers a continuous connection between members of the lgbtq rowing community and clubs, programmes, organizations and vendors in the broader rowing community.
 


	 
 


	we want to highlight a powerful tool on our community platform: the share a link feature.  it provides an opportunity for lgbtq rowers and supportive allies to promote rowing clubs or programmes, and other rowing-related entities that genuinely support acceptance and inclusion. the goal is to help both glrf members and website visitors to find a rowing home, vendors, and other resources where they can trust they will feel welcomed and comfortable in their identity.
 


	 
 


	every share a link listing provides a descriptive text space to describe the club or programme, vendor, or organization and any supportive language for lgbtq acceptance and inclusion. share a link users can search by categories, geography, and by tags, helping them find an accepting space to row and participate in the sport.  the categories, covering all aspects of the rowing experience, include: 
 


	
		clubs & programmes
	
	
		open ocean race teams
	
	
		boat, oar, and erg manufacturers
	
	
		rowing retailers
	
	
		national and regional rowing federations/associations
	
	
		rowing resources
	
	
		training and fitness resources
	
	
		rowing 101
	



	 
 


	representatives of lgbtq-inclusive clubs and programmes, vendors, and organizations are welcome to add a link for their entity.   
 


	 
 


	why does this matter now?
 


	 
 


	the current political climate, the assault on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and programmes, and threats against lgbtq participation in sports in the united states will (among many other things) make it harder for lgbtq individuals to find places where they can feel comfortable and safe, and for organizations to express support for the lgbtq community. 
 


	 
 


	although we believe there is an urgent need to show support from the north american rowing community, it is equally important for this resource to be built out worldwide. we call on the global rowing community to support our share a link feature.  with robust input from both the lgbtq rowing community and allies, share a link will be a powerful tool. 
	   
	the gay + lesbian rowing federation isn’t just for lgbtq individuals.  we warmly welcome allies.  our registration system doesn’t ask anyone’s sexual orientation, just a person’s gender identity. belonging to the gay + lesbian rowing federation helps expand our network and strengthen our community.
 


	 
 


	registering with glrf is free, as is adding share a link listings (you must register to be able to add to share a link).
 


	 
 


	if your club or programme is a strong proponent for lgbtq inclusion, why isn’t your link listed?

 how is share a link integrated into the glrf community platform?



								
glrfcentral posted a question in  share a link questions






					geographic links can be added to rowing groups.  as an example, there are two los angeles area rowing club links.  both are added to the west hollywood oars group.
		 
	
	
		
			rowing enquiries uses the links to help people looking for rowing clubs in their area.
				




 february 7













 who can edit the links?



								
glrfcentral posted a question in  share a link questions






					any glrf member can edit the description of an existing link, and also add an image.  to add or remove tags, the person who added the link must edit the link, or you can contact us.
				




 february 7













 what is the purpose of the tags in a link?



								
glrfcentral posted a question in  share a link questions






					the tags can pull together related links by geography, by demographic community, by rowing ability, and so on.  if you click on a tag in any listing, you instantly see all the links with that tag included.
				




 february 7













 do i have to add my name when adding a link?



								
glrfcentral posted a question in  share a link questions






					no, only your onlineid will appear.   of course, if you want to personalize the link by adding your name and stating that this is your company or you are part of the organization and fully support the lgbtq rowing community, that would be great.
				




 february 7













 i just added a link.  why doesn’t it appear?



								
glrfcentral posted a question in  share a link questions






					we have to provide link moderation approval.  since registration in glrf is free to join, there is an opportunity for spammers to sneak in and add non rowing-related links.
				




 february 7













 our club or programme isn’t gay. can we add it?



								
glrfcentral posted a question in  share a link questions






					yes!  what matters is the language in the link description.  will the lgbtq community feel welcome?
				




 february 7













 why doesn’t the glrf administrator list our link for us?



								
glrfcentral posted a question in  share a link questions






					by encouraging individual members to add links, they become personal recommendations for our community.  if you believe in the link, you should add it.
				




 february 7













 who can add a link?



								
glrfcentral posted a question in  share a link questions






					any registered glrf member.  all rowing-related links are welcome and you don’t have to be gay to add a link.   what matters to the lgbtq rowing community is the language in the link description? will they be welcome? will they be respected? will you listen to their concerns?
				




 february 7













 what is share a link?



								
glrfcentral posted a question in  share a link questions






					share a link is a unique feature that enables our community to share rowing-related and community-supportive links and resources.  any glrf member can add a rowing-related link that they think would be useful to the lgbtq rowing community.  currently there are twelve categories for adding website links.  
 


	 
 


	some links may be useful rowing training links or classic rowing basics links.  other links may be clubs, programmes, rowing retailers, boat manufacturers, and other equipment manufacturers that our members find to have an accepting and welcoming environment.

						the line at the starbucks in the lobby is always huge during the sin city classic.  i am always amazed at the complicated drink orders people place for a simple morning coffee.  i take my coffee black, like my fluid design shells .... (if only)

 regattas+ seat search feature goes live



								
glrfcentral posted a article in  news














					seat search as a concept began at the 1998 gay games when the whoars needed a coxie for their 8+ and 4+.  with the launch of gay + lesbian rowing federation website in 2003, we offered a seat search feature for featured regattas.  the idea of using a database was not really feasible for the website tools we were using at the time so the capabilities were limited.
 


	 
 


	fast forward to december 2024 and now rower seat search and club seat search is a default feature in any regattas+ listing.  for example, if a glrf member added the head of the yarra in melbourne as a regattas+ listing, a rower could submit a seat search to race in a boat, and a rowing club or program could list a club seat search for an opening in their boat maybe for a cox or for 6-seat.
 


	 
 


	what’s the difference between a rower seat search and a club seat search? for a rower whose club is not going to a regatta or who wants to race in more than just one entry, the rower seat search helps a rower announce that they are looking for an open seat in a race.  for a club or program that perhaps wants to enter two races but only has rowers for one boat and is short one or more for a second race, the club seat search helps a to fill a boat.
 


	 
 


	each seat search entry leverages the glrf member profile to display key rower and coxie profile of data that is important for filling a boat.  the seat search feature provides for three categories: sweep, scull, and cox.  seat searches can be made for each category, “rower looking for …” and “club seeking a …”  
 


	 
 


	if this was available in 1998, the whoars would have submitted a club seat search for a coxie.
 


	 
 


	regattas+ is part of the gay + lesbian rowing federation community platform that enables members to add their own regattas, ergattas, and rowing camps/clinics.  every regattas+ listing creates community for lgbtq rowers by providing a rsvp-like members going feature, comments feature, upload files, and share images.  
 


	 
 


	whether it is the head of the mississippi regatta or the covered bridge regatta or a eurogames regatta, glrf is helping to create community among lgbtq+ rowers.
 


	 
 


	of course, allies can join glrf and add a regattas+ listing.  glrf doesn’t ask anyone’s sexual orientation.

 california yacht club



								
dph2002 posted a link in  clubs & programmes






			rowing is a section or department of the california yacht club.  it features junior and adult rowing.  there are one or two doubles and one quad but mostly everyone sculls in a single.
 


	 
 


	cyc rowing offers lessons for beginners, teaching the foundations of rowing and safe boat handling skills.  the goal is to provide a fun introduction to rowing and to build the skills necessary to be a successful and independent rower.  lessons are open to both members and non-members.  once cleared on safety procedures and operations, there are two pathways to continue rowing for cyc members.  the first is to use shells from the club-maintained fleet on a first come, first served basis. the second is to purchase your own shell and rent a rack to store it.
 


	 
 


	cyc rowing hosts the annual head of the marina regatta, a 5,000 meter head race held within the marina del rey harbor.  the regatta is held on the first sunday of november each year. 
 


	 
 


	there are several glrf members who row at cyc rowing so you could call it lgbtq-inclusive.  does the rowing program organize teams for gay regattas? no.  but you are accepted as a member.
