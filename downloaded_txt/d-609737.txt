our programs















movies on the lawngrab your lawn chairs and picnic blankets, because you’re always invited to movie night at fort greene park. throughout the summer, we welcome hundreds visitors to attend our screenings in collaboration with rooftop films—as well as showtime, disney, apple tv+, and a24. we’re often the site for premiere screenings, including spike lee’s 2022 film crooklyn, and rely on feedback from the community to choose which film lights up our giant inflatable screen next. that includes our language access series, which showcases a spanish or chinese language film for fort greene’s spanish and taishanese-speaking residents to enjoy.















poetry in the parkin honor of national poetry month in april, the fort greene park conservancy invites you to join us for an afternoon to celebrate poetry.  notable poets such as walt whitman, marianne moore, denise bell, and richard wright all drew inspiration from fort greene park. the deep connection the park has to poetry & writing speaks for itself. walt whitman was instrumental in the founding of the park, marianne moore wrote a lot of her nature poetry in the park inspired by the flora around her, denise bell was an established poet in fort greene who wrote about disenfranchisement, richard wright wrote his novel sitting in the park and the list goes on. join us as we build bridges to connect the next generation of poets in fort greene park.
