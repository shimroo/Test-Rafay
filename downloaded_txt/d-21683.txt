play.
build.
be pirates!
make memories.





welcome to my world of play! since 1987, i have been creating unique playgrounds for children, both public and private, using all-natural redwood. with my team of "play professionals", we build and install green play structures and treehouses to endure for generations. we offer both pre-designed and custom-designed play houses. tough terrains, challenging spaces and unusual requests are my specialty: let me design a tree fort, clubhouse, or swing set specifically for your tree, your home, your dreams…     - barbara
