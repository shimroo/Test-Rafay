jesus our brother: mat. 28:10 





after jesus’ resurrection, on the third day, the two marys
went to look at the tomb. having seen the empty tomb, they left to go home but,
on the way, they met the risen jesus. as they fell down and laid hold of his
feet in worship, jesus said to them, “do not be afraid; go, bring word to my
brothers to leave for galilee, and there they will see me” (mat. 28:10 nasb
2020). there are many ways in which i relate to jesus. he is my lord, my god,
my savior, and the christ of god. however, i rarely relate to him as my
brother. yet, jesus, after his resurrection, referred to his disciples as his “brothers.”
jesus, having just been raised from the dead, declares his solidarity with the human
race by calling them brothers. jesus is not just our god, but he is also our
brother.
there are three things that we can learn from relating to
jesus as our brother. first is that jesus is not ashamed of us. the writer of
hebrews states that “for both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified
are all from one father; for this reason he is not ashamed to call them
brothers and sisters” (heb. 2:11 nasb 2020). as our brother, jesus is not
ashamed of us, even knowing our weaknesses and failings. he stands with us,
even when we fail and fall short of who we are called to be. secondly, jesus is
merciful to us. the writer of hebrews goes on to say, “therefore, in all things
he had to be made like his brothers so that he might become a merciful and
faithful high priest in things pertaining to god, to make propitiation for the
sins of the people. for since he himself was tempted in that which he has
suffered, he is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted” (heb. 2:17-18
nasb 2020). not only is jesus not ashamed of us, but he is merciful to us when
we fail. no matter what we have done, we know that we can come to jesus in
repentance and find mercy and forgiveness. finally, knowing jesus as our
brother gives us a glimpse of who we are to become. paul writes, “for those
whom he foreknew, he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his
son, so that he would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters” (rom.
8:29 nasb 2020). we are called to be like jesus, and god his
father, and our father, is working in our lives to conform us to his image.
jesus is not only our pattern for who we shall be but also our hope that, as
his brothers, our father in heaven will continue to work in our lives until we reflect
the life of jesus in our own lives. today, as you spend time with jesus, may
you begin to see jesus as not only your lord and savior but also your brother.

which jesus do you choose? matthew 27:17





 after his arrest, and towards the end of his mock trial, pilate
offered a choice to the jews as to who he should release to them according to
his custom. in matthew’s gospel, we read, “now at the passover feast the
governor was accustomed to release for the people any one prisoner whom they
wanted. and at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called
barabbas. so when the people gathered together, pilate said to them, ‘whom do
you want me to release for you: barabbas, or jesus who is called christ’” (matthew
27:15-17 nasb 2020)? in the greek text, barabbas is taken
directly from the aramaic and simply means “bar abba” or “son of a father.” we
might think of this as being akin to our last name. interestingly, some of the
manuscripts include the real name of barabbas, or in our terms, his first name,
and that name was jesus. in some greek manuscripts, this verse reads, “who do
you want me to release to you? jesus, the son of abba, or jesus who is called
christ?” pilate was forcing them to choose between two jesuses, one being the
true christ of god, and the other jesus being one who was both a murderer and
an insurrectionist (mark 15:7).
this easter season, we, too, ought to stop and ask
ourselves, “which jesus do we choose?” we live in a time when many prefer a
jesus of their own choosing, of their own making, rather than the true christ
of god. people want a jesus who thinks like they think, acts as they act, and
who is accepting of all their decisions, opinions, and beliefs. instead of
conforming their lives to the life and teaching of jesus, they want to conform
jesus to their way of life and their way of thinking. instead of accepting and
following the historical jesus, the jesus of the scriptures, they would rather
follow a jesus conformant to our modern mindset and sensibilities. for many,
they prefer a counterfeit jesus rather than jesus, who was the true son of god.
so, the question we must ask ourselves is, “which jesus do we choose?” my
prayer for all of us as we enter into this easter season is that we would all
choose the true jesus, the one who lived and died for us, and the only one who
rose from the dead so that we might have new life in him. this easter season,
may you blest in the true jesus, the one who is called christ.

producing the fruit of the kingdom: matthew 21:43





one day, jesus told a parable about a landowner who planted
a vineyard and leased it out to vine-growers who would tend the vineyard for
him. part of the price of the lease was that, when the harvest time had come,
the landowner would receive a share of the harvest of the vineyard. however,
when he sent servants to collect his fee, those who had leased the vineyard
refused to pay. finally, the landowner sent his son, saying, “they will respect
my son” (matthew 21:37 nasb 2020). however, vine-growers “took
him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him” (matthew 21:39
nasb 2020). jesus then reveals that he spoke this parable against the religious
people of his day, warning them, saying, “the kingdom of god will be taken away
from you and given to a people producing its fruit” (matthew 21:43
nasb 2020).
the greek word translated here as “producing” is a very
common word in the new testament. it is often translated as to make or to do.
bearing the fruit of the kingdom is not something that naturally or
automatically happens. it takes our involvement. we must engage in the process.
we must participate in the making, or producing, of the fruit. yes, fruit is
the natural result of the life of any plant, but producing a crop takes effort.

so how does one bear and produce fruit for the kingdom of
god? the secret is to remain in jesus. jesus said, “remain in me, and i in you.
just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself but must remain in the vine, so
neither can you unless you remain in me. i am the vine, you are the branches;
the one who remains in me, and i in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you
can do nothing” (john 15:4-5 nasb 2020). if we are to produce the fruit of the kingdom,
we must abide in christ. john goes on to tell us what it means to remain in
christ. he wrote, “the one who says that he remains in him ought, himself also,
walk just as he walked … no one who remains in him sins continually; no one who
sins continually has seen him or knows him … the one who keeps his commandments
remains in him, and he in him” (1 john 2:5, 3:6, 3:24 nasb 2020).
to remain in christ, and therefore produce fruit for god,
requires us to walk like jesus walked, to turn from sin, and keep his
commandments. to remain in christ is to live like christ. while we are saved by
grace alone, we are all called to “work out your own salvation with fear and
trembling; for it is god who is at work in you, both to desire and to work for
his good pleasure” (philippians 2:12-13 nasb 2020).
furthermore, this life of christ that we are to live can be summed up in one
statement, “and the one who remains in love remains in god, and god remains in
him” (1 john 4:15-16 nasb 2020). to remain in christ is to
remain in love, to live a life of love towards god and towards one another, for
everyone who remains in love will naturally bear fruit for god and for the
world.

washing our robes: rev 22:14





 as john nears the end of his revelation from jesus christ,
he sees the new city of jerusalem descending from heaven, and he hears jesus
say these words, “blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will
have the right to the tree of life, and may enter the city by the gates” (rev.
22:14 nasb 2020). in the original greek, the word translated here as “wash” is
a present participle, which implies an ongoing activity. this verse could be
translated, “blessed are those who are washing their robes.” washing our robes
is not something we do once and are done with it; it is something we must
continually do day-by-day. no matter how mature we become in christ, we will
still have the need to wash our robes.
earlier in his revelation, john tells us how we are to wash
our robes white. as part of his revelation, john sees a great multitude and is
told, “these are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have
washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb” (rev. 7:14
nasb 2020). we wash our robes through repentance and the forgiveness that are
found in the blood of christ. the truth is, we will never outgrow our need for
the blood of christ to forgive us and to cleanse us from our sins and the filth
we pick up from the world around us. 
furthermore, our experience with the forgiveness and
cleansing of the blood of christ must also be manifested in the way we walk and
live. speaking of the bride of christ, which is the church of christ, john is
told, “it was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean;
for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints” (rev. 19:8
nasb 2020). the righteousness that is ours through the blood of christ must
become manifested in our daily walk as we commit ourselves to good works towards
those around us. as we live righteous lives, as evidenced through our good
works, and as we continually avail ourselves to the blood of christ, which forgives
and cleanses us, then we will be among those who are continually washing their
robes as we wait for christ’s return.

to jesus who loves us: rev 1:5





while exiled to the island of patmos, john, writing to the seven churches in asia, opens his letter with praise to their common savior. he writes in praise, “to him who loves us and released us from our sins by his blood” (rev. 1:5 nasb 2020). in this passage, there are two participles that further describe who jesus is. the first is an aorist participle which describes a one-time past action. john says that jesus “released us from our sins,” a one-time past action. the other is a present participle, which describes an ongoing activity. this is the case where john says that jesus “loves us.” this phrase could also have been translated, “the one who is loving us.” jesus’ love for us was not a one-time event. jesus did not only love us when he came to give his life for us. neither did he love us only when he forgave and released us from our sins. jesus continues to love us today, and he will love us tomorrow and the next day. jesus' love for us is both continual and active. we can trust in his love day-by-day, knowing that we can never exhaust his love for us. what comfort and hope this revelation ought to give us, and what motivation to share that same never-ending love with the people around us.david robison

overcoming: rev 2-3





while exiled to the island of patmos, john received a
lengthy revelation of jesus christ. as part of that revelation, jesus gives him
seven messages to seven churches in asia. included in each of these seven
messages is a blessing for those who overcome in this life. here are the
blessings pronounced by jesus upon the overcomer: “to the one who overcomes, i
will grant to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of god) (rev.
2:7 nasb 2020).“the one who overcomes will not
be hurt by the second death” (rev. 2:11 nasb 2020).“to the one who overcomes, i
will give some of the hidden manna, and i will give him a white stone, and a
new name written on the stone which no one knows except the one who receives it”
(rev. 2:17 nasb 2020).“the one who overcomes, and the
one who keeps my deeds until the end, i will give him authority over the
nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the
patter are shattered, as i also have received authority from my father; and i
will give him the morning star” (rev. 2:26-28 nasb 2020).“the one who overcomes will be
clothed the same way, in white garments; and i will not erase his name from the
book of life, and i will confess his name before my father and before his
angels” (rev. 3:5 nasb 2020).“the one who overcomes, i will
make him a pillar in the temple of my god, and he will not go out from it
anymore; and i will write on him the name of my god, and the name of the city
of my god, the new jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my god, and
my new name” (rev. 3:12 nasb 2020).“the one who overcomes, i
will grant to him to sit with me on my throne, as i also overcame and sat with
my father on his throne” (rev. 3:21 nasb 2020).what is interesting in all these cases is that the greek
word translated as “overcomes” is in the present tense, which, in greek,
indicates an ongoing activity. these verses could have been translated as “to
the one who is overcoming” or “the overcoming one.” this is even more
interesting when compared to what john previously wrote in his first letter to
the church. john wrote, “you are from god, little children, and have overcome
them [the antichrists]; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in
the world” (1 john 4:4 nasb 2020). here, the verb is in the
perfect tense, which indicates a one-time past action whose effects are still
being felt today. when we come to christ, we are placed on the winning team. the
book of revelation tells an epic story where, as believers, we overcome and win
in the end. however, this does not mean that we do not face daily battles,
battles in which we are called to fight and overcome by the grace of god. while
we have won the battle, we still must secure that victory through daily skirmishes
with the enemy. we have both overcome, and are overcoming, through our daily
lives through the power of god that lives within us. our daily victories flow
from the grand victory we won over the enemy when we first became believers.
what comfort this ought to give us as we fight our battles and learn to
overcome day-by-day.david robison

entrusting ourselves to god: 1 peter 4:19





 in his first letter to the church, peter reminds us that suffering is part of the christian life. peter writes, “for you have been called for this purpose, because christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you would follow in his steps” (1 peter 2:21 nasb 2020). part of those footsteps that we are to follow in is to suffer both for the sake of christ and the sake of others. peter goes on to write, “therefore, since christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose” (1 peter 4:1 nasb 2020). this same purpose includes suffering. suffering is part and parcel of the christian life. peter encourages us that we ought not to be “surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though something strange were happening to you” (1 peter 4:12 nasb 2020), for such suffering is a normal part of being a christian. so how is a believer to bear up under such suffering and come through it even stronger in the lord? peter gives us this counsel, “therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of god are to entrust their souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right” (1 peter 4:19 nasb 2020).two things are of note in this verse. first is the greek word translated as “entrust.” this word means to put, place, or stand near or around something. it is often translated as commit, entrust, and deposit. peter is telling us to commit and entrust our souls to god as if we were depositing them with him for safekeeping. but how does one do this? how can we entrust and commit our souls to a god we cannot see and who is enthroned in heaven? we do so by choosing to do good. the greek word translated here as “doing what is right” is a compound word made from the greek word for good and the greek word for doing or making. we commit ourselves to god by committing ourselves to doing good. it is a bit surprising that the way we commit ourselves vertically to god is by committing ourselves horizontally to doing good to other people. some may question if such counsel is contrary to faith and returns us to a works-oriented salvation. are good works compatible with salvation by faith? the answer is “yes!” often, especially when we are suffering some fiery ordeal, it takes faith to continue in doing good. it takes faith in the goodness, graciousness, and merciful favor of god in our lives. only as we have faith in god’s goodness and faithfulness can we do good, even while suffering. the way through suffering is to entrust ourselves to a faithful god in doing what is good and right to others. david robison

co-worker in the truth: 3 john 8





in his third letter to the church, john praises the
believers for how they had treated strangers and those who traveled with the
gospel. john writes, “you will do well to send them on their way in a manner
worthy of god. for they went out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing
from the gentiles. therefore we ought to support such people, so that we may
prove to be fellow workers with the truth” (3 john 1:6-8
nasb 2020). there are two things of interest in these verses. first is the
greek word translated here as “ought.” the root of this word is the greek word
for profit or advantage. the idea is of a duty that has accrued to us on the
basis of the benefits and blessings we have received. john is reminding his
readers that, because of the blessings, favors, and advantages of god that have
become theirs in the gospel, the duty of supporting those who have gone out in
the service of the gospel has been accrued to their account. because we have
been blessed, we ought to support those ministers of the gospel.
the second thing of interest is the greek word translated as
“fellow workers.” this is a single compound greek word containing the preposition
“with” and the greek word for worker, which is the same greek word from which
we get our word for “energy.” this particular word is used only here by john
but is often used by paul to speak of those who were working with him in the
cause of the gospel. consider some of the people whom paul calls his fellow workers:
prisca and aquila (rom. 16:3), urbanus (rom. 16:9),
timothy (rom. 16:21), titus (2 cor. 8:23),
epaphroditus (philip. 2:25), clement (philip. 4:3),
jesus (not jesus christ) and justus (col. 4:11), philemon (philemon
1:1), and aristarchus, demas, and luke (philemon 1:24).

however, here, john is saying that if we help and support
those who have gone out for the sake of the gospel, then we have become
co-workers with them in the truth. in god’s perspective, those who go and those
who supply are both workers in the truth. when we support missionaries and
workers in the gospel, we are not simply supporting them or donating to their
cause; we are actually co-working with them in the truth. this ought to change
the way we view missions, missionaries, and our participation with them by
supporting them in their work. when we support them, then we too are
participating with them in the work. by giving, we too have become workers.

troublesome meddler: 1peter 4:14





peter writes to encourage us that suffering is a normal part
of the christian life. however, he goes on to say, “make sure that none of you
suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler” (1
peter 4:15 nasb 2020). this last word in the greek text,
translated here as “troublesome meddler,” is particularly interesting, and its
exact meaning is still debated. this greek word is a compound word, the first
part meaning “another’s,” and the second word is often translated in the new testament
as “bishop” or “overseer.” peter is saying that we should not pretend to be
another’s bishop, or another’s overseer. craig keener writes that this word
could refer to those “giving unwanted or ill-timed advice. mediling tactlessly
in others affairs was a vice often attributed to unpopular cynic philosophers” (the
ivp bible background commentary).
in thinking about this word, we ought to remember what peter
previously wrote in this same letter. peter writes, “for you were continually
straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of
your souls” (1 peter 2:25 nasb 2020). the greek word translated
here as guardian is the same word for bishop used by peter when he later warns
us about trying to be another’s bishop. the truth is, people do not need
another bishop, someone else to intrude into their lives to tell them how to do
things or to point out where they are wrong. they already have a bishop and
overseer in their life, and that is jesus. this further reminds me of paul’s
words when he wrote, “who are you to judge the servant of another? to his own
master he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the lord is able to make him
stand” (rom. 14:4 nasb 2020). in christ, we are called to be
one another’s brothers and sisters, not their bishop. that job we ought to leave
to the lord.

in which direction are you running? 1 peter 4:4





 peter writes to remind us that suffering is a normal part of
the christian experience. peter writes, “therefore, since christ has suffered
in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because the one who
has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin” (1 peter 4:1
nasb 2020). one of the ways we suffer is by being misunderstood by those who do
not believe. peter goes on to say, “in all this, they are surprised that you do
not run with them in the same excesses of debauchery, and they slander you” (1
peter 4:4 nasb 2020).
there are two things of note in this verse. the first is the
word translated here as “debauchery” and as “dissipation” in other translations.
in the original greek, this word is a compound word containing the negative
article (think of “un”) and the greek word for salvation. perhaps the most literal
way of understanding this word is as “unsavedness.” peter describes people as
running in one of two directions. either we are running into the savedness of
god, or we are running into the unsavedness of the world; there is no middle
ground. peter goes on to tell us that a life lived in running towards unsavedness,
is a life lived in pursuing “indecent behavior, lusts, drunkenness, carousing,
drinking parties, and wanton idolatries” (1 peter 4:3 nasb
2020). however, a life lived in running towards savedness, is a life lived in “sound
judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer … fervent in your love for
one another … hospitable to one another without complaint … [and] serving one
another as good stewards of the multifaceted grace of god” (1 peter 4:7-10
nasb 2020).
the second thing of note is that peter speaks of us running in
one direction or the other. we often think of the fast pace of our modern life,
but we rarely think of the pace at which we are running towards unsavedness or
savedness. people do not drift towards savedness or away from savedness; they
run! i know of a man who, one day, started going out for drinks after work.
this led him to stop going to church, which led to more drinking, and eventually
to being arrested for sexual assault. what is shocking is that this entire
process took only six months! our journey toward sin is a quick journey. it
does not take long to become completely consumed by sin. we must ask ourselves,
in which direction am i running? am i running towards god and his savedness? or
toward the world and its unsavedness?
