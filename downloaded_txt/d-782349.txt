what people are saying about our team:



amy trgovac
2 job openings

"i have had great experiences with cybercoders, and with amy trgovac in particular. we worked with amy to recruit two key members for my team. she was very thorough in understanding our needs and was immediately able to produce candidates. i got my first resumés within 24 hours of my initial calls with amy. 100% i would work with her again - she's the best talent recruiter i've ever worked with in my career."
jim j, vp of customer success




nate paules
21 job openings

"i don’t often take the time to acknowledge people from the staffing industry because i’m not often impressed. nate is the exception; i am continually impressed with him.  not only has he taken the time to understand our industry (manufacturing), but he’s taken the time to understand us.  he has embraced our needs as if they were his own and demonstrates a close relationship with our core values (trust, team, and excellence).

he is versatile, professional, friendly, always willing to go the extra mile for us, and we appreciate that his sense of urgency matches ours.  it truly is a pleasure to work with him."
leahna e, director of human resources
