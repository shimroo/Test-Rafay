welcome to lcbc
our church is made up of people of all ages and backgrounds
united in our desire to love and serve jesus christ and see
lives changed by christ
we are passionate about growing in our relationship with jesus christ, sharing his love with the community around us and helping others come to know him for themselves. whether you are already a committed follower of jesus, interested in exploring what it means to know him, or still sceptical, we look forward to welcoming you.
we meet together on sundays at 10:30am and at 6:00pm. our morning service will also be viewable live online. the most recent online services on our youtube channel can be found here.
