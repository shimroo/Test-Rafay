winter 2025
hi all,
welcome to the start of a new fishing season! i’m
sorry to see the exit of the longtime mlf (formerly
flw) western division; but very happy to see the
new opportunities that have opened for western
tournament anglers such as angler’s press pro
teams and future pro tour top 75 as well as others
such as the bam super 60 and the expanding
kayak events of the events.
i’m also proud to spearhead fisherman’s warehouse
support of fish conservation as the conservation
sponsor of the bam tournament trail live release
boat. you can read more about that in the feature
article in this issue. we have some new exciting
things coming down the pike.
the first issue of the year is always a great place to
feature some of the new gear that typically debuts
at icast in the late summer and has begun to
store shelves by winter. we hope you enjoy some of
the new products highlighted in this issue, that we
saw at the annual sportfishing tradeshow and are
looking forward to trying out on the water.
i would like to close by wishing all of you merry
christmas, a great happy new year and a personal
best for the upcoming season.
tight lines,and of course, tight lines!
wayne










fall 2024
hi all,
yes, the season of the fall feed is already upon us! but coincidentally it seems like mid-summer as i write this while the air temp is over 100 degrees, and there are several triple digit days still ahead of us. even so, we all know that the weather will cool, the fish will feed, and the fall bite will catch up to us in no time. for those of us that have been on the california delta, we can see the bait fish and fry are already plentiful, helping us determine lure profile, and color. this season is always a favorite!
we hope this issue gives you some insight into a few of the new products in the industry, a new fishery to catch bass in the golden state at, an insider’s look at how forward facing sonar is not only changing the tournament side of our sport, but also the tackle industry and so much more info that in the end helps you hookup with more and bigger bass.
we would like to welcome two new advertisers with us – valley hill and limit out marine. and as always, we encourage you to support the companies that support westernbass and the sport of bass fishing. without them none of this would be possible.
good luck to those getting ready for their season-ender fall tournament of championships.
and of course, tight lines!
wayne










summer 2024
hi all,
welcome to another summer season of westernbass.com magazine. the summer issue marks our 13th anniversary of the introduction of the westernbass mag and always a great time of year. we love to see the big bass that come by way of topwater, and punching, as well as those later stage spawners and who knows what will come from the catches with forward facing sonar this year!


summer always brings the icast show and the new products for our industry. it is always exciting and something we all look forward to!
we would like to welcome our newest site advertiser bridgford foods. they are not only a westernbass advertiser. their meat snacks are a new addition to the fisherman’s warehouse in-store product line. bridgford is a great supporter of the sport, and we are fortunate to have them onboard! speaking of which, do you have bridgford in your boat?

thanks to bridgford for joining us and all of the westernbass site advertisers. remember, who they are and always we encourage you to support those, who support us and the sport that we all love!

tight lines,tight lines! wayne

																	what's up every one  this should be  a first of many  reports . let's get to it .
 
bank fisherman  have reported  to me 1 -3 fish a day  varying  from 2lb stock trout  to  keeper bass  and 4lb average catfish. during january. 
 
boat anglers 

bite has been consistent  on all species  with most angler targeting  trout stock and  bass .

trout bite seems  to be 1-5 fish for most boat. with most days being 2-3 fish. 

trout have been everywhere  0-25ft. with hot spots being near clark canyon and  cachuma  hay.


bass have been consistent  in 20-40ft 
  drop shot  is king.  with the jig and underspin bite being day to day.   also if you know what your doing on ffs you can have large numbers of 1-2lbs fish schooling . other reactions  bites available  but may  be hard to get  many bites or a keeper limit .

aba january 2025 took 16lbs to win. with the average  being 10/13lbs for 5 fish limits .

crappie.  bite    is tough but biting . if you know what your doing your rolling in them.  if not you catch  1 a day by accident .

book a trip on lake cachuma  with me.
