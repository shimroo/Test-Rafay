professional photography is an art, a science and a business, the typical photographer's website only shows you their art leaving you with only one-third of the information you really need. we want you to make an informed decision, that's why this website  includes lots of business and science information. if you want to see our website with just lots of  pretty pictures click here.

what makes us different?
anyone can take beautiful pictures in 'perfect natural light' with most any camera (including cell phones) the problem is 'perfect natural light' is very rare! as consummate professionals, we are able to take the best images in any conditions! we are not your average run-of-the-mill photo snappers, we do things differently and it shows in our finished products. we strive for superior professionalism and use a minimum of two professional photographers and up to 5 cameras, 9  lenses and 12 portable lights at large events (weddings, bar-mitzvahs, corporate events) insuring complete coverage, different angles and superior backup. we include complete retouching, design and 100% guarantee on all our finished products.
 
          we work with you to create the best possible customized one-of-a-kind finished products that reflect your true personality. our proven track record and experience insures you uncompromised success. sure you could pay less and get less,  but that wouldn't really make you happy. your success is our success! 



dan harris photoart on facebook:


   
please note: we don't use our website/facebook/blog to 'hype' reality.
              you won't hear us say that our latest shoot was the "most incredible ever" (even if it was) and we don't say "our customers are amazing" (even though they are). we don't bombard you with phoney teasers about the "greatest, exciting newest thing ever ". we don't hold contests online  nor do we own angel wings or throw glitter. we hate to give or receive spam. we are always professional in our business practices. we will leave the over-exaggerated hype to circus side-show acts and/or used car ads.



don't delay e-mail or call 904-398-7668 today --you'll be glad you did!
when you order albums or prints from your wedding, mitzvah or corporate event from us we will fully retouch every image and adjust it to insure it prints the absolute best possible -guaranteed! we will meet with you as many times as needed  and provide proofing to insure you will get the best possible end result. we stand behind every product we sell, if there is ever an issue --no problem, no worries-- we will either fix it or replace it! our experience and expertise will insure the best decisions are made along every step of the way, we won't leave you stranded with an unfinished project.
