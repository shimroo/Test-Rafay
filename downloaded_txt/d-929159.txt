our position:



the apopka chief will continue to have birthdays
the 2011 book “tales of the big potato” includes a two-page history of the apopka chief. it recounts the current chief’s founding in 1923 and the six owners who have published the paper over the last century, including the late john ricketson. “the local newspaper belongs to the people it serves, and we, the current owners/management, are temporarily in charge,” ricketson said in the book. “if we do our job right, then long after we are gone, local newspapers will be here as a viable product that has been and is important to the growth of the greater apopka area.”

fun and games & a good life
patti bankson, the way i see it

when i was in high school, going to football games was more about socializing, which i’ve always loved, than about football itself, which didn’t matter to me much one way or the other. but, when we lived in denver and we were on tour a lot, my husband would turn on the games in our vehicle and we’d listen sunday afternoons on our way home. read bankson on page 5a.
