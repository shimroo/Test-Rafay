		being the parent of a marine in combat gave me such pride, and with that pride came a whole lot of fear. i was no longer his protector; he was my protector. he was no longer my little boy; he was my hero.
	
    — tracy della vecchia, 2005founder marineparents.com







 








		everything about your website helped us. without your efforts and dedication, we would have no where to turn for information during this trying time in a parents life.

019— julie arca, november 2011

017— marine mom teresa, 2018





		i don't know how to put it in words [how] tremendously helpful [your volunteers were] all throughout boot camp and now mct. you were my daily shoulder to carry me through it all.

011— recruit mom kelly, 2022








		i read the paper from [the founder] tracy yesterday, the day my son left for boot camp. it helped me tremendously to get through the night. iâm new to all of this, but a proudmom.
	
009— recruit mom kellie, 2022

		first, it is outstanding that you have created a network so extensive and so
helpful to everyone joining; it makes the parents feel at ease. thank you for
continuing to make our lives in the recruiting world easier.  second, this is a
great tool to be able to use to provide parents with something to turn to
while their children are at training andbeyond.
	
023— marine corps recruiter, 2014





		i feel more pride, more compassion, more respect...for my son. being here on this site has been the difference. i read how all the other parents have gone [through] and are going through this change and i find that i'm gaining strength through these very people. we are all in this together and i'm very happy about that. i hope that you find the peace and comfort that i have found here with marineparents.com.
	
016— marine parent robbie, from texas, april, 2005





		this site, along with the matrix, have been such an encouragement to me. having a daily glimpse into what my son is doing each day has helped me know how to pray, what to ask him about in daily letters and to just learn and appreciate the true calling that serving in the marine corps is. thank you so much!
	
011— christina, recruit mom from colorado, 2022








		your kind and thoughtful note is the boost of light i needed at this moment. thank you very much. i feel that we were meant to connect, as one marine mom to another.

		thanks to this organization and volunteers for keeping me informed every step of the way. i will forever feel such gratitude. during the difficult times, i felt like i wasn't alone. 
	
020— parent, november 2012





		when i was going through papers i found the marine parents pamphlet. i didn't really know much about the marines. it helped me to see other parents  going through the same emotions.
	
008— marine mom zissi, 2022









		your volunteers were so helpful at keeping us updated about things and what to expect. since then it has been a great place to connect and share. marineparents.com is the first resource i give new recruit parents. 
	
005— laura, marine mom from oregon, 2022
