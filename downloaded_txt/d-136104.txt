north east trailer sailors are people who
                                enjoy sailing. some of us like to sail by ourselves.
                                others enjoy group events. but “enjoy sailing” is
                                probably at the core of who we are and what we
                                do.
if you're a sailor or a sailor to be, we invite
                                you to explore our website. there are many fine
                                articles on sailing (and we are always looking
                                for more!). if you have any questions, do contact
                                us and we'll get back to you as soon as we
                                return from the water. and of course, consider
                                benefits of joining.
see you on the water!
