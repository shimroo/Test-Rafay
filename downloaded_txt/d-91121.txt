clients testimonials




i had a rink in my backyard growing up and i was able to go out there whenever i wanted and work on my hands,â he said. âi owe it all to that.
- sam gagner, nhl player
 







we chose custom ice for the installation of the unique ice palace arena at our summer children's camp north of montreal.  engineer brendan lenko gave excellent advice and guidance throughout the planning and construction phases.   most importantly,  the project was successfully completed a week ahead of schedule and according to budget.
- ronnie braverman, pripstein's camp
 







well, the service of custom ice is superb.  nice, friendly people and try to accommodate their clients as best they can.  my children, wife, neighbors and friends love the ice rink.  all my kids play hockey and it is a ball to have a 2 on 2 game of shinny with the family.  my sons slap shot is the hardest, fastest and most accurate on the team.  my only suggestion for the rink, is that a roof would make it much easier to maintain.
- terry duffy, toronto, on
 







our rink has given our family a great winter destination â¦ our own backyard!  unlike most of todayâs kids, our kids are growing up as âoutdoor kidsâ.  they are enjoying the type of winters that i enjoyed on the neighborhood ponds.  we now have a new tradition of ongoing hockey games at our large family gatherings at thanksgiving and christmas.
- pete thalmann, holliston, ma
