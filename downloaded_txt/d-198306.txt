restoring, improving, & protecting the quality of the environment
the position papers were created in 1989 to streamline the process providing cohesive and consistent messages that could be managed by the committees. jointly produced by the gca's national affairs & legislation and conservation committees, and approved by the gca’s executive board, the gca position papers summarize those issues that are of top priority to the gca. they are created with great care and contain specific core provisions which the gca wishes to see embodied in any piece of legislation.
