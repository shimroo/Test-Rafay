experience kenya’s safaris and african safari tours where rafting is possible for the full 450 km of the river which will take you from nairobi to the coast at malindi. this normally take about 21 days but more frequently an 80 km section is used which covers the best of scenery with medium grade white-water rafting. this section borders tsavo national park and so wildlife is plenty with giraffe, buffalo and elephant often seen. in between the scenic sections are a dozen or so sets of rapids ranging from class 2 to 4.
this can be combined with african safari holidays tour in kenya or tanzania for wildlife game viewing. learn more about african safari holidays on this african sermon safaris site to discover more about kenya safari tours and options available to book. learn more about the available kenyan safari holidays and kenya wildlife tour packages – african safari tours.
