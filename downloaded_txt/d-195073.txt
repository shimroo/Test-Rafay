join the global initiative to share jesus with every person on earth by 2038.



  























oikos is an initiative that expresses every home for christ’s belief—a belief carried through generations—that christ’s love has immeasurable worth and is intended for every human heart.
our goal is to carry christ to everyone, everywhere, in every generation by 2038.
