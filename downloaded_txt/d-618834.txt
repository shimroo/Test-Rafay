service dogs for veterans, first responders, and police

our mission  



puppies behind bars (pbb) trains incarcerated individuals to raise service dogs for wounded war veterans and first responders, facility dogs for police departments, and explosive-detection canines for law enforcement. puppies enter prison at the age of 8 weeks and live with their incarcerated puppy-raisers for approximately 24 months. as the puppies mature into well-loved, well-behaved dogs, their raisers learn what it means to contribute to society rather than take from it.
