“confidence in your look has a ripple effect on the way you feel”-mikel lo, md

eyes
our eyes are the focal point of our face and when they appear tired or aged it can affect how the world sees you. an upper eyelid lift or blepharoplasty tightens and rejuvenates sagging and drooping lids, while a lower eyelid lift smooths bulges and reduces puffiness.



eyes


















face
as we age, loose skin, volume loss, and wrinkles can make us look older than our true age. a facelift tightens the skin of the lower face and neck, while also lifting the underlying muscle and tissue. dr. lo strives for a subtle, natural result that leaves you looking like the best version of yourself.



facelift


















med spa
whether your concern is fine lines and wrinkles, anti-aging, hyperpigmentation and melasma, texture and scars, we offer an array of medical aesthetic treatments, laser resurfacing, and skincare services to help refresh, restore, and protect.
