the first day of your next diet  brings you one day closer to your next binge
do you find that you are an emotional eater? do you eat to celebrate, reward, distract, or when bored, angry, frustrated, etc.?
do you find that you are an emotional dieter? do you diet to help you feel like you have more control over your life. do you diet or think about dieting when problems arise?
if you answer "yes" to these questions then you might be using eating or dieting as a way of coping with emotions.
you can learn better ways to meet your needs. dieting and bingeing are two sides of the same coin. if you think you might be an emotional eater or an emotional dieter, then make sure you address those issues instead of starting your next diet.
