we are pleased to endorse max steiner for congress in california's first congressional district, in northern california.back in 2005, he noticed the same thing we did, dropped out of college, joined the army, and served in combat.  as a veteran, he went back to college, graduated, and continued to serve our country in various ways.

so we're back.  'time to encourage trump supporters to be a man!  enlist!

or, as donald trump would summarize:  sad!labels: donald trump

	 welcome president trump!
    



as the obama administration was focused on reducing the size of our military, our military needed no extra help - such as this blog - to help meet its recruiting objectives.  accordingly, operation yellow elephant went on hiatus, except for occasional commendations for real american patriots.

today's washington times reports, however, that president trump's plan to increase the size of our military may create some problems.  the entire article is worth a skim as relevant paras appear throughout.  sufficient quality potential recruits is only part of the equation, but experienced personnel can have their mandatory end of service dates extended if america still needs them.

oye comment.  with one political party - the republicans - in control of both political branches of our government, the buck stops there.  if young republicans really want to support our president, they will, once again, contact military recruiters to determine their eligibility and mutual interest.  thank you.  end comment.labels: donald trump

deutsche bank to cut 35,000 jobs under new strategy

oye comment.  this is the same deutsche bank that foreclosed on a servicemember, and threw his family out of their house, in violation of law, while he was deployed to iraq.
