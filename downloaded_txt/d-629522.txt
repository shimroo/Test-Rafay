                bring your patient’s story to life
            
it all starts with a conversation between a patient and their clinician. let us help you efficiently turn that conversation into a complete and compliantly coded record that reflects the quality of care you provide and justifies the reimbursement you deserve.

enabling better, smarter, safer healthcare. from capture to code.














we are solvers. we work hand-in-hand with our customers to tackle some of their biggest challenges in healthcare. from physician burnout to administrative burden to appropriate reimbursement and population health insights. we’re pushing the boundaries of innovation to ensure capture to code isn’t just a buzzword but a reality.

a reality where clinicians use ambient technology to unobtrusively capture patient visits so they can focus more fully on care, knowing documentation is already underway. where highly skilled coders have more bandwidth for complex cases while ai handles simple tasks — and aligns team workflows more closely. and health systems not only reimburse appropriately for care but produce records showing improved outcomes for patients in the community.

our technology platforms, from cutting-edge conversational ai to natural language understanding and everything in between, are built specifically to target our clients’ problems and solve them. their purpose is to advance healthcare and your organizational objectives, creating more time to care — a goal we all can stand behind. because at the end of the day, healthcare is personal.

























play











































workflow solutions that close the loop between clinical care and revenue integrity








ambient clinical documentation solutions automate documentation, in real time so clinicians get more time with patients — and their family and friends. gaps in the patient story are proactively identified and addressed with integrated and closed-loop clinical documentation integrity (cdi) solutions, helping to improve quality metrics, risk adjustment, continuity of care and revenue capture.​ records are seamlessly coded through an ai-powered, clinically driven review process, empowering coding teams, reducing time to bill and minimizing denials.​ underpinning these integrated workflows is expert content honed over four decades, quality and patient classifications that drive patient insights and measure quality outcomes.

















                        accurate and streamlined clinical documentation
                    
our generative ai clinical documentation solutions are built to reduce the administrative burden on physicians. which means, we help ensure documentation is completely, compliantly and accurately captured at the point of care. unobtrusively in the background so the physician can focus on the person sitting in front of them and not on a computer screen. we integrate that documentation directly into the electronic health record (ehr) workflow, and gently nudge the physician if documentation is incomplete or unclear, avoiding the need to query the physician days or weeks later for clarification.



speech enable your documentation


















                        cost and financial performance management
                    
it means that complete, compliant and accurate documentation is captured at the point of care so health systems and physicians can be appropriately reimbursed for the care provided. our technology proactively flags cases that have a high potential for denial so coders and the health information management (him) team can fix the issue before it goes further downstream. we can automate pre-qualified visits, as defined by the organization, so that your highly trained coders aren’t spending their time on simple, manual tasks.



capture your codes


















                        quality care and outcomes
                    
you can harness the power of the data and documentation you've captured to flag potentially preventable hospital visits, or possible severe maternal morbidity cases before it happens. you can prove quality outcomes and ensure your population is receiving the level of care they need to be their best selves. this data can be a formidable tool in ensuring health equity and drive increased access to care.
