exercise in the morning
if you find yourself unable to exercise during the day or evening because too many other commitments get in your way, consider exercising first thing in the morning before anyone else gets up. you will start your morning refreshed and have the rest of the day to do whatever comes your way.

prepare a weekly menu
prepare a weekly menu before you go to the grocery store. you will focus on buying only what you need instead of making last-minute impulse purchase. plus, you will not be stumped with what to make for dinner.

m&m colors
if you are trying to teach your toddler his colors, consider using m&m's. you can give your child an m&m for every color he identifies correctly. he will have his colors down pat in no time!

potty training boot camp
set aside a full day for potty training boot camp. give your child lots of liquids and take him to the bathroom every fifteen minutes. have your child pull his pants down and sit on the toilet regardless of whether he actually urniates or not. repeat this ritual throughout the entire day in fifteen minute increments. he will get used to the process of going on the potty even though he doesn't actually go each time. repetition is key.

kids need to play more and memorize less
take it from the experts...kids need to play more and memorize less. 
in their book einstein never used flash cards: how our children really learn -and why they need to play more and memorize less authors kathy hirsh-pasek, roberta michnick golinkoff and diane eyer address parents' growing infatuation with hurrying intellectual development. kids who are pushed early to excel in academics don't fair much better than children who are allowed to play more. the authors assert that children learn best through simple playtime, which enhances problem solving skills, attention span, social development and creativity. 
a simple concept...play more and learn more!
