education through creation series


a positive self-image
and a belief in one's self are all characteristics that are acquired
through parents, adults and environment. the "education through
creation" eight book series was designed as a tool 
to assist in the development of children in the formative
years.


children love being read to. not only does reading develop
a bond between child and adult, but it develops a child' s love
to read by themselves. readers are leaders! 

today's child is tomorrow's future!

the bright, beautifully illustrated,
and fun- filled conversation pages in the "education through
creation" series, plant seeds that will last a lifetime!
remember this: if someone was taking care of, directing and guiding
your child, what lessons would you want being taught?

the education through creation series teaches children moral lessons 
that will stay with the child throughout his/her life!  the books are brilliantly
designed to guide and teach in a fun, simple and thought-provoking manner. 

this series
builds cognitive learning skills, positive self- image, self-esteem
and adds a positive perspective on how to view life as we become
adults. please take a few minutes to read the
