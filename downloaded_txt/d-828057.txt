collective consciousness (2019-21)created during two years of residency in chicago public schools, collective consciousness visually engages objects in educational space. the project was made against the backdrop of covid-19 and the civil unrest of 2020 while students were learning from home. the project was created through the cps lives residency program that places artists in chicago public schools for one-year residencies. this is a selection from the project. contact matt for a full pdf catalog.
