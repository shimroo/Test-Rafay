for most paintball fields, turf is the biggest must have purchase that will be made. it can be the most time consuming and expensive addition to any field, however if done correctly can yield a huge customer return.
 alpha turf is the only paintball turf that has been researched and proven for paintball use. that's right, we put our turf through actual paintball play and astm testing. insurance standard and astm standard testing is something you will only find with alpha turf. no other company independently tests its turf to the rigorous standards for safety and durability. plus no other company will back their product with a minimum 15 year warranty! 


 

 first introduced to the market as a solution to the growing demand for a portable paintball system, the alpha mega arena has changed the way field owners think about paintball. the alpha mega arena allows users to be completely portable with their paintball field operations or provide an onsite attraction as an addition to their current fields.
our inflatable arena allows for a complete setup with turf and bunkers in just over 1 hour. prefect for the portable business, parties, and events, the arena fully inflates in 9 minutes leaving you with a completely enclosed paintball arena. don't be fooled by "look-a-like" arenas, this is the real deal. we test all arenas for paintball and reball use by the set astm standards.
