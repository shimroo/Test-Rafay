attention:
when bringing firearms into a gun & knife show please follow these simple steps.

1. bring the firearm in with no 
ammunition in the weapon. 

2. notify
security if you have any ammunition.  they will check in all ammunition
as you enter. 

3. have firearm inspected and safety strapped so that
it may not operate 
inside the show. 

4. be sure to stop back
and retrieve ammunition on your way out 
of the show.  all straps
on firearms 
may be removed at that time. 

the only exception to
this rule is if 
you are a police officer with 
badge and i.d. 
or an officer 
on duty in uniform.
