embracing texas  pride in sportsmanship: our commitment to the texas way
at tgca we proudly endorse the texas way, an initiative that  champions sportsmanship, integrity, and community strength in texas sporting  events. 

    the texas way, founded by thsca, thsada, and 2words character development, aims to enhance  sportsmanship, reduce ejections, and foster positive relationships among  coaches, athletes, officials, fans, and the local community.

what is the texas way?
  the texas way is a collaborative campaign to:  

improve the level of sportsmanship at uil  sporting events.
decrease the number of ejections at uil sporting  events.
strengthen communities and the relationships  between coaches, athletes, officials, and fans.

the three pillars of the texas way 
    to coach, play, officiate, or support the texas way means you commit to the  following three pillars:

respect for others: we pledge to give respect to  all participants (coaches, players, officials, and fans) because of who i am,  not because of what they do.
control of self: we commit to give boundaries to  our thoughts, words, and actions, and to control our anger in the face of  competition and adversity.
spirit of competition: we commit to give  everything we have to be the absolute best we can be, and to put our team in  the best position to win, but we will not sacrifice our integrity to do it. 

by supporting the texas way, tgca is dedicated to  creating a positive and respectful sports environment, ensuring that the spirit  of competition thrives with self-control, integrity, and mutual respect. 
join us in playing the texas way and make a difference in  the texas sports community!

tgca certificate of senior achievement
the texas girls coaches association, along with our coaches and their athletes, were devastated when our schools were forced to close for the rest of the 2019-20 school year due to covid-19. this action resulted in the elimination of the spring sports' seasons. tgca is offering a template online for our coaches to be able to print a certificate of senior achievement for all senior athletes and senior support staff members that were unable to finish their seasons. we feel this is a way tgca and our coaches can show our appreciation and recognition for these very deserving individuals. the certificate template can be found at this link:
http://www.austintgca.com/pdf/cert_of_senior_achievement.pdf
it can also be found on the tgca website under the forms category in the menu on the left-hand side of the main page. it will also be located on each of the following individual sports pages: soccer, track, tennis, golf and softball. it is in an editable pdf format, so that you can fill in the athlete's name, the school and the sport. this is for you to print and distribute, if you wish, to your senior athletes in these spring sports.
