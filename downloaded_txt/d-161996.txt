  graduate programs 
  undergraduate programs 


we offer ph.d. programs in chemistry and in biochemistry. our graduate students study and work with faculty members on the frontiers of molecular science. we also have interdisciplinary programs in materials chemistry, molecular biophysics, theoretical chemistry, nanoscience and supramolecular chemistry, chemical biology, environmental chemistry, catalysis and energy science.
learn more
we offer bachelor of science (b.s.) degrees in chemistry and biochemistry; and a bachelor of arts (b.a.) in chemistry. our undergraduate program enables students to obtain comprehensive training in these central sciences along with coursework in associated fields like mathematics, physics and biology. the program emphasizes laboratory experience, research opportunities, analytical and communication skills, and the flexibility for students to pursue their own interests. students will be well prepared for professional employment, graduate work or any health profession.
