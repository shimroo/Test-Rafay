welcome to talentplus
a lot has changed in show business since we opened our doors in 1977 but the core of what we do hasn't changed much. 
we join our partners in bringing their creative vision to life with the right set of characters for events, commercials, social media campaigns, product launches, and photo shoots. through all of our projects and all of our connections, there are two things you can always rely on from us:
 
 
passion + integrity
