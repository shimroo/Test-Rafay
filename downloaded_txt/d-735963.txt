dr robinson's parts emporium is here to help keep your

air-cooled vw alive and on the road with lots of used vw parts. 
we sell used volkswagen parts to help your
classic vw
rebuild / restoration. 
we are not a scrap yard. we
do however have lots of used car parts stored on our shelves, we buy cars to
save and clear workshops and garages and have an independent specialist who
pulls apart any dead but complete vehicles for us leaving us with the best bits for
you.

  we buy any car - well, any
classic / vw... and

parts and a computer... this is supposed to be fun! 

  


 parts emporium - the online
classic vw autojumble for old volkswagens, have an internet rummage. the original vw
saveyard. 



  

location
- i
am on the herts / beds border near junction 10 of the a1m (5 miles) - or 18
miles from junction 13 of the m1 (hitchin, letchworth, luton, baldock, stevenage,
milton keynes area) - monday to friday only. sometimes parts can be collected from milton keynes
(some evenings or weekends) -  visitors by appointment only
please - this means talking to me before you are at the bottom of the road!
 
i do not have a catalogue
as i try to keep the website 100% up to date and thus any valuable/interesting
items will be listed on here if i have them in stock! if there isn't a bonnet
for a '53 oval, or a door for a '66 split listed ... its because i don't have
one!

i don't sell
parts for your 2015 passat! - air cooled rules! (although there are a few water-cooled
bits creeping in....)

prices you see are what you
pay -  no vat!

 i have a few nos items, but most items are in "not-nos"
 © condition... 
 used!




 postage is available for
small/light items to the
uk mainland only! i can not put glass in the post... it breaks! i would expect you
to collect items such as wheels, bumpers, engines, seats, bonnets, doors, gearboxes etc!

 thanks for looking... and
please come back another time!

  i'm actually not as grumpy as i seem... really!

evolved since that time into the amazing site that you see today...well, i've
seen worse!  i'd like to thank you for your support in what has been a
strange period in life for us all ... keep your dog on its lead at all times...enjoy your vw, treat your friends well and
treat others as you would like to be treated by them... no smoking please... get out there and enjoy
life...  its easy to sit at home and complain and wait for stuff to happen...its
harder to make things happen... clunk click every trip...
wibble...  will the aliens be naked? ....  make an effort and it will be a more fruitful
life that you lead...  no ball games...
planet vacant is a strange place.. its a way of life.. you can choose your friends ...

baydriving, flat4thrashing, cal-lookin, aircooledfun. racing can be fun if you
do it right,  have a laugh, it might be your last chance, it aint what you
do its the way that you do it...  the handshake seals the contract.
... i'm gonna build a boat and call it dignity.... its all luck ...... does any one read this
anyway?
