student stories














shelby l. ('27)
"even though i’m just a first-year student at de toledo, i’ve already been amazed by how much of a positive environment there is at this school. everyone is made to feel so comfortable from the very first day. there is so much kindness here."















sammy s. ('24)
"when i first started at de toledo, i didn’t know a single person and was really worried about fitting in. that’s why being part of the peer mentor program – where as a freshman i was paired up with a senior – was so great for me.  i immediately had a friend and a mentor."















carly k. ('25)
"at de toledo, there’s so much emphasis on making a difference in our local communities.  for me, that meant starting a club called “hearts for humanity,” where we make lunches and provide clothes for those in need."















jake s. ('24)
"i love how the teachers at de toledo genuinely help you maximize your academic potential.  when i first started here, i was struggling with math and my teacher took extra time out of her schedule to work with me one-on-one. now, math is my favorite class."















jessie l. ('24)
"one of the most impactful opportunities i’ve had at de toledo is being part of the medical science academy.  all the research and experiments on the brain i’ve done in the program are definitely driving me in the direction of studying neuroscience when i get to college."















ben r. ('25)
"the school is always helping students find ways to create the perfect class schedule that allows us to develop our unique passions.  for me, that meant making sure i had time for robotics, music, and baseball."















shaun s. (‘24) 
"my dean gave me her personal phone number so i could call her any time day or night for help with math problems."















nitzan w. ('24)
"the de toledo shabbaton is like an ‘out-of-body’ experience.  it’s so emotional and transformational, and maybe more than anything, it creates your strongest friendships."















aaron m. (’25)
"i decided to join de toledo’s medical science academy in order to increase my exposure to bio-medical engineering, which is the course of study i’m going to pursue in college."















sammy s. ('24)
"from the day you start at de toledo, the idea of focusing on “ap kindness” and being an “a+ human being” is ingrained in us.  very quickly, sometimes without even knowing it, you just start doing good deeds for others in a very automatic, natural way."















ben r. ('25)
"the de toledo robotics program is pushing me to use my brain and my creativity to develop solutions for complex problems."















shelby l. ('27)
"being part of the volleyball team has been really special for me. it’s been a great way to make new friends and just really feel a sense of closeness and team spirit with my teammates."















aaron m. (’25)
"de toledo’s robotics team is special in so many ways.  we’re one of the few schools i know where the students on the team are actually empowered to build robots ourselves from the ground-up. we have so much freedom and creativity to design everything by ourselves. "















nitzan w. ('24)
"when i started at de toledo in the 9th grade, i was too afraid to even read a text aloud in front of my classmates.  now, i’m reading scenes from othello by myself in front of the whole class. that transformation would never have happened unless my teachers took a personal interest in my growth and development."















jake s. ('24)
"as part of de toledo’s global jewish education program, i spent time abroad in israel. that experience was something i’ll never forget and made me feel jewish in a way i never truly felt before."















ben r. ('25)
"at de toledo, i feel like there’s this really unique combination of jewish values, community, and a culture of kindness you won’t find anywhere else."















carly k. ('25)
"being involved in theatre has also really helped me overcome my shyness. it’s given me a level of confidence i never had before."















jake s. ('24)
"at de toledo, we have so many group retreats and social activities; it makes it easy to make new friends... even for someone like me who used to be really shy."















ben r. ('25)
"i feel like the experiences i’ve had in the de toledo robotics program are leading me toward pursuing engineering and computer science in college."















nitzan w. ('24)
"de toledo’s teachers are so unique: they connect with students and really care about us."
