packing instructions
for your instruments protection!
the best way to pack your instruments is to
put cardboard over tachometers to protect the pointers, speedometers, gauges
and clocks without a lens. do not use
duct or clear tape when installing cardboard over the faces of your instruments. 
use masking tape or a painter's blue or
green tape. next,
pack them in bubble wrap. many clients then take their instruments to the
ups store and they pack them in white peanuts.  this is not right,
the white peanuts settle in the box and can cause your instruments to be
damaged. before you take them to the ups double box them yourself and then
use white peanuts to fill around the boxes. do not use the white peanuts
without double boxing as damage can occur. this is the best way to pack
your instruments! the tachman wants to insure our clients know how to pack
their classic instruments so damage will not occur.

many clients are shipping their instruments in a way that they could
get damaged.  the above picture shows how i return your instruments
after they are serviced.  above is a speedometer and tachometer with
cardboard over the dials and using blue painters tape to secure the cardboard. 
after performing the above operation, use bubble wrap around the instruments
to protect them.  if you wrap the bubble wrap with tape, be gentle
so the dials will not get bent. do not use duct tape, scotch tape, etc
as this is difficult to remove and the instrument dial can get damaged.

this web site is dedicated to
my son george joseph herbert, who drowned on june 8, 1999.  he was
my right hand man in the late 1990's and may i add he enjoyed working with
all the classic car clients he knew.  it's hard to go on when your
son and best friend is gone, but we need to hang in there and cling to
the hope we are going to meet again.  he was only 22 years old when
he drowned, a veteran of the united states air force and my pride and joy.
god bless my angel! john 3:16, acts 16:31,
romans 10:9, romans 10:13.
