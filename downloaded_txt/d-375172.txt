monday, february 17, 2025 – what greenland’s indigenous inuit really want (and it’s not to be a part of america)greenland hasn’t had this much attention from america since the william taft administration. rhetoric, and even a few congressional proposals, are flying over the prospect of the united states purchasing — or perhaps invading — the autonomous territory of denmark. strategic positioning and untapped mineral resources are the main drivers of the argument. the likelihood of such an action appears remote. the inuit people, who make up the vast majority of the population, are more seriously focused on independence from the colonial power of denmark and cooperative efforts to reduce the effects of climate change. we’ll hear from elected leaders and other greenland residents about the current political pressures.
