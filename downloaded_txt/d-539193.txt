												america seems not to know that war with iran is impossible—islamic countries simply don’t exist  											


												sorcha faal											

january 4, 2020


a thought-provoking new ministry of foreign affairs (mofa) report circulating in the kremlin today discussing an official statement released by the government of the islamic republic of iran stating that “the deputy head of the hashed, abu mahdi al-muhandis, and head of the quds force, qasem soleimani, were killed in a us strike that targeted their car on the baghdad international airport road”, says this gravely concerning event prompted foreign minister sergey lavrov to call and remind his american counterpart us secretary of state mike pompeo that “the assassination of soleimani violates the norms of international law”—a reminder followed by foreign ministry spokesperson maria zakharova warning that soleimani’s assassination “would only escalate regional tensions and make life worse for millions of people”—a fact apparently not known by the american people reading such headlines as “fears of all-out war grow after u.s. kills iran gen. qasem soleimani” and “world war 3 proof: horrifying reason trump’s iran raid really could spark global conflict”—a war that could never occur because iran is not an actual country, nor are any other so-called islamic nations—all of whose present borders, rulers and governments are imaginary western constructs—and in reality sees all them being a part of what the islamic faith itself calls dar al-islam—a term describing all muslim peoples as one nation not bound by any borders—that stands opposed to those countries which do not have a treaty of nonaggression or peace with muslims called dar al-harb—and were forever enshrined in islamic law during the umayyad caliphate in the 7th century—thus creating a world, that for the past over 1,300 years, has seen dar al-islam and dar al-harb being locked in perpetual war—with the objective of dar al-islam being to force dar al-harb into a state of dar al-‘ahd—a designation for peoples and/or nations that have a treaty of non-aggression or peace with muslims—the last such example in history being the armenian peoples who were the dar al-‘ahd of the islamic ottoman empire in the early 20th century—but upon the outbreak of world war i, saw the armenian people breaking their dar al-‘ahd agreement by taking up arms against the islamic ottoman empire—thus turning the armenian peoples into dar al-harb whom the muslims then slaughtered by the millions.   […]

a thought-provoking new security council (sc) report circulating in the kremlin today discussing the “coronavirus pandemic war” and noting president putin welcoming the idea to boost the domestic tourism industry once this pandemic crisis is over, nevertheless admits that the emergence from this crisis will see a vastly different world than existed before—the outlines of which are being predicted by iranian foreign minister mehdi sanaei, who says the globalist-socialist “new world order” will no longer exist after the coronavirus exits, specifically because the united nations has proven itself incapable of effectively countering the crisis—a global crisis of multiple-dimensions and scope now seeing everything from peoples in europe torching 5g towers over coronavirus fears to british police arresting two men because they printed “pubs closed, borders open” coronavirus stickers that offended socialist sensibilities—which are typical banal (unoriginal) responses frequently seen in socialist societies whose bereft of true facts and knowledge citizens and authorities can always be expected to lash out in lunatic leftist hysteria when confronted by events they fear and don’t understand—but in doing so, makes them incapable of being prepared for the even greater horrors to come—that in this case are the rapidly looming famines being caused by this pandemic warned to be of “biblical proportions”, that now sees an additional 130-million people around the world pushed to the brink of starvation.

								fbi raids hillary clinton “death factory”							


								by sorcha faal in clinton foundation															
while fbi investigators in washington d.c. were becoming “highly concerned” as to why hillary clinton’s law firm was paying medcure founder janis locenieks hundreds-of-thousands of dollars, this report continues, fbi investigators in las vegas, at the same time, became “shockingly alarmed” after they discovered that cia gun runner and human smuggler stephen paddock made regular deliveries to the medcure facility in henderson, nevada—and though svr intelligence analysts do not suggest that paddock was using medcure as a “body dumping station”, they do stunningly note that nevada has the worst laws governing human remains in the entire us—whose elected or appointed sheriffs are mandated by law to be coroners, even without medical education—and who are, also, the sole determiner as to the cause of death—thus making this state the “perfect/ideal” location to rid oneself of the unwanted bodies of those killed during illegal human smuggling operations.     […]

fail: washington post hoax on trump’s “top secret time travel project” 
the washington post bravely risks it all to reveal that by 2016, donald trump used his access to gen. michael flynn to quietly direct darpa, then in secret works with cern in switzerland, to commission the first  time machine ever constructed. the result? an epic rap battle between trump and anne frank.

hearst boasted fake news is the enemy of the people, causes warsnewspaper publisher william randolph hearst boasted in a cable to his photographer in cuba "you furnish the pictures. i'll furnish the war." sure enough, his papers started the spanish-american war. back in the day fake news was called yellow journalism, but it is one and the same, the enemy of the people. 




was 9/11 a nuclear event? 

 view online or download pdf.  1,000 times more damning than 9/11 commission’s 28 pages’, ‘american holocaust: 9/11 an irrefutable nuclear event, over 42,000 deaths and counting — veterans today nuclear event evidence compilation leaked fbi 9/11 evidence against bush, clinton, blair and netanyahu too staggering to ignore. if a picture is worth a thousand words, here’s some culled from thousands implicating them all, saudis included.



uncle sam sayeth unto thee 

despite its failures, the truth is the press still can save us, and even the shadow elites admit it. in the meantime, don’t count on it. remember that there is no jailer more powerful than one who can imprison your mind, and that enslavement is the job of the news broadcaster dedicated to creating a fear-based reality and not reflecting life it as it really is. 
remember that citizen journalism works, and never rely on a single source.



rare candor from the corporate media 

“there is no such thing… in america, as an independent press… if i allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. the business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. you know it and i know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? we are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes… our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. we are intellectual prostitutes.” john swinton,new york times chief editor 1880
