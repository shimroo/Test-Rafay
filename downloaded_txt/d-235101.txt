~*~latest bits~*~
thought about starting a blog cause i like to try out new stuff..... but...... i am way to lazy. so this is a "catch up when you can" for me to post my boring / interesting bits of news / gossip.
here's the latest news been a while since i updated.....still at college....still working most of my spare time saving for a car.enjoyed my clerical work placement at the health centre aw bless lotsa babies and seniors.oooo yeah saw beverley knight at manchester academy on the 13th of april,she was "wikid" best concert i have ever seen,i'm still buzzin'! you have to check this girl out.not much time to work on the dolls n' blinkies etc exams coming up but i'll try to add when i can.by the way i have a web cam now ok i know i said i would never have one but...well...hmm....anyways here are a couple of pics.



 
had my first trip to the horse races...slap up meal...big hats...but my horse didn't run fast enough ( his name was "spliff" maybes had something to do with it! ) was an excellent day though and lucky you get to see me avec bigggg hat better than a win eh? ;)
