“connecting with like-minded women from around the world who are also passionate about trade is what i love most about owit.   it has expanded my global network, helped me tap into new business opportunities….and even turned international contacts into amazing friendships!  that’s what has kept me part of it for 20 years.”



										susan baka, vp international, owit toronto, 2018 owit woman of the year, president, bay communications & marketing inc.

										barbara mowat, owit international partner, president, groyourbiz ltd.									




“being part of the tampa bay chapter of owit for the past year has been an empowering and eye-opening experience. as a young professional new to the world of global trade, i have found the support and knowledge i need to pave my own path. it’s a wonderful feeling to know i have not only my own chapter, but these fellow members around the world by my side as i learn and grow in my career.”



										madison lawson, vp membership, owit tampa bay, international business manager, tampa hillsborough economic development corp.

owit has had a tremendous positive influence on both my professional and personal life. over 17 years and during my interactions with 4 different chapters, my involvement with owit has led to at least one new job, significant board of director experience, several useful insights related to my profession in trade finance, and innumerable friends and business contacts.
