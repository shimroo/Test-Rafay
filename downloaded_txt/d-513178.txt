when i first shadowed bfc, i enjoyed the feel of the school … they had all the clubs and activities i wanted. since attending foley, i've made many friends and have done activities i didn't think i would do.
- maddy kubacki, class of '24







i love attending bishop foley because of the family-like environment. the teacher to student ratio is low, so you can build a strong relationship with the teachers and other staff.
- michael drozdowicz, class of '24







bishop foley gives each student the opportunity to thrive in and out of the classrooms. both the staff and students are very goal oriented and are driven to aspire to greatness all while being authentically catholic. the curriculum is challenging and the teachers know just how to help students due to the smaller class sizes.
 
- violet potempski, class of '23







at foley i can find support from my teachers, counselors or anyone in administration. i feel comfortable asking teachers for help or advice when i need it. foley has really set me up for an excellent future and has helped me prepare for my future.
- gabriella irvin, class of '23







i enjoy attending bishop foley because of many reasons, the most important being the faith environment and the amazing friends i've made. the school puts a huge emphasis on both areas of life, while also providing academically rigorous courses and brilliant teachers to convey the information, making it the best high school for anyone interested.
- eleanor takach, class of '24







“bishop foley is a school that supports you not as a student, but as a person. they put in their time and work for you and the school is filled with welcoming students. it is a warm environment, and any student would feel welcome walking through the doors for the first time.”
- rosalyn lass, class of '26
