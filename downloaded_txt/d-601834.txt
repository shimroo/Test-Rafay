turn your yard into a secure enclosure






















(210)736-2287(833)230-2936info@catfence.com


























a safe and humane containment systemmost domestic cats have a strong desire to be outside, enjoying fresh air, sunshine and the natural environment. however, they can readily escape from any yard with a conventional fence. this subjects them to the dangers of the street: they can be lost, hit by cars, attacked by other animals, or picked up by animal control.














the affordable cat fence provides effective and humane cat containment by turning your yard into a secure enclosure. rather than causing pain to your pets through electric fences or collars, our cat fence is a barrier of netting supported by heavy-gauge steel brackets which attach to your existing fence. the barrier angles into your yard providing an overhang which cats will not climb. there is also a vertical component inhibiting the entry of feral cats and other animals from outside your yard.






































the affordable cat fence was developed by don barnes, an animal behaviorist/animal activist for over 40 years, with the help of the 16 cats who lived with him. he designed his system after buying another cat fence that proved unsatisfactory, and then decided to offer his system to everyone who cares about their feline friends.we are unique in that our fence is custom-built for your yard. unlike other cat fences that come in kits or panels, you donâ€™t have to buy more than you need. we will work closely with you to answer your questions and solve your specific containment problems.email us or fill out our order inquiry form to get started!
