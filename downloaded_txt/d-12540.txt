welcome!
we started kinsman company over 40 years ago, in 1981, near our home in point pleasant, pa on the delaware river. graham grew up in england where gardens are everywhere - and his aunties and uncles really did dig for victory. he has fond childhood memories of home grown fruits and veggies, as well as beautiful flowers.
gardening is your connection to the entire natural world: plants, birds, insects - and don't forget the frogs and toads! every flower you grow draws you closer to the living wonders that surround us.
