in the face of difficulty, opposition, and especially the threat of
natural catastrophe, nuclear war, or societal collapse.















thank you for defending the constitution!



(january 22, 2013) i am not going to remain silent while the constitutional rights of u.s. citizens continue to be threatened. violation of the second amendment is a tyrannical, all-out assault on liberty. no amount of propaganda can change this fact. many americans fought and died for the freedoms we enjoy in our country. thank you to members of the military and law enforcement who honor and keep their oath to defend the constitution. thank you for doing what is right! best wishes to you all! - eric a. cassano


orders we will not obey - oathkeepers.org
many thanks to these law enforcement officers! - cspoa.org











violation of the second amendment
is a tyrannical, all-out assault on liberty.














the second amendment
to the united states constitution

a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
