what we do:







since 1990, the san diego housing federation has worked to ensure that all san diegans, regardless of income, have a chance at a safe, stable and affordable place to call home. we do this by offering education, advancing smart policies and growing the capacity of those who build, finance and advocate for homes that are affordable to san diegans in need: working families, returning veterans, seniors and those living with mental and physical disability.key principles explained






   


“home is… a place we all deserve – no matter our color, no matter our religion, no matter our beliefs. we all deserve a home.”

— rickie brown, city heights community development corporation

   







 

share your story with ushome is...

 

last year, as we celebrated the season of giving, we asked our members and residents to tell us what home is to them. we received an array of answers from love to safety and security, but the main thing we found is that home is the foundation of our lives and can represent so much to each of us. what does home mean to you? if you would like to participate in our home is campaign or share your story, please contact sarah buchanan.
