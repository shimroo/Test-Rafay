tri-ang model railways




this site is dedicated to tri-ang railways. this range
  of products was manufactured between 1950 and 1965 in the united kingdom, by the lines
  brothers group of companies. the main factory was at margate in the south east of england.
  for many this range was the affordable introduction into the world of model railways

site introduction



tri-ang railways 
1950-1965



dave mccarthy, cardiff, wales, 
    uk 

january 2011 site under 
  revision. 2008 introduction below.
the site is now over 
  500 megs and there are over 28,000 files in it.
it was mainly created 
  when we all used dial-up modems and all the files were kept small for 
  reasonable download speeds. by today's standards the images are rather small 
  and 'poor' quality, but the site is too large to start trying to improve this, 
  so i hope you will still enjoy the contents which i believe provide the most 
  comprehensive source of information on tri-ang trains on the web.
regards to all,
dave
 


greetings, and welcome to my 
site.
 
revised january 2008
the site is now nine years 
old, having been first created in march 1999 
(my original introductions are shown below). 
the site has grown out of 
all proportion and now consists of nearly 2,000 pages and eight thousand 
pictures. it is made up of four main sections. tri-ang oo, tri-ang tt, tri-ang 
big big trains  and tri-ang minic motorways.
the site is completely my 
own, and is done for no commercial gain. it is purely my attempt to share my 
hobby and interest with others and try and provide a photographic record of the 
products manufactured under the tri-ang railways and associated lines. 
it has been joined with a
new site on airfix model railways 
and railway kits.
the number of visitors from 
all over the world to the site has grown and grown. it is staggering to me to 
find that i have had so many from australia, canada, new zealand and south 
africa, all places that tri-ang / lines bros. had factories, and where the 
memories are obviously still there. to all of you i say welcome and thanks for 
visiting the site, it gives me great encouragement to continue.
many people contacted me. 
unfortunately, so many that i fail to reply to a lot of them. my apologies to 
you all.  the guest book has been a help in this.
i have made many new 
friends and acquaintances through the site, many, too many for me to mention,  
have helped me develop techniques and ideas for improvements. i am always 
looking out for ideas, so if you have any, please let me know.
most of the photographs on 
the site are taken by me using a digital camera which has made all the 
difference. many people have been very kind and let me photograph items for the 
site, in fact many people have brought along items for me to include. i have 
also been sent many images for me to include.
there are a few images 
which i have acquired from a variety of unknown sources and i have included them 
to try and provide a comprehensive guide  my thanks to any unknown contributors. 
if any of these are yours and i have been unable to contact you then please let 
me know and i shall obviously credit you or remove them if you wish, please 
remember they are only used to share information with other enthusiasts about 
the tri-ang products. please e-mail me.  again thanks to all.
 
thanks and best wishes for 
now, dave.
 
 
original introduction 1999:-
this is my first attempt at creating a web site, 
thus combining two of my interests, collecting tri-ang railways and computing. 
the tri-ang railways side of the interest (obsession!) started with a ubiquitous 
princess train set for christmas 1960. then followed long periods of catalogue 
thumbing, unfortunately without the finance to do anything about it. then i grew 
up, or so i thought at the time, the train set vanished, fortunately only to the 
loft.
pat hammond's excellent book, "the story 
of rovex, volume 1 1950-1965", then became my downfall. as soon as i picked it 
up i was hooked. 30+ years just disappeared. i was back to "catalogue thumbing" 
in a big way. i had always gone to swapmeets being interested in a variety of 
die-cast toys. some how, although the tri-ang items had always been there, i 
suddenly saw them.
now two to three years later, i am into tri-ang 
railways in a big way. finance whilst being better than in the 60's is still 
limited so i don't collect mint boxed, but scour the swapmeets for good 
condition items. i enjoy this much more than having enough money to buy it when 
i see it and usually if i wait long enough one will turn up in fair condition at 
a reasonable price.
pat hammond's book is invaluable as a source for 
reference for all the variations, and the other items as well as rolling stock. 
so much so that his details of the tri-ang layouts for shops lead me to building 
my own.  i decided to build it using standard track throughout, rather than the 
mix of standard and series 3 as in the original. the search to make it totally 
accurate led me to spend a long time looking for items not usually prized. the 
missing items in the pictures, early engine shed, and original curved sidewalls 
have now been found and the layout is now exhibited complete.
my interest in computers has lead to me using the 
scanner to intake pages from rather tatty originals and photo retouch. some 
samples are attached, unfortunately to make them small enough for the site the 
quality is rather poor, but reducing from 20+ megs to 50k is bound to take its 
toll.
enough of an introduction, i hope if you find this 
you may find it interesting, any feedback/advice would be appreciated.
