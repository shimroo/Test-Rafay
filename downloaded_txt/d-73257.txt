what is dzogchen
it is the ultimate teaching of tibet, the natural great perfection.it is an outlook, a perspective.it is simple, effortless, profound, relaxing, and it is right here right now.it is empty, open, natural and luminous, the true nature of our spiritual mind.it is accessible through moment-to-moment mindful awareness, which brings out our intrinsic openness, acceptance and equanimity.the spirit of dzogchen is joyful and light as well as being a wise outlook and vast perspective.

the hardest thing about dzogchen is how to pronounce it (zo-chen)
