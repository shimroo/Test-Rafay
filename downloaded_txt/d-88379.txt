long ago in the lost land, forgotten by all its people now, there was the beginning	of that gold-linked chain of yours, iron and bronze and water and fire …


… the land is neither of the dark nor the light, nor ever was. …



… its enchantment was of a separate kind, the magic of the mind and the hand and the eye, that owes no allegiance because it is neither good nor bad. …


… it has no more to do with the behaviour of men, or the great absolutes of the light and the dark, than does the blossom of a rose or the leaping curve of a fish.
