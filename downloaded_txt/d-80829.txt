gigglechick is back!

*tap tap* is this thing on?
hey… it’s been a minute… or it’s been 12 years since my original gigglechick.com site bit the dust and had it’s domain snagged by someone 6000 miles away. granted, i really had been letting my blog collect dust for a few years prior to that because i got hooked on zuck’s monster and was posting there every 3 seconds rather than every 2.5 seconds to my own site. 
yadda yadda yadda… that said… i’m trying to wean myself off of that app as well as the others… especially after the gathering of the oligarchs a few days ago. that pretty much was a kick in the seat of the pants to get back to basics and back to my own site.
so, seeing as i regained my domain a few years ago, have been paying for hosting and not doing anything with this, i am going to try to come back here… 
well, i am going to post this bit of drivel to see what it looks like [again, i haven’t set any sort of design up for this site yet as of 01.22.2025 when i’m posting.]
