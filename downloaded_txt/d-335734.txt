wabi-sabi: for artists, designers, poets & philosophers
(1994) this is the book that introduced the term “wabi-sabi” to the non-japanese world. every book with "wabi" or "wabi sabi" in the title is based on the concepts elucidated in this book.an excerpt“wabi-sabi is a beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. it is a beauty of things modest and humble. it is a beauty of things unconventional. . . . “wabi-sabi is the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of what we think of as traditional japanese beauty. it occupies roughly the same position in the japanese pantheon of aesthetic values as do the greek ideals of beauty and perfection in the west. wabi-sabi can in its fullest expression be a way of life. at the very least, it is a particular type of beauty.“the closest english word to wabi-sabi is probably ‘rustic.’ webster’s defines ‘rustic’ as ‘simple, artless, or unsophisticated . . . [with] surfaces rough or irregular.’ while ‘rustic’ represents only a limited dimension of the wabi-sabi aesthetic, it is the initial impression may people have when they first see a wabi-sabi expression. wabi-sabi does share some characteristics with what we commonly call ‘prinitive art,’ that is, objects that are earthy, simple, unpretentious, and fashioned out of natural materials. unlike primitive art, though, wabi-sabi almost never is used representationally of symbolically. . . .”










































what artists do
(2018) the work of artists differs in substance, spirit, and methodology from other types of work. this book highlights these differences with examples from the lives of six seminal 20th-century artists.an excerpt“those who make art we call artists. anyone can be an artist. there are no tests to take, no certification required, and no particular skills needed. similarly, anyone can call themselves an artist. (conversely, anyone can be an artist but not call themselves one.) accordingly, there are as many ways to be an artist as there are people on the planet. “artists create from a subjective point of view:                                -this is what i see. (or would like to see. or could imagine. . . .)                                                                                         -this is what i hear.                                                                            -this is what i feel.                                                                                    -this is what i think.                                                                           -this is what i believe.                                                                      -this is what i question.                                                                   -this is what i am curious about.                                                    -this is what i want to manifest.                                                       -this is what i am. (or could be. or would like to be. . . . )“artists are cognitively grounded in the aesthetic. that is, they are aware of, and think about, the sensory and emotive qualities of phenomena and things. absolutely anything can be the object of aesthetic consideration, even things that don’t seem in the least bit sensuous, like a series of random numbers or an abstract idea.“every artist formulates their own problems to solve and sets their own criteria for success. . . .”




































on creating things aesthetic
(2023) a pared-down explanation of the mental operations involved when creating things of an aesthetic nature, i.e., art, design, and the like.  an excerpt“the use of the word ‘practice’ as in ‘her creative practice involves . . .’ began showing up with increased frequency during the 1970s in academic papers relating to conceptual art. the conceptual artists of that period produced many interesting ideas but few, if any, physical artifacts. so what were the critics and the art historians of that era to write about? 	“fortunately most conceptual artists could articulate, with remarkable clarity and specificity, the substance and subtleties of their thinking. this articulation was perceived to be a part of the art itself. ‘practice’ then became the term used to denote the totality of thought, intention, and action constituting a conceptual artist’s working life—at least according to those writing about it. “subsequently, as contemporary art in general began to evolve in a more idea-driven (i.e., conceptual) direction, this use of ‘practice’ expanded even further. today the term is used by most creators in the aesthetic domains to describe the essential contours of their working lives and creative production.”

musings of a curious aesthete
(2020) both a memoir and a design critique—with a smattering of ethics and morality thrown in. illustrations by marco koren.an excerpt“on a brilliant autumn afternoon when the sky was blue and the temperature mild, i was inspired to do some outdoor housekeeping. leaves, twigs, and other vegetable matter had piled up on the wood and concrete steps that ran through our garden. i realized, of course, that as soon as i finished removing this debris it would immediately return. i was okay with that. i have accepted a quasi-sisyphean view of things. after selecting an appropriate broom and collection basket, i began my work. my pace was slow and measured. the stairs were irregular and cracked in places, so i moved even more slowly so as not to miss any of the bits and pieces crammed into the nooks and crannies. why rush anyway? i was beginning to enjoy this.                  “sweeping up nature’s refuse isn’t typically considered an act of exceptional consequence. i knew this. so i was surprised when a peculiar idea insinuated itself front and center into my awareness: ‘with every sweep of this broom i am restoring order. and by restoring order—if only momentarily—i am saving the universe.’  “it was a crazy notion, of that i was certain. nevertheless, it felt as true as anything i had ever believed. how, i wondered, could this be? later that day an answer came: just as nature has given us a mind capable of perceiving our role in the overarching scheme of existence, nature has also given us a mind capable of creating meaning out of just about anything. furthermore, nature has given us a mind with the ability to believe that the meanings we create are actually true.”

the flower shop: charm, grace, beauty, tenderness in a commercial context

wabi-sabi: further thoughts
(2015) a complement to wabi-sabi: for artists, designers, poets & philosophers. of particular interest to design and aesthetics theorists, and other conceptual creators. an excerpt“in 1994 i introduced the term ‘wabi-sabi’ in a book titled wabi-sabi: for artists, designers, poets & philosophers. the observations and principles identified in the book as wabi-sabi have probably always been of interest to the aesthetically inclined, but perhaps they had never before been conveyed with such rhetorical intensity, or at such a receptive cultural moment. as a consequence, many people found the book’s vocabulary and conceptual schemes useful in describing aspects of their work. some even found inspiration for making new things. over time, other writers and thinkers began incorporating these theories and elucidations into new books about wabi-sabi. “i was generally gratified by the widespread acceptance of the wabi-sabi paradigm. however, in the book’s zeal to present the concept in an easy-to-comprehend manner, it omitted an explanation of the circumstances under which the japanese words ‘wabi’ and ‘sabi’ came to be conjoined. this has contributed to numerous misconceptions about wabi-sabi’s actual place in japanese history. the present volume has been written, in part, to untangle these misunderstandings. it aims to clarify exactly how wabi-sabi came to be and, in the process, further illuminate its character. (on another level, the text itself is a methodological ‘how to’ intended for those involved in creating new aesthetic paradigms.) . . .” 






























making wet: the magazine of gourmet bathing
(2012) the story, in pictures and words, of the making of a seminal avant-garde publication of the 1970s-80s.  an excerpt“people often assume that i've always been interested in bathing. but this isn't so. my fascination really only began while in architecture school. like most of my classmates, i was initially drawn to the heroic architectures du jour, modern–the taut, muscular variety–and then proto-postmodern. when those love affairs soured, i became curious about less self-conscious, more humane approaches to place-making. this led me to small, intimate environments: the kinds of places you go to feel safe and secure, the kinds of places that induce you to ‘let go’ and ‘be yourself.’ the japanese tea room–despite its very appealing form and philosophy–was too culturally specific for the vague purposes i had in mind. i sought a species of enclosed space that offered similar possibilities for transcendental experience but was more universally available. “that's when i discovered the bathroom. bathrooms are everywhere. just about everyone has one. and every bathroom, no matter how crude or sophisticated, comes equipped with all the elements of a primal poetry: “water and/or steam hot, cold, and in between. nakedness. quietude. illumination. . . .”

17 beautiful men taking  a shower
(1975) edition of 300. one of a series of bath-art projects that also included the silkscreen print “23 beautiful women taking a bath.”
























gardens of gravel and sand
2000) a philosophical enquiry into japanese “rock gardens” and what they might (and might not) mean. an excerpt “all the photographs in this book, various configurations and treatments of gravel and sand, were taken during may 1999 in kyoto, japan. many of the photographs were shot at formal 'dry landscape'—kare-san-sui—gardens located on the grounds of zen buddhist temples or former samurai villas now under zen buddhist caretaking. others were documented at either non-zen buddhist temples or shinto shrines. none of the photographs, however, is intended to be visually descriptive of the particular place in toto where it was taken. the non-specificity of the locations—almost as if the photographs could have been taken anyplace—is intended to limit distraction from our subject matter: gardens of gravel and sand. “the inclusion of trees and shrubs, which are often seen just adjacent to the gravel or sand, was also avoided in the picture taking whenever possible. plant materials represent a dynamic of nature wherein things grow effortlessly of their own accord. the making of gardens of gravel and sand, conversely, represents a conscious attempt to not let nature blithely proceed as it will. a well-maintained gravel or sand garden demands constant opposition to nature’s tendencies with regular cleaning, weeding, raking, and/or re-forming. “finally, rocks, too, were avoided, although often this was not possible. rocks are the 'celebrity' features of many japanese  gardens. they are prominently positioned everywhere. they are fawned over and sometimes even given individual names. hence the adoring english sobriquet, 'japanese rock garden.' but these same cherished rocks also cause many people to overlook the 'lowly' gravel and sand—or to dismiss it as mere background to the rocks’ exalted 'figure' status. “by severely reducing these extraneous and/or antagonistic visual and conceptual elements, what have we lost? we’ve thrown away predictable images of idealized japanese gardens. we’ve jettisoned obsessive emphasis on 'profound connoisseurship,' 'extraordinary sensitivity,' or highly specialized skill in garden design and construction. and we’ve obliterated at least 1,500 years of chinese and japanese garden history, hazy at best, virtually none of which is devoted to the gravel and sand anyway. . . .”
