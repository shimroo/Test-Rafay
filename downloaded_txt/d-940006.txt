is a diy vegas trip a good idea? 
the short answer is no, and the long answer is definitely not!  vegas is a small town on a big scale with lots to see and lots to do.  with all the different options available, upgrades, and costs involved, it can get quite confusing and a bit overwhelming, especially when trying to make arrangements for a milestone event in an unfamiliar city.   
words of advice:  planning a bachelorette party in las vegas should not be done last-minute. las vegas is "the entertainment capital of the world, and on any given day, there are thousands and thousands of visitors, that so many of the strip's hotels and resorts book up quickly. 
securing airfare and accommodations should be high on your checklist to make sure you get what you want and what you can afford.  everyone's financial situation is different, which can make the planning process a bit challenging. everyone has to get on the same page.  
it's all about communication and compromise, and remembering a bachelorette party is all about the bride . by working with one of our expert vip hosts, providing your budget information and expectations, you will be given all the options and the costs upfront.

last-minute reservations can potentially cost more.  depending on the clubs' supply and demand, bottle service minimums may increase for particular sections the week leading up to your party.  for example, suppose you are looking to make a table reservation at a specific club with a specific table or section. in that case, you should make your reservations and put a deposit down the moment you have enough money to do so.  again, our vip hosts can help you with this. trying to do this on your own can be a daunting task! 
before you land in vegas, be sure to have an itinerary of everything you want to visit. even though the las vegas strip is only 4.2 miles, frequent trips back and forth from one end to the next could take up a large portion of your day.  
 important note: please be wary of asking cab drivers to take you to the best nightclubs as certain clubs may commission them for bringing in guests.  also, with the current climate, many lyft and uber drivers are choosing not to drive, making it extremely difficult to get rides on the strip.  even during prime hours, it may take 30-45 minutes to secure a ride-sharing vehicle to transport you from one end of the strip to the other. 
when you book our services, it's seamless and straightforward. we can assist you with both bottle service reservations at one of the mega-clubs and safe and comfortable luxury transportation. while it is slightly more expensive, securing limo transfers throughout your weekend is the most efficient, fun, and exclusive way to commute around the city.  having rides set in advance also make your schedule tighter, and it gives you and your group a better opportunity to accomplish and conquer more during your trip.  to save time, money, and huge hassles, let bachelorette vegas assist in the planning.

las vegas nightclub & pool parties 
the nightlife in las vegas has quickly become a cultural phenomenon with several options to choose from – nightclubs, pool parties, lounges, outdoor rooftop patios, and after-hours venues.   

when deciding how to spend your day or night, avoiding the long entry lines is crucial. waiting in slow-moving lines is a waste of precious time, it's annoying, and you could still get turned away – unless you have vip entry or bottle service.  by working with bachelorette vegas, we can get you vip entry or a  vip bottle service experience. we can show you what it's like to be a true vip at a vegas club like omnia, jewel, marquee nightclub, on the record, xs, or the encore beach night swim.  
our bachelorette vegas party team can connect you with our numerous contacts all over town to get you into the hottest nightclubs with vip access and everything you want for your bachelorette party.  
if bottle service is a bit out of the budget, but you still want to hop around to multiple venues throughout the night, then consider building a custom package that includes our popular  club crawls. three different clubs in one night with drinks, vip entry, and transportation is an excellent value for those looking to explore sin city without spending an excessive amount of money.

male revues & male strip clubs 

a staple of many vegas bachelorette parties is the risqué and sexually-charged male revues and male strip clubs.  at bachelorette vegas, we can get you into the top male revues like chippendales, thunder from down under, magic mike live, aussie heat or black magic live.  the seductive moves from these hot, handsome hunks will keep you smiling, screaming, and squirming in your seats, and there could even be some special attention for the bride-to-be. 
if you prefer a private encounter to get your juices flowing, a few of the las vegas's strip clubs, like men of sapphire at sapphire gentleman's club, men of vegas at spearmint rhino, and kings of hustler at the hustler gentleman's club offer private room rentals for lap dances with sexy strippers who know how to move to your complete satisfaction while whispering sweet nothings in your ear.

pole dancing classes 

if you want to impress your partner or learn the skills for yourself, we have professional sin city strippers from "stripper 101" for “pole fitness studio” who can teach you the tricks to the trade. located in the miracle mile shops at planet hollywood hotel, stripper 101 offers 75 minutes or private and semi-private classes where you will learn pole dancing, striptease, and lap dances.  
this pole dancing class is always high on our bachelorette's list of extracurricular activities. not only is it fun and a great workout, but it's the perfect bonding experience and makes for a great photo op! 

getting around town in style 

with over 2 million residents living in las vegas, and nearly 375,000 daily visitors, and the fact that the town is open 24 hours, las vegas has become one of the most populated cities in america.  as a result, traffic is heavy, and travel can be challenging with cabs, ubers, and lyfts – and typically, they can only accommodate 4-6 people.  
let bachelorette vegas help you reduce the stress and burden of traveling in the longer than expected, bumper-to-bumper traffic on the las vegas strip.  we can book your group multiple limousine rentals  or transfers so you ladies can arrive at your destinations in style.  not only is a chauffeured limousine safe and convenient, but it is also the ultimate luxury ride.  capturing these moments and memories in pics and on video is also the perfect way to celebrate your experience and share with the world glimpses of your extravagant trip.   
we offer a variety of vehicles to choose from in all shapes and sizes to escort your group to the strip's finest clubs, casinos, restaurants, spas, golf courses, and a boatload of other entertainment options you can only imagine.  a must-see is a stop at the iconic "welcome to fabulous las vegas" sign for a once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunity.

a brief down and dirty timeline of the bachelorette party 
the bachelorette party is a century-old concept that traces back to 16th century europe.  it wasn't until the 1960s, during the time of the women's liberation movement, that bachelorette parties originated. brides-to-be began embracing their sexual freedom and launching their own version of the "bachelor" party – swapping the traditional bridal shower for wild parties with male strippers and alcohol.  
today, this time-honored tradition has evolved into one of the most important pre-wedding celebrations in honor of the bride-to-be.  bachelorette parties are the "last fling before the ring" – an opportunity for the bride to take a much-needed break from the wedding planning process and let loose for a night or a weekend with her bride tribe.
