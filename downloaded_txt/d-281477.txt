what is arc?


                            arc is a secular body that helps the world's major faiths develop environmental
                            programmes based on their own core teachings, beliefs and practices.








why work with the faiths?

                                the faiths are the oldest human organisations on the planet and together make up
                                the biggest element of civil society today.
