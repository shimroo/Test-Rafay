building democracy for the 21st century





























a holistic approach to building democracy through community lawyering



our mission at citizen advocacy center is to build democracy for the 21st century by strengthening the citizenry's capacities, resources, and institutions for self-governance. cac seeks to increase democratic protocols at every level of government and develop the voice of the public. efforts that start at the local level often result in statewide initiatives to address undemocratic barriers, often rooted in state law.cac engages in a holistic approach to building democracy through community organizing, coalition building, legal advocacy, civic education, and litigation to make government more accountable, accessible, and transparent. cac operates through the use of community lawyers who protect the public’s assets and promote meaningful participation in the democratic process.
