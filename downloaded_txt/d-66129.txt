    welcome to
tdiclub!

tdiclub is a website 
    
 

   
dedicated to the vw tdi (turbo direct injection diesel) engine.  most 
    of the action is in the discussion area 
    (also called forums). 

if you are looking for info on the current vw emissions scandal, please go to our faq thread that has a timeline of events, links to the report as well as some links to what vw has to say.  as info is added we will update that thread.
 many members who have 
    met originally online, often meet in person at regional
    get-to-gethers (or 
    gtgs for short).  there is also an internatation yearly gtg called tdifest that typically happens on the labour day weekend.  tdifest 2016 is coming to sturgeon bay, wi september 2-4th.  you can read about it in the  tdifest 2016 discussion forums. 
in previous years it has been held in 
    sunday river ski resort in bethel, maine(tdifest 2015),

to join tdiclub is a very informal 
    process.  just go to the forums 
    and register for an account.  
    once your account has been activated you will be a member and can join in 
    the discussions or just 'lurk'.  it is recommended that you sign-up for 
    an account as it brings a lot of extra features to you even if you are not 
    involved in daily discussions.  you can also meet members at various
    gtgs that may 
    be held near you.
while diesel cars are available in many countries around the world, volkswagen 
    has been the only manufacturer selling diesel cars in canada or the us 
    (other than the mercedes e320 cdi starting at $52,000us).  sometimes 
    the tdi is considered a  "niche" 
    product and i've venture to guess that is one reason there is such a unique 
    crowd of members.  where else can you say economy and performance in 
    the same sentence?  with this economy, one can also get great range.  
    while not typical, here is an example of someone getting
    
    1400 miles (2254km) on one tank of diesel.   
there are three main generations of tdi's found in north america.  the first generation was available 
    till 2004 used a distributor-type fuel pump and are designated ve engines 
    and were 1.9l in size.  after that vw introduced the pumpe-dã¼se (unit injector) engines (pd for short) 
    that were sold in canada and the us from 2004 till 2006.  the third and 
    latest generation of tdi engines which finally arrived in 2008 are common 
    rail and call a 'clean diesel'.  as you can see there was a bit of a 
    hiatus on the avialability of tdi's during 2007 which was due to changes in 
    us and canadian emission regulations.
the ve engines were found in a3 jettas, 
    b4 passats (1995/1996), new beetles (till the end of 2003), jetta iv (till 
    the end of 2003), and golfs (till the end of 2003).  the ve engine 
    found in the a3 jettas and b4 passats were rated at 90hp and 149ft.lbs of 
    torque.  the a4 jetta, new beetle, and a4 golf were rated at 90hp and 
    155ft.lbs.

    the pd version were available in new 
    beetles (2004 - 2006), jettas (2004 -2006), jetta wagons (2004 - 2006), golfs (2004 
    -2005), 
    b5 passat (2004 and 2005), and the 2005 v10 toureg.   the pd found in the 
    new beetles, jettas, and golfs are rated at 100hp and 177ft.lbs torque from 
    a 1.9l engine.  the b5 passat with it's 2.0l tdi pumped out 134 hp and 
    247 ft.lbs of torque.  the king of power is the 5.0l 310hp v10 touareg that puts out 553 ft.lbs 
    of torque.
as for the clean diesel common rail 
    engines they became available in late 2008 for the jetta wagon and sedan.  
    the engine displacement is slightly larger at 2.0l vs the previous 1.9l, but 
    power jumps to 140hp @ 4000rpm and torque is 236 lbs-ft between 1750 and 
    2000 rpm.  shortly after the 3.0l v6 version rated at 221hp@ 4000rm and 
    407 lbs-ft between 1,750 and 2,750 rpms became available for the toureg 2.  
    vw has also announce that the 2.0l tdi will be available for the next 
    version of the golf in early 2010.
demand for tdis is extremely high.  
    an example is in 2005 canadian sales of tdis accounted for over 50% of models where a tdi was an option.  
    another example is in 
    2006 the jetta wagon was only available as a tdi, they didn't even bother 
    with other engine types.
in europe the selection
    is much more advanced from the 1.2l lupo that gets 2.9l/100km (81usmpg [97 
    imp mpg]) up to the 313hp v10 tdi with 553 lbs of torque and everything in 
    between.
