the word of god is alive and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit, and of the joints and the marrow, and is a critic of thoughts and intents of the heart. (heb. 4:12)


all scripture is god-breathed, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of god might be mature, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. (2 tim. 3:16-17)


study to show thyself approved unto god, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. (2 tim. 2:15)

 thieme ministries
 salvation
 robert b. thieme, jr.
 grace ministry


r. b. thieme, jr., bible ministries (founded in 1967 as berachah tapes and publications) is a nonprofit organization designed to preserve and distribute the bible teaching of pastor r. b. thieme, jr. the ministrys purpose is to make thiemes biblical instruction available worldwide without charge or obligation, so that anyone anywhere can grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ (2 peter 3:18a).
 
for fifty-three years, pastor thieme fulfilled the command to shepherd the flock of god (1 peter 5:2) with over eleven thousand hours of sermons and over one hundred books on subjects ranging from salvation to the spiritual life to the essence of god to biblical history and prophecy. the unique focus of his ministry is on procedures for living the christian way of life between salvation and eternity.
 
r. b. thieme, jr., bible ministries provides audio recordings of bible classes taught from 1959 to 2002 and video recordings of classes taught from 1986 to 2002. a series of 30-minute lessons are broadcast on various radio stations inside and outside the united states. also offered are printed books, audiobooks, and ebooks on specific doctrinal subjects, with many titles translated into spanish, portugese, chinese, visayan and ilongo (philippines), and other languages of eastern asia.


salvation is the grace gift of god to man, received by faith alone in the lord jesus christ (john 3:16). no one ever earns or deserves anything from god. but in his infinite love and grace, god freely provides everything for us to have an eternal relationship with him.
 
for by grace you have been saved through faith; and that [salvation] not of yourselves, it is the gift of god; not as a result of works, that no one should boast.  (ephesians 2:8–9)
 
god’s plan of “grace and truth is realized through jesus christ” (john 1:17), the uniquely born son of god. jesus christ became true humanity to be our substitute and pay the penalty for our sins. when our lord jesus christ was on the cross, he was judged for the sins of the world. every sin that has ever been committed in the history of the human race was imputed to him on the cross and judged.
 
he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross. (1 peter 2:24a)
 
he made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf [as our substitute], that we might become the righteousness of god in him. (2 corinthians 5:21)
 
because of the work of jesus christ, salvation is available to everyone.
 
for god so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten [uniquely born] son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. (john 3:16)
 
and they said, “believe in the lord jesus, and you shall be saved.” (acts 16:31a)
 
believing in christ means you accept as true the fact that he died as your personal substitute. in the moment you believe, god gives you eternal life and guarantees your salvation. instantly, you are brought into an unbreakable relationship with god forever.
 
your attitude toward jesus christ determines your eternal future. you can either believe in christ for eternal life or reject him for eternal condemnation.
 
he who believes in the son has eternal life; but he who does not obey [believe] the son shall not see life, but the wrath of god abides on him. (john 3:36)

robert b. thieme, jr. (1918–2009) remains a significant voice of christianity throughout the world. his diligent, expository teaching is based on the original languages of scripture in light of the historical context in which the bible was written. his innovative systems of vocabulary, illustrations, and biblical categories clearly communicate the infallible truths of god’s word. thieme recorded more than eleven thousand hours of sermons and published more than one hundred books covering much of the bible.

                         thieme graduated from the university of arizona (phi beta kappa) and dallas theological seminary (summa cum laude). his seminary studies were interrupted by world war ii military service during which he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the united states army air corps. after completion of his graduate work in 1950, he became pastor of berachah church in houston, texas. his extensive training in greek, hebrew, theology, history, and textual criticism provided the foundation for his demanding professional life of studying and teaching the word of god. thieme retired as pastor of berachah church after fifty-three years of faithful service.


r. b. thieme, jr., bible ministries is a grace ministry and operates entirely on voluntary contributions. there is no price list for any of our material. no money is requested. when gratitude for the word of god motivates a believer to give, he has the privilege of contributing to the dissemination of bible doctrine.
