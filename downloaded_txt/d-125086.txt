richard ashcroft confirmed as special guest
for all uk and ireland oasis live ‘25 shows

 








“as a fan from day one i was buzzing for many reasons when the news of oasis’s return was announced. i can say with no exaggeration that the songwriting talent of noel and liam’s pure spirit as a lead singer helped to inspire me to create some of my best work. it was the perfection of ‘live forever’ that forced me to try and write my own. they dared to be great, made the dreams we had real and i will always remember those days with joy.
now it’s time to create more memories and i’m ready to bring it. see you next summer. music is power.”
– richard ashcroft
