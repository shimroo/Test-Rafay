aaha provides an internet-based application that enables veterinarians, humane organizations, pet owners or other persons to search various pet recovery service registries and identify those registries on which a particular microchip is registered. aaha is not affiliated or involved with any specific microchip registry and has no relationship, financial or otherwise, with this participating pet recovery service registry (“registry”). this registry has given aaha permission to search the registry’s database in order to assist pet owners in being reunited with their pets. aaha does not maintain a database of microchips of its own. it only links to registries such as this one. the aaha universal microchip lookup tool only searches the databases of companies that elect to participate in the program.
