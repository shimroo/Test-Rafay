    the end





what a beautiful destination...
paradise awaits you on, and it's just at the tip of long island!
commonly referred to as the end, because it is the easternmost point of the island and new york state.
come summer the town is overwelmed with nyc dwellers and tourists from all over flock to the pristine beaches, the enchanting ocean waters, the sun and surf.  nature lovers will enjoy the many hiking and bicycle riding trails.  beachcombers can walk or take guided tours to learn more about the local ecology.
montauk is an old fishing town with an extrordinary history, but during the off-season, the town returns to it's roots, with most all local businesses shuttered.
