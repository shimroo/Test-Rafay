we have produced a special video version of


life is a rock but wrc rolled me


it's almost 4 minutes of great 98 jock photos,


behind the scenes pics and quick cuts of memories.









  this tribute site is done as a labor of love by a couple of
middle-aged guys who used to work there.
 it's also a tribute to those professionals
who helped make the station a success.


 we hope this site will bring back some memories
to those who were lucky enough to
hear the station when it was on the air.


if you never heard the great 98, prepare for an
education of not only the top 40 format,
but learn about its mor days, the newstalk era
and even the disco phase.

also accept pay pal

this project was done as a labor of love and heard
years after its creation in the dc area on
oldies 104 wxtr during their big daddies
of washington radio weekend in 1994.


this 52 minute collection was created in
1975 and updated in 1979.
the contents of this cd have been taken from
the original master tape and digitized!


the history of the great 98








truly one of washington dc's last great top 40 am radio stations.
