floral preservation
enjoy your flowers forever with modern flower preservation in milwaukee! we thought we’d try our hand at flower preservation and fell in love with the process of encasing flowers in resin. instead of shipping your bouquet across the country, enjoy the comfort and security of having someone local in wisconsin create a one of a kind piece of art with some of your most cherished flowers. we service both the milwaukee area as well as the fox cities.
