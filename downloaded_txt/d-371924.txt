over twenty years of conversations






conversations, not scripts


“our morning with rafael was the quintessential context experience - and why we keep coming back. we saw a part of tokyo we would never have experienced on our own, but more importantly we left with a deeper understanding of tokyo, why it’s developed the way it has, and how its citizens actually live their lives. so much more valuable (and interesting) than simply seeing the sights.”mark r.tokyo, japan




experts, not guides


“william literally writes the book(s) on the d-day memorials which led to an incredibly informative day tour. from age 77 to 11, we were all captivated by his knowledge and his ability to connect the dots.”carolyn b.normandy, france




tailored, not one-size fits all


“fantastic way to learn or refresh your understanding of key aspects of the history of britain... one of the great things about a context private tour is your guide. you can tailor your experience to your group's individual interests. this was our third context tour. we are 3 for 3 in terms of top shelf guides, each very knowledgeable and personable. highly recommended!"owen m.london, uk

we have had such great success with context tours and our time with jaime was right on par, if not even better than previous tours. jaime is not only an excellent guide but he’s also an excellent person. yes, he’s well versed on topic. but more importantly, he’s very intelligent and well-read and a lot of fun to hang out with. we thoroughly enjoyed our time with him. obrigaga, jaime!

sabry was the best! had a great walk learning the history of the city. his knowledge is endless and answered anything we could come up with. he added in lots of art history and local culture. can’t wait for our jewish quarter tour with him on monday.
