we sell one-of-a-kind', hand and machine made quilts, designed and created by american quilt makers. some of our quilters are artisans, quilt designers or teach quilting; others are professional quilters and many are also grandmothers and great-grandmothers.
an american quilt is a thing of beauty, a work of art, a useful and thoughtful one-of-a-kind individually crafted gift, and just plain comfortable and cozy for taking that nap on your sofa or in your easy chair. cotton quilts are comfortable because they breathe, keeping you just right for sleeping any time of the year. quilts can also be beautifully displayed as wall hangings to brighten anywhere they are seen, in your home or in a public setting.
our accomplished quilt makers are in keeping with the finest traditions of american quilting since the first english and dutch settlers arrived from europe. the earliest quilts of the colonists were an integral part of their everyday lives, providing warm covers for beds, and hung over the windows to keep out the cold. early american quilts were primarily utilitarian; today they are both utilitarian and creative works of art to be  used and enjoyed for their beauty.
the american quilting tradition of making utilitarian bed and nap quilts continues. our mothers, grandmothers, great-grandmothers, and other previous generations have enjoyed quilting throughout american history. the art of quilt making is an exercise in patience and a labor of love resulting in a useful, enduring, thing of beauty and work of art.

what is the best size for a quilt? well, that depends on how you plan to use it, and the size of you bed if using it as a throw or coverlet. some quilts can be used either lengthwise or width-wise; other quilts cannot. it depends upon the design  of the quilt. quilt sizes can be flexible because they are not just blankets. quilts are decorative pieces of art that can also serve the very practical purpose as bed coverings.
if it is a sofa quilt, or lap-throw quilt, the size is less important. throw quilts for beds (sometimes folded at the foot of the bed as a decorative accent piece, or used for naps) can vary in size to suit your needs. 
if the quilt is to be used as a coverlet, it needs a drop (from top edge of the bed to cover the mattress by a few inches) on the two sides, plus the foot of the bed, if there is no foot board. quilts do not need to tuck-in at the foot of the bed, and coverlets do not cover the pillows. pillows sit on top of the quilt. use pillow shams or solid color pillow cases for pillows on top of the quilt, to compliment the colors in the quilt. coverlet size quilts are often used with solid color dust ruffles, which can be purchased commercially, to cover the box springs and bed frame.  
bed throw-size quilts are  sometimes used on top of another light weight blanket, and therefore do not need to have as long a drop on sides/foot.              
we do ship quilts to hawaii, alaska, canada, mexico, and overseas, but additional shipping charges will apply, for which you will be billed separately and additionally. payment of all foreign duty and taxes are the responsibility of the recipient, and if quilt is a 'gift' to be sent overseas, the buyer will need to contact the recipient, in advance, to alert them that a package will be arriving via customs, in countries where applicable.
