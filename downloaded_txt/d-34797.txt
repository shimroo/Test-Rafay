read the story 
              of a woman who gave so many courage
              in the midst of her own life-and-death struggle 
              with breast cancer.

              soraya, the book, was her last great effort. 
              as was soraya’s wish, royalties from this book 
              owed to her estate will be donated to 
susan g. komen for 
              the cure®.
