bold new jumpers






















in all my time documenting the insects and arachnids in my garden, i had never captured a bold jumping spider (phidippus audax) nest and hatching. first is the pristine silk nest spun on the leaf of kalanchoe orgyalis; it has doors on both ends.














i noticed the shape of the spider inside the nest, and as i watched from a distance, she gradually emerged from the back door, climbed up a nearby stem and jumped off into the garden. 




                                                                                  





                    

 a day later, the nest is in disarray and one tiny bold jumper can barely be seen leaving the nest in the last photo. i found some others scattered in the vegetation nearby. good luck hunting, little ones.
