about the complaints process
the complaints process is simple but there are a few details you will need before starting a complaint
1. the process


your data. we don’t share your data or use it anything apart from your complaint. it is safe and secure.
                    

time. going through the complaints process takes 5 - 10 minutes on average.
                    

2. what you need


                        you need the date, time and channel/station of the broadcast.
                    

                        if you saw it online you can still complain if you have the above details of original broadcast.
                    

                        if you don’t have this information or it’s not about  a tv/radio programme go to faqs (to find out where to send your complaint)
                    

                        if it is an election programme there is a separate process/code

frequently asked questions
all faq's ›




how do i complain?






you must complain to the broadcaster first (unless your complaint is about privacy only or about election programmes, in which case you can send it straight to the bsa). to go through the bsa process, it has to be a ‘formal complaint’.if you just want to let the broadcaster know your concerns, or it’s not an issue that can come to the bsa, it will be considered an ‘informal complaint’.contact details for major broadcasters are here.





what issues can i complain about?






if the programme you are complaining about was broadcast on or after 1 july 2022, you can complain to the bsa about the following issues under the new broadcasting standards codebook: 
offensive and disturbing content 
children’s interests 
promotion of illegal or antisocial behaviour 
discrimination and denigration 
balance 
accuracy 
privacy 
fairness 
to help you decide which is most relevant to your concerns see our guide to choosing a standard. the standards are explained in more detail in the broadcasting standards codebook.you can also complain to us about election programmes, which come under a separate code.





where can i find information about bsa decisions? 






all decisions on complaints can be seen on our website here.you can find out more about the number and types of complaints in our annual reports.





does the bsa oversee content for on-demand platforms like netflix, lightbox, neon or youtube?






we don’t oversee content for on-demand services, apart from certain exceptions:under a special agreement, we deal with content standards and complaints for neon.
we can consider complaints about broadcast content that’s then put online, as long as you can point to the original broadcast and complain within 20 working days of this.
some on-demand providers such as netflix and lightbox have signed up to the nz media council vod code which sees programmes classified to help people make informed viewing choices.on youtube, if you see content you believe violates the platform’s community guidelines you can report it directly to youtube. more information is available on youtube’s website here. 





does the bsa deal with complaints about advertisements?






the advertising standards authority (asa) deals with most advertisements for products, services or organisations on tv, radio, the internet, print and billboards.contact the asa by email at asa@asa.co.nz or phone 0800 234 357.the bsa can consider complaints about ‘promos’ for upcoming programmes, but these must be sent to the broadcaster in the first instance.we also consider complaints about election programmes (which might appear as short promotional/campaign clips for political parties or candidates, on tv or radio).





does the bsa monitor broadcasters or initiate action outside the complaints process? 






the bsa has no such powers. we become involved only when formal complaints come to us about specific programmes.





what's a broadcasting levy? 






broadcasters that make more than $500,000 in annual revenue from broadcasting in new zealand pay a set proportion of this to the bsa. this ‘broadcasting levy’ helps fund the standards system and bsa operations.for more information, see broadcasting levy.
