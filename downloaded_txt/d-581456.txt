about idleair
idleair provides america’s hard-working long-haul truck drivers an alternative to idling their engines during rest periods. idleair service allows truck drivers to turn off their diesel engines and apu’s and still enjoy heating, cooling, standard electric inside and outside the cab, satellite tv, internet, and many of the comforts of home — all while saving money and getting better sleep without the noise, vibration, and exhaust fumes from idling.

"just want to let you know what a great value idleair is in this day of $3.50 plus fuel. quite a bargain for the heat and cooling capabilities alone. add in the tv and 120v outlets, and it is unbeatable!" - daryl salek
