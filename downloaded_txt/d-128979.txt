the gift of prophecy

(a life-changing mp3 sermon by dr. jack 
      hyles—1st corinthians 12-14 teaches that the greatest gift of the spirit 
      is prophecy, which means to “speak forth,” and the greatest things to 
      speak forth are building homes, lifting the fallen and encouraging the brethren).

the clinton chronicles

most christians are 
							woefully naive, deceived about nearly everything. 
							sadly, they like it that way, choosing to bury their 
							head in the sand and remain uninformed about the 
							truth. consequently, under the guise of the 
							“conservative right,” the
							churches support evil, by foolishly thinking 
							they are supporting the
							lesser of two evils. we need to be wise, not 
							pawns in the game.

thou shalt not steal!


the central bank is the worst thing to ever happen to america! now 
      we have to pay for three homes just to get one. america is in 


		deep trouble!


"the 
        
        central bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the principles and form of 
        our constitution. i am 
        an enemy to all banks discounting bills or notes for anything but coin. if the american people allow 
        private banks to control the 
        issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will 
        grow up around them will 
        deprive the people of all their 
        property until their 
        children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered."
        
        —thomas jefferson 
        (1743-1826)
in the u.s we don't have a country with a government, we have a 
		government with a country!

for the new

		one 
		world government, they must 
		control a central bank, eliminate the 
		constitution, end christian values, disarm america, and 
		control the 
		media. the council on foreign relations has openly said they will 
		take 
		us over in favor of a one world government. the american people must be 
		warned or we may 
		lose our freedom forever. if we do not demand our 
		rights and uphold the constitution, the 
		cfr and bankers will continue 
		their march toward 
		socialism. if we allow them to 
		continue, they will 
		abolish our rights and put an end to our present government. freedom

“the gospel is not a call to repentance, or to amendment of our 
			ways, to make restitution for past sins, or to promise to do better 
			in the future. these things are proper in their place, but they do 
			not constitute the gospel; for the gospel is not good advice to be 
			obeyed, it is good news to be believed. do not make the mistake then 
			of thinking that the gospel is a call to duty or a call to 
			reformation, a call to better your condition, to behave yourself in 
			a more perfect way than you have been doing in the past …


nor is the gospel a demand that you give up the world, that you 
			give 
			up your sins, that you break off bad habits, and try to cultivate 
			good ones. you may do all these things, and yet never believe the 
			gospel and consequently never be saved at all.”

westcott and hort were pro-catholic!

the niv and the

niv reader,
            take the niv bible quiz!  (let all your niv-reading friends take
            it!)


the niv calls
            lucifer "jesus" (if you can still read the niv after 
          looking at this and praying the prayer at the end of the article, you 
          are lost)


niv says
            false prophets should "emasculate" themselves
should       
            1st john 5:7 be in the king james bible?


new versions say jesus is in danger of the judgment

niv
            and nasb agree with jehovah witness' bible 
          (side-by-side comparison. by the way, if you look inside the front 
          cover of the “greek interlinear new testament” which the       
            jehovah witnesses use, it says
that their greek

how the

            lucifer!!!)

 
niv is not god's word!




niv changes masculine words and makes them feminine—accurate?
 (this was written in 1997) 



niv
            goes hog wild with gender inclusivity (next they'll make 
            god “our mother” or “our parent” like the antichrist liberals)




does the 
          world really need a gender-neutral bible? (the
          gay bible is here! or, how about the 
          judith christ of 
          nazareth bible which presents jesus as a woman! talk about 
          apostasy!)

tniv:       
            translation treason (according to 
          hebrews 2:17 in the tniv, jesus was made like a woman in every way! should it be surprising that harper collins [parent company of 
          zondervan which publishes the niv and tniv] should also publish the 
          filth, "making 
          out, the book of lesbian sex and sexuality"? i think not! the 
			devil is in the niv and tniv folks! get 
          ready for the homosexual "gay" bible, it is coming! by the way, 
          avon publishers [another subsidiary of harper collins] publishes the

is the nkjv

nkjv translators
            admit they changed the authorized kjv



beware of 'the

the “new” king james 
            version is a counterfeit! (what's that
            weird symbol on the front cover?)



is the new king james version an improvement over the king james bible





does
            the new king james use the same texts as the old king james?


what
