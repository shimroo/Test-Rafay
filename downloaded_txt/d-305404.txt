not just a man. a mason.
now more than ever, the world needs men of honor and integrity. men that unite and not those who divide. that seek truth and share brotherly love with all, no matter their race, religion, gender or creed. men who live with virtue and character, always striving to be even better.
the world needs more than just men. the world needs masons.

the grand lodge of ohio
ohio freemasonry is a thriving brotherhood of more than 60,000 men in over 400 lodges throughout the state. men from virtually every city and village are quietly improving their own lives and making a difference in the lives of others — like minded men of integrity who genuinely care about each other, who are loyal and honor bound to help those in distress and to live by the masonic values of brotherly love, relief and truth.
