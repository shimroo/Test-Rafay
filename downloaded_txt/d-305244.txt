welcome to hotelguide.networks' directory of hotels and hotel reviews for tampa - st. petersburg, florida!

the climate of the tampa bay area is unlike any other in florida, and the intense sunshine imparts an unmistakable reddish-brown tan that identifies area visitors.  the persistent, gentle breeze coming off the gulf of mexico, the haunting cry of the seagulls and the ever-present, gentle, radiant heat obliterate all memory of other places, and make the passage of time irrelevant.  there is a wide range of activities and sights to enjoy in this paradise, from watching the assembly of hand-rolled cigars in the historic downtown cuban community of ybor city, to enjoying the annual sponge diving ceremonies and authentic cuisine in the greek orthodox community of tarpon springs, to the year-round nightlife along the gulf beaches.  the tampa bay area offers the full range of lodging accommodations, including contemporary top-brand hotels in the urban areas of tampa, st. petersburg and clearwater, waterfront resorts along boca ciega bay and the gulf of mexico, and a number of bed and breakfast inns where you can fully experience the ambiance of this unique area of florida.
