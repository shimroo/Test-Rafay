torque meter
journal of the aircraft engine historical society
for seven years the aehs published a prestigious quarterly journal, torque meter, which contained articles on all types of aircraft engines, both new and old. topics included engines and the aircraft they powered with emphasis on the engine installation, propellers, accessories, cooling, operation, and maintenance.
torque meter is no longer published. however,
all  torque meter back issues are still available!
