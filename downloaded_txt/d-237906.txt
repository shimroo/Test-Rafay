we are absolutely blown away to announce that sonic mojo has been submitted for a grammy® nomination in the contemporary blues album category (we are in some pretty heavy company). wow…this has never happened to us before, so to say we are thrilled and honored is an understatement! voting for the nominations takes place in early october and the nominees will be announced in early november! so, fingers crossed and wish us luck ! thank you! roger, bryan, scott & rodney!
