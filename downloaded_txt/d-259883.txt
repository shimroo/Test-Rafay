32,000
scwa's laboratory instruments can test down to parts per trillion. to get an idea, one ppt would be represented by a single drop of food coloring in 18 million gallons of water. another way to view it as representing a single second out of 32,000 years.

scwa has just under 6,000 miles of water main in the ground throughout our service territory. laid out end to end, that's enough main to stretch from suffolk to siberia.
