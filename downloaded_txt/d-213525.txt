welcome to the independent schools directory
helping you choose the right independent school for your child


                            this site contains information on independent schools in the uk which you can freely browse to find a particular school or to search for schools by... more location and numerous other preferences including places available and exam subjects provided. dynamic maps and location services are also included.


                            many schools publish their own additional information to view or download within the site and have website and email links.               
                    

                        selecting the right school is a subjective process. however, the ethos of the independent sector is to do the best by each child. with smaller classes and traditional values, children are not left to flounder. the fee paying system allows parents to exercise choice and seek high standards; schools have to respond.
