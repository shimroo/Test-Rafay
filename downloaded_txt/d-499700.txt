what client's say



sally lesline


the replacement cover for my select comfort air bed arrived yesterday. it fit perfectly and was in place before bedtime. it was heavier than i anticipated due to the luxury top but it all fit perfectly. it took me about an hour to dismantle and put it back together. it is of excellent quality and i couldn’t be more please with it.
i appreciate your quick responses when i asked questions before placing my order. thank you for being part of such a great company.

i thought you deserve to know that i am extremely pleased with my purchase of the bally's replacement zipper cover for select comfort beds.
i was skeptical at first buying anything online, but i did not want to pay the $700+ that the manufacturer claims was the replacement cost. i received it today and installed it in 15 minutes. it's a perfect fit!! woot!! thank you so much for making me a very happy customer!
you rock!!

thank you very much for your fast service in the purchase of our sterling waterbed mattress! it came today at 12:15 pm right on time for me to set it up and fill with water. looking forward to sleeping on it this evening after spending the last three nights out in the motor home. if we need anything in the future we will be sure to call our waterbed guy.
thanks again




joyce & bryan


not only was your shipping quick you know your product very well! others are skeptical purchasing online however having previously owned a waterbed and after speaking with you, it confirmed you have a lot of knowledge on waterbeds and accessories.
we purchased the sterling 600 sxe, heater and rails and love them all! and it will be so nice to have a warm bed again on the cold indiana winter nights. thank you for all your help!

hi pete! it was a pleasure speaking with you a few weeks ago, when i placed my order with you. i ordered a king-size perfection frame free sponge waterbed mattress, semi-waveless, single bladder, without a topper. shipping was super quick, and setting it up was a breeze!! it’s been a couple of weeks now since i received my new mattress, and i have to say that it is amazing – it feels just like a regular, old-fashioned hard-side waterbed mattress, except it looks like a regular innerspring mattress. the mattress completely conforms to your body so you have full back/body support and no uncomfortable pressure points. my husband and i have missed our old hard-side waterbed mattress so much, and we are so happy to finally have a waterbed mattress again. we are sleeping like babies again. thank you so much!!!




lorna


i just wanted to thank you. we are very pleased. :)
we received the tubes we ordered last friday, ahead of schedule, and installed them over the weekend.
your pricing was totally reasonable and before we even placed our order, your customer service was fabulous (i.e., explaining bed sizing over the phone to my husband before and providing the fedex tracking number to me after)!
please feel free to use my comments in any of your advertising. again, many thanks!
