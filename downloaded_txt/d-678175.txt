bluegrass festival 














 







smoked country jam is a 3 day, family-friendly event bringing together performers from all branches of the bluegrass tree. 



whether the music is traditional or progressive, americana, old time or roots, all are shared on the stage with one another. the festival showcases the past, present and future of this american-made music. each year, lineups of national and regional performers play over 40 hours of music. gp audio provides the sound and light reinforcement on both quiet oaks and pa wilds stages. the event features a 3-day lupus auction benefiting the lupus foundation of america. there is a full schedule of bluegrass workshops, children’s activities, a beautiful vendor midway, and the pennsylvania heritage songwriting contest. the festival is both 4-wheeler and pet friendly.

featured headliners: fireside collective  



a quintet who cheerfully disregard every kind of one-dimensional label that might be attached to their music, fireside collective has been on a roll since emerging seven years ago from the fertile roots music scene of asheville, north carolina. in quick order, the progressive bluegrass group released its debut album, won the 2016 band contest at merlefest, earned an international bluegrass music association momentum band of the year nomination and embarked on an ambitious touring schedule that’s earned an enthusiastic reception from traditional bluegrass to wide-ranging, eclectic music festival audiences alike.  ​blending the characteristic interplay of bluegrass instrumentation and harmonies with strong original material and exuberant energy, fireside collective has drawn on folk, blues, funk and a wide variety of bluegrass sounds to create a distinctive body of work that’s all their own.
