metal wall art, metal wall sculpture, metal wall decor





  

 


we create conversation pieces.every piece is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. the shiny golden metallic hues or blended colors of gold, brass and copper with subtle shades of shadow and light only a master of arts can imagine and create. our metal wall art bring life to lonely rooms with reflections of unique shades of shadows bouncing off the walls which can only be captured by a three dimensional gurtan metal wall sculpture.





 



 


gurtan metal wall sculptures are made of the highest quality standards and materials.every angle, shape, color mixtures are original from the twisted artist imagination. an artist brain is a terrible thing to waste. these artists are extremely demanding of themselves and every tiny detail while creating their metal sculptures drives some to near madness! (ever met a truly sane artist?) they imagine, draw and color the artwork in their head, sketch it on paper and finally ever so delicately hammer by hand, shape, pull, twist and burnish to perfection.





 


 




 


techniques used making our metal wall art.it is called manual brazing. in other words oxygen and acetylene torches are extensively used to cut and connect metal under extreme heat. every metal sculpture has hundreds of connections from tree trunks to branches and leaves. every part of the designs are handled separately and discretely while creating our artwork. it is a time consuming procedure, but at the same time it gives us the opportunity to provide necessary attention to each individual piece of art while we are creating it. although designs may have names and certain shapes, this is the reason no design can exactly be the same as one another. each piece has a life of its own, a soul of its own.
