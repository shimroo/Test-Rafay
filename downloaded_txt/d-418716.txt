2020 feels like forever

	thought we were dead? well, you're sort of right! but we've yelled at our hosting service and resolved some download bugs. 25% off forever is still a thing :) wwg and papercraft as a hobby will never truly go away, even if that means we're only here in spirit. happy cutting, folding and gluing into the great unknown!

deadfall: building essentials updated

	a roofing part in deadfall: building essentials was missing. we've fixed that and updated the file. if you bought this product before today, hit my collection and download the updated set.

note: don't worry about the download counter. it's not a lifetime limit--if you run out of downloads, the button automatically changes to a "request reset" button, and we'll take care of you shortly after you click on it.

	happy holidays to everyone!
