 through teaching, writing and workshops
            alison king sets up unforgettable experiences
            that motivate people to make  art &  design


by day, alison king is an assistant professor of digital design at grand canyon university. by night she's an artist and is the editorial force behind modernphoenix.net, an active  community that is reshaping the face of phoenix one building at a time — and in some cases rescuing city icons from total destruction.  

          she's fighting hard for her city's cultural preservation through writing, education and documentation. undaunted by failure and fueled by  fire, alison interprets design history in a way that sweeps people into action.
