we’re planting trees again!

to minimize our environmental footprint and offset 250 tons of co2, mercurius is planting around 20,000 m² (5 acres) of forest at bio agroforestry 'janmiekeshoeve,' near our headquarters in the netherlands. we started this project last year, but many trees were lost due to heavy rainfall. recently, our dutch colleagues planted new trees, and we’re hopeful that this year they will thrive!
