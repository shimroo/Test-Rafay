congressional art competition
celebrating america's creative visionaires
the congressional art competition is the officially sanctioned art competition for the u.s. house of representatives. each year, over 430 house members hold art competitions in their districts for high-school aged constituents. the house displays the winning artworks in the u.s. capitol for a year. the high point of the competition is the annual winners’ celebration, when 1,000 constituents come to washington to see the exhibit and honor the winners. the competition changes lives and introduces the legislative branch to young people across the country. the congressional institute is honored to host this bipartisan event since 2009. for more information, including how to enter, click the button below.
