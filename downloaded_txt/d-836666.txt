who needs madison avenue when you can work in annapolis? not only are we in the sailing capital of the world, our location keeps our creative juices flowing with cultural attractions like our very own symphony and ballet companies, and annual film, fringe and blues festivals.
it’s a hip place where every night there's live music all over town, lots of restaurants and shops to explore, and socks (not to mention suits) are optional. plus, how many places can you sit at the dock of the bay with your labrador or chesapeake bay retriever and watch sailboat races every wednesday?
