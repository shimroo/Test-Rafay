eric butterworth

(1916-2003)
 
popular "unity" minister and author








eric butterworth was among the leading spokespersons
in
modern times on "practical mysticism." eric was considered a
legend and spiritual icon in the unity
movement. the author of 16 best-selling books on metaphysical
spirituality,
a gifted theologian, philosopher, and lecturer, and for over 50 years a
teacher of "practical christianity," helping thousands of people
to help themselves to a more abundant life by the study and application
of truth. he possessed a unique ability to render the most complex
metaphysical
teachings in simple sound bytes of awareness. he mastered the art of
the
brief "essayette," of which he has written thousands and is often
described as "the twentieth century emerson." 
born in winnipeg, canada in 1916, eric attended
fresno
state university and capital university in ohio, where he studied
music.
he began training for the ministry at unity village in missouri during
wwii. he left to join the army and as a lieutenant in the medical
corps,
trained medical personnel and also served as chaplain and counselor.
after
the war, he returned to his ministerial studies and graduated from
unity
ministerial school.
a scholar and educator, eric established three
powerful
unity ministries. the first was in pittsburgh. he then moved to
detroit,
where his teaching resulted in the building of the detroit unity
temple,
the largest unity church at that time, where more that 2, 000 people
attended
his sunday services each week. while in detroit, he authored his first
book, unity: a quest for truth. in 1961, eric began his ministry in new
york city. he lectured every sunday at carnegie hall, then town hall,
and
since 1976, avery fisher hall, where the weekly attendance grew to
several
thousand.
his devotees include people from all walks and
stations
of life, all of whom state that his teachings helped to change their
lives.
eric was the first unity minister to appear on oprah , and speaking
about
his book discover the power within you she
said, "this book changed my perspective on life and religion. eric
butterworth teaches that god isn't "up there." he exists inside
each one of us, and it's up to us to seek the divine within." 
eric reminds us, "prosperity is one of god's
greatest
gifts to us. a loving father/mother god would not want its children to
be in poverty, and it is an axiomatic universal law that prosperity
will
occur when we do put spiritual practices into business!" eric
butterworth
passed away peacefully on thursday, april 17, 2003.
eric butterworth quotes:
"on human levels of consciousness one may emphasize
getting and having as the prime goals, in spiritual consciousness he
seeks
the way of giving and being." 
"go within in a time of silence and get a renewed
awareness of god as your resource, and then go about your business
affairs
in the strong consciousness of the omnipresence of substance."
"believe that you are always in the presence of
limitless
substance which you form and shape and release through your faith. keep
the high watch of truth by knowing that, wherever you are and whatever
your experience, you are an inlet and may become an outlet for the flow
of god-substance."
"i am secure, for i know who i am: a richly endowed
child of god. i am secure in all i do, for i know my oneness with the
divine
process. i am secure in all i have, for i know my treasure is in my
mind,
not in my things. i live my life from day to day as if god's supportive
substance were as exhaustless and dependable as the air i breathe,
which
it most certainly is."
"on human levels of consciousness one may emphasize
getting and having as the prime goals, in spiritual consciousness he
seeks
the way of giving and being."
the kingdom of god cometh not with observation ... for,
behold,
the kingdom of god is within you. (luke 17:20, 21 a.v.)

"jesus clearly says that the kingdom of heaven is
within you. it is not a place in space but an inner potentiality of
imprisoned
splendor which is released through you. (thus the windows of heaven are
in you. the windows of heaven are you!"
"life's inmost secret is the divine pattern in you
which you can only really know when you are giving yourself in service."
"i am god's living enterprise, and god cannot fail."
"within you is a limitless, unborn potential of
creativity
and substance, and the present experience can be your great opportunity
to give birth to it. thus, if you will, the tragedy can become a
blessing,
the disadvantage can become an advantage, the failure can become an
opportunity,
and the disappointment can become "his" appointment...
"so, no matter what the difficulty, the loss, the
financial adversity, if you are feeling negative, get busy pearling. by
the "all things work together for good" principle, any experience
of life can become the best thing that ever happened to you."
"if we plan and conserve, and keep our thoughts
centered
in god as our limitless resource of good, then our way will be filled
with
success and fulfillment. it depends on what we are thinking when we do
what we do. as the bible says: except the lord build
the
house,
they labour in vain that build it. ... (psalms 127:1 a.v.)"
"real life isn't made up of great success and great
failure, but of an infinite number of levels of living in between. and
true greatness depends more on inner overcomings than on outer
achievements."
"i am secure, for i know who i am: a richly endowed
child of god. i am secure in all i do, for i know my oneness with the
divine
process. i am secure in all i have, for i know my treasure is in my
mind,
not in my things. i live my life from day to day as if god's supportive
substance were as exhaustless and dependable as the air i breathe,
which
it most certainly is.")
"you always have within you the inlet that may
become
the outlet to all there is in god. (as you 'turn the green side up' and
become centered in the divine flow, you create the condition in
consciousness
that makes the result inevitable. you are never further than one idea
away
from all the wealth in the universe."
"prosperity books use as examples tycoons such as
henry ford and andrew carnegie to illustrate how you too can become a
millionaire.
the fact is, these people did not set out to make money at all. in each
case there was the sudden or progressive unfoldment of an idea, which
in
turn was translated into automobile plants and steel mills. the real
substance
that made it all possible was ideas. ideas are the flowing forth into
mind
of the wealth of the universe."
"the purpose of life is not acquisition but
unfoldment
and personal development."
"your life is god's gift to you. what you do with
it is your gift to god."
"in studying mathematics or simply using a
mathematical
principle, if we get the wrong answer in a sort of algebraic equation,
we do not suddenly feel that there is an anti-mathematical principle
that
is luring us into the wrong answers.....evil, and evil spirits, devils
and devil possession, are the outgrowth of man's inadequate
consciousness
of god. we must avoid thinking of evil as a thing in itself-a force
that
works against man or, against god, if you will."
"fundamentalists believe jesus was god becoming man.
i believe that jesus was man becoming god."
"in your spiritual quest, you are seeking to
establish
yourself in a unitive relationship with the divine flow. you can never
really achieve this level of consciousness until giving becomes the
main
thrust of your life. and when it does, when you discover the wonder of
giving, you become, unblushingly, an incurable giver. meditate long on
this point, for it is one of the most important keys of the prosperity
law."
"life for the whole person is a giving process. we
are not talking specifically about church giving, giving to charity,
etc.
there are many channels through which your giving may be funneled. we
are
talking about attitudes toward life, the basic awareness that life is a
matter of developing or unfolding from within. it is knowing that life
is not something to get but something to express."
"if you discover the wonder of giving, you will find
a great blessing of inner fulfillment in your work, which will lead to
better work, and, by the law of causation, to a greater experience of
affluence,
which may come through your job or through many different channels. the
law is exact: if you give, really work in a giving consciousness, you
must
receive."
"wait on the lord means to get yourself integrated
in consciousness with the divine flow. it is so very important, before
undertaking any project, to wait on the lord in a conscious prayer
experience
in which you turn your thoughts inward and establish yourself in the
flow
of the creative process. it is an important moment, 'god's moment,'
before
you go to work or before you set out to find a job. just become very
still
and centered, sense the creative energy of spirit tingling in your
fingertips,
guiding your hands, directing your footsteps, putting words into your
mouth,
helping you to do the things that need to be done, to do them easily
and
to do them well."
"i will do what i do better and better and better;
and i will do more and more of what i do."
"when you begin to understand this life principle,
you will know that there is a wellspring of life, substance, and
intelligence
within you, and that yours is the privilege at any time of giving way
to
its flow. this may lead to one of the most important realizations that
will ever come to you: if ever there is a lack of any kind, whether it
is a need for employment, or for money, or for guidance, or even for
healing,
something is blocking the flow. and the most effective remedy: give!"
"there is never a time when you can't find some way
to start the giving flow, which in turn will open the way to the
receiving
of your good. jesus clearly articulated the divine law: ".
. . give, and it will be given to you ... (luke, 6:38)
"give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed
down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your
bosom.
for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to
you
again." (luke, 6:38 a.v.) 
"think give! say to yourself, "i will think
give today. i will think give every day of my life." the law is clear.
it promises: think give, and you will get. it is a fundamental key to
achieving
prosperity."
"kahlil gibran, in his classic work, the prophet,
says: 'you give but little when you give of your possessions. it is
when
you give of yourself that you truly give.' give as in yonder valley the
myrtle breathes its fragrance into space."
"bring the whole tithe into the storehouse could
imply a commitment to work with the law in all aspects of life. prove
me
now, god says. prove the law in action. this involves going the second
mile in meeting obligations, turning the other cheek in relationships,
and forgiving "until seventy times seven." it means diligence
in keeping the high watch of positive thinking, and loving reactions in
overcoming the world of tribulations."
"jesus gave prime emphasis on giving as the way to
achieve this degree of consciousness: give, and you will receive. get
the
feeling of being a channel for the flow of good. think give, and you
will
receive. think of your work as giving. think of every relationship as
an
opportunity to give. give to your children. give to your neighbors.
give
to passers-by on the street. think give. give way. let!"
"on human levels of consciousness one may emphasize
getting and having as the prime goals, in spiritual consciousness he
seeks
the way of giving and being."
"when you begin to see things from the high
perspective
of the ever-presence of god-substance, you will be in the creative flow
of abundance, which will bless your life with sustained affluence. and
it will also go forth from you as a prospering influence in the world."
"wherever substance is at all, the whole of
substance
must be; and because substance is omnipresent, the whole of universal
substance
must be present at every point in space at the same time."
"this is fundamental spiritual law. when you really
know yourself as a spiritual being, you experience the fulfilling of
the
law, which "rushes, streams, and pours into you: in terms of substance
and supply and all that is required for success. when jesus said: '...
i came that they may have life, and have it
abundantly,' (john 10:10)
he was saying that the breakthrough he had made into infinite
mind
prepared
the way for what emerson called an inlet that may become an outlet to
all
there is in god."
"go within in a time of silence and get a renewed
awareness of god as your resource, and then go about your business
affairs
in the strong consciousness of the omnipresence of substance."
"believe that you are always in the presence of
limitless
substance which you form and shape and release through your faith. keep
the high watch of truth by knowing that, wherever you are and whatever
your experience, you are an inlet and may become an outlet for the flow
of god-substance."
"there is no such thing as a lack of faith. we all
have plenty of faith, it's just that we have faith in the wrong things.
we have faith in what can't be done rather than what can be done. we
have
faith in lack rather than abundance but there is no lack of faith.
faith
is a law."
"nothing stops the man who desires to achieve. every
obstacle is simply a course to develop his achievement muscle. it's a
strengthening
of his powers of accomplishment."
