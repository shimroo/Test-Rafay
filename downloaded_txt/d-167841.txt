from bitter to sweet
a few weeks ago, during my “one year bible” reading, i came across exodus 15:22-27. it’s a big moment for the israelites – they had just witnessed the miraculous parting of the red sea. but their celebration was short-lived.

a healthy portion of joy
one day last week, my neighbor shared a story that has stuck with me. he had recently stepped outside his home and noticed the faint smell of gas. concerned, he did the right thing and called the gas company.

making room for the calling
it’s hard to believe that we’re in the middle of january already. as you read this, we are in the heart of our making room stewardship series – a time of teaching, prayer and reflection as we align our lives with god’s priorities.
