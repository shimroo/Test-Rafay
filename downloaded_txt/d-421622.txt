practical astrophotography,
a book by jeffrey r. charles
(isbn 1-85233-023-6)
published by: 
springer-verlag
as part of the "practical astronomy" series.
available at popular book stores, including border books / 
amazon.com

this informative book captures the effective ways jeffrey charles learned 
astrophotography, sometimes through trial and error.  included are many tips 
about photography of planets, nebulae, eclipses, and more, plus a sample check 
list for travel and an astrophotography exposure guide.  covered are use of a wide 
range of telescopes and camera lenses, but the emphasis is on what can be done smaller 
aperture telescopes because these are what more people have.  
if you like the astrophotography related articles at the versacorp.com 
and eclipsechaser.com web sites, you'll really like this book!
----------------------
it is envisioned that a cd 
(if approved by the publisher) intended for use with this book will 
eventually be available for sale.  if implemented, cd would include color image 
files for most photos in the book, plus minor updates or errata 
notes.
on line errata notes may also be available at 
this link in the future.

eclipse chaser's guide to... wow
by jeffrey r. charles
cd: navagable cd of eclipse chaser web site, plus 
high resolution 360 degree vr eclipse site images.
(updated version should be available late 2018.)
video: an eclipse video is unlikely, partly because the first 4 eclipses were shot in analog sd video, and there is little 2017 footage of anything but the eclipse itself. a 2-hour digitally edited chronicle of 5 total solar eclipse expeditions had been planned. if a video is made, it may just be posted on a video site, preceded by video ad, but not banner overlays.
book: hard copy book is unlikely, partly because printing costs are high for a book with images that could rival large hdtv and computer displays.
available now from versacorp:
cd: eclipsechaser web site (with extra images): $19.95 including conus shipping. version with larger pix may be avail. late 2018.
prices and availability subject to change without notice.
images and more: prints, electronic files, 
and licenses are available for individual images and groups of images 
(photographs and other visual arts), as are licenses for software, 
music, screen plays, production rights, trademarks, and other

science and religion:


the falsehood of cosmic doomsday myths: fact versus fiction in the solar system.
the purpose of this paper is to ameliorate distraction and unease many may 
have experienced due to "doomsday scenarios" that were circulated circa 2008, 
some of which involve a so-called "rogue planet".  specifically, the 
somewhat long document demonstrates that, based on the current state of the solar 
system and the laws of physics, many predicted "doomsday scenarios" 
are mere fantasy, won't happen "on cue", and in fact cannot happen, particularly in the near term time frame most proponents predict. it is different from my other papers, but necessary because it appears that more and more people are being influenced by false "doomsday scenarios", and this trend has to stop. 

the paper is intended to neutralize the impact false doomsday scenarios may potentially have on people, specifically in the church, where there are at 
least two "lines of defense" (spiritual and intellectual) against such 
"false teaching".  the paper emphasizes religious arguments against many 
"popular" doomsday scenarios, but also addresses secular concerns 
about such far-fetched, false predictions.  this is because the so-called 
"science" in a vast majority of such predictions is flawed in obvious ways. 
the paper was first presented on 22 august, 2008, in downey, california. 
the linked file is only in draft form. (900kb pdf file)

about versacorp and the versacorp.com web site

versacorp (tm, sm) is a business that is 
dedicated to the development and marketing of highly innovative 
and versatile products, services, and technologies that encompass 
many fields.

versacorp was founded in 1983 
near estes park, colorado, by jeffrey r. charles.  versacorp 
began as a merger of the jeffrey r. charles' photography and art 
business (photography services, custom enlargements, drawings, 
exhibits, etc.); related marketing publication (e.g. brochure, etc.) 
design business; and camera and instrument repair and sales business. 
at the same time, mr. charles' "jrc designs" (tm, sm) business 
also came under the umbrella of versacorp. this aspect of the 
business also involves photography, but emphasizes a wide range 
of new technology development and related speculative product 
and intellectual property (ip) marketing.  the name "versacorp" 
was originated for the business because it was descriptive of the many 
encompassed markets and the versatile nature of the original and 
planned products, services, and technology.

the first versacorp-designed product (not counting artwork) 
was the versadapter (tm), a multiple function 
photographic and visual adapter for telescopes and other 
optical systems.  several months later, versacorp moved its 
operations to arizona, and, with an advertisement in the january 
1984 issue of sky and telescope magazine, began to internationally 
market a variety of its products, including the highly innovative 
versagonal (tm), a multiple function photo-visual flip mirror 
attachment for telescopes, surveillance instruments, microscopes, 
and other optical systems.

in the next few years, versacorp performed a variety of services 
including several types of repair and consulting engineering.  versacorp 
also obtained several patents, transferred some of its technology to 
licensees, and marketed (wholesale and retail) many additional 
products.  by 1991, versacorp had introduced more than 80 new 
optical, mechanical, electronic, and published products, 
some of which are still on the market today.  
while many versacorp products relate to optics, other past and 
present versacorp products, services, and technologies encompass 
a wide variety of additional markets including aerospace, 
astronomy, consulting, engineering, industrial equipment, 
sporting goods, surplus items (including miscellaneous items), 
transportation, furnishings, novelties, toys, games, ornamental design, 
publications, photography; film, video and digital cameras, 
video accessories; video production, custom machining, and more.  
up through 1991, versacorp was also a dealer for questar and vernonscope 
instruments, and versacorp customers have ranged from individuals, 
to universities, to the nasa funded jet propulsion laboratory.

in 1993, versacorp moved its operations to california and began 
to place more emphasis on ip and services.  at this time, versacorp 
discontinued some of its simpler astronomy related products in 
favor of a smaller number of more versatile multifunction products. 
in 1996, versacorp began to emphasize internet marketing of its 
products, services, and technology.  services were expanded to 
include image processing, web page design, technical writing, 
screen writing, editing, referrals, science consulting, design 
engineering, conceptual design, and system engineering. 
products, technologies, and other intellectual property developed 
or introduced during this time include airborne and space 
platforms, communications, medical, software, written works 
(including action, historical, science fiction, and technical), 
and new technology for 360 degree panoramic imaging.  
by 1997, versacorp had built on its founder's 1980's wide angle 
imaging concepts to go beyond 360 degree panoramic imaging 
and developed technology for true one shot full sphere imaging and 
associated virtual reality environments.  versacorp subsequently 
obtained related utility patents encompassing over 100 claims. 
in 2000, the founder of versacorp authored the book "practical 
astrophotography", which is published by springer-verlag.

more recent versacorp products, services, technology, and other ip 
holdings include the fields of architecture and site design, digital 
imaging, microscopes, scanning mirrors, and automotive parts. 
versacorp currently offers most of its previously available 
services and many of its previously introduced products, as well 
as technology transfer and other licensing opportunities for all 
aspects of its intellectual property (ip). more recently, versacorp 
has been using some of its web space to promote technology transfer 
for its patented and patent pending panoramic and full sphere virtual 
reality technologies. performing arts works (mostly lyrics and some 
music) were included in available ip by 2011. 
those interested in licensing versacorp technology or other 
versacorp intellectual property are invited to contact the 
technology transfer department at: license *at* versacorp.com.
