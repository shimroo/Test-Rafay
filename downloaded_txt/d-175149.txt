what dancers say about bellydancing with keti:





"keti's a-z system is one of the best constructed syllabuses i have seen in any form of dance education. she has to be one of the finest teachers of this genre in the world. her work is thoughtful and carefully graded, each step builds on previous ones. "

                                "keti's courses always exceed my high expectations. she always brings fresh ideas and invaluable dimensions to her timeless routines. as an egyptian contemporary dance graduate, i appreciate her insight, and have attended several of her live music training events in egypt."

                                "i've taken many workshops with great teachers, but keti's a-z courses were the most in-depth. i feel enriched! these courses gave me so much to share with my students - history, culture, musicality and so many new routines for my choreos."

                                "a-z gave me confidence, skill and is a wonderful resource to share. the first thing students comment on is its clarity and structure. improvisation is encouraged and intuitive dance skills are developed. on a deeper level, ketiâs approach embraces holistic elements of movement and energy work."

                                "a-z bellydance gave me a new approach, relevant to how i feel about dance as a healing art. the way keti organizes the course materials is awesome, genius! somatics has helped me be more present and aware in my body and has expanded my overall dance experience at all levels."

                                âi'd been bellydancing for years but felt really self conscious in free dance. keti's a-z has come as a breath of fresh air! i apply it to free dance and am no longer left wondering, i just go with the flow. it's really exciting to play with and give it my own personal twist. i'd recommend it for beginners or advanced dancers, there's so much fun to be had!â

"learning the a-z bellydance format was a game changer as a teacher, and for my students, providing a solid, yet flexible methodology upon which to build skills, as well as providing a solid cultural and historical foundation to the dance. as a mind body fitness teacher as well, i have integrated somatic principles both into my dance teaching, and my mind body based classes. it has assisted me in the development of new mind body based programs, and my clients have enjoyed feeling the movements in their body in new and deeper ways.â
