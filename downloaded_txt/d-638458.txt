over 50 years and 1000s of thoroughbred motorcars delivered 












































 



 































 






nestled in the horse country of rural new jersey, is an eclectic collection of the finest “thoroughbred motorcars.”  just moments from the united states equestrian training center and the united states golf headquarters, the stable, ltd., is located in the heart of the somerset hills.
visitors are greeted with open roads and rolling pastures in a bucolic setting conveniently located within walking distance to nyc trains, and close proximity to several major, and private, airports.
the stable, ltd. has been providing sales, and service, of thoroughbred motorcars since 1973.

"the 328 that i bought was the best investment i made on four wheels. tom made both the car and transaction beyond my expectations. always a fine selection for every enthusiast and wallet at the stable ltd."
