a need for change 



it's no secret.
rising operational costs and slimming budgets
are ongoing challenges for healthcare foodservice.
from a rising patient population to the mounting
paperwork, health system and single-site hospital
departments are feeling the financial and
organizational pressures of today’s healthcare
landscape, and a need for change is evident. 



healthcare executives would agree that their
top objectives entail efficiency, protecting
department budgets, and reducing risks, without
impacting quality of care given to patients,
staff, and patrons.

foodservice automation that leadsto optimizedoutcomes 



our fully-integrated system, hospitality suite, encompasses all aspects
of foodservice automation in one. from inventory to recipes and menus to meal distribution and point-of-sale, departments can realize the cost-saving benefits of utilizing software at every point in the supply chain. 



having one system manage tasks at every level in the supply chain also allows facilities to have a connected operation,
leading to consistent data capture that can be leveraged in
the decision-making process. lacking foodservice automation can contribute to operations spending more money than necessary. for that reason, a single platform solution is necessary to analyze
and manage all of these components.
