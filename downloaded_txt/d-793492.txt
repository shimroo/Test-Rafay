latest book: a possible epic of care: a collaborative poem between andrei codrescu and vincent katzandrei on his collaboration between himself and vincent katz: ‘our common bonds at that curious time of the planet-engulfing plague were various: we were friends, we were poets, we took poetry seriously enough to believe in its superpowers, but above all, we both had mothers who at ages past ninety needed the care and attention that we could provide them. 



our exchanges quickly became an ongoing epic of care. it became also a store of reminiscences, activities and ideas that paid homage to the women we cared for—communiqués and confessions that we would have liked them to appreciateblack widow press – october 17 2023

recent book: too late for nightmaresone hundred pages of cri-de-coeur poems written while washing vegetables and hands in the dark panic days of 2020-2022 in order to repel the horrors of covid politics of those stolen years. intended as spells these works are meant to healblack widow press – sept 2022



“my only job is to think."  me too, and i think you might be a cross between a secular wh auden only with a sense of humor, and frank o'hara only straight. or you are a fast train giving off sparks when you round corners, and the track is all corners. anyway, i really love this book and am dog-earing it compulsively. not only the poems about poetry, but things like "the weather is nice" and "walk on all fours" and "still hunting"  make me breathless with adoration, as wordsworth says. all that anger in the same bed as all that fun. alicia ostriker 11.29 2022 on "too late for nightmares""with humor and grace, wisdom and tenderness, codrescu transforms the commonplace into the miraculous. his work is cause for celebration" – kay boyle"andrei codrescu lives and writes at the edge of his imagination. he is a poet of hope and political defiance, of exaltation and exuberance"  – walter bargen“grab any dozen adjectives, and they’ll probably describe andrei codrescu: dazzling, funny, generous, warm, principled, loyal, dangerous, flaneur, mr present… it’s amazing how little ennui he’s capable of” – elinor nauen
