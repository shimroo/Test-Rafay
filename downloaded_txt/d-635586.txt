welcome to kayakfishing.com
since you’re here, chances are you already fish from a kayak or you think it’s a good idea.  i did too.
the first kayak fishing web site to hit the internet in august 1997, it’s been our ongoing mission to help direct anglers into the sport efficiently and cost effectively ever since.
editorially, we strive to promote kayak fishing over advertising, new products, competitive fishing, sponsorships and massive egos. with a deeper passion for the sport itself, we recommend all the proven fishing kayaks with paddle and peddle, as we know them.  in our direct referrals (by phone, text and email), we also recommend all the proven gear to best serve each angler in his and her fishery.
like the sport that used to cost a few hundred bucks bucks to get started in, kayakfishingdotcom has seen a lot of change over 24 years.  entry level kayaks start neat $1000 and some people come out to fish the coastal kayak fishing school with 5-$10,000 dollars already invested.  most every region now has a forum based website and fb has captivated, far reaching pages on sport specific topics from beginners to motorized kayak fishing (motor boating).  beyond profiling our fishing and crab trips here on california’s sonoma coast, the kayakfishingdotcom has always served as a resource for both entry level and veteran anglers to call, text or email a seasoned guide for information coast to coast.
entry level kayak anglers will still find quality information, blogs with kayak fishing info and tutorials, news on the sport and more as we grow the site.  pour through the menu to get a feel.
with paddling, peddling and so many specialty fishing kayaks, there’s a lot to consider.  we continue to fit anglers with the best kayaks, tackle, gear, and informed recommendations . we don’t sell boats or gear or much of anything beyond incredible fishing experiences here on the sonoma coast, 90 minutes north of san francisco.  between fishing and crabbing, kayak trips are available year `round.
there is no one “best kayak” for fishing and truth is, new fishing kayaks start around $299 if that suits your budget and fishery (don’t expect to pay that for ocean or big water fishing).  among the growing number of popular proven models, most are readily available used and often come with quality gear and accessories at a fraction of the cost of gearing up new.  into our third decade, kayakfishing.com guides have made more unbiased product referrals, to thousands of anglers for first kayaks and upgrade models plus kayak fishing gear and accessories, than we can count.
get good information! unique to all the sites that followed, anglers can still reach a guide or pro-staffer directly through kayakfishing.com by phone, text or email.   a handful of kayak fishing experts, including writers, guides and exceptionally talented anglers coast to coast, have been fielding angler inquiries for over 24 years.  give a call anytime!
continued good fishing,
