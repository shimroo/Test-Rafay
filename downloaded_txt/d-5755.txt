mission statement

founded in 2001, the
        reefquest centre for shark research is dedicated
      to shark and ray conservation through its scientific research and public
      education programs. the centre maintains research equipment and
      facilities, reference collections of fossil and extant elasmobranch
      specimens, a scientific library, elasmobranch data bases, and public
      education materials. 
 the centre oversees the thesis research of selected
      graduate students as well as publishes results of its own original
      research and those resulting from collaboration with students or
      colleagues in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, co-organizes
      international scientific conferences, and will begin producing its own
      series of scientific reports in late 2003.


  the main
      purposes of this website are:

to provide a resource for students and educators,
 to
      foster increased public awareness of the beauty, diversity, and
      vulnerability of sharks and rays.
 to facilitate collaborations with other researchers, and
 to establish a network of interested volunteers willing to collect
          specimens or data on behalf of the centre
