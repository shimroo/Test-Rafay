hottest dishes in town."every sit-down mexican restaurant offers fajitas, of course, but moctezuma’s turns its fajitas into a flaming affair for a mere two [dollars] more. for that surcharge, a server adds a ramekin of tequila to the sizzling tower, flames the booze, then let’s you watch as it cooks down to a tasty sauce. i ordered mine vegetarian and was rewarded with oregano-flecked roasted halved tomatoes, onions, bell pepper, half moons of zucchini, mushrooms and broccoli florets on a sizzling iron platform. served with poblano-lime rice, slow-simmered black beans and handmade tortillas grilled fresh to order in the lobby of the restaurant.
