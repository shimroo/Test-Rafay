scarlet macaw project
this is a project that we have been supporting from the inception. at that time there was poaching of young birds and the scarlet macaws were reducing in number. by recruiting the trappers to protect the nest sites the wild population began to increase. the school children were ‘educated’ that scarlet macaws were a valuable asset to the community and informed that tourists would come to see these beautiful birds and therefore boost income into the country. colouring books of outlines of scarlet macaws were printed and distributed to the schools and slowly the children learnt about these macaws. more recently cameras have been fitted in nesting cavities and the footage of the parents feeding the babies has been sent to the schools. 














tree tinning
one of the longest standing and continuously successful projects is the ’tinning’ of trees in australia to prevent predators climbing tree trunks to raid birds’ nests. this was the initiative of ray akroyd, initially specifically targeted at major mitchell’s cockatoos, but it ha since been widely adopted to assist other cockatoo species, and taken on board by neighbouring farmers and other conservation groups.













donation
many other species have been supported, either in the past or still ongoing. these include lilian’s lovebirds and african grey parrots in africa; fuerte’s parrots in colombia; blue-throated macaws in bolivia; the yellow-shouldered amazon parrot in bonaire; and grey-breasted conures, vinaceous amazon parrots, and lear’s macaws in brazil. keep a look out on our latest news page, and for full details of all these projects, and others as they arrive, or to make a welcome donation click here.
