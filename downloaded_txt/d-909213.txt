"community organizing is the process of building power through involving a constituency in identifying problems they share and the solutions to those problems that they desire” 



- david beckwith 



our vision is to broaden that impact by working together, as a network of community groups, and to identify and meet the training and resource developments of every member group. we are committed to support noble, the ohio fair lending coalition, and the shaker square alliance, in our common mission to advance general equity and to generate progressive change. 












volunteer journey
