frequently asked questions



is aruba safe?



aruba is one of the safest destinations in the caribbean. average crime rates are low compared to other islands, and the people are very friendly! aruba is also located just outside of the hurricane belt, meaning that the island is usually not in the direct path of hurricanes.





what is the weather like in aruba?



aruba is the island with the least rainfall in the caribbean. all year long, the temperature remains around 28 degrees celsius (82 degrees fahrenheit). except for a few occasional showers, the sun is usually always shining in aruba. this is also one of the many reasons why the island has such a high percentage of repeat visitors.





what can you do in aruba?



while aruba is best known for our beautiful beaches, there is so much more to do than just lounging in the sun or going for a swim. visit the historical oranjestad and explore museums and distinctly caribbean colored buildings. or take a trip down to san nicolas, also known as “sunrise city”, this cute little town is covered in colorful and artistic murals. aruba also has a national park named arikok, and two rock formation parks ayo and casi bari. fancy a climb? take on the challenge and climb the steps up to aruba’s hooiberg mountain. for the adventure seekers the north side of the island has a lot to explore as well, from old abandoned ruins to natural pools. take a catamaran out to sea and visit one of the amazing shipwrecks along the coast, or go parasailing to see the coastline from a different perspective. or take it to the next level and go skydiving. when visiting aruba you won’t go hungry, as the restaurant and nightlife scene is bustling with many different types of cuisine and interesting dining concepts. whether you want to relax or explore, aruba has something for you.





what is the best time to visit aruba?



as the weather is consistently warm, aruba is a great travel destination year round. the high season with the most visitors starts in mid-december and lasts until mid-april, this means that prices can rise in this period. so if you’re looking for a less crowded and more affordable vacation, think about planning your trip around the summer months.





what is the best place to stay in aruba?



the most popular place to stay in aruba is palm beach. the majority of aruba’s high-rise hotels are located here. along the strip you will also find many casino’s, restaurants, clubs and watersports companies. this is a great area for first timers. most of the low-rise hotels are located along eagle beach, stay here if you’re looking for a more quiet accommodation. don’t worry though, you will still be close to the hustle and bustle of palm beach when staying at eagle beach. staying in oranjestad is also highly recommended, although it is further away from the beach, the colorful town is sure to inspire you.
