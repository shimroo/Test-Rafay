welcome to
wilmington & the brandywine valley





greater wilmington and the brandywine valley is at the center of the mid-atlantic region and minutes off the i-95 corridor. while we are close by – ideal for a quick weekend getaway – you will feel as if you have been transported to a different land. 
the rolling hills and magnificent estates of the brandywine valley recall the french countryside. wilmington’s dining scene is a cornucopia of global flavors. the colonial hamlets of new castle and odessa give you the feeling of an english country village. our six grand gardens, all part of america's garden capital, encompass over 3,000 acres and lie within minutes of one another.
