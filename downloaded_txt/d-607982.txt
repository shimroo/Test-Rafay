our story
 
creating vivid landscape experiences
 
   my colleagues and i create larger than life living sculpture topiary for fine homes, gardens and resorts – as well as living corporate logos, world wide. our shop here in tellico plains can handle up to 64′ 10″ tall steel wire topiary structures that we deliver, set up, and even plant if you want us to.  or, if you prefer, we can build them on-site at your location – less footprint, no freighting! normal freight from our shop is fob tellico plains, tennessee.
you are welcome to make an appointment! our shop is open to your trip to tennessee, located at the southern entrance to the cherokee national forest, mile marker one, 1350 cherohala skyway.
it is something different every day here! from giraffes and elephants one day to giant chickens or a 20′ wolf the next. we are proud of all the things we get to make and appreciate the chance to be creative,  daily.
