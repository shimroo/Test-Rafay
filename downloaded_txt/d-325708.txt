village life

in the park

afton village patterned after our most beautiful traditional historic neighborhoods, afton village is planned with the pedestrian in mind. tree-lined streets and a network of wide sidewalks will create a strong pedestrian connection between residential areas and the commercial main street, the village green, and the 60 acre park that bisects the community.
