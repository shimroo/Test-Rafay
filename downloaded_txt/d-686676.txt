long term; about the weather







up to 2009 we had really hot dry summers. then suddenly god
decided once again he didn’t like the way people in this country were living
such sinful lives that he decide to punish us by filling the  summer months with rain.


well that’s what opponents of same sex marriage said anyway.
what really happened is the atlantic ocean warmed up, possibly due to climate
change or maybe just something that happens from time to time. 


a group of meteorologist recently ( may 2013) met in exeter
and decided that the atlantic was going through a 20 year warming cycle. this
warming has affected the jet stream, bringing it further south which produces
loads of rain brought in by the persistent south west winds that blow over the
uk. if this is true then the next sunny summer we will have here in the uk will
be in 2030 or there abouts. i will be 87 by then, i could even miss it.


but i have set this post to re-appear in 2016, 2021, 2026 and
2031 so we can check on the accuracy of the met offices prediction.

here in sydney, which is in australia for those of you who are as bad at geography as i am at spelling, you can travel on trains, buses and ferries all day long on a sunday for just $2.50. a bargin. well done sydney transport. now, to show how good you really are why not do away will the $15 surcharge to go to and from the airport. that is a rip-off in anyone's language.

a couple of blasts from the past. the green bus is modern but done up in the salford city transport livery. no ads on the side. salford didn't approve of ads. the red bus is a 1966 manchester cooperation transport bus out of hthe bus museum in the old queens road depot.
