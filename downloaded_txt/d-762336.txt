                                        looked beautiful. outer roses not super fresh. outer leaves already browning and wilting upon arrival.

                                        beautiful flowers; nice large bouquet (i was pleasantly surprised how large it was for $50!). delivery same day.  i ordered online at 730a and they received them before 1p.  this is my second purchase with creative and will definitely order again.

                                        i am truly impressed by my experience with creative floral designs! i ordered flowers from san francisco for a friend who lost her mom in alhambra, ca. before the flowers were delivered, i was emailed a "bloomsnap" (clear photo of what the arrangement looked like) and it was gorgeous! this is an awesome touch!  i will never order from one of those oversized corporate floral companies again, who have disappointed consistently with poor quality. thank you creative floral! i appreciate the updates and great job done!

                                        bernie and his team are magical.  the website doesn’t do creative floral designs justice.  they created an amazing arrangement on short order, were reasonably priced, and listened to my request (to add more pink).  i would recommend everyone order flowers from cdf.

                                        i sent these to my mother for mother’s day (2020). i ordered from the website and hoped the arrangement would look as beautiful as the picture. when my mom got the flowers she called me right away and told me they were the most beautiful flower arrangement she’s ever seen. it was so nice to be able to send my mom flowers that made her that happy during a quarantined mother’s day.

                                        this florist was extremely easy to work with—they designed an arrangement just for our aunt who  a birthday and is alone. i would highly recommend this florist!!

                                        creative floral designs did a great job with the floral arrangement we ordered. 
not only was it beautifully made, they were also very accommodating with the handling of the card we needed to go with the arrangement. 
the card was dropped off at the fullerton location, hand picked by them, and delivered with the flowers from the san gabriel location. 
highly recommend them.
