summary:

 
bill carter ruins his first chance with katrina korosec after they meet at a dance lesson. the experience sends him into a downward spiral of drugs, alcohol and depression, and nearly kills him. a kind hypnotist brings him back from the edge and sets him on a quest to heal the ache in his soul. his path out of his funk takes him through meditation and weird religions, resulting in an amazing discovery. "the mystery" is a kind of song that echoes in his brain, and gives meaning to his life.

after deep meditation on the mystery, he eventually finds a way to travel through time and fix that fateful night with katrina.

but time travel is never as simple as it seems. his several attempts to fix the past bring him deeper and deeper into a strange conspiracy of galactic significance.

summary:

 
the current cultural assumptions about love, sex, dating and marriage are not only absurd, but a danger to society and to individuals. we've taken the most successful institution known to man, tinkered with it, played with it, and toyed with it until it's barely functional. marriage simply isn't such a great deal these days, which is why many people are opting out. especially young men. this little book says the problem lies with all the modern assumptions we've tagged on to marriage. marriage is (or at least it was) the structure that took the complicated mess of human nature and created a legal and social framework that used our natural impulses and desires to create a stable society. marriage is what keeps human cultures from devolving into chaos. these 50 politically incorrect thoughts call young men to abandon the modern approach and look at love, marriage and sex from a different point of view.
