how to set up direct deposit


close modal window










whether you wish to send a one-time direct deposit, such as your tax refund, or your recurring paycheck – sfcu wants to make it easy.
here is all you need to do:

provide routing number, which is 221379905
provide your account number. do not include the suffix.ex. if your account number is 123456 and your checking account suffix is 0700, do not provide 123456-0700. only provide 123456.
if the form asks if the funds go to savings or checking, make your selection. if no selection is made and you have an sfcu checking, the funds will be deposited into the checking account.

it’s as simple as 1-2-3. if you have any additional questions, select the chat option during virtual branch hours or call to speak with a representative.
keep track of your account with online and mobile access. if you have not yet done so, register today for 24/7 access!
