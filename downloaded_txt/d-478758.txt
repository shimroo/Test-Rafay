first class hunting in namibia


since 1975




jan oelofse hunting safaris, our experienced and passionate team of professional hunters, will provide you with one of the best hunting experiences in namibia and all of africa. we are a family-run operation, established by the famous conservationist jan oelofse and his family in namibia in 1975. since the passing of this great man, our beloved husband, father, entrepreneur, inventor, artist, mentor and friend to many, the oelofse family annette and alex with carola, are carrying on the legacy he left behind. our hunts are customized to accommodate the expectations of hunters from various backgrounds and ages, we welcome families with children, bow-hunters and disabled hunters alike. being above all passionate conservationists, our dream is to offer hunts such to naturally sustain the environment and all its animals, with the interest of the current and the future generations of animals and hunters at heart. in jan oelofse’s words, our aim is to: “always give back more to nature than you take out.” we invite you to experience exactly that which our forefathers called africa!





















jan oelofse legacy award





the jan oelofse legacy award has been offering hunts annually to disabled hunters since 1992, including 10 trophy animals, daily rates and skinning.previously, this award was part of the sci pathfinder award, but unfortunately it was decided to no longer include this opportunity at the sci events.we have wholeheartedly chosen to continue this legacy in the name of conservationist jan oelofse, who was the founder of our outfit, and the initiator behind this award many years ago. our facilities are fully equipped to cater for disabled hunters, offering hunts to outdoorsmen and women in wheelchairs, from lightly disabled candidates to quadriplegics. our professional hunter rudie de klerk is exceptionally experienced in guiding these hunts, having suffered and recovered from a disability inflicted by an elephant attack some time ago. the recipients of this award have often found this experience life-changing, and have given us the opportunity to meet extraordinarily inspirational people, who have succeeded against the odds. it would be our greatest honour and privilege to continue hosting hunters who deserve to be rewarded for continuing a shared passion for the outdoors.
