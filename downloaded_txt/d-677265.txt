working together for peace 
the mission of the peace council is to demonstrate that peace is possible, and that effective interreligious collaboration to make peace also is possible.
in a world where religion too often is used to justify division, hatred, and violence, the peace councilors offer an alternative: the example of leaders from different religious communities working together in practical ways to relieve suffering and to make the world whole.
"the peace council is committed to working together for the common needs of the whole community of life. the council will build bridges through the message of non-violence, compassion, human rights, and universal responsibility, individual and collective."
														(from the statement adopted at windsor, november 30, 1995)
