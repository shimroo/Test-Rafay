everything is god/love in truth.  anything not coming from love is acting in fear.  fear is the opposite of love.
there is only god/love and everything is that; everything-else is an experience god/love is having.
every piece of this universe and beyond is an ego/separation experience god/love is having with and within itself.
ego is what allows god the experience of feeling-like an individual and separate; without ego everything would feel one with everything.
god calls itself ‘i am’.  god is conscious emotional energy.  all experiences happen within god’s consciousness.
everything vibrates at a frequency; that vibration is energy; that energy is god’s consciousness.
a spirit/soul is god’s energy having that spirit/soul/ego/separation experience.
everything/everyone/ego is god/love in truth and has the experience being a multidimensional being existing on many levels simultaneously.
love is at a high-frequency; fear is at a low-frequency.  in every-moment a person is choosing either love or fear.
love accepts and trusts all things and does not judge.  judging is labeling things good, bad, right, wrong, better, best, ugly, beautiful,
using the words should, shouldn’t, need, must, normal, sin, sinner, etc.  judging is also stereotyping and assuming things.
love includes... joy, peace, compassion, gratitude, abundance, freedom, wisdom, accepting and trusting all things, not judging.
fear includes... anger, depression, anxiety, lack-of-love, not accepting or trusting things, judging things.
whatever frequency [love/fear] you are at you attract and experience [be love if you desire love-based experiences].
whatever a person thinks/says/believes they manifest/create and experience;  monitor what you think/say/believe;
consistently think/say/believe whatever it is you desire to experience and imagine and feel it as if you already have it to manifest/create it.
focus less on doing and more on what you are being [love/fear] in all the things you are doing.
be true to who you are and allow others to be true to who they are.  you cannot stand in the light if you are holding others in the dark.
share your truth and what others do with that truth is none of your business.  think both/and instead of either/or.
there is only the now/present moment [past/future are illusions]; time and space are one in the same and are illusions.

i greatly appreciate all the support i have received from visits, comments, and sales.  if you have any questions please contact me.  i send everything love, light, and my all-energy which includes an abundance of intentions to raise the frequency of everything into love and in doing so helps shift everything from fear [anger, depression, anxiety, judging things, not accepting or trusting things] into love [joy, peace, compassion, gratitude, abundance, freedom, wisdom, being 100% healthy, not judging things, accepting and trusting all things].
