if you’re experiencing heel pain, the first thing to do is rest. you can also reduce your activity level and use over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to help with pain and swelling.
you can also try stretching exercises and icing your foot. a physical therapist can show you simple stretches for your plantar fascia and achilles tendon.
pain on the bottom of your foot.
plantar fasciitis causes pain in the bottom of your foot near your heel or arch. the pain is most intense when you take your first steps after waking up or after long periods of sitting. the pain may also feel like a stabbing sensation when you walk or run, especially on hard surfaces.
icing the tender area several times a day can help reduce pain and swelling. you can also use off-the-shelf or custom orthotic arch supports that go inside your shoes to distribute your weight more evenly. you can also try wearing a night splint to hold your leg in a stretched position while you sleep.
if simple treatments don’t help, your doctor can inject a steroid into your plantar fascia to reduce inflammation and pain. he or she can also recommend dry needling (a technique similar to acupuncture), joint mobilization, or platelet-rich plasma injections (using your own blood cells to promote healing). more than 90% of people with plantar fasciitis improve within 10 months of starting simple treatment methods.
tenderness on the bottom of your foot.
the most common symptom is pain when you take your first steps after getting up in the morning or after long periods of rest. the pain usually starts in one spot on the bottom of your foot near the heel. it can be a dull ache or a sharp, stabbing pain. the pain often gets worse as you walk and climb stairs.
your doctor will usually be able to diagnose plantar fasciitis based on your medical history and physical exam. they may ask about the things that aggravate or relieve your pain and they may move your ankle and foot to see how it responds. they may also press on the bottom of your foot near the tender area to check for tightness or swelling.
conservative treatments like rest, icing the affected area several times a day and using supports or shoe inserts may reduce the pain. taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication can help with the pain and inflammation too. a steroid injection into the affected area can also reduce pain in some people.
heel pain.

most people with plantar fasciitis get better by following simple self-management tips. resting your foot, avoiding activities that make the pain worse and using heel pads or arch supports can help. ice massage can reduce inflammation and decrease pain, as can doing specific stretching exercises to lengthen the plantar fascia.부산족저근막염
you’re more likely to develop plantar fasciitis if you:
are overweight or obese
have a job that requires standing for long periods of time
have tight calf muscles that limit how far you can flex your ankles
if your symptoms don’t improve, you may need additional treatments. these include:
your health care professional will check your feet and legs for tenderness. they will also ask about your daily activities and how the pain affects your life. they may suggest an x-ray or an mri to make sure that another problem isn’t causing your heel pain. they will probably also ask you about the history of your pain.
feeling like you’re pressing down on your foot.
when you walk, stand or put pressure on the bottom of your foot, you may feel a sharp pain that feels like pressing down on a bruise. the pain is usually strongest when you first stand up after sleeping or sitting for long periods of time. it’s also common to feel this pain when you begin exercising again after a long break.
over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen) can help reduce pain and swelling. you can also ice your foot for 15 minutes, twice daily, to help reduce inflammation and pain. try covering a frozen water bottle with a towel to protect your skin from frostbite.
plantar fasciitis often gets better with physical therapy, at-home stretches and wearing shoes with good arch support. your doctor may also recommend taping, prescription orthotics or injections to reduce inflammation and pain. in some cases, surgery may be necessary. the majority of patients get relief within nine to 12 months with nonsurgical treatment.부산정형외과





spine and orthopedic surgery at spine hospital

 12월 18, 202412월 18, 2024


we treat a wide range of spinal disorders. our specialists use minimally invasive techniques when possible.
research shows that shared decision making (sdm) and decision quality are related to improved health outcomes in routine elective orthopedic surgeries. however, few studies have evaluated these relationships outside of intervention trials. routine measurement of sdm and decision quality could help improve patient outcomes and satisfaction with routine orthopedic surgery.
decompression
when bone growth, herniated discs or spinal nerves become compressed, it can cause pain, numbness and weakness in the arms and legs. at centers for neurosurgery, spine & orthopedics (cnso), we use conservative care before recommending surgical decompression of the spinal cord or nerves to relieve these symptoms and return you to your normal life activities.
during surgery, we make an incision through which to access your spine and perform the procedure. with the aid of an operating microscope and advanced imaging technology, like fluoroscopy and x-rays, we can navigate through your bones safely and accurately.
during a discectomy or microdiscectomy, surgeons remove herniated portions of the spinal disc that are pressing on the nerves. laminectomy and foraminotomy enlarge the spaces through which spinal nerves pass out of the spinal canal, alleviating stenosis while preserving mobility. disc replacement surgery replaces a worn or damaged disc with an artificial one. kyphoplasty treats spinal compression by inflating a balloon to restore vertebrae height and injecting bone cement.
stabilization
our surgeons offer stabilization surgery to patients with cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine conditions that cause pain, weakness, and numbness. these include spondylosis, in which degenerative changes cause spinal segments to shift and compress neurological structures such as the spinal cord and nerve roots.
we use minimally invasive spine surgery techniques that avoid damage to muscle tissue during the procedure. using a tabular dilator and retractor, surgeons access the spine through a small incision without removing or cutting back muscles. this is called minimally invasive spinal surgery (mist). it results in lower bleeding and shorter hospital stays.

our doctors also use a state-of-the-art eos standing computed tomography (ct) scanner, which creates a 3-d reconstruction of a patient’s spine as they stand in the machine. this helps physicians accurately diagnose musculoskeletal disorders in the spine and determine whether or not surgery is necessary. compared to traditional surgery, mist also leads to faster recovery, less postoperative discomfort, and better adherence to treatment plans.
fusion
if your curved spine isn’t stabilized enough by using spinal instrumentation or decompression, surgery may be needed to fuse the vertebrae together. the doctor puts bone graft between the abnormal vertebrae, and uses metal plates, screws or rods to hold them in place. the graft stimulates bone healing, and over time the vertebrae heal into one solid piece of bone.
a large bandage covers the surgical wound for a day or two, and the nurse checks it every day for signs of infection, such as pain, tenderness or warmth in the area. pain medicines can control any discomfort you experience after surgery.잠실정형외과
you’ll be advised to avoid bending or twisting the back for the first six months following your operation, to prevent stress on the bone graft site. after that, you can gradually return to the activities you enjoyed before your surgery. you may have to wear a brace for support. ask your surgeon which type of brace is best for you.
minimally invasive surgery
minimally invasive surgery uses smaller incisions and specially designed instruments to allow your spine specialist to access the areas that need treatment without disturbing or damaging nearby muscles / soft tissue. this can help reduce post-op pain and narcotic use, scarring, soft tissue damage, blood loss and overall recovery time.
your healthcare provider makes a small incision in your back and then inserts a tubular retractor that exposes the area of your spine to be treated. through this, slender tools and a tiny camera are passed to perform your surgery. once your surgery is done, the tools and retractor are removed and the incision or incisions are closed.
some minimally invasive spine surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis, which means you will be able to return home the same day. patients may experience mild pain in the hours after surgery, but this usually resolves quickly with over-the-counter or prescription medication. this is normal and expected after any surgical procedure.하남척추병원

hospitals can use their blogs to provide valuable information about medical topics and help patients make informed decisions. they can also publish patient success stories to build trust and encourage patients to visit the hospital for health services.
using personable content in hospital marketing can feel risky, but it can be effective when done right. the best hospital marketing campaigns blend personality and relevance with healthcare needs.
content marketing
content marketing is an essential element of a healthcare company’s strategy. it allows hospitals and medical brands to position themselves as experts in their field, elevate their brand perception, and drive awareness. it also helps them build long term relationships with their audiences and attract more qualified sales leads.
the content marketing landscape is a crowded one, but healthcare companies can leverage their industry expertise to stand out. they can create a content schedule that addresses the needs of their audience and delivers valuable information. content can take many forms, including written articles, infographics, videos, and case studies.
a documented content marketing strategy is essential for any healthcare brand. it can help you align your content with the goals of your audience and make sure it meets your business objectives. it can also serve as a reference point for your team and help you track the success of your campaigns. the best way to create a successful content strategy is by working with a professional agency that has vetted, seasoned healthcare writers.
seo
seo is an essential tool for online visibility and success, and healthcare bloggers can use it to help their content reach more people. by researching and implementing relevant keywords, healthcare bloggers can optimize their content for search engine optimization (seo). this includes optimizing the website’s structure and content.
in addition, hospitals can leverage seo to promote specific services and providers by targeting search intent. this can increase the number of potential patients and build brand loyalty. however, hipaa regulations prohibit the use of tracking pixels, which makes it challenging to measure and track results in a compliant way.
a hospital blog is a great place to share valuable information on health topics and services, as well as personal stories about patient experiences. it also helps you establish trust with your audience by demonstrating your knowledge and expertise. in addition, blogging is an effective way to increase website traffic and secure more appointments for healthcare services.
social media
in an era where healthcare costs are rising, hospital marketing must be cost-efficient. it is essential to partner with an agency that focuses on value over quantity. this will help your budget stretch further and ensure that you get the most out of every dollar.
hospital blogs can address common patient questions and concerns, showcase the hospital’s expertise, and improve search engine optimization (seo). they can also promote upcoming events or seasonal health tips.
a well-written blog should include clear calls-to-action that direct readers to the next step. this could be to subscribe to the blog or make an appointment. in addition, hospitals should include information about the author of each post. this will allow patients to feel more connected to the hospital and its staff. this, in turn, will increase engagement and brand loyalty. people are more likely to share content that has a personal touch.
influencer marketing
influencer marketing is an effective healthcare marketing strategy that can help boost visibility and brand reach. however, it’s important to select influencers carefully and create impactful campaigns. it’s also crucial to monitor and track campaign results. this will ensure that your healthcare influencers are delivering the best possible results.병원블로그마케팅
using influencers to promote your hospital can help to humanize your organization and build trust with audiences. this is especially true for healthcare brands, which often struggle to communicate with audiences because of their medical jargon. influencers can bridge this gap by showcasing the compassion and relatability of their personal stories.

however, healthcare influencers must be mindful of the federal trade commission’s regulations regarding disclosure and endorsements. this means that they must clearly label sponsored content and ensure that they have a clear approval process. moreover, they must be aware of the limitations of their audience and only share content that aligns with their values. additionally, they must be careful about promoting health-related products and services that are not approved by the fda.병원마케팅 종류





otolaryngology – a medical specialty focusing on the ears, nose, throat, and head

 11월 27, 202411월 27, 2024


otolaryngology is a medical specialty focusing on the ears, nose, throat, and head. it is one of the oldest recognized specialties in medicine, dating back to the 19th century. otolaryngologists are also called ent doctors, and they are trained to treat medical and surgical conditions related to the ears, nose, throat, larynx (voice box), and structures of the neck and head.

to become an otolaryngologist, physicians must undergo up to 15 years of college and post-graduate training. this includes four years of college, followed by four years of medical school, five to seven years in a residency program specializing in otolaryngology, and then passing the american board of otolaryngology examination. in addition, some otolaryngologists may pursue one- or two-year fellowships for more extensive training in a subspecialty area.
the ear, nose, and throat are delicate areas of the body that are interconnected. doctors in the 19th century realized that examining these systems would allow them to identify and treat many different types of problems. as a result, they developed tools that enabled them to perform both medical and surgical procedures on these regions of the body.
in the ear, otolaryngologists may perform tests such as tympanometry, which measures how well your eardrum moves when air is blown into it; and otoacoustic emissions, which measure the sound waves generated by your middle ear. your otolaryngologist can also help you manage hearing loss by prescribing or fitting you for hearing aids, performing in-office procedures such as removing ear wax, and suggesting other treatments like vestibular therapy to improve dizziness and balance issues.
some of the most common ailments that otolaryngologists treat are sinus and allergy problems, snoring, ear infections, throat and voice issues, squatting or deviated septum, and nasal and sinus polyps. they can also help with more serious conditions such as thyroid or parathyroid surgery, salivary gland disorders, voice and swallowing difficulties, sleep apnea surgery, and neck tumors.부산코수술
otolaryngologists are also trained in the treatment of children with ear, nose and throat problems. they can address pediatric otolaryngology conditions such as recurring ear infections, snoring, birth defects of the nose and throat, and developmental delays in the child’s hearing and speech.부산이비인후과
because of their vast and varied training, otolaryngologists are able to handle both medical and surgical issues of the head and neck region. this is a big reason why many people choose to visit an otolaryngologist rather than a general practitioner when they have an illness or injury affecting their ears, nose, throat, or neck. you can find an otolaryngologist in your area by asking your primary care physician for a referral or searching the american academy of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery’s website for a certified member in your area.





plantar fasciitis and orthopedic surgery

 11월 27, 202411월 27, 2024


plantar fasciitis is a painful condition in which the plantar fascia ligament is pulled tight or torn, usually by excessive pressure from the heel. most patients have mild to moderate pain that improves after treatment, but some may require surgery. if you have persistent heel pain, talk to your doctor about the different treatments available.

noninvasive treatment is typically the first step, and may include stretching exercises (such as calf-strengthening or plantar fascia-specific stretching), shoe inserts, using a night splint to stretch the foot and calf during sleep, and anti-inflammatory medications. a physical exam will be done, and your doctor will take x-rays to assess the alignment of the feet and determine if a bone spur or other abnormality is contributing to the pain.부산족부정형외과
the most common symptom of plantar fasciitis is stabbing pain that appears when you stand or walk after resting for a long time, such as when you wake up in the morning or after sitting for a period of time. you may notice that the pain is worse when you climb stairs or walk after standing for an extended period of time. other symptoms include difficulty or pain when you bend or extend your toes, stiffness in the bottom of the foot or ankle, and an increase in the amount of time that you spend standing or walking.부산무지외반증
depending on your condition, your doctor might recommend wearing supportive shoes or limiting strenuous activities, especially running and barefoot activities. your doctor might also prescribe a heel cushion to decrease shock absorption and help alleviate the strain on the plantar fascia. if these conservative treatments don’t help, your doctor might inject the heel with a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and relieve the pain. platelet-rich plasma (prp) therapy, a procedure that involves injecting the patient’s own blood to boost healing in the injured fascia, has also shown promising results.
surgical options for plantar fasciitis can include gastrocnemius recession, in which the calf muscle is surgically lengthened to take pressure off the plantar fascia, and partial plantar fascia release, in which your surgeon partially cuts the plantar fascia ligament to relieve tension. in some cases, your doctor might use minimally invasive technology such as endoscopic plantar fascia release or percutaneous ultrasound-guided needle tenotomy to perform the procedure without making a large incision. however, these procedures are only recommended when other noninvasive methods haven’t been successful. you should discuss the pros and cons of each option with your doctor.

preparing for dental implant surgery

preparing for dental implant surgery
dental implant surgery replaces the root of a missing tooth. it involves a short recovery period and some diet restrictions.
the procedure can cause swelling, bruising and bleeding. but with proper care, implants can last a lifetime. implants and the jawbone fuse together in a process called osseointegration. this may take a few months.
preparation
the decision to transform your smile with all-on-4 dental implants is a significant one, promising restored confidence and functionality. however, meticulous preparation is vital to ensuring that the surgery itself goes smoothly and your recovery period is swift.
your dentist will review your medical history to ensure you are healthy enough for surgery and can fully heal from the procedure. they may also recommend that you quit harmful habits like smoking, and take preventative measures such as mouth guards to protect against clenching or grinding.
you should arrange transportation to and from your appointment in advance. this is particularly important if you are having iv sedation or oral sedation for the procedure, as these can affect your ability to drive. having someone to drive you home after the procedure will be a relief and allow you to rest in comfort for several days. you should also prepare soft foods beforehand, such as soups and smoothies.
incision
a comprehensive examination will be performed to determine if you’re a candidate for dental implants. this will include a thorough oral evaluation, x-rays and impressions of your gums and teeth. advanced imaging techniques like ct scans and mri are also used to assess the condition of your remaining natural teeth, gums and jawbone. 동탄치과
after the exam, your dentist will numb your mouth using local anesthetic medication. they will also administer sedation, depending on your preference. this can be done through a small mask that fits over your nose or iv sedation.
during the surgical procedure, your surgeon will create an incision in your gums. then they will use a drill to widen the opening in your bone to the appropriate size for an implant. they will then place the implant into the hole and stitch the gum tissue closed. during the healing process, you will need to avoid putting pressure on the implant and continue to practice good oral hygiene habits.
implant placement
before you undergo surgery, a doctor who specializes in conditions of the mouth, jaw and face (oral and maxillofacial surgeon) will review your medical history, examine your teeth and jaw and take x-rays or 3d images. this helps ensure that you’re a good candidate for dental implants and that there are no health issues that would interfere with your recovery.
an oral surgeon will numb the surgical area with local anesthesia before making an incision in the gums to expose the bone. a hole will be drilled into the bone and the implant screw will be placed inside. the incision will be stitched up.
after the implant has healed, a dentist will add the replacement tooth, which is known as a crown. typically made of pfm fused with porcelain, the implant-supported crown is incredibly strong. it can also be brushed and flossed like your natural teeth. you may experience swelling, bruising or pain around the implant site after surgery, but these symptoms will fade over time. you should follow the post-operation instructions provided by your dentist and oral surgeon.
recovery

dental implants take time to heal, but it’s an investment in your long-term oral health. the process of fusing the implant post to your bone tissue is called osseointegration, and it takes several months. during this recovery period, it’s important to follow your dentist’s instructions.
for example, it’s typically best to avoid irritant foods like hard, sticky, or crunchy snacks. you should also brush and floss carefully around the surgical site, and if you’re prescribed an oral rinse, use it as directed.
for most patients, local anesthesia is sufficient to manage discomfort during the recovery period. however, if heavier sedation is used, it’s a good idea to have someone drive you home afterward. you should also schedule follow-up appointments, as instructed, to ensure the healing process is progressing as expected. in many cases, it will take 3-6 months for the implant to fully fuse with your jaw bone. once it does, you’ll be ready to add your restoration.





how safe are diet pills?

weight loss pills can help people lose weight by boosting metabolism or suppressing appetite. they are not a magic weight loss wand, however. they work best when used in combination with a healthy diet and regular exercise. it’s important to carefully read the ingredients on any weight loss pill before taking it to ensure that you aren’t allergic to anything or have any other health concerns.

there are many different types of weight loss pills. some are derived from plants, like garcinia cambogia or hydroxycitric acid, which help the body burn fat. others contain stimulants, such as caffeine, which can boost energy levels and help you burn more calories during your workouts. many pills are also made of calcium, which can help the body absorb vitamins and minerals. there are even pills that are designed to “bind” fat and stop it from being absorbed by the body, such as the prescription drug orlistat, which is sold under the brand names alli or xenical.
although some diet pills are safe to take long-term, they can also have dangerous side effects. in addition, they can have interactions with other medications that you may be taking. the best way to safely use diet pills is with a doctor’s supervision.
many people have a hard time understanding the difference between safe and unsafe weight loss supplements. they are often marketed as being “natural” and “safe,” but they can still have side effects, such as nausea or digestive issues. 강남다이어트 some products may even be dangerous if they have ingredients that aren’t approved for human consumption, such as ephedrine or sibutramine.



over-the-counter and prescription weight loss pills both have the potential to be addictive if they are used improperly. the over-the-counter products aren’t regulated by the fda, so it’s difficult to know what exactly you’re putting in your body. prescription pills, on the other hand, have been screened by the fda. they are typically taken only on a short-term basis and only under a doctor’s care.다이어트약
the frequent promotion of weight loss pills and supplements on social media can make people think that they’re safe to take without a doctor’s approval. this can be especially harmful to teenagers, as it sends the message that being skinny is the only desirable appearance and that “diet culture” is a good thing. it can lead to unhealthy behaviors, such as orthorexia nervosa (an obsession with “clean” eating) or exercise addiction.
if you have a problem with using diet pills, get help for your disordered eating behaviors right away. professional treatment programs can target your underlying issues and help you find sustainable success in recovery. contact a treatment provider today to learn more about your options for inpatient or outpatient care.





non-invasive options for skin lifting

 10월 7, 202410월 7, 2024


over time, the skin becomes loose and saggy due to the loss of proteins called collagen and elastin. this makes the face look older and less toned, and it also leads to the formation of wrinkles and creases. tightening or lifting the skin improves these issues.선릉역피부과 many people choose to do this through a surgical procedure like a face lift, but there are also non-invasive alternatives that can be effective for many patients.



the first and most obvious treatment option for tightening the skin is to use a firming cream. however, it is important to know that these products will only have a minimal effect, and they do not work fast. in fact, it can take months for you to notice any real difference from using a skin-firming cream.
another option for skin tightening is to use ultrasound treatments. these devices work to stimulate collagen production in the deep layers of the skin. they also help to shrink tissues that have become loose and saggy with age. this is a more natural and non-invasive way to tighten the skin than having a facelift, but it can still take a few months for results to be seen.삼성역리프팅
ultrasound treatment is a popular choice because it can be done without needles or other incisions. it works by sending sound waves through the tissue to break up fat cells and to stimulate collagen. a handheld device with this technology is available for purchase online and at some beauty supply retailers, but it is important to have a trained professional perform the treatment. this is because the vibrations can cause damage to the tissue underneath.
lastly, there is a non-invasive treatment that involves the use of temporary sutures to create a subtle “lift” in the skin. this is a newer technique that offers an alternative to a facelift and is much less expensive. it is important to choose a skilled provider for this procedure, because it can be difficult to get the best results.

a facelift can be a powerful and permanent solution to loose and sagging facial skin. however, it is important to note that this surgery has its own risks, including bleeding, infection, and a reaction to the anesthesia. in addition, there is a risk of interrupting the blood flow to the face, which can result in loss of tissue. in rare cases, a facelift can also lead to scarring. this is why it is important to use proper wound care and to follow the recommended post-treatment regimen. in order to reduce the risk of complications, it is usually best to have a facelift performed under sedation.





avoid dentist overreaching

a visit to the dentist can be an anxiety-provoking experience. there’s a powerful imbalance of power between practitioner and patient: the masked figure hovers over you, wielding sharp metal instruments and pointing at spectral smudges on the x-rays. and the language of dentistry can be confusing — a cavity here, a root canal there. it can be hard to know what’s being recommended or whether it’s necessary.

fortunately, most dental treatments are not nearly as risky or expensive as surgery and other medical procedures. and the number of procedures available has expanded dramatically as research and technology have advanced. 강남교정치과 the goal of treatment should be to keep your mouth healthy and free of pain, infection and disease, says the american dental association (ada). but even if your dentist’s goals match your own, it’s easy to get misguided or excessive treatment. and that can cost you money — and stress.
it’s not unusual to hear stories about patients who have been harmed by care that went overboard or was unnecessary. the medical profession has long grappled with the tendency to overtreat, but the dentistry field has been slower to respond.주걱턱교정 there are fewer guidelines about how to treat dental problems than there are about medical treatments. but that doesn’t mean you can’t do your homework and ask questions to make sure you’re getting the best care possible.



in some cases, dentists go overboard because they’re under pressure to maximize profits or to perform a certain type of procedure. this is especially true in private practices, where dentists are often paid a commission on each treatment they provide. but even in a family-owned practice, this can still happen. the ada says that many dentists are “overly aggressive” in selling treatment because of these pressures, and that consumers can benefit from seeking a second opinion.
another issue is that not all dental treatments are well established in clinical trials, which are the gold standard for evaluating medical procedures. a number of reputable groups exist to study the evidence behind medicine, but dentistry has a much more limited body of information. and there are other influences that can affect a dentist’s treatment plan.
there are also a variety of factors that can influence the amount of dental work you need, such as your age and the shape of your bite. some treatments, such as crowns — which replace the entire top of a damaged tooth — require substantial recovery time. and others, such as root canals, can be very painful and costly.
if you’re in need of extensive dental treatment, consider taking advantage of the ada’s find a dentist tool and searching for a dentist who offers payment options that suit your financial situation. or check out community health clinics, which specialize in providing low-cost care for people who can’t afford to pay full price for a procedure. you may find that a little help from a friend or relative can ease the financial burden of a major dental procedure.
