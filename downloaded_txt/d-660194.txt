getting started
tgcs membership, admissions, iq testing services, and giftedness identification
tgcs membership.  children ages four and older who wish to participate in tgcs programs and experiences must meet tgcs admissions eligibility requirements to become a member of tgcs. tgcs offers rolling admissions throughout the year, so participation may begin immediately upon admittance to tgcs.  note: tgcs membership is not required for three year olds.
tgcs admissions.  tgcs admissions process begins with a tgcs-approved clinical cognitive assessment/iq test for giftedness identification, administered by a professional psychologist.
tgcs iq testing services.  tgcs provides clinical assessment / iq testing services for children ages 4-16, for a fee. tgcs professional psychologists have extensive experience administering assessments to many young children throughout the year. testing appointments are available weekly, upon request.

tgcs giftedness identification. tgcs utilizes âgold standardâ clinical assessments for tgcs admissions, for identification of giftedness and overall cognitive ability. tgcs measures giftedness on the basis of full-scale intelligence quotient (fsiq) and related comprehensive indices of cognitive ability, not by academic proficiency or achievement. high achievement scores are not always associated with high intellectual ability.
a gifted child may or may not be academically proficient in all subject areas due to his or her developmental differences in reasoning, sensitivity, and intensity. gifted children can be misidentified or remain unidentified in light of these differences, and other factors. following clinical cognitive testing, parents may or may not be surprised to discover their child is identified as a gifted child, regardless of his or her academic achievement levels.
peace of mind.  independent, individualized, and clinical assessments at tgcs administered by our experienced psychologists provide peace of mind for parents looking for conclusive understanding of their childâs cognitive ability.
