 german christmas markets 2019









german christmas markets


welcome to the original christmas markets 

























 


 


 


 


 


the magic of traditional german christmas markets is casting more visitors under its spell every year.
historic christmas markets, held in cities, towns and villages throughout the country, are becoming increasingly more popular, due, no doubt, to the enchanting festive season atmosphere they evoke.
the christmas fairs and christmas markets of germany are unique. if you're tired of commercialism taking over this holiday period and would like to get right away for a real traditional and romantic christmas market you might want to consider heading to germany where christmas gifts are not mass-produced but craftwork of real quality.here you can buy all kinds of christmas merchandise and gifts, especially traditional things such as crib figurines, toys, wood carvings, marionettes, candles and lambskin shoes to place underneath your traditional   christmas tree. many are difficult to resist - as will be the glass of delicious mulled wine you are offered and the baked apples that are very welcome on crisp winter days.
the ambience of a typical german christmas market is further enhanced by the aromas of  hot chestnuts, grilled sausages and other tasty snacks. youngsters especially will be attracted to the gingerbread biscuits known as lebkuchen, marzipan figures and other sweets.
with so many christmas markets through out germany the most difficult choice is which christmas market to visit. the best solution is to sample at least two christmas markets, preferably in a city for some serious shopping and a small town or village if you are looking for something a little bit more romantic.
most christmas markets start in the last week of november and run through to christmas eve or a day or two before. they are usually open every day from 10am to about 8 or 9 pm. 
in 2019 most christmas markets are expected to start one day earlier in comparison to 2018, this is due to the season of advent begining on a different date each year. in 2019 the first sunday of advent will be on the 1st of december 2019.
please note that the fith sunday before christmas is "totensonntag" a remembrance day in germany (24.11.2019). for many german cities (mainly catholic areas) this day is a public holiday with many attractions closing. some early starting christmas markets may also be affected. as this decision is usually made at short notice, we advise you to contact the local tourist office to check if the christma markets you intend to visit will be closed on that day.
