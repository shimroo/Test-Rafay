20th annual cowgirl up!
march 28, 2025  –  may 25, 2025
in 2005, desert caballeros western museum embraced a revolutionary idea: an annual exhibition showcasing the brightest contemporary female artists working in the western genre. in the male-dominated world of western art, cowgirl up! turned the spotlight squarely on women’s voices and perspectives, serving up a new, deeper understanding of the american west. over a decade later, cu! remains one of the major national events for western women artists.
