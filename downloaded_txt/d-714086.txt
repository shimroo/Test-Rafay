	uranian society: a commentary on the contemporary
	
  


this blog is sometimes fun, sometimes serious. it is a commentary from the perspective of an openly masculine gay man on u.s. culture, religion, and politics. difference of opinion is welcome and encouraged - enjoy! 

for those curious about the blog title...
(from the oxford-english dictionary: uranian-literaray/poetic 19th cent.: a homosexual, also a reference to aphrodite in plato's symposium)

my sources in port huron/fort gratiot, michigan have noticed unusual behavior at the home of my nemesis and his wife. even after two years, if anything should happen to me, authorities should look first to these people:richard and judy davis4707 desmond beach  fort gratiot, mi 48059(810) 385-9274

	 convert or die...
	 
    


another manifestation of fundamentalist thinking, at some sort of rapture, god will come again (was there a first time?) and leave behind unsaved souls. those left behind will wage wars, those who don't convert are against god and deserve to die. let's hope those right wing nuts, who have already helped to lead us to war in iraq, don't lead us into some sort of religous conflit where, as in this video game, it's convert or die.

	 not ashamed
	 
    


i am so glad that i have a life partner that would not be ashamed to admit anything i have done to a group of people, especially a church. my partner would never neglect to read an entire letter out of shame and embarassment at the annual meeting; would not try to cover-up, hide, or decieve about the truth. thanks judy (fucking lying bitch), your embarassment and shame, and attempt to cover things up while your spouse hides behind you said more than words. perhaps that act was the best christmas present of all this year...want to prove me wrong? get up and read the entire letter to the church yourself along with the threat, be honest. otherwise, every day that passes, you prove this post is true.

at first it was that he did not know his accuser. then he bought drugs from him, but didn't use them...then he used drugs but nothing else...now he's admitting to sexual activity of a homosexual nature and drug use.so often with evangelicals self hatered, loathing, and shame over the way god made us leads to unhealthy and decietful behaviour. denying who he is, buying onto the idea that god considers him immoral, had lead to a destroyed family, drug use, anonymous sex, infidelity, adultery, public shame, hurt in the family and among the church. what might have happened if haggard realized that there's nothing wrong with homosexuality, had embraced the care of the way the creator made him?if you preach against homosexuality, help to legislate discrimination against your own people, help those struggling with their sexual identity to think they are somehow damaged and unacceptable to god, and by doing so send them into the same closet that destryed your church and some of the people in it, your family and yourself, (perhaps) he deserves this. haggard is not a victim, he's a victimizer. he's the assailant, the bully, preaching against and making the lives of those who are as he, unequal. he's been brought down. how many more are out there? how much more must this continue among evangelicals? when will human rights advance past this, so that this would be unthinkable?
