about the nvrha 



the northern virginia relic hunters association (nvrha) convened its first meeting in february 1972 at centreville, virginia. thirty-two people attended the meeting and became charter members of what would become the longest running organized relic hunting club in america. the nvrha was organized to promote the study and preservation of the american civil war through the location, identification, and preservation of military and related historical artifacts.at its monthly meetings, the nvrha has speakers with presentations on all aspects of the american civil war. numerous members have published books on american history and the identification of civil war artifacts. these texts are widely used for reference by students, professors, historians, archaeologists, and relic hunters. our club has donated volunteer hours and resources to various museums, battlefield preservation associations, and the archaeological community. in addition, we make financial contributions yearly to support other worthwhile community services and local charities.each spring the nvrha hosts our annual american civil war show. advertised nationally, the show offers military effects, relics, memorabilia, books, paper goods, art, and antique weapons. these items are displayed by the country’s most distinguished civil war and world war i & ii dealers and museums, as well as private collectors.
