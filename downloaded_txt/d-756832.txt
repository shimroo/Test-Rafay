mentor and educator
mr. apfel has more than four decades of experience handling complex medical malpractice and personal injury matters. among other things, mr. apfel's outstanding record of success can be attributed to his unmatched understanding of the medical principles and science involved in the cases he handles. beginning in 1991, when the birth trauma litigation group was established, mr. apfel has written extensively to expose junk science and litigation-driven literature, and has taught both experienced and inexperienced lawyers how to evaluate medical issues and determine when a bad outcome could have been prevented.

over the course of his career, mr. apfel has trained and mentored many lawyers and paralegals who have developed great expertise and skills in handling complex medical malpractice cases. for example, seth cardeli, a partner at levin & perconti, and a lawyer who has worked with mr. apfel for the past 9 years, has received multiple national honors and is currently recognized by his peers as one of the top birth trauma lawyers in the united states. kim martel, a paralegal at levin & perconti, who has worked with mr. apfel for the past 12 years, received national recognition for her outstanding work, when she was selected as the 2020 paralegal of the year by the american association of justice, a national organization of trial lawyers.

mr. apfel is the author of a landmark law review article, "using a differential diagnosis to prove that intrapartum asphyxia is a significant cause of cerebral palsy," that helped set the standard in how causation issues in cases involving cerebral palsy are litigated by lawyers representing brain damaged children in the u.s. he currently chairs an annual 2-day program to teach lawyers the fundamentals of electronic fetal monitoring and the criteria that can be used to identify babies who may not be getting enough oxygen and are at risk of developing brain injury during labor and delivery.
