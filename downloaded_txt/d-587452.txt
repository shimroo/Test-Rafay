this place deserves 10 stars, hell 100. i proposed to my girlfriend on this tour and the company went above and beyond for us. i can’t express how grateful i am for y’all for being so accommodating to our 8 person tour; picking a certain group of dogs for the moment, allowing us to go to a scenic spot for the proposal, and just being so in the moment with us. i will be forever grateful for yall. take away the “accommodating the proposal” aspect and this was still an amazing experience. we love dogs and these dogs love sledding. it was so much fun seeing them in their element and driving the sled. it was absolutely beautiful.

darby! you are the bomb! we love you and thank you for being such an amazing tour guide.

if you book this place, you won’t be disappointed. and look for mayhem, cause she’s the prettiest little goofball around.

thank yall!
