saying goodbye

it is with a heavy heart that we notify you that new home professionals will be closing for business on dec 26, 2021. after that time, we will no longer be providing temporary staffing. after 24 years of business and many market ups and downs the ripple effects of the pandemic are proving to last longer than we anticipated. i am immensely proud of our staff and the work that we have done over the years. their dedication to providing excellent service made new home professionals the go-to staffing supplier throughout northern california and paved the pathway for hundreds of agents to get their start in new home sales.in an effort to maintain staffing options for our clients, we have entered into a referral agreement with smart staffing solutions. to place an order contact: norcalorders@s3staffing.comfor agents seeking a position in new home sales please reach out to carol shaw the vp of sales with smart staffing solutions (949)637-5980. we would like to express our sincere appreciation for your support over the years. the relationships we developed are invaluable.sincerely, jackie shipley
