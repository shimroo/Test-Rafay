and now for something completely different...



here it is.the moment you've all been waiting for...my first recap of the tv season. survivor.(this may get lost when i switch over to my new blog...but i have no idea when that will be...so i may as well get it up over here...and bring on the snark)~~ flicka (the rollergirl) is the new courtney (the fire dancer), only more annoying and dumb. the chickens? i seriously would have beaten the crap out of her. and was she the one who said, "go whiteys?"~~ i totally thought cao boi was introducing himself as "cowboy" as some sort of nickname - anyone else? no? just me? "you have some bad wind" snerk. ~~ he. ozzy in the tree like mowgli in the jungle book. hilarious!~~ did you see nate's face light up when jeff gave them flint. who needs seiku and his hypothetical fire, anyway...~~ chicken man=judd lite~~ and the "cuddle puddle"? if it was that cold, why were their shirts off?~~ and what did he say...karma is a bizzle? abysmal? anyone catch that?

i sat on top of jude law



oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god.seriously. the one freakin' time i forget my camera. seriously. i take that thing everywhere. everywhere. but, yesterday i totally forgot that i was going straight downtown after work to the film festival. and i forgot my camera. so i have no pictures.no pictures of the line outside roy thompson hallno pictures of the losers walking around with tvs strapped to their backs so people in line could watch flim festival footage.no pictures of the 7 girls from manchester who we stood in line with and sat with (and were just as jude-obsessed as i am)no pictures of the red carpet.or of anthony minghellaor robin wright pennor juliette binocheor jude law.mmmmm...jude law.he's gorgeous in person, folks. gorgeous.and during the movie screening, breaking and entering, which was great, by the way, i highly recommend, we were sitting right above the cast. i spied on jude as he whispered to his castmates. and wondered who the girl sitting next to him was. it was not sienna miller. or his nanny friend. he was there alone. in a gorgeous dark blue suit and brown pointy shoes. hot.and after the movie screening, the husband waited for me as i was the last person out of the building. well, i and the manchester girls, were the last ones out. we found a prime spot where we could see sir jude shmoozing it up with the vips. ah...to be a vip.

13 of the most unnecessary baby products



thirteen  of the most unnecessary baby products at least for me. i'm sure this will be different for everyone.1. peg perego high chair. we got the white leatherette. big mistake. big. the tray was too high for my little ones to feed themselves because they couldn't reach the food. the tray was also way too far away from their bodies that they would drop all the food into their laps. also, it was impossible to clean. i bought an easy clean fisher price and i love it. pegs are eye candy. totally not worth it.2. diaper geniewe have never used this. mostly because we rarely change our babies in their bedrooms, and just throw the diapers straight into the garage. why do i want them sitting around in my house when i can just get rid of them right away?3. change tablemy kids were way too squirmy. and it's a huge pain to always have to go upstairs to change diapers. a pad on the floor is perfect for me, thanks.4. peg perego double strollerwe got the tender xl. 4 years ago, before the mountain buggy and valco side-by-sides existed. it's huge and bulky and it's really hard to steer. and i always end up using my cheap grace side-by-side. 5. swingwe got a graco swing as a baby gift - we asked for it - and we never used it. wait, that's not true. we used it about 4 times. it's not that it wasn't great...it's just between the bouncy chair and the gymini, it totally wasn't necessary.6. wipe warmerum, yes, tell me again why this is necessary. are wipes really that cold?7. bath ringthis was the very reason i hated bath time. my kids never quite fit right into this contraption and i never had the right angle to wash them properly. 8. cheap strollerthe evenflo comfort dimensions plus. what a waste of money. it fell apart. and the seat never sat up straight. pain in the ass, if you ask me. i bought myself a peg pliko and a zooper boogie to replace it and have never looked back.9. bottle warmerum, yeah, the best thing you can do is teach your babies to enjoy their formula/milk lukewarm to cool. i promise. it will save you the hassle of having to continue heating their milk forever. 10. shoeswith the invention of robeez, baby shoes are completely unnecessary. 11. snowsuiti have a bunting insert for my infant seat. amazing. snowsuits, be gone. no more bulk, and trying to fit the straps of the carseat over the giant snowsuit. no overheating. 12. what to expect in the first yearthe only thing worse than this book is ""hat to expect when you are expecting". these are two books that are gathering dust in the closet in my basement.13. baby powderseriously, have you ever used it? i still have the same bottle of johnson's that i bought when emily was born. links to other thursday thirteens!1. raggedy2. sadie3. jenny ryan4. tug5. lindsey6. froggie mama7. the shrone8. tiffany9. audrey10. kimmy11. something blue12. buttercup 13. julie14. jennifer15. vicky(leave your link in comments, iâ€™ll add you here!)

while my pretty one sleeps...



my other pretty one...watches rockstar??i wish you could see the clock in the shot also - it was 12:30-something. (we missed the first showing because of meet-the-teacher night at the kids' school, so we had to watch with time-shifting. needless to say, i'm zonked.)she had spilled her water in her crib and was laying in it, soaking wet and freezing. so, we let her come out and play in bed for a little bit. she was in heaven.

hello? anyone out there??



have i scared y'all away with my blahs?it's funny that you write certain posts and assume that no one will comment on them. like that day that you were blocked, gave up and wrote an entire post about socks, and you get the most comments you've ever gotten.then there are the posts that you assume will generate the most comments...like the one i wrote yesterday, where i talked about being bummed, about being in the same theater as jude law (#1 on my list), and about a sack that you can hang your child from while you do your business in a public bathroom. and you get nothing. nothing. i'm not fishing here. it's just interesting. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~anyone hear the latest in federletus news? it seems that it's another boy for the federlines, at least according to the national enquirer now, i have no idea if there's any truth to this rumor, but i thought she was having a little jailynn? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~anyone watching rockstar supernova?i'm a little bit on the obsessed side - since i'm watching the monday night, tuesday night, and wednesday night shows each week...at first i was all about dilana. she was a creepy and scary and mysterious chick. now she's just an emotional wreck that destroys songs. they already had one of those on that show...ahem...can we say zayra...and we all know what happened to her...i'm hoping that my man toby will take this thing home. i love him. he's all accent-y and evs-y. and i can't get that freakin' oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh song out of my head. and that ass? mmmm. and that's got to count for something. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~anyone thinking that prison break is not nearly as good as it was last year???

a bad case of the blahs



i don't know what it is. just can't really shake it this morning.i'm usually not one to admit when i'm feeling down. i'm usually all smiles and all about the "everything's fine." by nature, i'm incredibly independent (which, most likely is the result of growing up in not one, but two emotionally unattached workaholic families. i didn't really have a choice. either you are independent, or you don't survive) and don't like to rely on others, for anything really. i like for everyone to think that everything 100% fine, 100% of the time. sure, i'm fabulous, but sometimes i just feel shitty. i guess there's just a lot going on. i'm having some clothes fitting issues (in that they just aren't fitting. at all), i'm having some friends issues (yes, once again), i'm having some web design issues, and i don't even have a freakin' kitchen sinkthe good news of the day, though, is that on wednesday night, i've got tickets to see my jude in the movie breaking and entering at the film festival. andhes.going.to.be.there.the husband better pray that he doesn't want to take me home. he is on my list, after all.edit:my blahs are completely gone.it's amazing what a little good news will do for you!ro, my designer over at ciao my bella, is working so hard on my design today, even though september 11th is a day that hits really close to home for her, and i'm so appreciative. so...be on the lookout for my new site (yes, people, we are getting rid of blogger for good! wahoo!) - it's not done yet, so don't go peeking around just yet...and for those of you who are worried, my good pal haley has an automatic redirect for me, which will be handy for you until you change all your blogrolls over from i write, therefore i blog to my new site, cheaper than therapy. (ah, don't you just love that name???)okay...also...thisjust might be the most hilarious thing i have ever seen in my life.

addict and other ditties



we have a new obsession in our household.are we had our first sentence on tuesday.(no, i'm not kidding)isabella is beyond obsessed with this birthday dora doll. she walks around holding her saying, "da-ra. da-ra!" it's actually beyond adorable.we were sitting in the car and the dora doll had fallen to the ground. isabella shrieked and then said, clear as day, "i want my dora!" (i guess it wasn't clear as day...it sounded more like, "iwama da-ra" but, you get the idea.) and then she said it again.until i turned around and picked it up for her.sucker.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~on another note, please please please come and visit me at my new blog at urbanmoms.caand leave a comment. let me know you were there.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~yes, i realize that i'm the last person on the internet to talk about suri. i've seen all sorts of photos of her flying around the internet from her debut in vanity fair and on katie couric's show. i've also seen the hilarious photo that you won't see in vanity fair, where miss suri cruise looks like the poster girl for the new omen movie. poke fun all you want. (she's chris klein's! she looks like l. ron hubbard! i think i see pacey a little bit around the eyes! it's a wig!) lordy knows, i've been doing a lot of that! but, folks, this is one cute baby:
