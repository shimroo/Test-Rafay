lebanese taverna was born between two great cities: beirut, lebanon and arlington, virginia. the restaurant was founded in arlington’s westover neighborhood in 1979 by tanios and marie abi-najm, who had escaped civil war in beirut just three years earlier. lebanese taverna introduced classic lebanese family cooking to the d.c. area and over the next four decades became a beloved local institution. today, lebanese taverna is run by the five abi-najm siblings and has a dozen locations in washington, d.c., its suburbs, and baltimore, including six full-service restaurants, seven fast-casual eateries and their flagship lebanese market. lebanese taverna classic eastern mediterranean cooking in a contemporary settinglebtav cozy lebanese comforts with fast-casual servicethe market the flavors of a lebanese souk to arlington, va
