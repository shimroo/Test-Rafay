fresh milk in glass bottles
our milk delivery is done mostly overnight, and fresh from our cows. we know that our milk comes from cows that receive the best care and quality feed, with no supplemental rbst growth hormones. we bottle the milk at our own local dairy to control the quality of the entire process, and deliver the best in nutrition to you.

the fresher the milk, the better the taste, and that means families love our milk. our customers say that milk in glass bottles tastes like old-fashioned milk. and, because we pick up the empty bottles, right from your doorstep, and recycle them for new deliveries, youâll never have to throw away empty containers again.








itâs simple. we are committed to your satisfaction, so our milk is unconditionally guaranteed, until you drink it! we deliver to many of the cities along the front range from loveland to castle pines and golden to commerce city.

 review 
 what customers say







dear longmont dairy, our son in denver sent this to us one morning when a dinosaur appeared for breakfast. your hardwork touches lives more than youâll ever know.  thanks for what you do. best regards,
										linda s.








dear longmont dairy, thank you for continuing to serve such an important role in ensuring our family has delicious milk every week. we are thankful for you.








our family is so grateful to longmont dairy during this time. we really look forward to the weekly deliveries every friday. i never realized how much dairy--especially cheese, butter, and sour cream that our family could go through every week. i am currently on chemotherapy for stage one breast cancer so we avoid going to the store as much as possible, and when we do an order for grocery pick-up, we never know what will actually be in the bags! we always enjoy the milk and other products from longmont dairy, but i just wanted to tell you how important your services are to our family right now! wishing everyone well there at the dairy!








their cold brew has completely changed my mornings and i definitely can't see myself going back to store-bought milk ever again! -tiffany r.








our milkman has been delivering to us for years. he is terrific. he always does such a good job of caring for our milk order. the milk itself is delicious. i love that they have expanded their menu for deliveries. i have saved myself many grocery store shops because i can just order from longmont dairy. thank you all for your hard work!!! -n. williams








our favorite things by far are the chocolate milk and root beer milk! and they have a ton of other products outside of just milk that are top-notch as well. very convenient, great service all around, good price point, local, and noticeably fresher than the store's milk. -savannah g.








we've been customers since 2017. the dairy has a great variety of products including milk of course, locally made bread, cookie dough, and ready-to-make meals. their app is easy to use. our orders are always correct and delivered on time. we love to support a local, all-natural, family-owned dairy. â corinna s.








ice cold fresh milk at your doorstep, and so many more great products.  great service, from the sales staff to the delivery staff. love it! -julie b.








the results are in, and my wife and all three kids will only drink this milk. if youâre comparing side by side, the milk is substantially better and you can taste the freshness. my kids look forward to every monday simply to get their hands on that chocolate milk. itâs gone the same day we get it! -crystal g.








longmont dairy is the best! best product, best service, and the best customer service. i canât say this enough. thanks for all that you do.
