off shore fishing on ‘the natural’: fishing out of deale md & ocean city md (301) 704-7231
the natural is a 47′ daytona sport-fisherman with a legendary comfortable ride and large cockpit. the natural is a deale md and ocean city charter boat fishing the chesapeake bay and the atlantic ocean.  the boat is equipped with hdmi tv, sirius/xm satellite radio, microwave, grill, and 2 a/c systems to make for a comfortable day or overnight on the water. the natural maintains state-of-the-art electronics, live-well, tournament level tackle, and all necessary safety equipment. we fish a maximum of 6 passengers or anglers.
charter boat fishing trips: 
spring 2025 is near. our offshore ocean city charter trips are 12 hrs + and also leave at 5:30 am.  off shore charters begin in june out of sunset marina in ocean city md.
fish cleaning:  our offshore fishing trips produce large fish and the marina provides an exceptional fish cleaning service for a nominal cost.
mates tips: just like dining out it customary to tip the mate 15% of the charter fee.  our mates are exceptional and spend many hours before and after your trip ensuring your charter is productive and enjoyable.  they are not paid by the captain or owner of the boat, their tip is their salary.
cruises & special charters:
we provide cruises and use of the natural for a variety of additional services beyond fishing.  we can support sunset cruises, lighthouse tours, special events like watching the blue angels practice, sailboat races, or just a cruise out on the water with friends.  please call for rates.  we have also taken funeral parties for the spreading of ashes.
makeup charters:
we actively support makeup charters while in ocean city md.  the current cost of makeup is a flat fee of $400 per man with a 6 person minimum.  we don’t support makeups for chesapeake bay fishing.  if you would like to be added to our ocean city off-shore makeup list please drop us an email: captdick@naturalcharters.com
