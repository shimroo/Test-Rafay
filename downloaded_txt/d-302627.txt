take the quiz nowupcoming events there are no upcoming events at this time. view all eventswhat makes integrated wealth systems so different?there’s no shortage of money gurus and how to get rich programs out there. but here’s what sets integrated wealth systems apart from everyone else:1. make more money: while most financial “experts” tell you to live below your means, we show you how to invest money and build wealth so you can expand your means. the problem with other financial education programs is they tell you to do the right thing at the wrong time. for example, pay off all your debt before you start building wealth. this type of restrictive money management makes you think and live small! we show you a better way. the way of the wealthy. we show you how to increase your income so it surpasses and eliminates your debt. expand your means. expand your mindset. live full. don’t settle!2. keep more money: most business owners, as forbes found, even if they are incorporated still pay entirely too much money in taxes each year. typically this is because they don’t have a solid tax and entity strategy and while also blindly following their cpa’s not-so-great advice. many people shy away from this conversation out of an unfounded fear that they’ll be engaging in some sort of tax evasion which will cause them to get fined or go to jail. however, we’re talking about using every single legal option to lower your tax bill.yes, it’s about doing it “by the book” but it’s also about knowing what the book (80,000-page tax code) says is rightfully yours.3. higher returns on investments: every wealthy person knows alternative investments are one of the fastest ways to build wealth. it’s 180º opposite of the “park-n-pray” strategy most use. we show you how to find deals that generate 10, 20 and 30 percent returns — and how to do your due diligence so you can feel confident investing in these type of deals. loral and other big table members actively invest in alternative investments such as real estate, cannabis, gas & oil, storage units, cryptocurrency and more. they openly share their investment strategies and results with the community so these deals serve as real life case studies everyone learns from!4. do it with a team: how many times have you gotten conflicting financial advice from professionals? your adviser tells you one thing, your cpa another. then you wonder, does my financial adviser know what my lawyer is doing? does my insurance broker need to be updated by my cpa? when these relationships are not in harmony it slows down, and often interrupts, your wealth building process.this is why we take a team approach to wealth management. you get “access” to a team of vetted financial professionals who are all on the same page regarding your wealth. for example, our cpa will do a free audit of your last 3 years of taxes to show you where the “leaks” are in your wealth bucket. if you discover you need to setup a new entity you’ll talk to our entity expert. want to learn how to invest the thousands of dollars you just saved in taxes into off wall street assets?
