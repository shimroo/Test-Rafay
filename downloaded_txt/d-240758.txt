classic british sports cars    -  upgraded for today's enthusiasts


			classic british sports cars are as fun to modify and personalize as they are to drive, 
			and they're much more fun to drive after they've been modified.
			
			now in our 25th year, britishv8 magazine is the world's biggest and best resource 
			for enthusiasts of modified and v8-powered british sports cars. we feature detailed 
			how-to articles on all sorts of performance mods, giving special attention to 
			engine swaps. our online magazine, huge article archive,
			photo gallery (with over 10,000 photos!), and message board are all free for
			enthusiasts to enjoy here on our website.
			
			got a hot-rodded british sports car? we invite you to share your photos and an 
			article, and to to join us at our annual meet. we're pleased to welcome new 
			friends to one of the fastest growing and most fun branches of the old car hobby!
