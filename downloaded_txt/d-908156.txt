an open heart





          by ryan











last night at a family christmas party i met some new people some very cool others i'm not sure about. let me explain this one lady came up to riley and i and said i was hoping you would both be here your aunt said if i had any questions you would be the ones to talk to. of course i was wondering about what so i ask her talk to us about what? 



she went on to tell us she had a son who was 10 years old and told her and her husband that he was gay that he liked boys. she said her husband is really upset over this and can't believe that at 10 years old he would know what he liked and if he was gay if he could handle having a gay son. 



well part of what she was saying floored me and when someone else at the party jump in the conversation and agreed with her husband saying at 10 the boy didn't know what he wanted and was just confused pissed me off. so i told her first off know matter what love him for who he is or who he chooses to love.



then i told her that her husband and this guy are both wrong that he could already know what he likes cause i knew when i was in kindergarten. the thing is talk to him about it let him know you support him and will always be there for him even if his dad won't be. talk to your husband maybe he will come around too. 



i also went on and told her she may also needs to read up on gay sex so when it's time she can talk to him about it. i told her gay people are different and start having sex at different times me personally i was really young when i had sex (most of you know i posted about it before) not saying he will but she needs to know so she can be ready to talk to him about it.



just makes me mad that people think it's a phase he's going through that he don't know what he likes already makes me mad that his dad may turn his back on the boy just cause he's gay. riley also told her he started young also he also told her if the boy needed someone to talk to we were available. just wish people weren't scared of what the don't understand just open there minds.

my thoughts on ferguson 





          by ryan











after my posts on facebook and twitter i said i would do a post on my thoughts and feelings on ferguson. i'm not asking people to see it like i do everyone has there own thoughts and that's fine this is mine. everyone is free to comment on this post i enjoy to see how you feel on this topic. 


my feeling is this i feel the grand jury got it right by not bringing criminal charges on this officer for doing his job. first of all i'm sick on the media calling michael brown an unarmed teenager they make him sound like a week little 13 year old kid. when he wasn't he was an 18 year old man that was over 6 foot tall and 300 pounds so calling him an unarmed teenager to make him sound like a victim is bullshit! 



next he robbed a store and acted like a thug to the owner of the store when the store owner confronted him. if he was this little unarmed teenager as the media keeps saying he should have had his ass at home instead of stealing cigars and fronted on a store owner. next when an officer of the law gave him a command follow it it would have stopped there but no he tried to thug his way through the officer and got shot. 



what pisses me off is this the people of ferguson is playing the race card to make it okay to loot, start fires and just raise hell this is what they wanted. not only the people of ferguson but in other cities who are protesting this. look at it this way change the story white kid black cop white kid stole something didn't follow the officer command then tried to steal the officer gun hit the officer and the officer shot him you think it would be in the news? hell no it wouldn't and if it was we would said that dumb ass white thug got what he deserves. 



so i'm sick and tired of the race card just cause people think something didn't go right. please i'm gay and i don't have the same rights as you but you don't see me pulling my rainbow card. i live the best i can and i follow the law i don't have money but i don't go out and steal shit. i don't want the cops bothering me so i keep my nose clean yep it's that easy. so you people out burning down your town for what cause your stupid that's why you was looking for a reason and this is as good as any. 



what's a shame is the people who own these business you burn down the people you but out of work cause you burnt there job down. how stupid us that? i feel sorry for these people and i hope they had insurance and i hope they don't rebuild in your community cause honestly you don't deserve to have them in your community. bet you didn't think about that when you was out ripping and burning down your town. 



so over the dumb shit!
