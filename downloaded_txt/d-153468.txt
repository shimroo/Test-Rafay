about us

welcome to the web site of south fork resort. we have redesigned the site to be more user friendly, easier to update and maintain, and hopefully overall an all around better experience. we have brought as much content from the old site over as possible. if something is missing please let us know. two new features of the new website are the south fork resort picture gallery and the south fork resort blog. be sure to check the picture gallery frequently for new pictures. the south fork resort blog will take the place of the fishing report page and will allow us to easily provide updates, whether it be fishing reports, lake reports, updates on the resort, or maybe just random thoughts. we look forward to hearing your feedback on the new website.
south fork resort, located on the southwest side of mark twain lake in northeast missouri, has been serving families and sportsmen alike since 1988. south fork resort offers five cabins, eight kitchenettes and four motel rooms, for a total of 17 rental units on 8 acres. all units are at ground level and most are facing our fishing pond. our cabins and kitchenettes are stocked with everything you should need to make your trip to south fork resort the best it can be. all units are now setup with a basic satellite tv package including local channels. we also offer guest wifi access.

our reviews







i have stayed here several times for a church conference that we have close to this location. i always have a wonderful experience here. the folks that own this place have always been very customer considerate. i would recommend this place to anyone for any type of stay. anyone that has a bad experience is because they where not trying to work with the staff here. they are a very fair priced place and i prefer this place over any of the hotels locally. the folks are family friendly!

– floyd foster
