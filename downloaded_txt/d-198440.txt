who we are:
alcoholics anonymous is a fellowship of people who share their experience,
strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and
help others to recover from alcoholism.
the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. there are no
dues or fees for aa membership; we are self-supporting through our own
contributions. aa is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or
 institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to
achieve sobriety.
