								philosophy							



							
							
							causal closure principles and emergentism 

													

							causal closure arguments against interactionist dualism are currently popular amongst physicalists. such an argument appeals to some principles of the causal closure of the physical, together with certain other premises, to conclude that at least some mental events are identical with physical events. however, it is crucial to the success of any such argument that the physical causal closure principle to which it appeals is neither too strong nor too weak by certain standards. in this paper, it is argued that various forms of naturalistic dualism, of an emergentist character, are consistent with the strongest physical causal closure principles that can plausibly be advocated

								philosophy							



							
							
							is there anything it is like to be a bat? 

													

							the concept of consciousness has been the source of much confusion over the past two decades. current orthodoxy in ‘consciousness studies’ has it that the key to understanding the concept of consciousness is to grasp the idea of qualia. but the appearance of mystery here is the product of conceptual confusion. there is nothing to ‘the qualitative character of experience’ beyond the individual character of a specific experience and how the subject felt in undergoing it, and here there are no mysteries beyond empirical ignorance and conceptual mystification.						

								by p. m. s. hacker							
















								philosophy							



							
							
							wrongdoing and forgiveness 

													

							joanna north explores the nature and value of forgiveness, arguing that it requires recognizing the wrongdoer's responsibility and involves a conscious effort by the one wronged to improve their relationship with the wrongdoer. she highlights that modern moral philosophers often overlook the moral significance of forgiveness outside a religious context and addresses the challenges in defining this complex moral response.						

								by joanna north							
















								think							



							
							
							behaviourism 

													

							behaviourists take the view that mental states are essentially behavioural: to be in pain, for example, is just to behave, or be disposed to behave, in certain ways (to writhe and go ‘ow!’, and so on). behavourism, if true, would neatly explain how mind and body are related.nowadays behaviourism, as a philosophy of mind, is philosophically out of fashion. but here, rowland stout explains why he still believes it may be true.
