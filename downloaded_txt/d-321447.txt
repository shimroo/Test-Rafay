aerial photography by marge beaver
























producing beautiful
			aerial photos has been my only focus 
			for more than 30 years.  i have had 
			custom aerial photography assignments in nearly every u.s. state, and 
			our aerial photographs have graced the
covers of over 40 books and magazines.
i no longer am able to do custom work, but i have stock 
			aerial photographs of every harbor on the 
			great lakes as well as most
			lighthouses. 
			i also have other points of interest all the way from the
			
			statue of liberty to the
			golden 
			gate bridge. check out my
			skyline photos of 
			detroit or my many
			chicago pages.
i currently have only one of my three coffee table style
			books still available.  
			it is "above west michigan" with aerial photos of all locations from 
			the ludington area south to the indiana border.



i am located in 
			norton shores, a suburb of muskegon, mi on the east shore of 
			lake michigan in the heart of the midwest. visit the index to my on-line 
			gallery.
my airplane, which i no longer own, was set up to provide
			vertical (map-like) 
			as well as oblique 
			(scenic) aerial views and was equipped with gps and moving map navigational 
			instruments.
for
			camera equipment 
			i used a canon 1ds mark iii with numerous lenses. with my in-house custom
			color lab, 
			every enlargement is printed with your total satisfaction and 
			delight my goal and i can provide enlargements of any of my photos 
			in any desired size.
