welcome to bay area fitness gym
we are the largest gym in the area with the most equipment in maine!






 high intensity
to enable your body to make a positive change, your exercise intensity must reach a certain threshold before your body will respond. by training to muscular failure, we tell our body that more muscle and improved metabolic are needed.


 brief workouts
our workout programs are designed to last 20-30 minutes or less. this is the minimum amount of exercise that will produce the stimulus for adaptation. anything in excess of this amount only acts to consume your body's precious recovery resources.


 infreq. workouts
reaching the required stimulus intensity threshold consumes a large amount of your body's resources, which is metabolically taxing on your body. replenishing resources and making metabolic gains takes time. reintroducing the stimulus (a workout) too soon will interrupt these processes.


 record keeping
bay area fitness trainers will teach you how keeping precise records of your workout performance will allow you to know if you are manipulating the variables of intensity, duration, and frequency appropriately. by doing this you will be able to see progress on every workout.
