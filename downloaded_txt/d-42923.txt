    how we can help
  














read mauricio’s new book on addressing toxicity















for the toxic people in your life (work, home) and those related toxic experiences, this book was written to skill you up, empower you to deal with these toxic situations, toxic moments in your life. enough being on the sidelines - go from bystander to upstander. no longer will you regret later - "oh i should have said something or done something." also a great gift - give this book (anonymously if you have to) to that bully, narcissist, difficult person in your life.as the author, i bring all of my experiences over my 30 year career as a management consultant, workplace investigator, executive coach, trainer and expert witness specializing in bias, prejudice and hate. all too often, i was hired to intervene where parties were not engaging each other and i was hired to come in and address the toxic conflict behavior pattern.learn how to stand up for yourself - especially when others are present and say nothing to support you.
