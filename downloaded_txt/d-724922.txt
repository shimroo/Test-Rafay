pirate party 2009





september 19th is national talk like a pirate day. for the last several years, we have had a pirate party. last year, we made handprint parrots.



materials needed:
washable paints in multiple colors
color printer
white cardstock
construction paper
glue sticks 
wet wipes

print out a parrot body onto white cardstock. i used a picture that had a tail and legs and just cut that part out to allow for the handprint.
paint the palm and each finger of the child's hand a different color using a sponge wedge and the washable paint.
press the child's painted hand at a downward angle onto the construction paper. the fingers should be facing down.
using the glue sticks, attach the parrot body to the top of the handprint. the handprint will form the feathers of the tail.

enjoy!

dino party 2009





as a member of a local moms club, it has been my pleasure to help plan kids parties. for the past 2 years, we have had a dinosaur party. we usually have a craft and the mommies love a handprint craft. here are the instructions for the handprint dino that we used.


materials needed:
contruction paper
washable paint (we used green)
black sharpie
wet wipes
small sponge wedges


using sponge, paint child's palm with green paint. press painted hand onto the construction paper. paint a green circle on the thumb print for the head and a tail extending from the pinkie side of the palm. paint legs on your dino. using the sharpie, draw teeth and an eye on the head. we named all of ours using the children's names with "asaurus" at the end. (i.e. lillyasuarus, benasaurus, finleyasaurus, etc.)

enjoy!
