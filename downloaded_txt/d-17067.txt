africa’s voice for wildlife

see our vision





africa’s voice for wildlife

see our vision








we are an africa-based global conservation organization protecting wildlife and their habitats as essential parts of a modern and prosperous africa. we articulate a unique vision of african-led conservation, focusing on solutions that create opportunity for people — not at the expense of wildlife and their habitats, but because of them.




 


our closest living relative
bonobos share 98.7 percent of our dna. it’s fitting, then, that their fate is intertwined with ours—only a people-centered conservation approach can sustain them.
