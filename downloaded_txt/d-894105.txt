  growing disciples by loving god and neighbor
  we are a community of growing disciples inspiring others to know jesus and deepen their personal relationship with him. transformed by the power of his word and eucharist, we are sent forth to glorify the lord by our lives. enthusiastic in our faith, together we worship, grow, serve, connect and give.   our purpose is: 

​to lead people to jesus christ and inspire his disciples by word and sacrament to be sent as his apostles to share our faith and transform society.
