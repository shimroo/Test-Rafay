	learn our impact
















largest number of brands all under one roof!



















































































"we had no idea what to expect from the pbc expo - similar to how we’re feeling about being first time parents! but were blown away by the huge range of products, information and lovely brand owners to talk to directly about their recommendations for all stages of pregnancy, birth and early childhood.we loved being able to touch and feel different products and see them up close without having to deal with any pushy salespeople or trying to guess from a picture on a website.the experience was awesome! so much fun and so easy to navigate! fingers crossed it’s an oracle to our parenting journey ahead too, haha!"kerry and johnny balbuziente
