lightweight and strong - good quality
i put one under each leg of my grand piano (each leg has an attached metal caster) and it rolls the piano easily and smoothly leaving no marks on the new oak floors. 
 
mikecustomer | purchased move-it tri-dolly|highly recommend - they stand behind their product
to say that i was pleasantly surprised ... and very impressed is an understatement.  shepherd stood behind the product and i could not be happier. 
 
richcustomer | purchased gate casterdefinitely met my expectations. built well. large wheels which are hard to find on a dolly. i bought three and may get more. 
 
milliecustomer | purchased plant dollyvery well made. the rubber is thick so that they go on tight and last a long time in commercial use. they are black rubber but do not leave scuff marks like a lot of black rubber items do.
