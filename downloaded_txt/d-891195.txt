“narco is a treat, crafty and delicious, like a vintage depalma thriller. ”

— umair aleem, screenwriter of netflix's action-thriller, 'kate'

 












































 














marcus wesphal suffers from severe narcolepsy. his condition is peculiar—if he gets overly excited or stressed, he passes out.however, he’s adapted well. he has all his groceries delivered; he’s got good friends, he's developed quite a following as an online sleuth, and he admires the girl of his dreams, jessica wright, through his front door peephole (he’s working up the courage to ask her out, ok?!). marcus has crafted the perfect bubble for himself. but when he watches jessica get murdered right before his eyes, helpless to do anything about it before passing out, that bubble bursts.marcus is now the prime suspect in jessica's murder. if he’s going to prove his innocence, he will have to leave the safety of his apartment and track down the real killer. or, could he possibly be the killer and not even know it?narco is a classic psychological suspense thriller inspired by films like alfred hitchcock’s rear window and vertigo, and christopher nolan’s memento, but told in a new way for a new audience.

no one seemed to notice sonny gibson as he stepped back into “the  hideaway,” a dusty little honky-tonk nestled off the carolina highway.  but before the night was over, sonny would be on the run—from the law,  from the criminals, even from himself. loose ends is a gritty,  slow-cooked, southern crime romance that follows a winding trail down  tobacco road, through the war-torn streets of baghdad, and into the  bright lights and bloody gutters of south florida. from jason latour,  co-creator of eisner-winning southern bastards and the writer of  spider-gwen, chris brunner (southern bastards, batman: legends of the  dark knight), and rico renzi (spider-gwen, squirrel girl).

mack from body bags





”bold films has set guardians of the galaxy’s dave bautista to star and john wick 2 scribe kyle ward to write dogtown, a film based on the long-running comic book series body bags. the comic was created by jason pearson (deadpool, x-men) and it is a stylized, irreverent action story. bautista will play mack delgado, a professional bounty hunter tough  enough to be called a “body bagger.” things take a turn for him when the  teenage daughter he never knew he had turns up on his doorstep, hoping  to reconnect with the father she lost long ago. the hope is to start  production this fall.hivemind’s jason brown and sean daniel will produce alongside bold films’ michel litvak, gary michael walters,  david litvak and jon oakes. bautista, rawson thurber and jonathan  meisner will be exec producers with bold films’ josh throne, svetlana  metkina, jason pearson, ford gilmore and keven gardner.
