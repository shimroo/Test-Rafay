creative engagement


staff, volunteers, families and friends – often struggle to meaningfully connect with the people they care for. timeslips can help.











what is timeslips? 
we pioneered an evidence-based method that invite people into meaningful engagement. it can enliven any conversation – remotely or in-person. originally designed for people with dementia, it has been applied across generations, cultures, and abilities.
