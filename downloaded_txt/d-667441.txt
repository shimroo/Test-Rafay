i had a great time; as my girlfriend did also. the sailing and the country beat my expectations. thanks for helping prepare the trip and answering questions. the sailing staff was knowledgeable and helpful. i'm considering purchasing a boat and having you guys rent it if you could forward some information in regard to that it would be great.

thanks for your interest in our trip. we really had a fantastic time and had no problems at all with the yacht. everyone told us we had come at the wrong time of year, but we really enjoyed having the most beautiful beaches and wonderful snorkelling all to ourselves. we found bob very professional and the office staff were very helpful too.

thank you for your follow-up. we had a truly sweet and memorable 4 days aboard the 43 mainship "magnolia". she was exceptionally well maintained, clean, comfortably appointed with all amenities and most roomy for just the two of us, my wife jeanette and i. feel free to publish our comments on your website. jim & jeanette thompson - ft lauderdale, fl

					the day on the boat was absolutely wonderful. thanks for your work. you did a great job. the whole group had a lot of fun with waterski, jetski and so on. we did not get bored at all. at the end, we were sorry that the time went by so fast and that we had to leave. thanks again for all your work.andrea petzold - atlanta ga

i was told by the team that they really enjoyed the experience. they all loved the yachts and the training. i was told that they decided not to race, but rather have a good time. they said that this was the best team building experience ever. thanks,

 thank you for following up. i have to say that your company in general and your key west crew in particular are a pleasure to do business with. you made a deal and kept it, delivered a clean and functioning boat to us on time. the boat was well found and served its purpose.
