about conahec







 
the consortium for north american higher education collaboration (conahec) is a membership-based international network of higher education institutions interested in actively collaborating with higher education institutions in the north american region.
active members of conahec are able to achieve internationalization goals that would not be possible as individual institutions in particular quickly finding partners for collaborative projects and gaining information about support from funding agencies. all students, faculty and staff at institutions that join conahec are considered members. conahec does work most closely with our designated primary contacts at member institutions, often working out of the institution’s international education/programs office.
we offer our members a variety of programs and activities that help them network with key contacts at other institutions, find partners for collaborative projects, exchange students, faculty and administrative staff, and engage in professional development activities. conahec also draws from a network of expert consultants on the internationalization of higher education institutions to provide advising on themes such as: international strategy development; development and management of international offices; successful practices in developing international collaboration programs; and strategic international partnership development. conahec regularly shares information about member international events and initiatives including short term/summer programs through its extensive global network of internationally engaged higher education contacts we’ve developed and maintained over decades. if you would like to join our free email distribution lists to receive periodic information about international education and collaboration opportunities, please complete the form in the footer.
