				and craft classes covering different levels.			
			



dancing

				dance classes are a great way for students to unwind from music classes, to get some exercise and to have a great time while 
				learning new dances.

				booths to purchase cds, books, instruments, and more from instructors and guest exhibitors, visit our dulcimer doctor, or

jamming

				jamming is always a highlight at kentucky music week. jams for all instruments and all levels are held at motels/hotels

				and kidâs camp coordinators. our kids camp instructor is a certified teacher with nelson county, ky schools.			
			



mardi gras theme day

				at the end of the week we'll have our mardi gras theme day and finale' party. we'll have a parade during the lunch break and 
				if you would like to "join the parade" meet in the media center and we'll put on costumes, pick up instruments, get in line
