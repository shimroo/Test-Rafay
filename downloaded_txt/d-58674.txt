          big news in the real estate world - and for re/max specifically!

the 2024 realtrends verified rankings are out, and re/max agents are shining bright. ✨ these rankings are a big deal because they highlight the top performing agents and teams across the us.

want to know the best part? nearly one out of every eight agents who made the cut are re/max agents! 🤯

here's why this matters:

1️⃣ to even qualify for these rankings, agents need to have huge sales numbers - way above the national average. think $16 million in sales volume or 40 transaction sides! (for teams, it's even higher!)

2️⃣ this shows that re/max agents are absolute rockstars when it comes to experience, market knowledge, and getting their clients amazing results.

3️⃣ if you're buying or selling a home, you want a re/max agent on your side!

a big congrats to all the re/max agents featured in this year's rankings. you make us proud! 👏
