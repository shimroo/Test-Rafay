why we love st. maarten




1
so beautiful

year round crystal blue waters, golden sunshine, cool caribbean breezes, white sand beaches and unparalleled views.



2
so friendly

known as “the friendly island,” france and the netherlands have shared this haven of sand, sea and sun for over 3 centuries. you can feel the harmony from one end of the island to the other…..inviting visitors back year after year.



3
so unique

half dutch/half french – let yourself enjoy the best of both cultures, including fabulous cuisine, casino gambling, nightlife, and duty-free shopping…all only minutes from cupecoy beach club, most within walking distance!



4
so much to see and do here!

swim, snorkel, scuba dive, go boating, fishing, golfing, beachcombing, horseback riding on the beach, or go to a beach where the airplanes come so close you can practically touch them!



5
or just relax!

read your favorite book, listen to the surf, or just sink your toes into the warm sand on one of st. maarten’s 38 beaches!
