our most popular design30 cowboysthis design was first created in 1990 and is our signature image and most popular cowboy silhouette. this was jdubs first long piece and since then, it has been featured in esquire magazine, pacific northwest magazine, the seattle times and other publications featuring our work. over the years, we have cut thousands of cowboys in all lengths and scales. they have been used in many ways such as on ranch signs, coat racks, weathervanes, on walls, open beams, and in large windows. it has been amazing to see the many ways our customers have used the work of art.
