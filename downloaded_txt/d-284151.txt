the center’s activities have been funded by external grants and contracts from a number of funding sources including the u.s. department of commerce, economic development administration; the ohio public works commission; and the ohio township association. the center’s primary efforts are directed towards student-centered research and assistance to small/non-metropolitan cities, villages, townships, and counties. center projects are initiated upon request from local governments or by center staff as an ongoing program for various local governments in the region and statewide. the center operates with the director, professional staff, and also draws upon miami university faculty, graduate students and undergraduate students in public administration, policy analysis, political science, environmental sciences, and geography.
miami university maintains a solid commitment to public service. the activities initiated by the center for public management and regional affairs stand as a centerpiece of miami university’s public service mission. numerous local governments (cities, villages, townships, and counties) and non-profit organizations across ohio have benefited from direct applied research projects. for example, the center conducted a citizen attitudes and public opinion survey for hanover township in butler county, and the center assisted with the development of the scioto foundation's university/college access network (ucan). in addition, the center for public management and regional affairs had been designated as a university center by the u.s. department of commerce, economic development administration.






the center signed and has maintained a cooperative agreement with the ohio township association since 1995. in conjunction with ota, the center produces the ohio township trustee sourcebook, the ohio township fiscal officer sourcebook, the ohio township personnel management sourcebook, and the ohio township zoning sourcebook. this four-volume set (township sourcebook series) has been designated by the ohio township association as the recommended resource publication for township officials in ohio.

cpmra projects




survey research, strategic planning, and records retention




conducting survey research is a valuable experience for miami's public administration students, as well as the community interested in seeking the level of citizen satisfaction, service delivery, and/or consumption patterns. students learn "real world" applications of their local government and research statistics coursework; while, local leaders can take a "snapshot" approach to community opinions. examples where students teams have developed the survey instrument, analyzed the findings, prepared a final report, and presented findings to local leaders include oxford township (butler county), the city of springboro (warren county), and the village of farmersville (montgomery county).
one response to change is strategic planning. a variety of programs have been developed and facilitated by the professional staff of the center. in the city of clayton (montgomery county), local leadership developed an issue agenda; in the village of union city (darke county), a citizen advisory group was concerned with quality-of-life issues; and in west milton (miami county), the community improvement corporation board members were interested in establishing goals and objectives.
the center can provide expertise and assistance in developing a comprehensive and compliant records retention program for your community.








personnel and other human resource management




an important function of local government is personnel management it is often the largest percentage of the operating budget. assistance has been provided to numerous communities in the form of policies and procedures, position descriptions, performance appraisal systems and compensation schedules; examples include fairfield township (butler county), spring valley township (greene county), and crosby township (hamilton county).other human resource management advice has been provided to agencies that require an external reviewer to perform job audits (warren county engineer's office) and work distribution analysis (benham's grove facility, city of centerville).








geographic information systems, planning and zoning, and computer and information management




geographic information systems are a tool to aid local government decision-making and many computer mapping applications are becoming more user friendly. center staff can help connect your community with the resources necessary to get started, managing data, producing output, and utilizing spatial representations.
communities faced with planning and zoning issues have received the following types of assistance: development of telecommunications ordinance for the city of harrison (hamilton county), review and update of zoning ordinances and comprehensive plans, training of board members, review of enforcement capacity, etc.
computer and information management demands are a critical issue facing local governments. with the increased used of data, information management is a challenge. the computerization of accounting functions, service delivery, utility billing, dispatching, planning, zoning, and land and site inventories for development opportunities are common concerns. center staff have also assisted with cemetery tracking and records management projects.








economic and community development and local government management and program evaluations




economic and community development efforts may be provided by the center for communities that do not have a full-time development professional or they can support existing personnel or programs. in the past, the center has received funding from the economic development administration of the u.s. department of commerce to provide project assistance to local governments who are facing either growth or decline.
local government management and program evaluations have been provided to numerous communities, departments, and agencies. examples include coordination of an executive search, charter reviews, job audits and distribution analysis, and forecasting of future financial demands and personnel needs. the storage and management of records is a legal requirement for all local governments.

the center is coordinating and participating in the delivery of the ota leadership academy (designed to provide elected township officials with continuing education). center staff lead several otala workshop sessions at every ota winter conference. cpmra is now working with the ota to develop and implement a leadership academy ii (designed to provide elected township officials with continuing education beyond the scope of the original otala). cpmra continues to produce the township trustee sourcebook, the township fiscal officer sourcebook, and the township personnel management sourcebook, which comprise a multi-volume series on township government and management. the township zoning sourcebook was published in 2009 as the fourth volume in the sourcebook series. the ohio township association has designated the four-volume township sourcebook series as the recommended resource publication for township officials in ohio.

research monograph: “does collaboration beget collaboration?: from cooperation to co-production in township government” this cpmra study was one of four research projects supported by a competitive grant from the ohio commission. faculty and student authors included philip russo, director, cpmra and professor of political science; andrew dudas, senior project manager, cpmra; patrick haney, professor of political science; mark morris, senior project manager, cpmra; and heath ingram, junior public administration major. bethany bowyer, senior public administration major, and deanna watts, political science graduate assistant, provided additional assistance.








scioto foundation (adams, pike, jackson, and scioto counties)

ohio public leader fellowships





the ohio public leader fellowship program provides students with a practical, co-curricular experience that enhances their understanding of the inner-workings of state and local government institutions.  students emerge prepared for success in the arena of public leadership while host organizations benefit from engaging with outstanding young talent.
the ohio public leaders accepted into this program receive paid fellowships ($1,000-$2,500) and are selectively assigned to state or local government institutions or to related public or non-profit agencies throughout ohio. the fellowships support special projects that are designed to meet the needs of partner agencies and the professional interests of ohio public leaders.
with the support of the opl advisory board, faculty, and professional mentors, our students typically complete their ohio public leader fellowship during the four-week winter term.  over 100 miami university students have been awarded ohio public leader fellowships.
the ohio public leader fellowship is an initiative of the center for public management and regional affairs housed within the department of political science.
