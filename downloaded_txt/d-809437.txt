six-print canadian philatelist option


october 2024

some very exciting news!

over the past year, gregg redner, rpsc president, has received repeated queries about whether it might be possible to return to six printed copies of the canadian philatelist, rather than the four print and two digital copies currently included with membership. up until now, the cost of doing so was prohibitive. however, thanks to mike walsh, who publishes the canadian philatelist, it is now possible to offer this option to those members who wish to take advantage of it. here are the particulars:

beginning in 2025, the rpsc will offer a third category of membership, in addition to the current digital-only and four print/two digital options. we will now offer those who would like six print copies that option. the additional cost will be $16-17 per year for the two extra printed copies ($24 in the u.s. and $32 internationally). it is important to note that slightly more than half of this additional cost is for postage. to select this option, please select the appropriate box on the registration and renewal forms, and the rpsc will take care of the rest.

to secure the extra printed copies available each year through this option, it will be necessary to renew your membership no later than december 31, 2024. watch your dues renewal notice (distributed about mid-november) for specific options.
