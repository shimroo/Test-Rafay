the mission of tmacc is to advance equitable, safe, and sustainable multimodal transportation solutions by serving as


a resource center for innovative mobility strategies,


a collaborator of the public, private, and non-profit sectors, and


a catalytic agent for advancing and implementing best practices.










  





tmacc was founded in 1992 as the chester valley tma and consisted of 14 founding members, some of whom are current members including chester county intermediate unit, great valley regional chamber of commerce, krapf’s coaches, inc., pennstate great valley, and saul, ewing, remick & saul.
in 1995, the chester valley tma board of directors changed our name to the transportation management association of chester county to better attract and retain members important to our mission.










today tmacc represents all of chester county and continues to advocate for sustainable transportation practices and connectivity. tmacc’s membership represents more than 20,000 commuters and includes a range companies including those with a focus on engineering, planning, law, consumer goods, finance, hospitality, education and more.

discover the first steps to improving the bicycle culture in chester county including tmacc’s plan…tmaccjuly 19, 2024














  






more than a newsletter, is a quarterly publication that is digestible, sharable and, best of all, informative.
because tmacc has our finger on the pulse of so many different change agents, organizations, departments, roads, trails, and systems—the entire commuting infrastructure really—we thought it would be really helpful to capture the state of it all in a magazine.
there are big initiatives we’ve pared down into understandable stories and smaller updates that may not have received the promotion they deserved… most of all, chesgo! is information for you, the commuter on the move!





  



explore the current issue


















  






— from the latest issue






bicycling is an efficient, healthy, and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. however, many people hesitate to cycle due to various concerns such as fear of traffic and accidents, lack of safe and connected infrastructure, insufficient amenities like bike racks and repair stations, and a general lack of awareness or education about cycling.
societal attitudes and the dominance of car culture also play significant roles in deterring people from choosing bicycles as a regular means of transportation. despite these challenges, the potential for building a better bicycle culture in chester county is immense.
