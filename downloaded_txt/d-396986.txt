brooks masten has been making finely crafted open-back banjos for over 20 years, drawing inspiration from historical banjo makers and machining his own vintage replica brass banjo parts in his portland, oregon shop.  his banjos are known for their wonderful playability and tone in addition to being beautiful pieces of art that are built to last.  brooks only produces 25-30 artisan banjos a year, and many custom options mean that your banjo could be one-of-a-kind.
