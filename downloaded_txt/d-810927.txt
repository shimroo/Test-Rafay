ice storm no match for pelican 1510
in early february 2022 an ice storm came through my home town of memphis which according to the ny times caused around 60,000 people to lose power for almost a week. i was leaving for a work trip the next morning, so i had already packed the car in expectation to leave for my early flight. the storm hit and in addition to losing power, the accumulation of ice on the trees combined with high winds caused one of my neighbor's trees to fall directly on my suv in the middle of the night.

crushproof and crashproof
i was on my way home from teaching a women’s “stop the bleed” and firearms safety course at the homestead (florida) training center for triad medical training. i had my pelican 1615 air case tied down in the bed of my truck with my range setup inside. i was at a stoplight when i heard two cars coming up behind me at a high rate of speed. i realized they were coming into my lane and not stopping. the lead car struck the rear of my truck spinning me into the intersection and ejecting my pelican case from the bed of my truck. my pelican case ended up in the middle of the intersection and got dragged under a pickup truck, until it got run over and became dislodged. the gentleman who’s truck it was under noticed the case dislodge from under his truck and took it home. upon inspection he found my fiancé’s business card in the id slot and reached out, reuniting me with my gear!
