everyone is welcome at energy tattoo, we are a safe space for all.  we offer appointments via instagram so we can give you individualized care. committed to providing you with the highest quality tattoo work, and we strive to make each tattoo and piercing the best experience you could ask for.  if you are a local and see our door open we welcome you to come by and see the studio, because we are by appointment our hours vary.  if you are traveling to santa barbara from out of the area then feel free to email or dm us ahead of time.  we do receive a large number of emails daily and therefore suggest anyone planning less then a week ahead of time to call into the shop and speak to an artist via dm.
