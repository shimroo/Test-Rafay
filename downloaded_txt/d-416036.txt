   what people are saying about us!     
  "i am so impressed with the wonderful job sohn & associates did in selling my 300 acres of farm land in vanderburgh county. without question, the entire matter was handled with the utmost professionalism in every detail."

  “just a note to let you know how much jan and i enjoyed our three day venture at this past weekend auction. i enjoyed our personal visit as well as seeing a lot of old friends. most importantly was how wonderful your staff was. they were always helpful with requests, loading and just generally very pleasant people. it was such a pleasure to deal with them.”

  “sohn auction went above and beyond our expectations.  we recently sold our two unit duplex well over original list price.  my husband and i could not be happier with the end result.  trent and his father were extremely professional and are wonderful at what they do.  sheila has worked diligently on preparing both the buyer and sellers towards a speedy closing.  thank you all for what you have done for us!”
