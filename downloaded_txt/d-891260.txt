  harbor remembrance day december 7,1941 
 


 president 
  franklin d. roosevelt called december 7, 1941 "a 
  date which will live in infamy"
this date 
  marked the first of one thousand three hundred and fifty one days of war 
  that touched the lives of all who lived at that time. 
the fabric 
  of freedom is woven with the moral and spiritual lineage of the men and women 
  of honor, courage and integrity. those who value something more than their own 
  personal safeties.
let us never 
  forget their strength, their love, their courage, their commitment, their dedication, 
  their perseverance and their devotion for this great country.
