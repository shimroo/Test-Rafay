            the latest: judge declines to block musk and doge from accessing federal data or laying off workers

a federal judge has refused to immediately block billionaire elon musk and the department of government efficiency from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. u.s. district judge tanya chutkan said tuesday that there isn’t evidence of the kind of grave legal harm that would justify a temporary restraining order. the trump administration has maintained that layoffs are coming from agency heads, and it asserted that musk isn’t directly running doge’s day-to-day operations. the decision came in a lawsuit filed by 14 democratic states challenging doge’s authority to access sensitive government data.

            polish president says us assures him it won’t reduce troop levels as he revives 'fort trump' idea

poland’s president andrzej duda says he has received u.s. assurances that washington will not reduce its troop presence in poland and elsewhere along nato’s eastern flank. the administration of u.s. president donald trump has not announced any troop withdrawals, but has said europe must do more to provide for its own security. that has triggered fears that the region could lose its u.s. security protections at a time of resurging russian aggression. duda said tuesday that “there are no concerns that the u.s. would reduce the level of its presence in our country” or that part of europe. he spoke after meeting with warsaw with gen. keith kellogg, the u.s. special envoy for ukraine and russia.

            ethiopia and somalia hold a first round of technical talks in turkey toward resolving their dispute

turkey says top diplomats from ethiopia and somalia have held a first round of technical talks aimed at resolving a dispute sparked by a deal between ethiopia and somalia’s breakaway region of somaliland. turkey has been mediating between the horn of africa countries after concerns about potential conflict in an already volatile region. tensions have simmered since landlocked ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding last year to lease part of somaliland's coastline for a marine base. in return, ethiopia would become the first country to formally recognize somaliland’s independence. turkey says the next round of talks will be in march.

            as israel uses us-made ai models in war, concerns arise about tech’s role in who lives and who dies

u.s. tech giants have quietly empowered israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in gaza and lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services. but as the number of civilians killed has also soared, so have fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people. the israeli military uses ai to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn its enemies' movements. an associated press investigation found after the surprise attack by hamas militants on oct. 7, 2023, its use of microsoft and openai technology skyrocketed.
