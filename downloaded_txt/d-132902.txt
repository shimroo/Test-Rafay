land acknowledgement
we acknowledge the land that fort lewis college is situated upon is the ancestral land and territory of the nuuchiu (ute) people who were forcibly removed by the united states government. we also acknowledge that this land is connected to the communal and ceremonial spaces of the jicarilla abache (apache), pueblos of new mexico, hopi sinom (hopi), and diné (navajo) nations. it is important to acknowledge this setting because the narratives of the lands in this region have long been told from dominant perspectives, without full recognition of the original land stewards who continue to inhabit and connect with this land. thank you for your attention and respect in acknowledging this important legacy.
