i had a great time on the kom tdf week 1 trip. the staff and overall organization of the trip was on point. the tdf viewing areas were fantastic and made the trip special. having tents, food, & live race viewing on tv’s on top of the tourmalet was exceptional. the daily routes offered an array of options for different level of riders. i was also impressed that the staff allowed us to ride in the pouring rain in the basque country. i thought that was a very special experience to be with a group riding bikes in the pouring rain in the basque country. then cross the finish line of the tdf. one of the highlights of the trip for me. i would easily do another bike trip with thomson!

our group has done a number of trips with thomson.  as with the others, the riding was fantastic, the staff was superb, the food was wonderful, and the hotels were great.     the angliru was intense and the lagos de cavadonga was amazing.
