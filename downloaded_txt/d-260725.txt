		::motivation::





 
 





giving 
				material goods is one form of generosity, but one can extend an 
				attitude of generosity into all one's behaviour. being kind, 
				attentive, and honest in dealing with others, offering praise 
				where it is due, giving comfort and advice where they are 
				needed, and simply sharing one's time with someone - all these 
				are forms of generosity, and they do not require any particular 
				level of material wealth.
