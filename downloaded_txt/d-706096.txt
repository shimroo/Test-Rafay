friends! i felt the love this summer! chasing summer, the duo with my husband, joseph felt the love this summer *22 shows, 5 countries, 35 host families, countless bbqs, lots of beautiful conversations and singing with you all until the evening hours! amazing! thank you to each and every one of you who came to the shows, who helped book the shows, who hosted the concerts, who told your friends about the music, who ran sound, who gave us a place to stay and who gave us tons of hugs throughout! you make it worth it. thanks for your authenticity, for your fun, for your vulnerability, your tears and your laughter. it will take years to process each moment, conversation and adventure from this summer.  wow! much love to you and i will see you again next summer...and maybe i will pop over for a surprise tour in december. you will be the first to know! love, tammy*
