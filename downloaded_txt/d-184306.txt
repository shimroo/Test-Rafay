1:1 union area school district has committed to providing chromebook devices for each of our students in grades k-12.  students in grades 5 and up have the opportunity to bring their devices home for homework and other google classroom activities.  we also provide all synchronous students with a chromebook at home regardless of their grade level.  our goal is to provide equal access to technology for all students within the district.







steam throughout the district building, coding, robotics, painting, designing, and a slew of other activities occur throughout our district on a daily basis.  with two new steam teachers and a nationally recognized robotics team, our district is full steam ahead with engaging educational activities from our pre-k to seniors.  we take pride in the scope and variety of projects and activities that occur throughout the school year.  in fact, we shut down our school each february for a full week to allow our students and staff to work on steam week.
