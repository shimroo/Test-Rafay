paul & gaye

the holiday to tasmania has been and gone, and my wife and i just want you to know that we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. the package that you put together worked a treat and everything worked like clockwork. thank you for your meticulous work in booking everything for us.
		




deb c.

hi ben, just wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that our trip was absolutely fantastic!  we got back to brisbane late friday and canât stop talking about it and looking at the over 1,200 photos i took! thanks again for organising everything. it was wonderful!

		




steve & jane 

hi zuleika, we just wanted to send our thanks to you now that we have returned from our trip to tasmania. we thoroughly enjoyed our couple of weeks. the scenery was fantastic, the experiences you booked for us were really enjoyable and we didnât experience any problems. again, thank you so much for organising our trip.




tony & narelle 

hi talise, i just want to thank-you and the tasmanian vacations team for organising our tassie holiday earlier this month. it went off without a hitch. the hotels and b&b were great. so was the cruise and railway journey. and the rental car. at every place, the staff were thoroughly professional and friendly, like nearly every local we met. we'll be back.




bob & dimity 

hi talise, we just wanted to thank you for organising the accommodation and dinners for our trip last weekend. it was a fantastic 5 days and everything went smoothly!





john & june 

hi caitlyn, just a note to say how happy we were on our all too brief visit. the heritage accomodation was lovely, the staff were helpful and answered our every need. congratulations on a great job, two octogenarians who thought they had seen all, greatly impressed.




wendy & william nz

a big thank you for arranging our tasmanian holiday. everything went very smoothly so we had a very relaxing, enjoyable holiday. the accommodations were superb and we did so enjoy the local food and wines. each region had highlights of their own but have to say our last two nights in hobart at the henry jones were the icing on the cake for the whole trip. thanks again for your organisation, we would recommend tasmania as a destination and definitely recommend you to do the organising.




julie & john 

talise, just wanted to let you know we had a wonderful time in tasmania. it was a truly brilliant holiday for us both. everything you arranged went smoothly and we were happy with all the locations and accommodation you selected and recommended. we particularly loved the day trip to josef chromy in launceston and the day cruise on the gordon river. our accommodation in hobart was perfect as it was so close to the markets and mona ferry. we will be sure to recommend your services to friends and family. thank you so much for everything.




sharon vic 

dear talise, thank you very much for helping us organise our tasmanian vacation. we had an amazing time. our highlights would have to include the national parks apsley gorge, wineglass bay, montezuma falls and the wombats at cradle mountain. attractions wise we loved the bicheno penguin tour, seahorse world, platypus house (the echidna experience was brilliant), cataract gorge chairlift, and devils@cradle (we viewed a night time feeding). we had a fabulous holiday and appreciate your help with organising our itinerary.





robyn act

thank you very much for your time for putting together our trip to tasmania. you have done a marvellous job and we enjoyed our accommodation that you organised for us. we had a great time in tasmania, with great weather. once again thank you.




robert & brenda nsw

brenda and myself would like to thank tasmanian vacations for the great way the organised our recent trip to tasmania. every aspect went extremely well making our holiday not good but great.




margaret & ken wa

caitlyn, we are now back home again following a wonderful trip to flinders island. we were more than impressed with island quarters and the way that roweena looked after us. the unit itself is really nice and the location of course was perfect, being only a few metres away from everything in whitemark and being so close to the beach. we look forward to using tas vacations again.







susanne & peter qld

talise, thank you for organising a wonderful trip (only one day of rain!). the accommodation was great - our favourite being gardenia house. our favourite place was stanley and the bruny island trip was a treat. we will be back to do more on the east coast.






greg & carmel sa

kim, we really wanted to let you know how impressed we were with all of the accommodation and tours that you booked for us. the standard was great â stand outs for us were the corinna wilderness experience and the oyster catcher villa at bruny island. there were no problems anywhere with our bookings and we were very impressed with the friendliness of staff. we wanted to thank you for organising the trip for us.





peter f. vic

caitlyn, i write to express our appreciation for your arranging the 'ground' bookings for our tour of the state. your expertise in interpreting our needs led to a great experience for us. we enjoyed all the accommodation and tours on the itinerary. everything worked well in terms of location, time and distance.




georgina b. sa

caitlyn was fantastic in arranging our tasmanian holiday. nothing was too much trouble for her to arrange and even the changes we asked her to make. we had no issues on our tasmanian holiday. a beautiful and friendly place to visit and i certainly hope to go back one day to see what i couldn't fit in this time.




jonothan t. wa

i was impressed with how talise had looked after my alterations to original plans and the speed that she was able to resolve the alterations. thank you talise. my wife & i thoroughly enjoyed our holiday.




kate & ben nsw

i just wanted to reach out and thank zuleika very much for the most wonderful holiday. we had such a great time travelling around tassie and we are in awe of how beautiful the scenery is as well as the food and people. we will certainly be back as 10 days was not even close enough to feeling satisfied. i will be in touch later this year for stage 2 adventures. thanks again for everything.




michele j. qld

it was absolutely fantastic!!. everything from the car  pickup and drop off, to all the different accommodations. it went seamlessly  and we both had the best time. the choices you made for us were amazing and we  loved every minute of our time in tasmania thanks to your work and expertise.

judith m.nsw

booking through tasmanian vacations helped make our trip to  tasmania a very special one - from the ease of car hire, national park pass  & brilliant accommodation - everything was terrific. this allowed us to have  a very enjoyable holiday that, had we tried to book this ourselves, may not have  been possible. thank you, tasmanian vacations for your efforts!
