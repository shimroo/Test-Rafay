redefining air dispersion




ductsox® air dispersion products are an innovative and cost effective fabric alternative to traditional metal ductwork providing precise and efficient heating, cooling, or ventilating for virtually any building application. ductsox systems are well established in the hvac industry.  they have been in use for more than 35 years in a variety  of environments, including gymnasiums, pools, food  processing, fitness centers, convention centers, schools  and warehouses.

fabric vs metal
systems that utilize fabric, such as ductsox, provide targeted, precise and efficient air dispersion for new construction and retrofit projects. additional benefits include a total lifetime ownership cost that is significantly less than a comparable metal ductwork layout and the ability for a system to be custom designed based on the application.

whether for a new building or retrofitting an existing space, the benefits of utilizing a fabric airflow system outweigh those of metal ductwork.
