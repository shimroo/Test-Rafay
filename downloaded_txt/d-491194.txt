welcome
the association of british counties (abc) is a society dedicated to promoting awareness of the continuing importance of the 92 historic counties of the united kingdom.
the abc believes that the historic counties are an important part of the culture, geography and heritage of the united kingdom. the abc contends that britain needs a fixed popular geography, one divorced from the ever-changing names and areas of local government but, instead, one rooted in history, public understanding and commonly held notions of community and identity. the abc, therefore, seeks to fully re-establish the use of the historic counties as the standard popular geographical reference frame of britain and to further encourage their use as a basis for social, sporting and cultural activities.
more information about what the historic counties are and why they matter can be found in our an introduction to the historic counties factsheet.
