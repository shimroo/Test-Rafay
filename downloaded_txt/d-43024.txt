make firefox your own





























extensions for every interest
from security to news to gaming, there’s an extension for everyone. add as many as you want until your browser is just right.


change up your look
go from light mode to dark mode depending on your mood or preference, or liven things up with a custom theme (rainbow unicorn, perhaps).


tweak your settings
there’s no need to settle. change up the new tab page, search bar, bookmarks and more to explore the internet the way you want.




backed by the non-profit that puts people first



challenging the status quo since 1998
firefox was created by mozilla as a faster, more private alternative to browsers like internet explorer, and now chrome. today, our mission-driven company and volunteer community continue to put your privacy above all else.



your privacy comes first
as the internet grows and changes, firefox continues to focus on your right to privacy  — we call it the personal data promise: take less. keep it safe. no secrets. your data, your web activity, your life online is protected with firefox.




keep all your favorite browser features — and discover new ones.



works with google products
all your favorite google tools (like gmail and docs) work seamlessly in the firefox browser.



facebook container
download this browser extension to stop facebook (and instagram) from tracking you around the web.



sync your devices
firefox is available on all your devices; take your tabs, history and bookmarks with you. all you need is a mozilla account and you’ll get access to syncing and more mozilla products.



screenshots
grab a high-resolution image of anything online with our screenshot tool built right in the browser



enhanced tracking protection (etp)
firefox automatically blocks many third party trackers from collecting and selling your web activity.



picture-in-picture
from watching a web tutorial to keeping an eye on your favorite team, your video follows you while you multitask.
