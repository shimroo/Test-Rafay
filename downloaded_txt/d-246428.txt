space education





mike gruntman is the founder of the 
astronautics program at the 
		university of southern 
		california (usc). he has been leading its nationally prominent flagship component, 
	  master of science in astronatical engineering (ms aste), since mid-1990s 
	  (pdf). 
	  
	  for several years mike had been calling for creation of independent academic departments 
	  in space engineering in u.s. universities. in 2004, the usc program was reorganized 
	  into a new independent academic unit, today's department of astronautical engineering.
	  this is a unique development in space engineering education in the united states, and
	  this is a unique department. it offers bachelor of science, bachelor of science (minor), 
	  master of science, engineer, and phd degrees and graduate certificate in 
      astronautical engineering. 
	  


	  mike served as the founding chairman, 2004–2007, of the new department and 
	  guided its spectacular growth. mission accomplished! he chaired the department again from 2016–2019.
	  


	  during the first 18 years of the new department (2014-2022) it awarded more than 800 degrees
	  master of science in astronautical engineering, a significant contribution to workforce 
	  development for space and defense industries. a number of students graduated with bachelor's and 
	  phd degrees as well.
  


	  mike's 
	graduate course on space systems is among largest 
	in this engineering field in the country. more than 2200 graduate students took this class from 1994-2021. 
	mike also teaches short courses 
	on fundamentals of space systems for government and industry. 
 




a recent (2022) 
book includes more than 160 problems with detailed solutions 
from this university course
(and enhancing short courses).

energetic neutral atoms (ena) in space
 – 
astronauticsnow.com/ena/



measurement of energetic 
		neutral atoms (ena) in space has emerged as a powerful tool to remotely 
		probe hot plasmas and populations of energetic ions such as planetary 
		magnetospheres and the interstellar (galactic) boundary of the heliosphere. the 
		original bold vision of ena imaging emerged in the late 1970s. about 20 years 
		of concept refinement and development of enabling instrumentation followed 
		to overcome measurement challenges. mike gruntman played a leading role in this development. 
		nasa's image mission successfully demonstrated the 
		instrumentation and the power of the experimental concept by imaging 
		earth's magnetosphere and cassini imaged the magnetosphere of saturn 
		in ena fluxes. two ena imagers are launched in 2007 and 2008 on the 
		nasa twins mission to conduct, for the first time, stereoscopic 
		imaging of the earth magnetosphere. nasa's ibex mission, launched 
		in 2008, mapped for the first time the interstellar (galactic) frontier of the 
		solar system in ena fluxes. the science magazine highlighted ibex discoveries
		on its cover in november 2009.

the journey to ena imaging began in the mid 1970s






ena tutorial



among mike's main contributions to ena and euv imaging are 



(a) discovery (1982) of the disturbance of the supersonic interstellar wind by the neutral solar wind flux
 (pdf)
 – the effect that is today routinely accounted for in global heliospheric models and possibly contributing to the yet unexplained heliospheric ribbon;



(b) prediction (1992) of the anisotropy of heliospheric ena fluxes, the effect that has enabled heliosphere ena imaging 
(pdf)
 – first implemented and demonstrated by ibex;



(c) part of effort (2001) in definitive formulation of the concept 
of heliosphere boundary ena imaging in an article in the journal of geophysical research  
(pdf)
 – a key to proposing the winning science objectives for the ibex mission;



(d) experimental demonstration (1981) of ena detection with energies down to 0.5 kev (1.5 orders of magnitude 
down from the lowest energies of >20 kev at the time) using thin foils ans start-stop time-of-flight (tof) techniques
(pdf)
 –  the breakthrough technique that enabled ena imaging instruments on the image (mena) and twins missions; 



(e) experimental demonstration (1981) of measuring absolute particle detection efficiency without calibration 
(pdf)
 –  the technique that is used on ibex (ibex-hi); 



(f) spearheading the effort to formulate and propose the first dedicated ena space experiment 
and building the first generation ena instruments (early and mid-1980s) 
to detect the neutral component of the solar wind and heliospheric 
ena fluxes from the interstellar boundary of the solar system 
(pdf)
 – 
the flight experiment (experiment gas njointly with mpae and cbk, instruments gas-1, gas-2, gas-3, and block gas-e) 
was built but never flown in space due to "political" headwinds (first scheduled for ill-fated phobos mission
to be launched in 1986 and then removed and rescheduled for never-launched relikt-2; two phobos spacecreaft 
were launched in 1988 and were lost); 
ibex measured for the first time heliopsheric enas in 2009; 
the neutral solar wind (pdf) 
is yet to be observed experimentally; 








(g) developing a concept (1981) and demonstrating (1995) suppression of uv and euv background photon fluxes (main contributors to signal noise) in ena instruments by diffraction filtering
(pdf);
 – the technique that enabled ena imaging instruments on the image (mena) and twins missions;



(h) proposing (1983) and developing in detail (1991) a concept of the unique technique for detection of low-energy neutral atoms by their surface cionversion to negative ions
(pdf);
 – the technique that enabled low-energy ena imaging on the image (lena) and ibex (ibex-lo) missions;



(i) development of the concept (1998) of euv mapping of the heliopause 
(pdf);



(j) development of the concept of and demonstrating a breakthrough enabling design (2005) of an instrument for euv mapping of the three-dimensional solar wind and the heliopause
(pdf);



(k) ruling out (1993) use of coded-apertures for ena imaging of the magnetosphere
(pdf). 



mike's 1997 review article on imaging of space plasmas in ena fluxes remains to this day a main publication in the field.
