the contraction zip is an acronym for "zone improvement plan". the zip code was first used by 
				the 
united states postal service and was later adopted by the philippine postal corporation (philpost) 
				to be implemented throughout the philippine archipelago. the difference between the u.s. and the philippine zip code is that the u.s. zip code comprises five (5) digits and sometimes with an additional four digits for a more accurate delivery of mail due to the 
				vastly larger area of the county. while the philippine zip codes always contain only a four (4) digits. note that the philippines' land area is roughly 300,000 square kilometers, about the size of the state 
				of arizona or italy. note that the acronym "zip" is always spelled in capital letters.
