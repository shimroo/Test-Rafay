securing the future of catholic education
catholic online school is now the largest catholic school in all of history


join us in transforming lives through free, world-class catholic education available to anyone, anywhere






catholic education is at a crossroads






did you know that in the 1960s, there were over 13,000 catholic schools in the u.s. serving more than 5.2 million students? today, that number has dropped by more than half. fewer than 6,000 catholic schools remain, serving only 1.6 million students. this decline is not just about closing schools—it’s about losing the future of the church.
however, at catholic online school, we believe there’s hope. in just a few short years, we’ve grown to become the largest catholic school in the world, with over 1.34 million student enrollments across 193 countries, offering 7,000 video-based lessons. this makes us not only the largest catholic school today but the largest in the history of the church. through our free educational platform, we are filling the gap and ensuring that catholic education thrives, no matter the challenges..
