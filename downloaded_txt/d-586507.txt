							the anza-borrego desert is a land of many faces, where the 
																twists and turns of each 
        canyon reveal a unique charm and beauty. from the colorful borrego 
        badlands east of borrego springs to the 
        forested slopes of the laguna mountains,  
					and the desert 
					wildflower blooms that follow the rains of winter,  
		diverse plants and
        animals have adapted to many
