                "we have been using leadtools since the development of our first product version of the dhs image database in 1994.
                we chose lead because all our requirements could be covered with one tool. the dhs image database has been used worldwide
                for over 25 years as a modular image management system in the qa and the laboratory area for archiving, recording, processing,
                anaylsis, and documentation. we started using leadtools for reading, writing, and visualizing the already extensive number of
                different image formats. we’ve also started to add in annotations throughout our time using leadtools we have never experienced
                any major issues. their support team has always been informative and quick to help!"
