                        custom paint
                    




                        custom paint is what hot rods-n-hogs is primarily known for. whether it's a show winning black, a multi layered graphic or a fantasy airbrush design, we have produced it.  we can paint your factory sheet metal or prep your after-market "tin". on aftermarket gas tanks, or if there is a considerable amount of welding done on your factory tank, we seal it with  the "tank renu" process to prevent rusting. we also do all factory color repairs and most after-market custom paint repairs.
