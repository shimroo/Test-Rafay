	  coney island nathan's hot dog eating contest 
	 
    



happy 4th of july!!!




 joey chestnut defeated defending champ matt "megatoad" stonie today and regained his title in nathan's famous hot dog eating contest
 on coney
 island, swallowing a record 70 dogs in 10 minutes. joey broke his previous record of 69 hot dogs. he beat stonie by a whopping 17 hot 
dogs.

last year, stonie snapped chestnut's streak of 8 consecutive wins at coney island but this year chestnut got revenge and won the mustard belt back.

miki sudo repeated as the women's champion with 38.5 wieners and buns in 10 minutes.
