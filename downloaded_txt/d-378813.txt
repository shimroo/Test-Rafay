tammy trent joins christian talk show life today tv as new co-host 



 



nashville, tn: november 29, 2022 – popular christian recording artist tammy trent has been ministering to audiences around the world through her music since signing her first record deal in 1995. starting december 2022, television audiences will see more of tammy as she becomes the new co-host on the daily christian tv show life today alongside the current hosts james and betty robison and their son co-host randy robison.tammy trent has been a familiar voice on christian radio since her music career began with hit songs such as “your love is 4 always”, “welcome home”, “run to the cross”, “it’s all about you”, and “my irreplaceable”.  tragically on september 11, 2001 as america endured one of its greatest attacks, tammy endured her own personal tragedy and loss when her husband of 11 years was killed in a scuba diving accident while on a mission trip in jamaica.after taking a year off the road to grieve and allow god to begin healing her from a shattered life, tammy returned to the stage with the women of faith conferences and the revolve tour for teen girls for 6 years sharing her testimony of love, loss, and hope, and she continues to minister all over the world to this day.tammy will inherit the role as co-host from inspirational author and speaker sheila walsh, who departs the show to pursue other ministry opportunities. life today is a half-hour daily program that features guests who share their personal stories of spiritual victory and personal growth through difficulties in their lives. life today has been airing daily on various networks and stations around the world since 1992.“what an honor to be joining the hosting team of life today with the robisons who are like family to me.  i’m amazed at how beautifully god has grown this relationship through the years, since my very first appearance on the show in 1998,” says tammy.  “over the years, i’ve traveled around the world on mission trips with life outreach international sharing stories of those in desperate need of life-saving resources.  my prayer is that i continue to serve this ministry and encourage viewers through life today.” although life today is filmed in dallas, tx, tammy will continue to travel from her hometown of nashville, tn while fulfilling her speaking and music ministry events as well.  to request an interview please contact:ministry coordinator anita daneker at anita@tammytrent.com 



happy 25th ministry anniversary, tammy 




 




in june 2020, many friends, family and elite industry friends gathered in nashville, tn to celebrate and honor the ministry of tammy trent for the past 25 years.it was in may 1995 when tammy released her debut album and 6 weeks later, her first single, “your love is 4 always” reached #1 on the chr (christian hit radio) charts. two more albums would follow, producing a number of top 10 hits, including the #1 hit song “my irreplaceable” on the ac (adult contemporary) charts.but on september 11th, 2001 her songs ceased for a time. tammy stepped away from the spotlight to heal after the tragic death of her husband and childhood sweetheart while on a mission’s trip. that day would change the world forever. that day changed tammy forever.she has since walked the road back to healing and has allowed god to use her life’s experiences, new music and her books to literally help millions across the world to also find healing, restoration, strength, hope and joy again in the worst of circumstances.today, tammy honors the past, celebrates the present, and embraces the future!
