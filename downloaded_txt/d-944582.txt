                  best italian restaurant! when i lived in elk grove i would make trips to stockton on the weekends just to eat here. they offer a complimentary     antipasto bar on the weekends with lunch meats, cheese, olives, torts and the most wonderful stuffed peppers.  the main entrees are amazing, never had a subpar dish here.review by - yelp
