older revision notes

about this page


yes. this is yet another anime cd cyclopedia based on the remus cd
cyclopedia compiled by steve pearl.  the real aim of this project is
to have a database with timely updates and useful searching.  how well
that aim is accomplished, who knows?  currently, about a third of the
remus pedia has been cleaned up with the remaining to be handle in a
timely fashion, i promise!  the next step of my current plan is to
convert to a sql db engine (mysql).  this should allow for nifty
querying functions.
comments are always welcome.


technical stuff


the pages and index are currently generated from a plain-text format and
converted using a perl script into html.  i like doing things this way
because i can change layouts and only have to change it in one
location.

i initially had tried to develop this project using msql but stopped
that due to limitations in the msql engine.  but i've given mysql a
try and i think it should be powerful enough for my needs.  the key
advantage of having the mysql db against the current text file system
should be having efficient searching be easier.  text files would
require all sorts of intermediate index files for the same efficiency
which i think will be more of a pain.

the rating system is arbitrary, but if you provide a rating, i'd like the
scale to be 0-5 following these guidlines somewhat.


0: "this cd blows chunks.  it suketh mightily. i would use it
to torture people."
1: "this cd is pretty bad.  i'd consider using it for
microwave fireworks."
2: "this cd has good points and bad points.  i wouldn't
consider getting it."
3: "nice cd.  maybe get it if i can find it cheap."
4: "this is a very good cd that i'd seriously consider getting."
5: "i loved this cd. you will love this cd. buy buy buy!"
