i am a modern-day nomad.i have no permanent address, no possessions except the ones i carry, and i rarely know where i’ll be six months from now. i move through the world without a plan, guided by instinct, connecting through trust, and constantly watching for serendipitous opportunities.
people are my passion. unlike a traditional nomad, when i go somewhere, i settle in with the locals long enough to share the minutes of their days, to know the seasons of their lives, and to be trusted with their secrets. i have lived with people in thatched huts, slept in their gilded palaces, and worshipped with them at godly ceremonies and dens of black magic. i have also cooked with women on fires all over the world.
i’ve been living and loving my nomadic existence since the day in 1986 when, at the age of forty eight, on the verge of a divorce, i looked around and thought, there has to be more than one way to do life.

 note: i am now in my late 80s and no longer living a nomadic life. the spirit of that way of living and connecting is forever a part of me, but i reside in a home in seattle near my daughter, son-in-law, and grand dog.
