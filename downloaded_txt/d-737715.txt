autumn prayer reflection











autumn prayer reflection











autumn is a time for deep reflection, introspection, thanksgiving, stillness, and harvest.

as the leaves have begun to display their mellow and rich hues of amber, orange, red, and sienna, they seem to suggest to each of us that the innocence of the season of spring and the boldness of the season of summer have acquiesced themselves to mellowness and kindly wisdom of the ages.



as we reflect upon our journey against the backdrop of the earlier part of the year, we do so in the spirit of relief and anticipation, in the spirit of challenge and triumph, in the spirit of solemnity and joy, in the spirit of weariness and rest, in the spirit of inertia and change, in the spirit of incredible gains and necessary losses, in the spirit of astonishment and enlightenment, in the spirit of planting and harvest, in the spirit of struggle and surrender, in the spirit of transformation and transcendence, and with the reflective awareness of our finiteness and infiniteness all being informed by gentle, yet rich wisdom.



god, we render to unto you thanksgiving for the lives by which we have been impacted and we thank you for the lives that have intertwined with our own lives. we render unto you thanksgiving for the lives of those whom we are given responsibility to co-journey in service, healing, friendship, affirmation, empowerment, struggle, empowerment, truth, and transformation!



god, we thank you for the lives of your beloved and resilient children, who forge the spiritual journey with a banner of faith, love, joy, and trust all informed by an intrinsic understanding that we serve each other in a spirit of love with no judgment. we thank you that we serve each other celebrating our unfathomable faith and strengths with the belief that eyes have not seen, neither have ears heard of their uncharted and unlimited possibilities.



god, during this season of harvest, we thank you for an overflowing cornucopia of love and hope, compassion and persistence, empathy and competence, tenacity and vision, gentleness and care, mission and creativity, blessed by the service, wisdom, and presence of your beloved, gifted, and talented people who serve in a plethora of capacities from leaders to visionaries, from teachers to artists, from receptionists to direct care persons, from outreach persons to those persons who are in the helping and healing professions, from environmental services persons to persons in finance, and from administrative support staff to management, (and endless list) etc. we thank you for each of them dear lord! we thank you for those who are named as well as those who are unnamed. we are blessed by each other’s gifts and offerings in service. we thank you that we are our brothers' and sisters' keepers and delight in and are humble by such a charge. we thank you for the opportunity to serve and to be transformed by having served.



we release, like fallen and ripened leaves into the autumn winds, weights and burdens, misperceptions and deflated hopes, fears and doubts, worries and anxieties, hurts and wounds, and limitations and insufficiencies…shedding the aforementioned for a bountiful harvest of grace, patience, compassion, tolerance, forgiveness, joy, mindfulness, kindness, rejuvenation, and a love that holds us in its grasp forever, while never letting us go.



god, we thank you for relationships, spiritual union, community, table fellowship, the unknown, and the opportunity to gather in a spirit of gratitude, thanksgiving, strength, camaraderie, celebration, humility, grace, and power. we render unto you these petitions, we pray. yes, this is true, let it be so, so be it, may it be so, amen. peace

an intercessory prayer













an intercessory prayer





“o’ god, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come,”

healer and keeper of our souls, we come humbly, soberly, and joyously to
thy throne of grace to say, “thank you lord!”

we thank you lord for the gift of today, the present, a present, a
gift, many gifts of pre-sent moments! 

we thank you lord for the sacrificial lamb of god, jesus christ, who
took away the sin of the world!

we thank you lord for the comforter, the holy spirit, who maketh
intercession for our groans and moans that we cannot and tremble to articulate!



we ask you, gracious lord, to heal our wounds, deep wounds, private
wounds, nursed wounds, and unconscious wounds with your balm of love and your
ointment of healing.

we pray, heavenly father, that you will calm our unspoken fears…fears
that cause us to believe our lives will be perpetual winters that go from frost
to frost, from sleet to sleet, from hail to hail, and from barren wastelands to
barren wastelands, quietly wondering shall spring or summer ever visit us again?



we ask you heavenly father to remove the veneers that hinder us from
being transparent with thee and with others as well as ourselves!

we ask you, father, god, to quiet those secret anxieties that take us
hostage, that rape us of thy present joys, that imprison and hinder our
capacity to earnestly love, that cause us to fight, to take flight, or to freeze
in our actions to connect with others because fear has cohabitated with us and
rented space in our psyche and despair has caused us to believe the our
concerns have no merit in thine eyes! 



we petition thee, heavenly father, to breathe upon us a fresh anointing
as our hopes have been pillaged by the storms of life, while the winds of unpredictability
and the proliferation of carnal agendas that have the form of godliness, but
lack the power therein, have scattered our remembrances of thy glorious
promises! breathe on us lord, because in quietude we have surrendered our
inspiration and acquiesced our zeal as our dreams have been decimated by the fiery
darts of the adversary and naysayers!



lord, we pray for the brokenness and apathy in the world, the nation, the
county, and our communities.

gracious lord, we pray that your hand of healing would bless, heal,
restore, and deliver those whom are sick, hungry, homeless, elderly, outcast, scorned,
forgotten, unloved, overlooked, incarcerated, abused, exploited, abducted, bereaved,
broken in spirit, those who are contemplating suicide as a way out, those who
are in the clutches of all types of addictions (substances, sex, food, money,
power, fame, and vain glory), and those who are overwhelmed by financial
pressures. lord, touch and heal men, women, and children in the name of jesus!



lord, we pray for the pulling down of cloaked destructive and carnal strongholds
in our churches, schools, communities, and nation. we pray for more charity in
the world and the extinguishing of self-centeredness, apathy, and malignant narcissism.
we pray that you, dear lord, will convict and melt the hearts of those in
positions of leadership helping them to remember that “thy will be done!”



grant us lord the peace, knowledge, wisdom, and the blessed assurance
that you are the maker of heaven and earth and beside thee, there is no other!

as we reflect upon and render thanks 
for your greatness, help us dear lord to remember that 

the air that we breathe is your breath, 

the light that shines every morning is your banner and its rays, your
sword of truth! 

the earthquakes that shake the foundation of the earth and the thunder
that rolls are thy voice that calls the world to remember that thou art god!

that the pleiades, the earth, the sky, and mighty oceans art thy glory!


"we thank you that you have made us like a signet on your finger and that you have chosen us."

"now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory wiith exceeding joy, to the only wise god our savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever"



these prayers we petition thee in the mighty and matchless name of
jesus christ we claim and pray! amen!

passion and praise: palm sunday reflection







passion and praise









passion is derived from the word that means “suffer.” as we
reflect upon the significance of palm sunday during the triumphal entry of
jesus into jerusalem, we do so with excitement, praise, anticipation, and
renewed hope. while our hearts and minds are catapulted into spheres of joy,
praise, and pregnant expectation, they must also be tempered by imminence of
the clandestine presence of suffering that resides within the corridors and
shadows of praise, not for the purpose of suppressing our joy, but to remind us
that where there is no cross, there is no crown. 



while the masses gathered to welcome jesus, many had no inherent
idea what he was really about. many had hoped that he was the messiah, which in
their minds meant a political leader, who would bring salvation from political
and societal oppression and debauchery, and overthrow the roman aristocracy.
after all, jesus had raised the dead and performed many miracles recorded and
not recorded, thus, the populous assumed that jesus would restore the kingdom
of david and free them from roman rule. 



while there was veracity in the hopes, expectations, and
dreams of the masses, many had misunderstood, fallen short of comprehending,
and recklessly overlooked that the necessity of the fulfillment of the passion
of jesus christ of which psalm sunday was the precursor; i.e., suffering would
still unfold before authentic praise would be perfected and fulfilled. for we
know that “god moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform” and the word of god reminds us “for my
thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the lord,
for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your
ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” isaiah 55:8-9. 



in essence, the plan of god was operative on a higher plane
not yet understood by the hearts of men and women. regarding the manifestation
of perfected praise, perfected praise is a profoundly deeply-rooted honor and
reverence of thanksgiving that believers lift up to god, who has saved and
blessed them by his grace through the crucifixion and resurrection of jesus
christ. perfected praise is also birthed by purification through the fire of
trials where joy and peace are the believers’ companion where hopelessness and despair
should otherwise reside.  



thus, while believers, witness bearers of the faith, must
approach palm sunday with joy and shouting “hosanna,” which means “save now,”
we must also do so with a sober reverence to god because within “the cup” that
overflowed with praises bestowed upon jesus, were bitter dregs of suffering of
which jesus was aware. in essence, while the focus of the masses was on the
material world, the focus of jesus was on a mission of a higher call and vastly
more enormous than one place and one time, for it was a mission that would
transform all that was, all that is, and all that shall be! glory to god in the
highest!!! god is the alpha and the omega and within the passion of jesus, “the
beginning and the end” were reconciling themselves that the excellency of
christ would be made manifest!



importantly and ironically, the masses who shouted hosanna
during the triumphal entry of jesus into jerusalem, were comprised of the same
masses who displayed the fickleness of the human heart just a few days later in
their angry and insulting vulgarities and chants requests to pilate to “crucify
him!” this dynamic causes the believer to keep ever present the question that
jesus proposed when he stated, “for what shall it profit a man, if he shall
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? mark 8:36. place not your hope and
faith in accolades of men and women, but god almighty beloved of god! an important
point to mention here to us as believers is that we must resist the temptation
to place god in a box as well! the lord is doing a new thing!!! just as jesus
was not finished with the plan of god during his triumphal entry of jesus into
jerusalem, god is not finished with you yet nor his plans for your life beloved
of god! keep the faith and continue to press forward to the mark of the high
calling in jesus christ!



while our eyes are fixed on easter morning and the joyous
outpouring of grace and gratitude that was is manifested through the
resurrection of jesus christ, let us not forget the rough and rocky precipice that
jesus took and that we must take to get there. christian lyric writer, jennie
e. hussey, echoed these sentiments in a hymn that she penned in 1921, “lead me
to calvary.”



lead me to calvary





        king of my life, i
  crown thee now,

        thine shall the glory be;

        lest i forget thy thorn-crowned brow,

        lead me to calvary.

refrain:lest i forget gethsemane,lest i forget thine agony;lest i forget thy love for me,lead me to calvary.

show me the tomb
  where thou wast laid,tenderly mourned and wept;angels in robes of light arrayedguarded thee whilst thou slept.

let me like mary,
  through the gloom,come with a gift to thee;show to me now the empty tomb,lead me to calvary.

may i be willing, lord, to beardaily my cross for thee;even thy cup of grief to share,thou hast borne all for me.

happy new prayer 2017






happy new year



















as we embrace the dawning of the new year 2016 and the
twilight of the present year 2017,



may we thank the lord for another chapter in our lives,



may we live each page with renewed hope, purpose, vision,
and meaning as we touch the lives of other inspiring them to new heights of
discovery and enlightenment,



may we live each day anew with joyful hope and unquenchable
inspiration,



may we be gifted by the wonder, majesty, and the bliss of
excited expectation for dreams to be fulfilled in the plan of god...through
many dangers, toils, and snares our heavenly father has watched over us, 



may we greet others with a banner of peace, songs of joy,
and greetings of glad tidings of the good news of mercy, grace, love, and
faith,



may our faith be re-ignited and set a flame by the holy
spirit and sacred breath of a loving and merciful god,



may we be enraptured by the safety and embraced by the
infinite love of god...a love that will never let us go, 



may we be courageous enough to embrace the strength of our
weakness,

and humble enough to embrace the weakness of our strength, 



may we be encouraged by the assurance that we are on the
heart and the mind of god,



may we love so deeply that we risk to set the world aflame
with love, joy, compassion, benevolence, peace, and godly inspiration,



may the love of god soar us to new heights, greater depths,
and infinite possibilities not yet fathomed, beloved of the most high,



may we trust god without restraint, reticence, nor
reluctance, and for doing so remain buoyant on his everlasting promises,



may the lantern of our hearts burn passionately and brightly

that others will see its light, be inspired, and be drawn to
into the community of god's love, grace, and mercy,



may we be renewed, re-enlightened, and re-affirmed that we
are 

beautiful and gifted, loved and cherished, 

and powerful and resilient because of christ who resides
within each of us,



may we be catapulted to greater heights of imagination,
inspiration, potential, and creativity,



may we remain committed to the journey of faith and give
ourselves to inspire, touch, and lift-up those who are broken, outcast,
wounded, rejected, and forgotten with humble awareness, but for the grace of
god, 



may the new year overflow in grace, prosperity, goodness,

 joy, love, and peace
in our service to god, 



may the lord open and expand new doors in all dimensions of
our lives 

right now, during this season, and throughout the year to
come!


you are loved,





blessings for a wonderful new year
