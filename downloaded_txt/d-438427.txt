jim barber 




“imagine how successful you’ll be!” that simple phrase is at the heart of all of jim’s programs.jim believes that by unleashing the power of the human imagination, seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome, and “impossible” dreams can come true!unfortunately, our society tends to downplay the importance of the imagination, and instead emphasize setting goals and dealing with reality.we are suffering the consequences of that bias.and so jim’s programs encourage us to recognize how important our imaginations are to us, and gives us specific tools and techniques to harness this incredible tool.jim’s programs are not some touchy-feelie rehash of trite cliches. instead, each of his programs is an in-depth exploration of the power of the subconscious mind, specifically the astounding power of the imagination!
