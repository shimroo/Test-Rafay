									lena, girls on the run participant								
at girls on the run, i learned how to be myself and not let others define me.

                                    learn more                                








									leesa, girls on the run coach								
i strongly believe in the transformative power of teamwork, and i am deeply grateful for the opportunity to guide and support these young athletes and junior coaches. girls on the run is truly so much fun!

                                    learn more                                








									ashley, caregiver								
i’m truly grateful for her coaches and this team, the girls on the run platform helped her dream big and achieve many goals. amari went out for track in 6th grade at irving middle school and absolutely loved it and literally hit the ground running, and we have “gotr” to thank for encouraging her and establishing such a great foundation!

                                    learn more                                








									kacy, girls on the run participant & coach								
because of girls on the run, i cultivated an inner strength to be an advocate for both myself and others. i learned the importance of having a community of girls and women around you that support and uplift each other. gotr inspired my whole path forward.

                                    learn more                                








									reina, girls on the run participant								
in girls on the run, i learned it is so important to give back to your community. whether it is in small amounts or large amounts.

                                    learn more                                








									brandon, principal								
the culminating 5k event downtown was spectacular and the smiles on our college hill girls, their run buddies, and family members provided evidence of the positivity the gotr program affords our students.

                                    learn more
