2024 in a nutshell


so that was 2024… the year in which dame maggie smith died. the year in which so-called ‘a.i.’ continued to infect the internet with specious dreck. the year in which the country that styles itself as the guardian of the free world elected a mentally unstable compulsive liar and convicted criminal as president.
on the plus side, the uk temporarily kicked out its own brand of window-licking fascists, and i took some more photos. so here’s my fourteenth annual video slide-show review of the year:



consistent as ever, as in the previous thirteen years, this year’s slide-show contains 97 photos.
once again, i composed the ambient pap backing track. it is called gui-tardigrade:

science ftw!




bbc: spacecraft attempts closest-ever approach to sun

a nasa spacecraft is attempting to make history with the closest-ever approach to the sun. the parker solar probe is plunging into our star's outer atmosphere, enduring brutal temperatures and extreme radiation.


genius move on behalf of nasa to time this rendezvous to happen during mid-winter, when the sun’s at its coolest!
…but it would have been an even more genius move to make it happen at night.

charles rex(otropia)


these new-fangled fivers…



look more closely…



…there’s no polite way of saying this: the charles formerly known as prince appears to be wall-eyed. his right eye is looking straight at us, while his left eye is glancing over our right shoulders.
(in the good old days, an observation like this would no doubt have earned me a one-way trip to the tower. thank goodness we live in a modern, twenty-first-century democracy!)

2023 in a nutshell


so that was 2023… the year in which global temperatures headed off the charts. the year in which, once again, peace was not yet restored to the middle east. the year in which an old man finally inherited an overpriced hat from his mum. the year in which some bell-end took a chainsaw to an iconic british landmark. 
on the plus side, we got some new bookshelves, and i took some more photos. so here’s my thirteenth annual video slide-show review of the year:



consistent as ever, as in the previous twelve years, this year’s slide-show contains 97 photos.
once again, i composed the ambient pap backing track. it is called funk & disorderly:
