new!

all lyrics from final fantasy song book: mahoroba are now (finally) online!
              tsuki no akari, a new version of 
                rosa's theme of love from final fantasy iv on the ds. 
              darkness and starlight, a more thorough
			  japanese version of the opera from the dark mages' third album.
              <plug>if you enjoy the music from the ff series, perhaps 
                you'd like to take a look at the lyricized songs of the dragon 
                quest (dragon warrior) series? it's 
            another site presented by our very own impresaria.</plug>




      we've made some room in our mess of a basement so our guests can go 
      there to find the lyrics to the final boss theme of ffvii. they do contain 
      a spoiler, and they're tucked away pretty well down there. if you think 
      you're ready, come right this way; we'll take the stairs. 
      i'll come with you.
