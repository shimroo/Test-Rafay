so punk is dead & this is so new.




matt good, sonny moore & computer desks?you know it's true.made by my love __emobarbie__ based on our kinky convos.some classic quotes from me to lise (__emobarbie__):sums us up perfectly - "we are the dirtiest bitches to walk this earth. we can't talk about weather."matthew's dick/cock/yorkie bar - "would that be matthew's yorkie bar? although that has a side-effect. "it's not for girls" meaning matt is gay :o"on lise being too horny - "i think you're getting too horny because you haven't had sex with matt for over 5 minutes."on mikey way - "fucking quiet ones. they're always the sex-machines."on sonny's cock - "his cock is as long as that broom."on my classmates not knowing what the fuck the 'yorkie bar' and cupboard thing was about - "i explained about the yorkie bar and simply said, 'matt likes sex in a cupboard.'"me: i'm freezing to death.lise: get sonny to bone you then.me: i can't, the doors open. *sob*me: okay that's going in!!lise: what's going in?me: im hungry. but if i eat i'll want to throw up. pshlise: you'd best not eat sonny's cock then.me: *sob* but i wanted to!lise: if you feel like you're gonna throw up - then it's not going to be very pleasant for either of you is it? tsk becka think! hahahahr.me: it's in now :p oh jesus i keep saying inlise: what's in?!...lise: o_o o_o o_o i want to fuck his face off. now.me: *pushes you towards cupboard* lise: maattthhewww i'm coming! ... not literally.me: oh good. i was going to say - a bit quick! you two don't take long do you?lise: he's actually really quite tall. nah, you don't say.me: yeah he is. lmao. i noticed that. and he has long arms. lise: long arms = long fingers = lise a happy girl.me: i knew the finger comment would be thrown in.lise: oooh matt wants me in his cupboard. me: he has his yorkie bar out.me: mum has to make mine seperate because i'm a fussy cow and have to be vegetarian.lise: you're a veggie? how did i never know that? you shouldn't suck on sonny's cock then really should you? hmm.me: that made me choke. but, that would be cannabilism, not eating animal meat.oh my god i love that girl.the sexual adventures of frankie and lisheyharhar dirtyness ♥
