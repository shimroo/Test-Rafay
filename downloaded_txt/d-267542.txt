greetings intrepid musical adventurer,

you have stumbled upon one of the great secrets of the sonic wonderverse…alas, i am sorry to say that i am not making megatars any more. it was fun while it lasted but for a variety of reasons, it was time to move on. thanks to all the megatar fans out there (cue crickets). no really, you guys are special and i wish you all the best. may your many and varied musical explorations be fruitful and your heartstrings be well tuned.cheers,patrick








if you are looking for strings click “strings info” in the menu at the top of the page.think you could be the next bearer of the torch that is the megatar? i still have the tools, most of the inventory, the jigs, templates, cut files, suppliers, production notes, etc. to make instruments. i would happily sell it to someone for a song, especially if they wanted to reboot the brand. let me know if you are interested in taking over. please no tire kickers. this is a great opportunity for the right person to jump start a guitar making career.not that you might go away without being entertained, here is a gallery of some of my favorite musical instrument experiments that i have made over the years…
