the chindits


introduction
the chindits were the largest of all the allied special forces of the 2nd world war. formed and lead by major-general orde wingate dso, they fought behind enemy lines in northern burma during 1943 and 1944 in the war against japan. they were unconventional due to their total reliance on airdrops for their supplies and complete dependence on wireless for communications.
wingate and long range penetration
in march 1942 lt.col. (then) wingate arrived in india after carrying out successful guerrilla operations in 
palestine and abyssinia. using his understanding of guerrilla warfare he proposed a scheme of long range penetration 
operations deep into the enemy-held territories of burma. in july 1942 the 77th indian infantry brigade was formed 
for this task.
 
wingate organised and specially trained the chindits in commando methods, preparing them for jungle fighting, 
sabotage, and air supply dropping.

 
the chindits would infiltrate deep behind the japanese lines in northern burma. for many months they lived in and 
fought the enemy in the jungles of occupied burma, hundreds of miles behind the japanese forward positions. 

their mission was to raid the enemyâs lines of communications, blowing bridges, railway tracks and blocking supply 
routes.  they would harass the enemy to cause confusion, disrupt their plans and divert their resources.

the chindits were organised into columns with a strength of about 340. each column was strong enough to defend itself
and capable of mounting surprise attacks on enemy targets, yet small enough for concealment and for mobility to evade 
and slip through enemy nets. columns would combine to strike larger targets and then disappear back into the jungle.

1st expedition
there were two chindits expeditions into burma, the first in february 1943, code-named operation longcloth, consisted 
of a force of 3,000 men who marched over 1,000 miles during the campaign. it was an experimental operation to prove british forces could operate many hundreds of miles from their own bases in the midst of japanese controlled territory and to test wingateâs theories and to gain experience.

2nd expedition
the 2nd expedition in march 1944 was on a much larger scale and consisted of a force of 20,000 men. 
they were given the name special force and was composed mainly of british battalions supplemented by burma rifles, gurkha and nigerian
battalions and a company of hong kong volunteers.

wingate had wanted an airborne invasion, to assist this united states provided an air task force to be known as 1st air commando. equipped with bomber,
fighter, transport, glider and light aircraft they provided the chindits with direct air support and evacuated their 
casualties. the fly-in of the bulk of the force, code name operation thursday, was by the raf and 1st air commando. 
gliders were used to land advance parties who then constructed airstrips for the transport planes. it was the 
second-largest airborne invasion of world war ii. 


once inside burma, well-defended strongholds were established from which columns operated, air supply drop zones 
established and nearby airstrips were built for evacuating casualties. floater columns patrolled outside the 
perimeter of the stronghold to counter-attack the flanks and rear of any enemies approaching or attacking the 
stronghold.


tragically their leader, general wingate, was killed in a plane crash a few weeks after the launch of operation 
thursday. towards the end of their operations, the chindits came under new command and the plans for them were 
changed. they were used for tasks that they were not trained for or equipped for and were kept in the field much 
longer then wingate had planned. casualties were high.
