getting to know the palisades
on foot
hikers and cross-country skiers have over 30 miles of trails to discover, ranging from gentle riverside strolls to challenging rock scrambles.

many first-time palisades hikers are surprised at how rugged our trails can get! check our hiking page for tips, suggested hike routes, and other useful information before you set out.
 
by a picnic table
four riverfront picnic areas provide space to relax and play by the mighty hudson â and to show us how you grill!


each of our picnic areas has its own character, but each can get busy too â especially on a nice weekend day. this page will help you avoid some frustration and get the most from your day in the park.

on a bike
the park includes miles of tree-covered roadway right along the hudson â not to mention some grueling uphills to conquer!


have fun, challenge yourself, decompress â but please be courteous and keep it safe! this page will give you the information you need to enjoy your ride here.


from the water
the park and the palisades take on a whole new aspect when experienced from the river!

boaters should always stay mindful that the hudson is a wide tidal river with powerful currents and heavy boat and ship traffic! this page will  start you off with some of the information youâll need to get safely on and off the water from the park.
 
with a fishing pole
fishing and crabbing are allowed along the shoreline, for  the length of the park.

for information about what is and is not allowed (and what may or may not be safe to eat!) please check here before you drop your line in the river.
 
through a park program
whether you love history, nature, just getting outside â or a  bit of all of it! â throughout the year youâll find a wide range of public programs, open to all and at no or minimal cost.

we also offer ways to get even more involved with the park, with ongoing park programs, volunteer opportunities, and more! take a look at this page for a calendar of upcoming events and to get a better sense of all we have to offer.
 
from home
as you explore this website, we hope you will enjoy learning more about the palisades and this park â with their rich stories, both human and natural.


thanks to the efforts of far-thinking people over a century ago and since, the new jersey palisades today belong to all of us! these pages were created to help you and others enjoy this great national landmark.
