thoughts on the pot: a kaleidoscopic cornucopia of jokes, observations, and advice
by pat duke
pat duke, the beloved narrator of the smash hit swamp people on the history channel, shares a hysterical and thought-provoking collection of punchlines, one-line zingers, observations, and advice on a variety of topics.
nothing is off limits: you’ll enjoy laugh-out-loud moments about work, retirement, marriage, divorce, drinking, drugs, religion, obesity, vegans, kids, parents, life, death, sleep, farts, and poop. mostly these are jokes, but the author sprinkles in sage advice as well as stories about the flat-out weird.
