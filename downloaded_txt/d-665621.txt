            hemp for shipping        

            
            no other natural fibre can withstand the forces of the open ocean and the ravages of salt water as well as hemp is able to.            
        






            golden age of medicinal cannabis

            cannabis counterculture

            growing hemp        

            
            industrial hemp is one of the oldest agricultural crops on earth and it has been used to make thousands of different products.            
        






            cannabis sativa l.        

            
            cannabis sativa was first classified in 1753 by botanist linnaeus. in 1783 biologist lamarck classified a second species: cannabis indica.            
        






            old masters

            reefer madness        

            
            a series of anti-marijuana propaganda films and books released in the 1930s helped fuel hysteria about cannabis.
