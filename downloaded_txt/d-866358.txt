changing millions of lives worldwide since 1980 



chi is a non-profit educational organization founded in 1980 by tom and lilka areton. chi’s mission is to promote international understanding and goodwill through people-to-people exchanges. we believe that the best way to build bridges of friendship and trust among people is to experience directly each other’s customs, languages and values. to live, study or work together leads to a transformational experience of acceptance and genuine affection.
