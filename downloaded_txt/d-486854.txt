the kaleberg journal - february 2025        02/05 - little st simons - a stop at fort fredericaen route to little st. simon's island we stopped at fort frederica to eat our left overs and stretch our legs. there are ruins, historical gardens and the view of the coastal waterway the british fort once defended from the spanish. it was february, but we did spot a violet in bloom and ripe oranges. oranges are green until cold weather ripens them into the form that turns up in grocery stores.                  some oranges, too high up to reach, so probably sour     keywords: georgia        02/04 - little st simons - flatboat to the islandwe took a flatboat out to little st simons island. it was a very pleasant ride on calm waters. on our previous visit, it had been wet and icy. all of us passengers huddled under blankets. this trip was quite different.                              keywords: georgia        02/03 - little st simons - arrival, needlerush trail and sunsetwe took the flatboat from the hampton river marina to little st simon's island. as soon as we were on land, we took a short walk north up and along the needlerush trail. we felt right at home. then, we went and watched the sunset before dinner.                                                                 keywords: georgia        02/02 - little st simons - sancho panza, controlled burns and moreone of the guides at little st simons took us up north to an area of the island we had not explored. we visited the twin oaks, two old gnarly live oaks with long almost horizontal branches twisted and warped around each other. it's hard to capture this in pictures since the trees wrap around one. there were bones and feathers on the ground.we passed through one of the controlled burn areas with charred vegetation and black ash on the ground. this is part of the island management plan. the burned area was a real contrast to the lush local vegetation.we also stopped at sancho panza beach. it was once wild dunes, but now most of the dunes are covered with grasses. it's one of the many transformations. we didn't spend a lot of time exploring, so we're hoping to get back to the area on a future visit.  welcome to the island                welcome to the island      a burned area            the twin oaks                        sancho panza beach           keywords: georgia        02/01 - little st simons - atlantic beachin the afternoon, we headed out to the atlantic beach. the tide was going out, and it was going to be an extremely low low tide. this meant lots of beach and a gps track that mainly had us walking on water.we did some bird watching en route, and saw a friendly and photogenic armadillo. then we crossed the dread mosquito causeway to the beach. it was too cold for our insect "friends", so there was not a mosquito to be found.one of the nice things about having a guide was having someone to point out and explain things. we had seen and collected sand dollars before, but our guide showed us the distinctive pattern of holes that they leave when they bury themselves at low tide. he even dug one up for us so we could see the moving spikes on its underside. (of course, he returned that one to its hole.)we also saw some little sand worms and their trails of snot and sand along the beach and olive shells with their distinctive tracks. we walked far out on the sand into the sea. the sky was bright and the ocean endless.  en route                the mosquito causeway      sand patterns                  a living sand dollar  a sand dollar hideaway      a sand dollar in the sand      olive shell with its distinctive track                keywords: georgia the kaleberg journal - january 2025        01/31 - little st simons - norm's pondwe explored the beach for a while. then we headed back to the lodge with a stop at norm's pond. norm is the biggest alligator on the island, and norm's pond is the biggest, best and deepest pond there. norm lives alone except for norma, his lady alligator friend.                                                                 keywords: georgia        01/30 - little st simons - an amazing sunsetwe knew it was going to be an amazing sunset when the color started appearing in the late afternoon. there were also some leaping fish in the river, so we were well entertained before dinner.                                                                       keywords: georgia        01/29 - little st simons - flatboat loopwe took a flatboat tour down the waterway fronting the lodge to the atlantic ocean. then we cut around and returned on the hampton river. the waters were calm for the most part except when we approached the ocean proper. along the way, there were egrets, cormorants, herons and other sea birds. we even saw dolphins, but they would leap and dive too quickly to photograph.                                                                       keywords: georgia older entries
