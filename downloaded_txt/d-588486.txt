division of social medicine and professionalism






history
in 2018, the division of social medicine & professionalism was created through the merging of the institute on medicine as a profession (imap) and the center on medicine as a profession (cmap). since 2003, imap had been analyzing and promoting medical professionalism as a field of study and a force for change. it has conducted and supported research in topics including:

the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on physicians' prescribing patterns
the political campaign contribution behavior of physicians according to specialty
the involvement of physicians in human torture and the death penalty
the role of state governments in shaping u.s. clinical practice patterns
analyses of the physician payments sunshine act's impact on conflict of interest

mission
the division of social medicine & professionalism is dedicated to:

promoting advocacy on behalf of not only individual patient health, but also population health among medical professionals
analyzing the implications of the extraordinary changes in the delivery of health care on medical professionalism
investigating the impact of "disruptive technologies" on medical practice and professionalism
analyzing the impact of the entrance of investors on the practice of medicine
