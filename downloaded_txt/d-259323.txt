 why cuba? why me? cuban chronicles more from waltermy interest in cuba has deep family roots. my father and his parents lived there from 1939 to 1942. as jewish refugees from nazi germany, they were unable to enter either great britain or the united states, despite having close relatives in each. the roosevelt administration strictly enforced a restrictive quota on jewish immigration. my father and his parents had to wait in cuba until 1943 before obtaining permission to enter the us. i was born in new york city in 1944. (a good history of the jewish experience in cuba is robert m. levine’s 1993 tropical diaspora (isbn:0-8130-1218-x). there’s also a novel which eloquently evokes the time when my father lived in cuba, passing through havana, by felicia rosshandler (isbn: 0-312-59779-7). my father took me to cuba in august, 1956. we visited his old residence and met some of his old friends. i don’t remember much about it except that cuba was a very hot and sticky place. (i was only 12 at the time.) we stayed briefly at the hotel nacional, and after that we moved to a smaller hotel. we traveled to pinar del rio with one old friend, john gundrum, also a german immigrant, but one who’d never left cuba. in november, 2000 i made my second visit to cuba as an adult. i’d spent three weeks there in late 1999, on a delegation of yoga teachers and students meeting and practicing with our cuban counterparts. i knew more than most in the us about this caribbean nation. i’ve read a lot of cuban history, and followed cuban affairs closely. now i wanted to take a much closer look. how do cubans actually live, day-to-day? i wanted to get a sense of how they work, their likes, dislikes and so on. it’s one thing to hear and read about a place, in the media (cuba is terrible place! people are dying to leave!) or, on the other hand, uncritically favorable accounts among the few left media sympathetic to cuba.

about that “other” walter lippmann

if you don’t know me personally, you might be wondering, ” walter lippmann”, haven’t i heard that name before? well, you very well may have. the “other” walter lippmann was more or less the george will of his time, though he had been mildly socialistic as a young man. we shared little beyond our name, and our secular, german jewish background. but, because my name is spelled exactly as his was, people sometimes ask if we are related. there’s no family or other connection. read more from some scholars whose work i appreciate who’ve written about his ideas and politics.
