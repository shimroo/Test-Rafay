									lets face it, the worst part of travelling and overnighting is the apprehension one endures when staying in a hotel anywhere but especially in a popular resort location where rooms are typically rented out nightly and they normally show the wear. not here! for 3 years now we have stayed at ho-jo plaza 12th street, and never have we had any drama at all. the entire management and support staff greet you with a smile and a pleasent word. they take care of their duties, and their customers and are genuine in their concern for taking care of your needs.
the rooms are always spotless and fresh, the beds comfortable, and oh yeah, we are seniors on a budget, so the price has to be right! we go mid week to avoid the crowds and the associated higher room prices, but staying mid week might even lead to a "meal deal" package ...if you ask. by the way, the girls at the reception desk are always awesome!
