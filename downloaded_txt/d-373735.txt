thomas gray archive

the thomas gray archive is a 
	      peer-reviewed
	      digital archive and research project devoted to
	      eighteenth-century poet, letter-writer, and
            scholar thomas
            gray (1716-1771), author of the
            acclaimed "elegy
            written                           
            in a country churchyard" (1751).
              founded in 2000, the archive's mission is to
            facilitate collaboration and to
            support the study, research, and teaching of gray's
            life and works.
            
new to gray?
gray was a versatile writer.  his slim but
            wide-ranging corpus comprises lyric
            and
            dramatic poems, humorous and satirical pieces, imitations
            and
            translations, written in english, latin, and greek.  gray
            was also
            a polymath. his interests and areas of expertise included
            literature, philosophy, history, sciences, architecture,
            art,
            geography and travel. he went on
            the grand
            tour with horace walpole and later in life devoted
            himself to
            antiquarian studies, spent time studying at the newly
            opened
            british museum, and travelling in the lakes and
            scotland. his
            biographer william mason concluded, "[p]erhaps he was the
            most                               
            learned man in europe" (qt. johnson, 'the life of gray' [22]).
