testimonials
we have purchased numerous pieces of equipment from tinsley over the last decade. they build quality machines and are always available for support when needed. strongly recommend for anybody considering melters or belt coaters.
bill buppert, president, mary sue candy
our first two tinsley belt coaters and chocolate tanks were installed 15 years. we now have five belt coaters and many more tanks that run continuously on average 8 hrs/day. they are perfect for our operation, easy to run & maintain. plus they produce a quality product.
