 si conclude una storiaâ¦ che prosegue: i nostri cani, non piã¹ nostri, ma che rimangono nel nostro cuore, sono ora nelle mani dell'azienda agricola villa forni, a cui auguriamo la capacitã  di mantenere il prezioso pool genetico e di raccogliere i frutti di tanta passione di tanti sacrifici.alfredo morselli - ferruccio vita





to an old labrador 
 a paw that's laid upon my knee, 
                and questing eyes that gaze at me, 
                and furrowed, slightly worried, brow 
                twixt turn'd out ears: all ask â 'what now?' 
                my hand goes out to smooth the coat 
                it sears my loving heart to note 
                the clear brown eyes now dimming blue, 
                and muzzle turned all grey in hue. 
                full fourteen years, in canine age, 
                will spell the turning of a page 
                ere many moons shall pass. i know. 
                it is inevitably so. 
                yet still her coat has shine and sheen, 
                and still her appetite is keen. 
                with greedy love, and hope, i pray, 
                that god may yet defer the day, 
                when shadow at my feet will be 
                only the ghost that i shall see, 
                soothing my mind with memory, 
                of field and marsh and forest tree, 
                where two hearts beat and were but one 
                in seeking what befell the gun. 
                my fingers fondle under ears, 
                i fight with sentimental fears. 
                i'm deeply troubled in my mind, 
                what best to do? to leave behind 
                will cause her misery and pain, 
                and if she comes, there's risk again. 
                the slope is steep on forest hill, 
                even the very cleanest kill 
                may fall two hundred feet below, 
                to bramble, blanketed in snow 
                my own short breath and rheumy back 
                confine me to the level track
                * * * 
                although we brought home only two, 
                it did not seem, to us, too few. 
                we'd stolen yet another day 
                that no-one now could take away. 
                contented, by the warm fireside, 
                our love was not unmix'd with pride.
