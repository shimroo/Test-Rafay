::   bootlegs 





the boot faq from the old official site forum is now available here. many thanks to eric r. the farm tape list is also available here. 

 over recent   months, a couple of fantastic sounding soundboard recordings have become   available on the wolfgang's vault site. although unavailable as yet to download   in lossless format, you can hear a couple of genesis and phil collins gigs   streamed to your computer. these may later be made   available for sale, but in the mean time, i cannot supply you with information   on how to download them. 
so far, the available shows are;
genesis - shrine, 24-jan-75
 genesis - hammersmith, 06-oct-76

version 10 now ready! the complete guide to genesis   radio shows. if it's sheer quality that you're after, then radio shows   are the way to go. but what shows have been broadcast, and how to spot the   fakes? david dunnington has compiled a list which is a must read. read version 10 of his guide here


 





:: best boots 





one question i get asked quite a lot is "what is the best recording from   individual tours?" well, there is a wealth to choose from, so i have highlighted   some of the more obvious ones, mainly from a sound quality perspective for new   traders to look out for. i have tried to stick to complete shows, although there are some exceptionally good partial shows, often radio broadcasts or from pre-fm discs.

nursery cryme - like a nun with a gun - watford town hall - 28th june 1972


foxtrot - tm productions, uk - 24th/25th february 1973

trick - sab 04  - syria mosque, pittsburgh - 13th april   1976


wind &   wuthering - zurich revisited - hallenstadion, zurich - 2nd july   1977


and then there   ... - tm productions - uptown theatre - 13th october 1978


duke - tm productions  - lyceum ballroom, london - 7th may   1980

turn it on again  - radio 2 broadcast  -twickenham, london - 8th   july 2007 



please feel free to   dispute any of these! they are not always the most interesting shows from each   tour, but they are probably the ones of the best quality

flotsam and jetsam is a collection of b-sides, remixes and rarities from across peter gabriel’s solo career. over 60 tracks are featured, mostly all of which have been previously released physically, either on 7”, 12” or cd singles, soundtrack or tribute albums, but, with a few exceptions, are being released digitally for the first time.
the collection – arranged chronologically – is split into three eras. the first, 1976-1985, covers the period from peter first going solo to the end of his run of four self-titled solo albums. it opens with a cover version of ‘strawberry fields forever’, the first time peter featured on a release after leaving genesis. the second, 1986-1993, are peter’s popstar years with music released around the albums ‘so’ and ‘us’. the third era is 1994-2016and features remixes from the ‘up’ album, plus tracks used in various films and notable cover versions. it ends with peter’s song ‘the veil’, written especially for the oliver stone movie ‘snowden’.
across the collection are a handful of previously unreleased versions of songs, most notably, the extended version of ‘slowburn’ (pg1), the full version of ‘don’t break this rhythm’ (an edit featured as the b-side to sledgehammer) and the tracks ‘curtains (broad mix)’ and ‘father, son (daniel lanois and richard chappell mix)’ both only previously available on the non-commercial music industry trust awards cd ‘uscita’.
