new children’s ministries podcast


teaching kids about missions


kids are naturally egocentric; this means they easily think about themselves first. this may sound negative, but it has to do with how their brains aren’t fully developed. as children age, they begin to notice the people around them and develop compassion and empathy. this is why it is so important that we come alongside children when they are young so that they can be exposed to what it means to serve others as jesus did.
join host joy hensley and special guest moriah frederick, the newly appointed kidserve coordinator, as they dive into the power of involving kids in missions. discover practical tips and inspiring stories on how to empower the next generation to make a difference!
