based on natural resources canada’s (nrcan) approved guidelines. refer to nrcan’s fuel consumption guide available at https://fcr-ccc.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/en for more information. full battery charge and ideal conditions are required. figures will vary based, amongst others and non-exclusively, on driving and charging habits, speed, accessory use, weather and temperature, battery age, vehicle condition, road condition and other factors. in sub ideal conditions, figures may worsen by more than 50%. battery capacity decreases with time and use which will further reduce range. see the owner’s manual or nrcan’s fuel consumption guide for details.
