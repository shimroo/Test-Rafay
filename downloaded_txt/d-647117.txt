your heart needs travel







it doesn't matter where you're from or your age or ability, your heart needs travel. so follow your heart and whatever it needs to the middle of canada.
here, a 100-kilometer-wide sunset over a mirror lake makes everything else disappear. here, a rib-crushing hug chases the cold from a winter day. here, a fiddle contest gets your toe tapping. here, the rhythm of a jingle dress dance comforts your spirit.
every heart needs something a little different, but the power in all of these moments calls us to venture forward.
