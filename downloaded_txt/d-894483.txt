welcome to intellistitch


    at intellistitch, we revolutionized quilting by introducing advanced stitch regulation systems that ensure precise and consistent stitches with every project. our innovative technology has helped countless quilters achieve professional results, whether working on intricate free-motion designs or larger, more detailed quilts. with intellistitch, you enjoy unmatched control, effortless stitching, and the confidence that every stitch will be as perfect as the last.


key benefits of intellistitch systems:

perfect stitch regulation: intellistitch adjusts to your quilting speed, guaranteeing even stitches no matter how fast or slow you go.
versatile compatibility: designed to fit a wide range of longarm quilting machines, intellistitch has empowered quilters of all styles and skill levels.
smooth speed adjustment: whether you're moving quickly across large areas or focusing on detailed sections, intellistitch maintains consistent stitch lengths.
multiple quilting modes: choose from manual or regulated stitching modes to match your quilting needs, ensuring complete flexibility and control over your work.


important update:
while intellistitch has made a significant impact on the quilting community, we are no longer selling intellistitch systems directly, through dealers, or from quilting machine manufacturers.
however, we are dedicated to supporting our existing customers. we continue to offer paid support services and provide replacement parts and repair services for our intellistitch turbo/pro and equalizer main boards.
