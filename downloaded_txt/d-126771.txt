friends,i wanted to let you know that i have embarked on a quest to create lyric videos for my entire catalog, since you tube has become the biggest source for people to listen to music. my purpose in this effort is to garner attention for my more obscure songs, the “deep cuts” as they say. given you tube's algorithm, my hope is folks who search for “sailing” may discover “november” or ”walking in avalon” and others. my dear friend and bg singer marcia ramirez introduced me to a wonderfully talented video designer in nashville, shaye smith to create the content. shaye has been working hard and we have been able to post a song each week. i invite you to check out my video section or visit my you tube channel.as always thank you for your support. take me as i amthe new album from christopher cross is available now at these online retailers:

   dear friends, hope all is well. we just finished a 3 week bus run in the us, then right to japan. i just got home and am feeling a bit like burnt toast, but the shows went really well thanks to you. as you can see i have a new project band in austin called “freedonia”. it’s been a ton of fun to working with these talented folks, and i am very excited about the album coming out, and our first show in austin june 8th. the band features a horn section with 3 saxes, as well as a great rhythm section. i play guitar and sing lead vocals. we have 14 new songs, however we do not play any cc material in our shows. no worries i will of course continue to play cc shows. i am hoping the band catches on and builds a following beyond austin and can tour, we shall see. my musical journey continues with your support. thank you! christopher
