mathematically connected communities (mc²) is a partnership of dedicated math educators including teachers, university mathematicians, school/district administrators, and researchers working collaboratively to improve mathematics learning for k-12 students across the state of new mexico. we are a research-based organization currently funded by the new mexico public education department (ped), numerous new mexico school districts, and additional external sources.




 





our vision is to improve student achievement and the teaching and learning of k-12 mathematics by building a statewide learning community of mathematics educators, mathematicians, and public school leaders.
our mission is to develop a sustainable, statewide learning community of teachers, teacher leaders, and principals who are highly knowledgeable about the common core state standards for mathematics (ccss-m) and effective instructional strategies that support all students’ learning and achievement in mathematics.
