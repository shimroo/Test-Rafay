our story

                                            my interests in celtic symbols and the meaning behind them began as a boy growing up in co. kerry with 
                                            visits to stone circles and ancient dolmens. i was fascinated by what i saw at these ancient sites. 
                                            this fascination has developed into a lifelong love of learning about irish heritage and celtic spiritual 
                                            traditions. i learned the significance of knots and how each symbol conveys a message.  emigrating to 
                                            the usa in 1984 and established celtic revival in 1992. our first store was in harvard square, cambridge,  
                                            and after some years, celtic revival took to the road sharing our story, partaking the finest irish and 
                                            scottish festivals in north america. here we were able to reach a wider audience offering exhibits 
                                            including "the passage of time",  "ancient circles" and our latest exhibit,  "the wishing tree". over 
                                            15,000 people have tied their wishes to the wishing tree. it has been a fulfilling adventure working with 
                                            and meeting so many delightful customers and friends that we have made over the years. a great joy has 
                                            been to have families stop by to introduce their kids to us. and to share their story about when they  had 
                                            celtic revival make their wedding rings.  that tells us we are doing things right!
                                    




                                            joe at our wishing  tree exhibit
                                            the tree has over 15,000  folks wishes.

sizing

                    have your finger sized at a jeweler!
                    this is an important purchase donât leave sizing up to chance.
                    custom-made rings are not covered by our standard 21-day return policy unless the goods are faulty.
                    from our experience, a wider ring suits a longer finger and a narrower for a shorter finger. if you are
                    looking at a wider ring,
                    make sure you give it a little slack to go over the knuckle, as a wider ring usually would go up a 1/4
                    to a
                    1/2 size..
                    have yourself sized with a 6 mm sizer. we recomend to measure twice,
                    you want the ring snug on the finger and keep an eye on it when you go swimming in the summer time.
    
                    as width goes, our guide to have a better sense of millimeters is as follows. stack pennies together
    
                    3 pennies = 4.2mm
                    4 pennies = 5.8mm
                    5 pennies = 7.2mm
                    6 pennies = 8.8mm
    
                    rings are available in pollished, matte or antiqued finishes.

celtic symbolism





                    for many, this celtic symbol represents eternity..the eternity of time, the eternity of nature,
                    and the eternity of love.
                    
                    providing an illusion of depth to the pages on which they are inscribed, these knot work designs
                    can be seen on irish manuscripts and celtic stone carvings through out the british isles.
                    people from many lands herald celtic knot work as the emblem of their heritage because the people
                    known as "celts" lived in many areas of modern-day europe, spanning far beyond the shores of the
                    emerald isle. what most of us call "celtic" knot work is actually derived from the exquisite designs
                    created by irish christian monks who had come to the emerald isle in the dark ages to bring
                    christianity to the pagan celts.
                    
                    the monks who came to ireland were influenced by the knot work styles found originally
                    in ancient syrian and coptic manuscripts of the middle east..they took the designs they derived from
                    those
                    lands and created a uniquely irish art form.the flow and design of the knots tied into the psyche
                    of the irish as it related to their pre -christian spiritual traditions. celtic ideology was tied to
                    observing time as
                    being an infinite journey. the basis of the older irish spirituality was focused around the sacred tree
                    that
                    grew from the center of the land and time moved around it.being centered is being present. wise
                    philosophy
                    then
                    and still rings true today.
                    
                    contrary to popular belief, these designs didn't appear until the mid-7th century when irish monks
                    began compiling their illuminated manuscripts of the christian gospels. so although there are many
                    other prehistoric celtic symbols, celtic knot work is the distinctively irish contribution to those
                    ancient
                    celtic designs. the irish monks began creating the beautifully adorned illuminated manuscripts such as
                    the book of armagh, the book of durrow, and the book of kells, by the 8th century, interlacing celtic
                    knot work had become the defining characteristic of irish art.
