breast is best
we recognise that breast milk is the best nutrition for a baby. it's full of everything a baby needs to grow and develop in a healthy way, and gives children the very best start in life.
before using infant formula instead of breast milk, consumers should first speak to a health care professional.
a decision not to breastfeed, or to introduce partial bottle feeding, could reduce supply of breast milk and be a difficult decision to reverse.
