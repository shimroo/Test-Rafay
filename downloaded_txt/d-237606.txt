	 stephen colbert with the white house correspondents
	 



this is the greatest thing we've seen since jon stewart handed tucker carlson his ass on a paper plate live on cnn.  this speech has caused an uproar here in dc and if you don't watch it, you're a poor excuse for a human being.

	 bush rejects tax on oil company profits
	 



i don't know why this surprises me.  you would think with his approval ratings being so low, he might actually, i don't know, do the right thing for once!  i believe those companies will invest the profits in renewable fuels like i believe oj is looking for the real killers.

you have not lived until you've seen this video.  catchy tune with just about every pop culture reference you can imagine.

sorry for the lack of updates!  let us make up for it with the calvin and hobbes searchable database!  it's a safe bet that the word "snow" will yield amazing results.

	 new rules
	 



i am in no way a bill maher fan, but i have to admit that his list of new rules shows flashes of brilliance.  my personal favorite: "you can't wear a che guevara tee-shirt with your designer jeans unless you're trying to be ironic. one is a symbol for impoverished workers. the other was sewn by them."che shirts are one of my biggest pet peeves in the world.  this old article by bully says it a lot  more eloquently than i ever could.

	 notes to netflix
	 



i didn't realize this was a new trend, but it seems like a funny idea.  people apparently put post-it notes on their netflix dvds when they return them.  enjoy!
