our history






 previous







dawn of the atomic age
during the manhattan project, scientists and engineers in oak ridge, tennessee, developed and built the world’s first large-scale uranium enrichment facilities.







atoms for peace
in the decade after world war ii, the country greatly expanded its enrichment capability.  three huge gaseous diffusion plants in tennessee, kentucky, and ohio – originally built for defense purposes – were the dominant source of fuel for most of the world’s civilian nuclear reactors through the 1970s, helping advance the cause of non-proliferation.  u.s. enriched uranium exports required acceptance of nonproliferation commitments and international atomic energy agency safeguards against diversion to military uses.







the u.s. falls behind
the united states’ role as the assured supplier of enriched uranium fuel has steadily declined since the late 1970s. while enrichment programs in russia, europe and china have expanded in recent years, the united states shut down its three enrichment plants in 1985, 2001 and 2013, without building a replacement that can meet u.s. national security requirements. the country now lacks a domestic enrichment capability for national security purposes for the first time since the manhattan project. learn more about the national security importance of domestic enrichment capability.







privatization
bipartisan legislation passed in the 1990s privatized the u.s. enrichment enterprise, creating the united states enrichment corporation, the predecessor to centrus.  proceeds from the sale of the company generated $3 billion for the u.s. treasury.







1993-2013:  megatons to megawatts
under a landmark agreement between the united states and russia, 500 metric tons of former soviet nuclear weapons material was converted into fuel for america’s civilian power reactors.  the u.s. government appointed usec as its executive agent for the program, which became known as “megatons to megawatts.”  the fuel supplied 10% of u.s. electricity needs for two decades while permanently eliminating 20,000 warheads worth of weapons-grade material by the time the last shipment of fuel was received at the end of 2013.







2014
after a downturn in global enrichment prices driven by the ongoing market effects of the 2011 fukushima disaster, the company filed for bankruptcy to restructure debts that were incurred to finance the development of new enrichment technology.  the company emerged from this restructuring in october 2014 as centrus energy corp.  the newly reorganized company retains strong technical capabilities and long-term sales and supply contracts stretching more than a decade into the future.







late 2023
under contract with the u.s. department of energy, centrus began first-of-a-kind production of high-assay, low-enriched uranium (haleu), a next-generation nuclear fuel needed for many advanced reactor designs.  centrus’ american centrifuge plant in piketon, ohio became the first u.s.-owned, u.s.-technology enrichment plant to begin production since 1954.  







looking to the future
centrus continues to provide our utility customers with leu sourced from our global supply network.  at the same time, centrus is pioneering production of haleu in piketon, ohio, and our goal is to forge a public-private partnership that will enable us to scale up to meet the full range of commercial and national security requirements for enriched uranium, including leu and haleu.   with world-class technical capabilities, a billion-dollar order book, and long-term supply and sales agreements through 2030, centrus is well-positioned for the future.
