our purpose
elizabeth, a bridgeport resident, was in between jobs when she noticed a lump last year. uninsured at the time, st. vincent’s charitable care provided her mammography. after her cancer diagnosis real financial challenges set in. help paying bills and buying groceries came from st. vincent’s swim across the sound because donors like you were kind enough to be generous. “i thank god for st. vincent’s and the swim across the sound every day,” elizabeth told us.
