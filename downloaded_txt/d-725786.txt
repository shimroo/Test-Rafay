hungry!





the little birds are out in full force today looking
 for food. with all the sleet and snow we are getting here in the st. louis area they are having a rough time. 
i've fed them once and will have to again this afternoon.

birthday cake




















i knew they were going to put one of the stl250 birthday cakes at the base, and they finally did. i noticed it wednesday afternoon when i left work. i would have carried my camera but it has been too cold to leave it in the truck all day. so today i made a trip to get a shot before the weather turns on us tonight. i love having the c141b in the background. it is a beautiful plane and makes a nice backdrop.

bear & bull





bear & bull, a photo by mike matney photography on flickr.last weekend i participated in the rocky mountain school of photography weekend in st. louis. it was two days of photography instruction and i learned a lot. on sunday as we walked down to pi to grab some lunch i saw this statue. it is one of those little things that you would miss as you drive downtown but when you're walking you can't. there is so much to see in st. louis and i can't wait for the warmer weather to get over and explore some more.#stl #stlouis #statue #stifel #downtownvia flickr:downtown st. louis.

happy president's day!





happy president's day everyone. since i have the day off the wife and i drove up to alton to visit a store, only to find it closed! not sure if it was because of the freezing rain we had this morning or that they were just closed for the holiday. regardless leaving empty handed we drove across the clark bridge to visit the riverlands migratory bird sanctuary. not much open water but we did see a few trumpeter swans and other water fowl. on the way back to illinois i pulled off to the side to get a shot of the clark bridge in the fog.



clark bridge in the fog.




now what? trumpeter swans at the riverlands migratory bird sanctuary.
