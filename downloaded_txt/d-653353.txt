the "not-a-liberal-anymore" gunner



i'm not exactly sure how to describe myself politically except that i'm basically left-leaning. i understand that this blog is based on an oxymoron... but i can't explain it. i want the right to own and legally use firearms. so, this is where i can talk about it.

catching up





i can't believe it's been over a year since i've posted. guess i suck as a blogger. well i've been busy! (who hasn't?) since june of 2009:

we found out my wife was pregnant and we had our first baby. ok, i could probably stop there since that was such a huge change–it really effected our entire lives. i definitely haven't been shooting as much as i'd like, but it comes at a great trade off.
i picked up a savage weather warrior 16 fcss in .308 winchester with a nikon pro staff 3-9x40 bdc scope. it's a great rifle that i'm still learning to shoot well. i love the stainless finish, accutrigger and accustock. this is my first bolt-action, so i don't have any other experiences to compare it to. i wonder if the bolt is stiffer than others. i've seen guys cycle some remington's with just a flick of their wrist and i can't really do that. i might need to work on my technique, but i need to keep it in the context of hunting, since that's what i'm really planning on using the rifle for. i think the trigger is wonderful, and haven't touch the adjustments since i don't want to go with too light of a pull. i've used it for the past two deer seasons. unfortunately, i haven't harvested anything yet.
i now have a benelli vinci realtree apg 26" that i used for the turkey season and shooting clays. it's a totally different beast than my mossberg 590, no surprise there. it's a very smooth autoloader and the only problems i've had were with handloaded shells.
i started handloading 12 gauge shells with a lee load-all ii (?) reloader. i've handloaded about 350 shells and love it. it's perfect for me for the amount that i'm shooting. i was surprised how expensive lead shot is, but otherwise am really happy that the whole set up is really saving me some cash.
i'm sure there's lots more i'm forgetting but i had to try and cover what i could remember so that i can start from somewhere.

preparing for the 2009 flintlock season





i'm thinking about buying a thompson center firestorm with a ss barrel. i've found one for about $449 nib. not a great deal, but not too bad either.first, i wanted to contact the pa gaming commission to make sure that this type of flintlock would be acceptable for use during pa's hunting seasons. i was told on the phone that this model would be ok for use during the flintlock season. i didn't want to spend the money only to find out they didn't allow the use of synthetic stocks or something else.i read a gunweek review on the firestorm and a forum post on huntingpa about the firestorm that sounded pretty good and a friend mentioned that he was looking at one of these models as well. i only wish it came with a nice wooden stock and brass accents like the hawken.from the research i've done this week, i think i'll go with one. happy birthday to me!update: i just picked up the firestorm and it looks great. my wallet isn't so happy about the fact that flintlocks require a whole range of dedicated accessories and cleaning tools, but i think it's cool. it's a modern flintlock, but to me it's still a great tribute.

ammunition accountability act?





this is the first i've heard of this. and i can't believe this!that's why the fact that the assembly has bought into a national crusade known as the ammunition accountability act is suddenly a legitimate threat. new york, pennsylvania and 16 other states have already enacted legislation that would mandate the engraving of a unique serial number on the base of each handgun and “assault weapon” bullet, and an identical number on the cartridge's case. the act calls for dealers of this “encoded ammunition” to record the purchaser's name, birthdate, drivers license number, etc.all non-encoded ammunition must be disposed of prior to jan. 1, 2011. the database and other expenses involved would be paid for by a special tax of a half-cent per round of ammunition sold.http://www.theithacajournal.com/article/20081204/sports/812040369folks, we gotta get together and do something about this. i can't even begin to think of how this would affect us. i'm a shooter and a reloader. this is totally bullshit!
