time for an upgrade





after using the dexcom sts system since september.   i have loved it the whole time.  i trust it totally.   i have decided to buy the dexcom 7 system.  this is motivated by a couple of factors.  1. the sts sensors have gone up to 60 dollars each.  that is 300 bucks for a box of 5 sensors.  ouch.    2.   the dexcom 7 system is actually onsale this month.  for the month of march is is 295.00 for the dexcom starter kit.   so for the price of 535.  i am getting the dexcom 7 system and a box of 4 sensors.  much better then the 695.  i was originally quoted.  i called the rep this afternoon with the credit card info and the system should be here on thursday.   that is awesome.   i have a ton of crud to do this week.  the girl scout cookies arrive on thursday also.  i have the option of getting training on the dexcom 7 from a cde.  the question is do i really need it or not.   well, i am going to go out and feed the critters.   i promise to post later this week.

okay need some electronics help here





i know two posts within minutes of each other.   okay, i am buying my mom a television.   we know it is going to be a 32 inch lcd model.  the challenge and question i have for everyone are which ones do you recommend or not recommend.  we are looking at consumerreports.com.  i can get a pretty good deal on two of the highest rated ones.  the sony  http://www.amazon.com/sony-bravia-kdl-32s3000-720p-hdtv/dp/b000p6r6cy/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=utf8&s=electronics&qid=1202191589&sr=8-1, samsung http://www.amazon.com/samsung-lnt3242h-32-lcd-hdtv/dp/b000n4z3tq/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&s=electronics&qid=1202191694&sr=1-1.   the third option is the cheap option.viziohttp://www.amazon.com/vizio-vx32l-lcd-hd-tv/dp/b000rok6lc/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&s=electronics&qid=1202191838&sr=1-3    i just have no clue and don't want to give mom a cheap crappy tv.   if you have any comments please let me know.   i know if i give mom the option she will probably stick with the vizio.  i am debating the sony but don't like that it looses in the viewing angle category.  the vizio is ratted pretty much very good across the board except for sound and remote.  not sure that either are important to mom.

it's susserific.





    okay,  i recieved my sussy a few days ago.  actually i am bad it was almost a week ago.   i have just been super busy and not feeling great.  the sussy did really help to lift me up on that day.  i can't wait to read the book.   the bag balm is great for dry hands.  last but not least the sugar free lifesavers are delicious.   i loved the decorations on the outside of the box.  it included goofy my favorite disney character.   i kind of take after him i think.  this sussy came from sarah in chicago.  i lost the card with her code name on it.  so sarah i hope you see this and i am sorry i took so long to post about it.    i can't wait to read the book that was included.   i first need to finish the library books.    i just want to also say thank you to beth and amelia for organizing the sussy exchange.

a few quick updates





well i ordered the kitchen aid stand mixer from kohls.   in the end it ended up costing me about  168.70.   i paid for a 30% off coupon on ebay.   i am actually very happy with the price.  the mixer should be arriving here tomorrow.   then the same day i ordered my mixer my printer decided to die.  it was making odd noises all along.  i had 1.5 packages of ink for old printer. i decided i would take the unopen package back to staples.   this credit gave me another 42.50 to work with on the printer purchase.  i had decided to stick with an hp printer since i have been very happy with them.  staples had one for 80 dollars.   well with the staples rewards check, two cash cards, and credit for returning the ink.  opps forgot the 9.00, i got for returning ink cartridges.   the printer cost me a total of 8.50.  that is because i added a 2 year replacement warranty onto the printer/copier/scanner.  the man behind me in line said you can't beat that.  we then went over to walmart.  i got the blood ketone strips they ordered for me.  also picked up other stuff and pictures.  dropped off 3 video tapes to be turned into dvd's for an upcoming birthday.   soon i will be inundated in girl scout cookie crud.  well, i need to run gotta train the cookie moms on the new online program.  it seems very easy.

a question for everyone





okay, we are thinking of getting one of those stand mixers.  we have pretty much narrowed it down to either sunbeam or kitchen aid.   the price difference is dramatic in these two.  the question is if you own either one of these stand mixers what do you like or hate about it.   the sunbeam that we are considering is this model. http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=2593950  the kitchen aid. http://www.kohls.com/kohlsstore/kitchendining/bestsellers/prd~32685/kithttp://www.kohls.com/kohlsstore/kitchendining/kitchenelectrics/mixers/stand/prd~25941/kitchenaid+classic+plus+45qt+stand+mixer.jsp or this one depending on if we can find someone with a 30 % off coupon.or this onehttp://www.kohls.com/kohlsstore/kitchendining/kitchenelectrics/mixers/stand/prd~25941/kitchenaid+artisan+5qt+stand+mixer.jsp.   thanks for your help

another batch of quick updates.  okay, i haven't posted here in a long time so maybe we will go to bullets for the highlights of what happened this year.in february we got a new puppy.   her name is lilly and she is a great rather nutty addition to the looney bin.march, was a hectic month.  my brother got married and we gave away jack the goat.april, not much went on in april basically the last of the goats arrived.  it was born on easter sunday.may, started out bad but penny lived and is back at home doing great.june, i got to go to a book signing.   school ended.  a rather slow month.july,  i went to florida for friends for life.august,  i decided to buy a used dexcom.september, i recieved and started using the dexcom.  i really love this machine.  i promise to post on this later.  i also ended up getting the pain pump replaced.  more on that adventure much later. october, first a1c since getting the dexcom.  i dropped a full point in 6 weeks.we also got a new critter.  sam the bull hopefully to become a steer.  we had 10 piglets born on october 7th.  we lost one piglet early on but kept 9.  we still have 4 little lets running around up in the yard.november, once again penny is worrying us.  she is anemic again.  we need to decide how to treat her.   as a family we decide to go on the steriods.  i have to say those meds make the dog feel great.  also heidi get's married.   congratulations heidi.   nervous energy over first pain pump fill since replacement.   more on that later to. december, penny's numbers are not great but the one vet thinks to give her more time and see if they work their magic.   penny is doing much better with her hips.   go for another a1c and actually went down.  i love the dexcom.i have included a picture of penny on the top in her yankees shirt.   we still love the yankees and have hope for next year.  the second picture is of lilly.  she had a great christmas and birthday.  she just needs to learn to be nicer to her sister penny.   lilly is also learning to love the gator like her older sister penny.  the both see the work clothes come out and all hell breaks loose.   well i need to get back to worrying about penny's latest round of blood work.   i am making a late new year's resolution.  to try to keep updating my blog.  at least once monthly.  this is you january update.  also another amazing factoid.  i have purchased my airline tickets for the summer already.  well, i need to read more of my book before the pup decides to eat it.  oh and once again thank you all for you support when penny was so sick.  i figure with all the more on that laters, i have a bunch of posts.
