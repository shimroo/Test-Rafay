preparing students for success!
delphi academy of florida is a highly personalized, student-centered and competency-based school program. we focus on mastery of the basics for a solid academic foundation while encouraging and fostering creativity, innovation, collaboration and leadership skills.
everything we do at delphi is designed to allow students to explore their potential, give them tools they need to succeed, gain confidence in their ability to tackle anything they desire and encourage them to follow their dreams.










 










delphi summer camp!
we are bursting with excitement for this year’s summer camp! all kids need to have fun, learn and thrive in the summer. they need a safe place to play, to make friends and experience new things. that’s what we do and we’re ready to give them their best summer ever!



save my spot!





 



empowering students for life!



 






hands-on learning
nearly half the school day is filled with “hands-on learning” activities. there are field trips and exploration at the lower end, hands-on projects at every level, and apprenticeships at the upper end. additionally, steam (science, technology, engineering, art & mathematics) classes nurture critical thinking, innovation and creativity.
one of the best things about our approach is that we make learning fun! as a result, our students not only excel in school but they become lifelong learners. in today’s rapidly changing world, this is one of the most important gifts we can give them.

"i am so grateful because i know my daughter is the best version of herself, and what happens at delphi with these students is just the stuff of a parent’s dreams for their child."
delphi parent













 






mastery of the basics
literacy is an important component in the delphi program. we teach students how to read extremely well at a young age and then continue our rich literature program all the way through high school. our students gain knowledge and a love of reading. the ability to write and communicate effectively improves dramatically. we extend this approach to other fields as well, such as mathematics and technology, since fluency and competence in any subject depend wholly on a mastery of the language involved. to open doors in a world that depends on high levels of communication, information, and technology, we emphasize literacy.
by broadening the traditional concept of the basics (reading, writing, and arithmetic) to include study, communication, research and reasoning skills, we give our students the essential building blocks they’ll need for lifelong learning.

"since coming to delphi, all three of my children have thrived, both academically and socially. they are getting an excellent foundation for their futures."
delphi parent












 






nurture creativity
creativity comes in many forms and we view it as an integral part of an excellent education. our beautiful art room, dance room, music room and woodshop are bustling with activity each afternoon. you will often find the younger children planting and tending the lower school garden or creating something in the lower school science room. older students have a wide choice of electives that are geared toward their individual interests such as art, pottery, performing arts, computer coding, cooking, fitness, sports and more!

physical education & sports
physical education and sports play a key role at delphi. younger students have daily p.e. classes with specialized coaches where they develop physical skills, learn good sportsmanship, team building and, of course, have fun! we feel that young children need organized play times to balance out all they are learning in a typical school day.
older students are involved in fitness classes and competitive team sports. delphi views sports as an opportunity for students to develop self discipline, self-confidence, leadership skills and a practical understanding of how to work as a team in the accomplishment of a mutual goal.
