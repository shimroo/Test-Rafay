zotac id81 remote with libreelec 9.2.2







 





wednesday 15 april 2020 - 14:20
nemesis







upgrading from openelec 7.0.1 to libreelec 9.2.2, i found many of the buttons on my remote – namely the "windows" and teletext buttons – no longer worked.  it's an external remote & usb receiver combo that's bundled with many zotac mini pcs, like the id81.
the receiver reports as a philips mce usb ir receiver- spinel plus (device id 0471:20cc).

openwrt on a belkin wemo - the hard way

if you're stuck with a belkin wemo where you had unfortunately upgraded the firmware, alas, the only way i've found to get openwrt running on it is to break out the soldering iron. unless another vulnerability is found...  if you're running firmware version wemo_ww_2.00.2176.pvt or lower, check out the easy way.

openwrt on a belkin wemo - the easy way

vulnerabilities aside, the firmware (even the latest version) on the belkin wemo is just plain flaky. i've had multiple issues where the device appears to just "hang", flashing an orange error light if it temporarily loses its wireless connection (which seems to be around once a week).  fed up, i decided it was time to grant them a new lease of life, by reflashing them with openwrt.

showing the user agent in the drupal 8 dblog

if you've just done a site restructure or migration to drupal 8, you will inevitably need to redirect pages from your old url scheme to however you've structured the new site.  in drupal 8, the easiest way is to monitor the database log, filtered with "page not found".
many of these hits however will come from bots scanning your site.  but to tell whether it's a random bot, google, or likely to be a real user, we need to inspect the user-agent header.  this means digging into your log files.  wouldn't it be more convenient if you had a quick & easy way to see these details?

upgrade lumia 530 to windows 10

i've got a cheap lumia 530 i use as my dev phone.  having recently upgraded my daily driver lumia 925 to windows 10, it was time to upgrade my dev phone too.
the lumia 530 isn't officially supported anymore — and probably never will be.  regardless, it's still possible to run w10m 10586.164 on your lumia 530!

pushing agendas with statistics

there's currently an infographic being shared around on facebook, created by the australia institute, a misleadingly named political lobby group.  it's a great example about how careful selection of statistics, combined with social media, can be an effective way to push an agenda (whether political or otherwise).
