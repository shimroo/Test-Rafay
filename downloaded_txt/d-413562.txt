an update from merrimack valley oral surgeons
 
with our continued monitoring of the covid-19 virus, we have made the decision to postpone all non-essential care for the next few weeks, and re-evaluate our plan as more data is released from the cdc and department of health.
however, we will remain open to treat patients with acute care issues (e.g. emergencies). in addition, we have shortened our hours.
