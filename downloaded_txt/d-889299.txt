as i wrote in previous reviews, this zobaline cured my diabetic cat's neuropathy in his back legs at the onset of his diabetes. however, the new form of the pills, wider and flatter, are very difficult for my cat to swallow and he often chokes on them. please go back to the previous shaped pill or i will have to buy elsewhere. as you can see in the picture, my cat is not happy with them neither !

i give this to my cat daily for her neuropathy. she's had diabetes for almost a year. i'm hoping once her numbers are regulated that the zobaline will work its magic!

it really helps my cat who has pancreatitis to maintain his weight as his body can now absorb the nutrients from his food. he is no longer scrawny like before when he was first diagnosed with the condition. lifelink’s zobaline is a life saver for him! he has been fine for 7 yrs now ever since he was on zobaline. and it’s a lot cheaper to buy it direct from lifelink compared to the price on amazon.

this was recommended by my doctor to take along with the thyroid supplement i take every morning. produced in the adrenals, it's the master hormone regulator in the body and we produce less of it as we age. i am 76. i take one every morning along with my thyroid supplement and 1 cardio-peptase, also from life link. my energy levels are smoother and i have more stamina throughout the day.

my doctor recommended this to me a few years ago. it's the enzyme that eats up arterial plaque, which is administered in large doses to stroke victims. i take one every morning to prevent arterial plaque build up and thereby lower the risk of stroke.

according to my doctor, orotate is the most bio-available form of magnesium and it's hard to find. i've been taking this product morning and evening for years for improved sleep and blood circulation.
