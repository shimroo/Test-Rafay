welcome!my music’ingmy writingmy travelswhere to find me








hi! i’m adam, and i’m happy you’re visiting

about my work
i’m known for warmly ‘herding cats’… particularly designing and managing complex programs and online communities. 
as of may 2024, i’m excited to be dipping my toes back into startupland — leading community programs for udio — following a 17-year adventure at google across search, maps imagery, travel, and health!
some of my past work includes serving as google’s first international “search evangelist”, spinning up customer care programs for multiple products, advising b2c startups in music & productivity and other areas, and co-founding the boston branch of a german consulting firm. [see my linkedin profile for additional scintillating details]
about my personal interests

arts:  i love making and listening to music (sample below) and have also been involved in many musical theater productions.
tech:  i’m always learning about and trying out all sorts of tech, particularly tools which help connect and delight people.
travel:  i’ve had a wonderful time visiting and photographing many places around the world, in part thanks to my points-and-miles hobby (and yes, i still need to organize and host my pics after the demise of google+ photos!)
fitness:  i like being physical active; i spent many years lindy hopping (swing dancing) and nowadays enjoy gym classes, walks with friends, and rhythm/fitness games on the meta quest.
