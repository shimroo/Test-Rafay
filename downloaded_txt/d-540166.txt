logan's run parallel








the recent lay-offs in jfj seem like the old movie logan's run.  younger people are replacing the older ones.  are individuals really of no use after 30 or 40 or 50?

used for jesus - true stories by those who worked for jews for jesus





in 2002, a book of stories written by those who once worked for jews for jesus was put together, but never was published. this is the draft of that book. these stories need to be recorded somewhere. those who once worked for jews for jesus hope that the organization has changed.

jews for jesus operated just like a cult

anthrodepravity systematic theology (or, sayings from chairman moishe)





anthrodepravity systematic theology (or, sayings from chairman moishe).


only apostles can have discretion ...(with him included of course.)

regeneration is acknowledged only as a word in the dictionary. 
hate nice
 guys! 
anything mentioned about human selfishness in the bible is true 
and should be amplified,  expounded upon, and stressed.  
all mention (in the bible or elsewhere) of human nobility, commitment, honor, and courage is to be 
regarded as interesting prose to be laughed at. 
conditional 
sanctification is a fallacy but can be simulated by exacting rules. 

people choosing well without close supervision theologically, 
doctrinally, and in all management philosophy is to be disregarded. 

indoctrination, fear, and rewards are the only dependable motivational 
tools. 
in summary:  all people are excrement, just some are runnier than 
others.

an open letter to david brickner and the jews for jesus board of directors:

 

many
 ex-jfj workers have wounds still not healed from their time with your 
organization. you can help. here is how. please contact these people and
 apologize for what might have happened to them under previous leadership. 
you can help them, and make all negative accusations less true. you 
don't have legal repercussions for hypothetical wrongs, your claims that
 things are improving would be more credible, and many will learn from the alleged wrongdoings of the past and privately repent of them. and many 
of us will shut up.

rambling thoughts about jews for jesus and ex-jews for jesus





this ex-jews for jesus blog has been around for awhile.  it has been set so that all posts are anonymous.  writing styles are easy to figure out though.  although this post is anonymous, i imagine many who read this blog know who wrote many of the posts, and can identify the writer of this one.   there's a history of how ex-jews for jesus came about.   to sum things up, many who left jews for jesus staff, felt hurt.  it wasn't until the internet connected us that we even knew others had been hurt.  most of us had just moved on.  the hurt stayed with some.  having some sort of support was what some of us needed.  i was convinced god wanted this blog, the ex-jewsforjesus yahoo group, and the used for jesus site.  although these "places" are kind of "dead," i still believe that they did (and may still) serve a purpose.

imagine david brickner talking about what's happening with jews for jesus





we can imagine david brickner talking to the lord about recent jews for jesus happenings:'lord, you gave us instructions not to sue other believers. chosen people ministries is not a believer, it is a corporation.what about marcello you ask? lord, you gave us the names of your children who supported us. those people now belong to us, not to anyone else. remember we asked you to intervene and you didn't, so rather than get taken advantage of, we had to sue.oh, you mean what about firing him? come on lord, he broke the rules. we asked you to give us wisdom and we felt you tell us to fire him. i know he didn't sign the covenant, but we told him we didn't care if he signed it, we were going to enforce it, don't bother us with details. come on lord, why are you brining grace into this, it doesn't apply.what about my staying on the job after patti divorced me after i required others to resign? well lord, when i realized patti was going to leave me, i saw the need for jews for jesus to show some grace to people, so i had the rules changed. you understand that, right?what, what did you just say, "depart from me for i knew you not?" but lord...lord...'

we are gathering information for a book about jews for jesus - how did jews for jesus affect your life?





a book is going to be published as an anthropological study on how jews for jesus affected the lives of people who worked for the organization.real names will be used only if individuals want their names used.if you ever were employed by jews for jesus, how was your life affected?  did you have trouble adjusting to life outside of that ministry?  was your faith affected?in addition, we are interested in hearing from the children of those who were employed by jews for jesus.  did your parents' commitment to the group affect you?  did jews for jesus have a positive or negative impact on your life?we'd also like to hear from people who had positive experiences with jews for jesus.  it would be great to hear from people still working there, in fact.if you would like to share your story, feel free to comment on this post.  if you wish to respond anonymously, that is fine.

so much sadness in jews for jesus





in the spring of 2010, moishe rosen died.shortly after that, it was then announced that jews for jesus' executive director, david brickner, is getting a divorce.in 2008, baruch goldstein, one of of the jews for jesus founders, passed away.now we've heard that holly meyer, the wife of jews for jesus los angeles' branch leader, stan meyer, is very, very ill with a horrible progressive illness that leads to a slow death.today, we are thinking about ceil rosen, ruth rosen, lyn rosen bond, (and moishe's grandchildren), patti brickner (and david and patti's children), baruch goldstein's widow, his children, and his brother efraim goldstein.also, our prayers are with holly and stan meyer and their adopted daughter.although some of us involved in ex jews for jesus remember things about jews for jesus that may be unpleasant, we do remember that those in jews for jesus once were our family.

happy hannukah - light one candle!





some of the lyrics below hit home for those involved with ex jews for jesus.  some of us are "still suffering," but we do not wish for "anger to tear us apart."like martin luther king jr., we once had a dream that we could could all fellowship together.  most of us believe now that true reconciliation could never happen; however, we don't want what we believed in doing when we served with jews for jesus to die.happy hannukah and don't let the light go out!--------------------------------------light one candle peter yarrow- ©1983 silver dawn music ascap light one candle for the maccabee children                with thanks that their light didn't die                light one candle for the pain they endured                when their right to exist was denied                light one candle for the terrible sacrifice                justice and freedom demand                but light one candle for the wisdom to know                when the peacemaker's time is at hand chorus: don't let the light go out! it's lasted for so many years! don't let the light go out! let it shine through our love and our tears. light one candle for the strength that we need                to never become our own foe                and light one candle for those who are suffering                pain we learned so long ago                light one candle for all we believe in                that anger not tear us apart                and light one candle to find us together                with peace as the song in our hearts (chorus) what is the memory that's valued so highly                that we keep it alive in that flame?                what's the commitment to those who have died                that we cry out they've not died in vain?                we have come this far always believing                that justice would somehow prevail                this is the burden, this is the promise                this is why we will not fail! (chorus) don't let the light go out!                don't let the light go out!                don't let the light go out!

star wars parody: the ex-jfj vs jews for jesus saga resumes





(note: this parody may only make sense to those who have been involved with ex jews for jesus in the past.  can you recognize who some of the characters or places represented?)(disclaimer:  none of this is meant to hurt anyone.  it just adds some humor to something that is actually very serious.  ex jews for jesus' purpose is to support those who have been hurt.  laughing once in awhile is needed!)the ex-jfj vs jews for jesus saga resumesthe times of peril in the galaxy continue....jabba the mo has dieddarth b's marriage has endedthe borg queen temporary took the thronebut some of the clone generals decided that darth b should continue to control the empiredarth b's queen has fled, but his offspring are still involved with the empirethe empire may be crumblingfor many years, most of the rebels were in hidinga remnant of the destroyed rebel base did remainthey are now leaving their hiding placesa new and secret base now existsthe spell darth b and his queen put on the princess has been brokenthe princess and her banished first advisor have reunited and joined forcessome of rebel soldiers are waiting....the saga resumes!

jews for jesus is being sued by one of its former missionaries





marcello araujo was once jews for jesus missionary.  he was fired in 2005 for allegedly violating the workers covenant.  why was he dismissed?  he got married without jfj's permission!apparently, araujo never signed the workers covenant since he thought it was "cultish."  he is now suing jews for jesus for wrongful dismissal.lawsuit pits one messianic jewish group against another - from canada's the globe and mailevangelical group, ex-missionary suing - from arca max publishing religious newsmissionary sues jews for jesus - from the rosh pina projectjews for jesus workers covenant - (not the most recent copy)

divorce doesn't matter in jews for jesus?





the jews for jesus workers covenant used to say that that vocational staff could not stay on jews for jesus staff if divorce occurred.  it didn't matter who was at fault.  the person had to resign.not anymore.david brickner is staying on as executive director of jews for jesus anyway.we've learned that some of jews for jesus' staff have left the organization because of this decision.  they say they can no longer support the organization's leadership.moishe rosen would have probably insisted that david resign.has jews for jesus credibility changed in your eyes because of this decision?
