welcome to talmudic university
since 1974, talmudic university has set the standard for the south florida jewish community’s education. with a world-class yeshiva and kollel, talmudic university provides classes, lectures, and study groups to hundreds of community members of all ages and levels of jewish affiliation.
the yeshiva is under the leadership of harav yochanan zweig, a scholar nationally renowned for his ingenious originality in jewish thought and his lucid presentations of the most complex talmudic treatises. with an ambitious focus on increasing jewish learning and literacy from miami to the palm beaches, talmudic university is creating the future of torah in florida today!
