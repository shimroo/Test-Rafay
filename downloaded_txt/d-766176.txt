  #womenofascend meet rachel lovell, vice president of talent acquisition and retention at ascend.

with 18 years in transportation under her belt, it might surprise you that ascend has been rachel's one and only job. she started in 2006 as a dispatcher in the local division, all thanks to the suggestion from her uncle, who was an lrs driver at the time. as a single mom finding her way, ascend became her home sweet home.

when asked about her favorite memory at ascend, rachel pointed to clinching the "recruiting professional 2018" award! 🏆 the chance to embody the spirit of the entire team overwhelmed her. rachel emphasized how the collective hard work, teamwork, and sacrifices of every employee truly shaped the outcome.

rachel's journey is a testament to seizing opportunities and making them count!

  see the world clearly this eye health month! 👀 protect your vision, protect your future. ascend offers our employees and their families vision insurance, setting standards and leading the industry in coverage. #eyehealth

one of the most important pieces of equipment a cdl-a driver can invest in is a quality pair of uv-blocking sunglasses.🕶️ this will protect your eyes from uv damage and reduce the overall strain on your eyes.

additionally, once you put your truck in park for the night, it’s essential to give your eyes a break and avoid activities that could put further stress on your eyes, like staring at a bright phone or computer screen for too long or reading in low light.

  #womenofascend: meet shelby whitt, our new retention manager at ascend.

shelby brings a decade of experience in store operations and retail management from lowe's home improvement. her decision to join ascend was driven by her intrigue with the complexity of the transportation industry and the alignment of ascend's values with her personal ethos, particularly the emphasis on "building trust."

in just a short time with ascend, shelby says her quality of life has changed immensely. the chance to spend time with her loved ones, a core value for her as a family-oriented person, has brought about significant positive changes.

thank you shelby for being part of the #womenofascend and welcome to the team!

  winter cold temperatures, inclement weather, and icy roads all present driving challenges. to stay safe on the roads, truck drivers should equip themselves with winter essentials like ice scrapers, blankets, snow boots, extra food and water, and chains for their tires.

so stay safe, stay warm and make sure you have all the winter essentials you need for your trips!

➡️ 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐒𝐚𝐟𝐞 is more than just knowing about what is safe but taking the time to analyze a situation and choosing the safest option.
➡️ 𝐁𝐞 𝐒𝐚𝐟𝐞 is continuing to choose the safest option. analyze a situation and make the right choice.

  ⚠️august safety message⚠️ 
no texting while driving for commercial motor vehicle drivers. hands-free calls only! 📵 remember, safety is non-negotiable.

drivers should only text, email, or use a hand-held mobile phone when safely parked on the side or off the road. when driving, they can use a mobile phone for calls if it's hands-free, requires just one button press, and doesn't require risky maneuvers. emergency situations are the only exception.
