										our democracy is a sacred institution, and it’s critical that we do the hard work to nurture and protect it. too often we govern by crisis instead of by leadership. meridian institute understands the importance of collective leadership when it comes to addressing the challenging issues of our time. they create safe, productive spaces for dialogue, problem solving, and action. this is essential if we are to preserve the essence of our democracy.
