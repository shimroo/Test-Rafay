how i personally bought 17 million dollars in real estate during my first three years as an investor.
how i took a student and coached him into buying 2.3 million dollars of real estate in 5 hours.... with an average home price of $150,000. we shot it on video and he did it from my home office, on the phone, without using any money for down payments or using his credit.
how i took a room with 48 newbie real estate investors and within 3 hours showed them how to buy houses using nothing but a cell phone and the classified ads in the paper? after the 3 hours was up, they got on the phone and within an hour and a half bought 98 houses.
how i use the internet and computer technology to completely automate my business and put all the drudge work on autopilot.

how i built a huge list of real estate investors who i can send an email to and sell most of my flip houses in about 20 minutes.
what to say to make offers to home sellers that 1. will make you money and 2. that will be accepted by the seller almost every time.

"it took 3 weeks to do my first deal. i found a $125,000 house for $68,000 using joe's techniques and flipped it and made $10,000 cash before it closed. i did this in a few short days. the deal between the buyer and seller had not closed when i made my money... i got it up front from the buyer."

âi just put another $5,000 in my pocket with 
about 3 hours work.â
"iâve got to admit, i thought this joe crump was just another get-rich-quick scam... iâve seen these guys before... but i just put another $5,000 in my pocket with about 3 hours work. all i did was implement what he told me to do at the last event. now iâve got 7 more deals cooking that should close over the next few weeks. my wife and i are quitting our jobs to stay home with the kids and "play" with real estate full time starting next month!"
