            geodes was established in 1992 with only a 12 pound rock tumbler and has grown to be one

            finished mineral specimens, carvings, agate ends, small and large decorator pieces, and
            polished phantom crystals. some of our inventory includes rough slabs, 
            rough rocks, rough turquoise nuggets, frosted selenite clusters, pyrite specimens, tumbled stones,  thick and thin slabs, mexican and australian opal
            rough, lapidary equipment (new and used), fossils, spheres , books and magazines. we sell by the piece
            or by the barrel, depending on your needs. we have mine-direct contacts in brazil and
            mexico, as well as contacts with many dealers who own their own mines. products can be
            ordered by e-mail,  phone, or secure shopping cart, with payment by cash, check,
            money order, visa, or mastercard.
