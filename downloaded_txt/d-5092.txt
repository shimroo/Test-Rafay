in galileo’s trail

marco meniero from civitavecchia, italy
galileo galilei was born on feb. 15, 1564 in the city of pisa, which is also the location of this mural by the brazilian street artist eduardo kobra. the photographer used a nikon mirrorless camera and 14–24mm lens to capture this scene; the star trails in this image were imaged over 1,100 three-second subframes at f/5 and iso 200, comprising 55 minutes of exposure.
