what our students saytestimonials


hi chef ernie,
i loved class, as i think you already knew hahaha! i really liked your teaching style, and that soup was delicious. maddie was a great teacher, too! i sliced a tomato today with my newly sharpened knife and it was so easy; no more fighting with the tomato skin!




 leah





i’ve had two experiences with chef ryan so far, and i think he’s not only very knowledgeable, but he is very friendly and funny.
as for specifically the yuzu class, i took the yuzu class because i had heard it’s a citrus fruit from japan, but i have not tasted it before. that is the main reason i took it.
i liked that he gave us tips about making salmon as to how to figure out exactly when flip it or when it’s done. (cooking time is hardly every correct as there are different sized portions of every protein). so visual or texture/feel tips are really what i take away.



 ro





this place was great! we learned to make mediterranean dishes, the chef was amazing and her food tasted great.  easy, simple to make at home recipes
