since its founding in 1910, dunbar is proof that authentic design expressed with craft is an honest guide through time. 
dunbar's relationship with edward j wormley spanned over three decades and produced one of the most relevant and
enduring contemporary design archives in history. the archive is not only a library of proven designs but a source of inspiration.
