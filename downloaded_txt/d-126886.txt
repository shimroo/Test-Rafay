i also used chris and his team for my parents when they arrived. they were beyond happy with the service. again, a very friendly and chatty driver, and he also brought their luggage in to the hotel for them. they were extremely appreciative of this, and this extra level of service makes them stand out from the crowd. i can guarantee that i will be using them again and again and again in the future! laura vdw: september 10 2021 i have used this company for years, which speaks for itself. i usually travel alone, and like the security of having transport directly to my accommodation, especially late at night (although prague is a pretty safe city). prague airport shuttle has friendly and helpful english-speaking drivers and provides a reliable and efficient service which i would thoroughly recommend. deborah robinson: june 29, 2022      we used chris and prague airport shuttle for a transfer from passau to prague after a viking river cruise.  chris was very easy to communicate with via email.  we elected to pay in advance by credit card.  chris informed us the day before that our driver would be david.  david was right on time, and actually came right onto the ship to help us with our luggage.  we had an enjoyable drive to prague.  we would have used them for a ride to the airport, but our transfer was provided by the hotel. i would not hesitate to use prague airport shuttle again.  great service! kim kindel: passau to prague transfer   prices  book your private prague airport transfer in 2 minutes - no credit card requiredwe speak english; we drive clean, late model fully insured cars and provide great western style service.we will be waiting for you no matter how late your flight might be, at no extra charge.unlike cheaper companies we will never make you share.up to four passengers for one fixed price to prague centergbp 27.00 eur 33.00 usd 35.00 czk 800.00(up to 3 passengers plus 3 standard suitcases (23kg max) or 4 passengers plus hand luggage. saloon car) 5 - 7 passengers for one fixed price to prague centergbp 37.00 eur 44.00 usd 48.00 czk 1100.00(up to 7 passengers plus 7 standard suitcases (23kg max) plus hand luggage. minibus)we also have 12, 20, 29 and 50 seat buses and vans, please contact us with your requirements       services airport transfersjust by yourself or need a bus?
