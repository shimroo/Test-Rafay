statewide rankings: week 10


dragonfire posted a topic in ky boys basketball (high school), thursday at 04:41  pm

*still no ranks from bluegrass scoreboard.  guess they didn't get the engagement they wanted, and dropped it.

*st. x still consensus #1 in all polls with all first place votes.  two road games next week at jeffersontown and north oldham may present some challenge, but it looks like st. x is going to remain in this position through the end, and may not lose to a kentucky team this year.  

*great crossing was back to a consensus #2 and frederick douglass a consensus #3 as ksr flip flopped them back.  no other team was conensus top 5.

*danville christian and hazard join the above three as consensus top 10 teams.  bryan station was rated in the top 6 of three polls, but my personal "favorite" kentucky high school sports zone dropped them all the way to 10th. green county was also denied by kyhsz, who had them 17th while the other three had them top 10.

*kentucky high school sports zone continues to be the only one to rank boyd county - though they did drop them to 10th despite no losses, which was... odd.

*there are eight unicorns this week (a team that was rated by only a single outlet).  boyd county continues to be the weirdest of those.  as with last week, ksr continues to be the only one to believe in prp (#14).  additionally, we have south oldham (ne 19), trinity (kyhsz 20), simon kenton (ne 21), henderson county (ksr 21), south laurel (kyhsz 24), and lexington catholic (kyhsz 25).

*nations elite seemed unusually harsh and overreactive to some results.  that marshall county loss induced them to drop the marshals from 5th to 14th, the only outlet to have the marshals out of the top 10.  warren central was dumped 12 spots from 11th to 23rd after losing to butler county, and likely would have fallen out altogether if they'd lost to bowling green.  

*kyhsz had adair county up to 4th this week.  i'm curious to see how far they drop after losing to warren central on tuesday.  no other outlet had adair above 10th.  

*17 teams were consensus rated this week (down from 20 last week)

nky girls basketball top 10 (week of 2/10/25)


the double deuce posted a topic in ky girls basketball (high school), february 9

was a terrific week in nky, with a slew of great games, and a lot of clarity on who and what as we end the season.  for the 9th, at least for me, it looks like two contenders, three "could win it with a bounce or two", and then likely 3 "happy to make it to nku" (although newcath is playing much better, and after yesterday, i guess you never know).  sklp would be #1 if not for that ot home loss to cooper, but they look like they are the clear favorites in the 8th region.  

notre dame settled the debate in the 35th, at least for now, and if sophia stays healthy they look like the best threat to cooper to win the 9th.  she is such a difference-maker this year!  holy cross comes off the narrow road win at newcath yesterday with three brutal games this week, so if nothing else, they'll be "battled tested" as they enter the post-season.  dixie dropped two games to ohio teams before picking up a win yesterday.  brossart and newcath appear to be coming together, scott appears to be sliding back a little, and campbell county is impossible to predict from one day to the next (as is often the case with a team is so perimeter-oriented).  in ryle's case below, i'm factoring in the sad news that they have lost jaelyn jones for a few games.

this week has some interesting games, beyond holy cross' gauntlet, with cooper playing dixie, sk getting sacred heart in independence, notre dame getting state #2 grc, and campbell county and dixie tangling in edgewood.  should make for a great week!

statewide rankings: week 8


dragonfire posted a topic in ky boys basketball (high school), january 29

*as usual, st. x is a consensus #1 across the board.  great crossing and frederick douglass continue as consensus #2 & #3.  bryan station moved back up to 4th in a majority of polls, in contrast with last week where they were #4 by average but rated as such in only one poll.  they are a consensus top 5 team.

*14 teams were consensus rated (down from 18 last week):

st. xavier
great crossing
frederick douglass
bryan station
marshall county
warren central
hazard
manual
covington catholic
danville christian
green county
ashland
george rogers clark
calloway county

*for the first time this year, the unicorn love is really spread around.  usually, it's kyhsz that has the majority, as their rankings are frequently inexplicable.  we have four unicorns this week (a team that was rated by only a single outlet).  cooper graduates from this status as they are up to four oulets, as does newport which were rated by nations elite in addition to kyhsz this time.  boyd county (kyhsz 18) continues to be a team that is only loved by kyhsz.  the others are north oldham (ne 22), jeffersontown (ksr 23), and north bullitt (media 24), with north bullitt remaining a unicorn from last week by the same source.  clay county falls out of the ranks entirely this week.

nky girls basketball top 10 (week of 12/30/24)


the double deuce posted a topic in ky girls basketball (high school), december 30, 2024

happy new year to all of our girls' basketball players, families, coaches, administrators, and fans, i hope you have a safe ending to 2024 and a safe and prosperous 2025.  been a great year for several of our local teams, and i hope 2025 brings just as much joy, hardware, and laughs along the way.  thanks for all you do to develop our young ladies and provide so much enjoyment to gyms' full of fans and families rooting like crazy.  

things are a little muddy at the top as we try and slice and dice the results that have happened, and forecast who can do what moving forward.  holy cross had a big week winning the berea holiday classic, as well as their ot win vs brossart at thomas more.  cooper started off this week with a monster win versus franklin-simpson and defending their queen of the commonwealth cup title, the biggest invitational in the state each year.  i'm not sure if brossart losing twice to holy cross so closely (once in ot) says more about holy cross, or brossart, to be honest.  cooper's win over f-s is the best win of the year for the area, but they have the 12 point loss to holy cross (which i'm not sure could be replicated, but we won't find out until nku at the earliest).  cooper also gets credit for playing a massive schedule, like qcc, and then playing purcell marian over the weekend, and then getting sacred heart this week (i believe sk and hc also play the valkyries this year).  simon kenton looks like that team knocking on the door to the top of the ranking as they continue to get better and better.  going to be a fun rest of the year!

bluegrasspreps.com mr. football watchlist (12/10)


devilmaycare posted a topic in ky football (high school), december 10, 2024

state final headlines
• hodge completes unique legacy
• coffman takes the ram by the horns 
• atwell reaches milestone, but fails again to grab brass ring 


first team all-watchlist
connor hodge (christian academy of louisville, ath)

good things come in threes, so they say. i'm sure hodge would agree after doubling up union county on the scoreboard to seal cal's third consecutive state championship. 

he masterfully mixed passing and running to the tune of 362 total yards (225 passing/137 rushing) and all six centurion touchdowns. 

for a brief career retrospective, he's started both ways for three consecutive state championship teams and excelled at three different positions. hodge aggressively grew into his role at quarterback in his first year on the job after being all-state at defensive back and all-state worthy at receiver as a junior. he simultaneously led the state in receptions and interceptions in 2023 before sliding to quarterback and leading the state in total offense.

the depth and reach of that career arc is unmatched by anyone else running this race. there are certain names that evoke demi-god like reverence within this state. michael bush is one of those. purely from a high school perspective, hodge to bush is a worthy comparison.

cooper received the opening kick.  the jags were stopped on downs and punted.  cooper's ryker campbell intercepted a deuce baily pass and returned it to the bowling green 12 yard line.  on the next play cam ohara hit isaiah johnson for a 12 yard touchdown pass.  the extra point was no good and the jags lead the purples 6 to 0 with 828 left in the 1st quarter.  the purples took the kickoff and marched down the field liked they own it and deuce bailey walked into the end zone from two yards out to make it 7-6 purples with 414 left in the first quarter.  jaxen smith recovered a jag fumble at the cooper 48 which led to a 41 yard fg to put bowling green up 10-6 with 927 left in the half. 

jaiden combs made one-handed touchdown catch to put cooper up 12-10 with 844 left in the half.  it was a 32 yard td pass for cam ohara and the extra point was no good.  bowling green answered with a 31 yard braden widener fg to make it 13-12 bowling green with 342 left in the half. 

bowling green started the third quarter on their own 39 yard line.  a few players later deuce bailey hit trevy barber on a 41 yard pass to the cooper 14.  on the next play, bailey ran it in to make the score bowling green 20 cooper 12, with 951 left in the 3rd. ohara ran around trying to avoid sack and lost the ball giving bg ball on the cooper 27.  the bowling green offense turned that into a 3 yard jaxen smith touchdown run to put bg up 27-13 with 501 left in the 3rd. 

with 840 left in the game, deuce bailey ran it in from 6 yards out to make the score 34-12 bowling green.  cooper answered with a 22 yard td pass from cam ohara to austin alexander.  the two also hooked up on the two point conversion to make it 34-20 bowling green with 729 left in the game.  another braden widener fg made it 37-20 purples with 334 left in the game. the bowling green purples are your 2024 class 5a state champions!

with 735 left in the game trinity's caleb ricks intercepted nathan verax and took it to the house for a 28-17 trinity lead. jamaurion berry scored on an 11 yard td run with 326 left in the game to give the shamrocks a 35 to 17 lead.  bailey vance added another pick six for trinity bringing the score to 42-17 rocks with 315 left in the game.  a long dylan lee run after catch set the raiders up for a late touchdown.  verax hit lorms from three yards out to make it 42 to 23 ryle with 103 left in the game.  the two point attempt was no good.   the trinity shamrocks are your 2024 class 6a state champions.

trinity vs. ryle predictions/updates (6a state championship)


devilmaycare posted a topic in ky football (high school), november 30, 2024

#1 trinity shamrocks (12-2) vs. #5 ryle raiders (12-2)

kickoff: 4pm sat, dec 7

in a whirlwind of a season for the big boys, the gold standard of kentucky high school football is back to defend a title, both in reputation and hardware. trinity has run another gauntlet of a schedule, including wins over frederick douglass (×2), male, carmel (in), st. xavier (oh), and bryan station. losses to center grove (in) and the archival tigers of st. x kept the shamrocks tethered to the parity that permeated 6a this season. and yet, here they are, 4 quarters away from state title #29. soph qb zane johnson may be the face of the program, but the backbone is a defense allowing just 9 points per game, tops in 6a and #3 statewide. they just choked the life out of douglass. that's why they're here.

standing in their way is an old familiar face, with sights set on making history. ryle is searching for title #1, not just in the program's three decade existence, but also the 1st ever won by a nky “big school”. boone county, dixie heights, and simon kenton have all swung and missed over the years. they're also searching for their 1st win over the shamrocks in 8 tries. ryle got an up close look at the winner's circle 18 years ago, but was rebuffed by the same dynasty that blocks their path now. a running clock demolition of st. x in the region final catapulted the raiders into the role of trendy pick to end nky's futility in the largest class. jacob savage leads a fearsome defensive front, one that also includes ends dillon smith (uofl commit) and bo gay.

when the lights come on at kroger field, there will be nowhere to hide. the moment has proven too much for many a contender over the years, but there is no greater proving ground than a state championship game versus the trinity shamrocks. can ryle rise to the occasion and join bullitt east to strike another one for the rebellion, or does the evil empire further distance itself from the pack?

cooper vs. bowling green predictions/updates (5a state championship)


purple88 posted a topic in ky football (high school), november 30, 2024

5a state championship game

cooper jaguars (14-0) vs bowling green purples (12-2)

saturday december 7, 2024 at 8:00 pm at kroger field in lexington, ky


game information:

this state championship game will again (even though i think it’s unfair to keep 5a in the #6 game slot every year) be the last game of the 2024 season and will be played at the university of kentucky’s kroger field at 8 pm. 

i think cooper has earned the right to be the favorite in this game.  they really haven’t been challenged since the first highlands game and are playing better than most all teams left.  bowling green is the defending 5a state champion but has clearly had a harder time getting back to this game than the jaguars have.

this game will feature some of the best players 5a (and the state too for that matter) has to offer.  check out some key stats below:

khsaa 5a leaders:

passing leaders: 
#2 cam o’hara – cooper – 236 yards a game.
#3 deuce bailey – bowling green – 229 yards a game.

receiving leaders:
#1 travey barber – bowling green – 91 passing yards a game.
#2 isaiah johnson – cooper – 84 passing yards a game.

defensive sacks leaders:
#3 montez trussell – bowling green – 14 sacks on the year.
#7 austin alexander – cooper – 10 sacks on the year.

key questions?  which high powered offense will be the most effective?  which defense can make the big stops when it counts?  which qb will have his best game of the year?  can bg contain the d1 wrs?  can cooper slow down deuce bailey and his stable of wrs?  going to be a really good one!  really looking forward to it! 

who wins this championship game and why?
