testimonialsour clientsays:

fantastic service from the wonderful elisabeth – i have used having a ball for many years now and have loved the dresses she gets me to venture out in. she really goes the extra mile – she looks at skin tone and suitable colours and body shape and asks how i want to feel at the event and without fail – she has always found something that i feel spectacular in.
enjoy the experience and never wear the same dress twice! ❤️
