 passion is what started it all

crafting experiences for over 25 years

we started iron hill with one goal in mind: to be the best local brewery in the world. starting with homebrewed beer recipes and perfecting our craft, paired with a passion for high quality food, we’re changing the perception of the term “brewpub” one community at a time.

our story







more than just a pint and a dish, but  expertly paired

our food & beer menus are designed to complement one another, and some of our dishes are even made using beer as an ingredient. we’re excited to suggest the perfect beer pairing to enhance the flavors of your meal.

				russian imperial stout			






 
abv 9.8% ibu 75
a rich, full-bodied stout, this style of beer was originally created to survive the long voyages from england, across the baltic sea, to the russian imperial courts. our version, with strong notes of dark chocolate and espresso, is brewed with that same regal spirit – worthy enough for a tsar, and, more importantly, you.
 
awards: 2003, 2006, 2010 gabf gold medal; 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 gabf silver medal; 2012 gabf bronze medal; 2010, 2012, 2014 world beer cup gold medal; 2016 world beer cup silver medal; 2006 world beer cup bronze medal

				inkredibly juicy ipa			





abv 6.5% ibu 16
this pineapple-infused ipa starts off with a wave of tropical sweetness, but beware the bite there are aggressive hops lurking in the depths of this beer!



			x			





				pig iron® porter			





abv 7.5% ibu 30
on november 14th, 1996 iron hill brewery officially poured its first beer. among the opening beer lineup was our classic porter, pig iron porter. we’ve paid homage to this long standing iron hill staple by aging it on rye whiskey barrels and upping the flavor and alcohol.

				homestead™			





abv 4.6% ibu 17
straw-colored farmhouse ale that features complex citrus fruit flavors and aromatics, which fades to a refreshingly spicy, dry finish.



			x			





				citra ipa			





abv 5.8% ibu 65
sixteen ounce can of our american ipa using the citra hop, which imparts a distinct tropical citrus aroma to this medium-bodied ipa.



			x			





				dankonia ipa			





abv 7.2% ibu 17
hazy, crazy and totally groovy baby. it’s time for dankonia: a juicy new england-style ipa. it’s a whole vibe of intense pineapple and tropical fruit notes-plus a big ol’ batch of dry hops. looks like we brewed up a boogie wonderland of pure easy sipping enjoyment. can you dig it, baby? of course you can.



			x			





				grove fresh ipa			





abv 6.6% ibu 55
all flavor, no pulp. brewed using real oranges, this hop-forward ipa tastes like it came straight from the grove. it’s as refreshing and juicy as it is big and bold. technically it’s a west coast ipa, but we think it drinks more like a cold glass of fresh squeezed oj.



			x			





				hipster ipa			





abv 6.7% ibu 4
this hazy, new england style ipas been crafted by our finest, tight-pants wearing brewers. it’s a blend of wheat and oats, unironically dry hopped with all american hops. notes of melon, mango and pine lead to flavor so cool it’ll curl your mustache.



			x			





				kryptonite			





abv 9.4% ibu 90
brewed with more than twice the usual hops, this double ipa is a hop hero of sorts. first, you’ll taste notes of citrus, tropical fruit, and pine. then, that craveable bitterness swoops in. so strong, so powerful, this beer might just be your, well, let’s just say weakness.

				mahalo, apollo!			





abv 6.3% ibu 15
refreshing, golden and a little hazy. those words depict the perfect summer day just as well as they describe this deliciously drinkable summer ale. brewed with grains of paradise and lemongrass, this beer strikes the perfect balance between wheaty warmth and spicy hops, the kind of balance you’d need to surf the waves of a tropical paradise.



			x			





				orange creamsicle			





abv 6.3% ibu 23
hooray for summer and especially for this hazy, juicy, and creamy double dry-hopped milkshake ipa. brewed with lactose and finished with blood orange puree for a craft beer that tastes just like your favorite ice cream treat.



			x			





				pog champ			





abv 4.8% ibu 9
level up with our insanely drinkable passionfruit orange guava (pog) combination. the tropical fruit flavors and a touch of tartness make this beer a true champ.



			x			





				philly phavorite ipa™			





abv 6.7% ibu 16
this hazy beer may be considered a new england ipa, but its inspiration is pure philly. brewed with flaked oats and wheat, this beer features tropical fruit and resinous pine notes almost as intense as your passion for the home team. whether you’re cracking one open at a tailgate or in your living room, you can just taste the brotherly love.



			x			





				sweet leaf ipa			





abv 7.2% ibu 65
brewed with whole leaf hops and far out vibes, this beer is a happening of peace, love, and flavor. take in its earthy hops. tune into the subtle undertones of grapefruit, pine, and tropical fruit that keep things grooving. dust off those lava lamps, drop the needle on some vintage vinyl, and just let the experience of this beer roll over you, man.
