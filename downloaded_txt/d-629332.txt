reviewer comments



 



"both 
								(psi-plot & prostat) are easy to learn and use, and there is good set of 
								tutorials is provided. i was productive in a 
								couple of minutes, and a guinea pig with no 
								prior statistics software experience produced 
								useful graphics and results after half an hour 
								with no support other than the built in help 
								system."

								"for the many science areas, locations and users 
								for which an exploratory, task-focused, work 
								station level tool is more appropriate and more 
								productive than a corporate level package, 
								either of these would be an excellent choice. "

								(see full review click 



								here) 
 




"(psi-plot) is pleasant to use, and offers a very high degree of 
								flexibility and sophistication, without 
								generating any of the computational insomnia 
								that is so offen associated with complex 
								software products on the market. 
								strongly recommended." 
								 
								------materials research bulletin


 






"in 
								comparison to its biggest competitor in the 
								technical plotting market, sigmaplot, 
								psi-plot comes out as the best value for 
								everyday work. while both offer a large variety 
								of 2d and 3d plot types, 
								psi-plot is less expensive, runs faster, offers more extensive 
								statistical analysis capabilities, and is less 
								demanding of the host computer in terms of cpu 
								power, ram, and hard disk space.... 
								psi-plot for windows is easy to use, included the plotting and 
								analysis tools most commonly used in biological 
								sciences, and is economical in terms of both 
								computer resources and the customer's budget." 
------ the quarterly review of biology 
 






"the manual is 
								best described as terse. there's a set of 
								lessons, and the package (psi-plot) as a whole is superior to the introductory statistics 
								course i took at the university of iowa. ... and 
								(psi-plot) has spectacular graphics."

								-----byte magazine
 
 






"it's 
								easy to use, the manual is clear and provides 
								many examples, and the memus are close to 
								intuitive"
								"if you need to plot data, examine data, or 
								process blocks of data, i recommend this package 
								(psi-plot). ... when it comes time to 
								 do 
 								things with your data,  psi-plot  is the package to have on your computer."
------ edn magazine
