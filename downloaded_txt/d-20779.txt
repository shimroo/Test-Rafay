the new carbon cycle.exploit the trees.extract the oil.burn the forests.trash the oceans planet.we are creating have created our own extinction...







					ever consider why save our earth only posts links to news stories and why they don't campaign?
					

					ann walker wrote her report over 30 years ago and gave this to the world governments. in the report, she explained what would happen to us if we failed
					to protect the world's rainforests. the website was set up to campaign on ann's behalf and now 20 years since her passing, save our earth now shows you
					the proof that ann walker was correct. maybe you will act when you realise the danger you are in....
					
					the responsbility for the future of our civilisation is not in the materialism that invades our lives each day but in the choices we must make now. it's about time you understood how severe the situation is. yet the more we see every day, politicians are concerned by short term popularity while energy (fossil fuel) companies increase profits and expand their power and control, determining the course of humanity's direction. you will suffer because you did nothing to stop it...
