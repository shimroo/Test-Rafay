mark moxon's homepage


includes over 570 pages of travel writing and advice from 25 countries and six continents, plus over 5000 photographs and at least one good joke...

if you have an interest in travelling, enjoy the odd chuckle, or even fancy being a travel writer yourself, then i hope you'll find something here to while away a few minutes. here's what's on offer:





travel writing: take your pick from the hundreds of travel tales i've written; people seem to like them, and i hope you do too. take the tales as they come, and if you don't enjoy one, try another. and if you don't like any of them, just be thankful you haven't had to sit next to me on a ten-hour bus journey. you'd know if you had.


surprise me: don't know where to start? then why not try a random travel tale and see where it takes you...





photo library: a photograph is worth 1000 words, which means my searchable photo library is worth over a million of 'em.


free ebooks: if you want to read me on the road (or even on the way to work) you can download all my travel writing for free.





free audiobooks: if you'd rather listen to me reading my own stories, take your pick from my selection of free audiobooks.





great journeys: to help those of you who are planning your own trips, i've compiled a selection of my favourite journeys. i hope they will inspire you in your own travels.


travel tips: i've also compiled a collection of tips i picked up from my travels, and some suggestions on how to be a travel writer. feel free to ignore them totally.





about me: this bit's for those who are interested enough to want to know about me and my work. it's far from compulsory.


about this site: if you're interested in how i built this site, the site's accessibility statement, or using my content on your site, then this is the section for you.





contact me: if you want to let me know what you think of my site, i'd be delighted if you would get in touch.


finding stuff: feel free to search my site, or check out the contents of the entire site with the site map.


to navigate round my site simply use the arrows and links on the left, from where you can access the whole site. the page on using this site has more details.
