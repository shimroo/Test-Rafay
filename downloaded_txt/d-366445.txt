thanks for showing up!  this is one of the mirror sites holding
my software.  the packages here are either ones i've written or 
ones i package for someone else ("rpms" in the description).
please note that these are not all complete packages.  some of
them are simple scripts that i use, with little in the way of 
documentation or installation routines.
software packages
for a complete list of all files, see
filelist.html.
if you'd only like the most current rpms of the software i
write, see neweststable.

personal
if you need to get a hold of me, try:

email: wstearns@pobox.com
i'll have this address forever.

i have a diary running.  i
expect to update irregularly, when something interesting happens.
here's my pgp key.  i'd
strongly suggest that you download this from more than one of the
mirror sites and compare the two (so you can't be fooled if
one of the mirror sites gets hacked).  this key has not changed since 1998.
it can also be found on the public key servers, such as the one at

mit.
this key is used to sign any rpms i build.
here are some funny images and files.



here's the cruise my wife and 
i took in august, 2001.
finally, a few shots of me waterskiing on lake sunapee in new
hampshire, usa.
