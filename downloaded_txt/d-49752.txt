physical therapy helps you help yourself





don’t live with pain!



back and body care – physical therapy – uses a holistic treatment approach.  we incorporate a variety of techniques into a physical therapy based practice.

our interdisciplinary approach includes:


physical therapy treatments such as manual therapy, exercise,  therapeutic massage,  balance and gait (walking), and postural evaluations and proper ergonomics for home and work.
modalities such as heat cold and traction.
body work techniques including: feldenkrais, yoga, pilates, cranio-sacral therapy (myofascial release), deep tissue massage.

we are located in the bernal heights district of san francisco, one block from cortland avenue’s shopping district. transportation options include: muni lines: 24 divisadero & 67 bernal heights  (departs 24th st/bart@ mission on the hour – 20 & 40 min after the hour) – both buses stop at the same corner (folsom and cortland) a 2-3 min walk level walk from our office.
