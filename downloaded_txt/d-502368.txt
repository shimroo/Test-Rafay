beltona manufactures high quality, handmade resonator musical instruments using a combination of modern technology and traditional wood lutherie. the body is constructed from resin with glass and carbon fibre and is the perfect amplifier for the highly responsive beltona aluminium resonator cone – the secret to the great sound. the resin construction has proven to have real sound, weight and strength advantages over metal resonator instruments. resin is a dense and strong sound reflector that loses very little energy in its own vibration, unlike metal or wood, making these instruments the ultimate sound reflector. necks are carved from various woods in the traditional manner. instruments are hand built to individual order allowing for customers’ requests for unique body paintwork, neck dimensions, setup and pickup installation. there are occasionally instruments available in stock.
