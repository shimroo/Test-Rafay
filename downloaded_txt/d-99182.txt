federal prison after a tense sentencing hearing where greenberg spoke of the harm the attack has caused.  quintez brown was arrested shortly after leaving greenbergâs campaign office, where one of his six shots grazed greenbergâs sweater. four other staffers were in the room with greenberg, and one of them rushed to close the door on brown after he fired.greenberg, who was elected mayor later that year, said in court friday that he saw a man he didnât recognize come to the door of his campaign headquarters, and when a staffer tried to engage the man in conversation, âi saw a gun pointed directly at me and iâll never forget the sound of those gunshots fired,â greenberg told the court. greenberg said in the ensuing days, he felt âfear and confusion that made me physically numb for days.âbrown, 24, pleaded guilty in july to federal charges of interfering with a federally protected activity and discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. the plea agreement called for a sentencing range of 15 to nearly 18 years.us district judge benjamin beaton said brownâs attack was premeditated and was a threat to the communityâs political system. he

twin bi-racial newborns as black ex sex-pal shot them to death ready to be a mom again: âit took me 9 yearsâ                           in hindsight, the red flags were everywhere.                     but when florida mom megan hiatt, 22, decided to end her abusive relationship back on nov. 13, 2015, she never imagined her ex, gawain rushane wilson, would grab his ar-15 and fire several shots as she cradled their 5-month-old twin daughters, hayden rose and kayden reese, in her arms.                     by the time he was done, wilson, 28, killed both girls, hiattâs father and himself.                     hiatt was shot seven times. bullets struck her chest and abdomen. her lungs and kidneys were the only organs not pierced. the gunfire hit her left wrist and shattered her left leg and knee.                     she lost her left eye and was unable to walk.                     hiatt had packed her things ready to leave wilson for good on that tragic day. a close friend and her dad, travis james hiatt, 49, stood outside wilsonâs jacksonville home to provide support. she was discussing a co-parenting plan with him when he âstarted shaking physicallyâ and became âvisibly distraught.â                     âwe were on the couch; he had reese, i had rose, and we were feeding them bottles,â she said. âmy things were packed into a truck outside, and he flew into a rage.â                     âhe asked, âare we over?â                     âyes,â she replied.                     âare you sure weâre over?â                     âweâre not meant to be in a relationship together,'â she said.                     wilson stood up, âthrew reese on the couch,â and went to the closet where he kept his firearms.                     âhe told me, âi am going to murder your dad, and youâre going to watch. iâll show whatâs over, bitch.'â                     when he heard hiatt scream, her father came barreling through the front door. wilson opened fire. over and over, hiattâs fearless father was downed by bullets, yet continued to push himself back up.                     wilson, who was an engine mechanic for the navy, then turned the weapon toward hiatt and the girls.                     âat this point, i know weâre going to die,â she said. âwhat am i going to do battling an ar-15? i was hysterical, and i was ready to die with daughters in my arms, protecting them the best way i could.â                     after fatally shooting the âsweet and beautifulâ babies and critically wounding hiatt, wilson stood over the mother of his dead daughters and shot himself in the head.                     âat the end, when everything had happened, i could hear my dad dying, and i was crying,â hiatt recounted. âi told him, âiâm so sorry, i didnât know he was going to do this.'â                     when asked why he wouldnât just stay down, her father âsaid he wanted to take every bullet he could so there wouldnât be any more bullets left for me and the girls,â she said.                     hiatt, who is a fraternal twin herself, said she had two options after the shooting: give up on life or find hope, and make the best of her second chance.                     âi canât keep living in the past, because i will never get to live the second chance iâve got, she said. âi am immensely blessed and grateful i was given the willpower and confidence and hope to be more than what happened to me.â

extreme ideology that he apparently took on,â hill said.âhe picked up antisemitism, he posted a lot of anti-black content because of that â¦ internalized racism,â said hill, who is senior director of investigative research at the organization.metro nashville police said wednesday night investigators were probing âvery concerning online writings and social media postsâ as they attempt to determine a motive behind the attack that was partially streamed online.    escalante was fatally shot inside the cafeteria of the school and another student was grazed in the arm.henderson then fatally shot himself before a confrontation with police.alleged online writings reviewed by outlets included henderson stating that he âwas ashamed to be black,â wtvf

said was a "meticulously planned" stabbing rampage at a taylor swift-themed dance class in england last summer. axel rudakubana, 18, entered the surprise plea as jury selection had been expected to begin at the start of his trial in liverpool crown court.                    the july 29 stabbings sent shock waves across the u.k. and led to a week of widespread rioting across parts of england

church we believe that the king james bible is the inspired and preserved word of god (2 tim. 3:16) and that "rightly dividing the word of truth" (2 tim. 2:15) is the key to understanding the bible.                    all scripture is for us, but it was not all written to and about us. to rightly divide the word of truth is to recognize and consistently maintain the clear divisions that god put in the scripture.                     the main division in the word of god is between the prophetic kingdom program of israel (concerns that which was spoken by the prophets since the world began, acts 3:21) and the mystery program of the body of christ (concerns that which was kept secret since the world began until it was revealed through the apostle paul, rom. 16:25).                   christ chose paul to be the pattern and spokesman for the body of christ to follow in this present dispensation of grace (1 cor. 4:16-17; 11:1; phil. 4:9; 1 tim. 1:12-16).   hope bible church website             hillview baptist church on youtube           we believe salvation is by the grace of god through faith in jesus christâs death on the cross for our sins, his burial, and resurrection the third day.                     we love sinners enough to share the gospel of the grace of god with all men. we believe godâs power unto salvation is in the gospel of christ (romans 1:16), and his power to stablish believers is in paulâs gospel, the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery, and the scriptures of the prophets.                     we believe the great enemy of godâs power in his word is the traditions and wisdom of men, which make the word of god of none effect. (mark 7:13, 1 corinthians 1:17, and colossians 2:8-23).                     therefore we hold to true biblical ministry of preaching christ crucified to sinners, and building up the saints in christ through good doctrine, obtained only through studying and teaching the king james bible rightly divided (2 timothy 2:15)  hillview baptist church website             shorewood bible church on youtube           we are an independent, self-governing, self-supporting, self-propagating local body of believers.  we maintain no organizational affiliations with any other group, although we gladly fellowship with others of like precious faith.                     our purpose as a visible, localized manifestation of the body of christ is to glorify god by promoting "the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery" committed to the apostle paul (rom. 16:25, eph. 3:1-9) and carrying out "the ministry of reconciliation" committed to our trust as ambassadors of christ (ii cor. 5:18-20, ii tim. 1:13,14).                      to this end and following the ministry strategy of the apostle paul (acts 14:21-23), we have established three biblical priorities for our ministry:  shorewood bible church website                         thanks for visiting
