tom's hardware guide: review of jan. '05 400ml
derek boiko-weyrauch

''the cacophony of battle includes the thrum of explosions and
the screams of the dying. does this sound like your average day
at the office? perhaps not, but in addition to the shouts from
the crowd, more prizes than you can shake an awp at, a vending
machine filled with the nectar of the caffeine gods and plenty of
bawls; and you have lanpartynw's 400 man lan. it is 24 full hours
of gaming, mayhem and free goodies, which this year was never
more fun.''
