inspire others as a survivor or carer
while every cancer experience is unique, it takes extraordinary strength and resilience to face a diagnosis. if you’re a survivor or carer, you’re invited to participate in the survivor and carer’s lap of honour.held during the opening ceremony, you can choose to lap the track, or stay for the celebrations. whatever you choose, you’ll inspire our participants, and most importantly, those facing their own cancer experiences right now.
join now 





















reflect at the candlelight ceremony
during the relay, you’ll take strides against cancer. at the candlelight ceremony, it’s your chance to reflect and remember.
the candlelight ceremony is a touching, emotional vigil to honour your loved ones. you might remember the life of someone special, celebrate survivors, or reflect on your own cancer journey. while deeply personal, the candlelight ceremony has power to connect our community—and to remind us why we relay.
