thomas troward. 


(1847-1916)




early teacher of
mental science










who was thomas troward?
thomas troward was her majesty's assistant commissioner and later
divisional judge of the north indian punjab from 1869 until his
retirement
in 1896. it is this later period for which he is best remembered and
most
celebrated; in it he was at last able to devote himself to his great
interest
in metaphysical and esoteric studies.
the most notable results were a few small volumes that have had a
profound effect on the development of spiritual metaphysics, in
particular
that of the the new
thought movement, of which the teaching known as science of mind is
troward's most direct legacy. he was a much influential figure in the
development
of ernest holmes'
religious
science/science of mind organization due to the impact his philosophy
had
on holmes, and troward's teachings are regularly taught in science of
mind
classes.
thomas troward was born in punjab, india, in 1847 of british
parents,
albany and frederica troward. his father was a full colonel in the
indian
army. he was brought back to england to attend school and in 1865, at
the
age of 18, he graduated from college with gold medal honors in
literature.
he then decided to study law, although at heart he always considered
himself
an artist and a painter. 
at age 22, in 1869, he returned to india and took the difficult
indian
civil service examination. one of the subjects was metaphysics and
troward
surprised everyone with his answers because of their originality. he
became
an assistant commissioner and was quickly promoted to divisional judge
in the punjab, where he served for the next 25 years. 
in india, he married his first wife. together, they had three
children.
he married a second time after his first wife died and had three more
children.
his second wife, sarah ann, helped in the publishing of his works after
his death. in the forward to a publication entitled, troward's
comments
on the psalms, annie troward writes: "when he retired from the
bengal civil service in 1896, he decided to devote himself to three
objects
-- the study of the bible, writing his books, and painting pictures...
he believed that the solution to all our problems was there (in the
bible)
for those who read and meditated with minds at one with its inspirer."

troward's favorite hobby was painting. he had won several prizes
for art in india. after he retired from civil service, he returned to
england
in 1902, at the age of 55, intending to devote himself to his painting,
as well as writing. he had already thoroughly digested all of the
sacred
books of the oriental religions and they had certainly influenced his
spiritual
ideas. it is said that at one time a vision came to him about the
development
of a system of philosophy that gave peace of mind and the practical
results
of physical health and happiness to the individual. 
people described him as a kind and understanding man, simple and
natural in manner, but personally boring as a speaker. he was
considered
a very precise and proper englishman. his two daughters were born of
his
second wife and he was fond of playing practical jokes with his family.
while in india, he learned the language of the country. he studied all
of the bibles of the world, including the koran, hindu scriptures and
books
of raja yoga. his studies in original hebrew provided the foundation
for
his book, bible mystery and bible meaning. 
shortly after returning to england, troward begin to write for
the
new thought expressions publication. he had already developed,
in
some detail, his philosophy of mental science when he was accidentally
introduced to the "higher thought center" of london through a
mrs. alice callow, who happened to meet him in a london tea room. this
group immediately recognized him as an extremely articulate and learned
individual. he was invited to give a series of lectures and in 1904
delivered
his famous edinburgh lectures at queens gate in edinburgh, scotland.
these
lectures were given to a very small but appreciative group of persons.
however, it is said that even this captive, willing audience hardly
understood
what he was saying. 
still, troward’s genius did not go unrecognized. the philosopher
william james characterized troward’s edinburgh lectures on mental
science
as "far and away the ablest statement of philosophy i have met,
beautiful in its sustained clearness of thought and style, a really
classic
statement." 
his writing is a combination of intuitive oriental mysticism
filtered
into a western pedantic writing style. it is said that reading troward
is difficult. actually, if we read troward slowly and deliberately we
will
discover that he is very clear and concise. the secret of understanding
troward is to understand his major premises, then how he logically
argues
from those premises. this is typical of the western legal mind. 
troward was a major influence on the works of ernest holmes,
frederick
bailes, joseph murphy and emmett fox, and has been quoted by numerous
other
writers.
it must be remembered in reading troward that he was a product of
his time. his books use scientific jargon that was present around 1900.
he was raised in the church of england and had read the bible daily
from
boyhood. therefore, his books, especially bible mystery and bible
meaning
have a clear christian bent. 
on may 16, 1916, at the age of 69, thomas troward passed from
this
plane. he will be recognized in history as a contributing influence to
religious science, the new thought movement in the united states and
great
britain, and also, to some extent, to the more liberal ideas of the
church
of england.
