we're here to offer our
                    products and design skills for your renewable energy system
                    project! 
                     our
                    systems include the use of
                    solar panels, wind,
                    hydro
                    and gas
                    generators;  we provide components
                    for emergency power back-up, off-grid
                    homes, rv
                    power systems, solar
                    water pumping, telecommunications, general battery
                    charging, marine
                    applications, grid-tie, energy
                    efficient
                    appliances, energy efficient refrigerators,
                    and lp propane
                    appliances.
while the supply of our alternate energy
                    components and efficient
                    refrigeration appliances is generally excellent, please 
					do not wait until the last minute to order your goods!  
					some items are manufactured on a per order basis and are 
					generally pre-sold by the time the next "batch" arrives.
we have a great deal of data about these
                    systems on our website; take your time to explore the
                    information we offer.  to design a system, we
                    need to know your specific power requirements in terms of
                    watt-hours per day.  click here for "figuring
                    your power requirements" to get
                    started.  if you already know the total watt-hours per
                    day you need, click on "insolation
                    map & suggested systems" to get an idea
                    of what the components are (and costs) for the size system
                    you need, as well as how much power you can get from the sun
                    in your area of the country. 
an outline of basic "system
                    components" is offered in the next button;
                    we explain how the modules, regulators, inverters, and
                    batteries are used and give an overview of their place and
                    function in the system.
the costs for solar panels, inverters,
                    controllers, generators, and other goods are listed under pricing 
                    it's quite a lengthy page, so be sure to scroll down to find
                    what you seek.  we've also added additional
                    specifications for the more popular items that are linked to
                    our pricing page (inverters, solar modules, lp
                    refrigeration, etc)--so check it out!

                    information on energy
                    efficient refrigerators and wind,
                    hydro and gas generators  (yes, we offer a
                    line of propane, tri-fueled, other fuel generators). 
basic water
                    pumping systems are detailed; and, of course, get
                    back to us for specifics on your water pumping needs so we
                    may design a system based on your water requirements.
if you're looking for something you just
                    can't find, please e-mail
                    us or call; chances are we can get it for you or locate a source where you can find it.  we also offer more
                    products than are covered in these pages, so please don't
                    hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns
                    about your renewable energy project
