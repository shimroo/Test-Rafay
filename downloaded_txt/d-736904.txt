spartanburg, south carolina, new 
				home of carolinas boxing hall of fame

spartanburg, s.c.  spartanburg is 
				stepping into the ring.
				the carolinas boxing hall of fame is coming to the upstate, 
				claiming spartanburg memorial auditorium as its new home after 
				spending the past 18 years at the bojangles coliseum in 
				charlotte.  "spartanburg probably deserves it more than any 
				other town in north or south carolina for the number of 
				champions and the number of fighters that have come out of 
				spartanburg," said carolinas boxing hall of fame secretary mike 
				bivens. "its the perfect place to have it."  full
