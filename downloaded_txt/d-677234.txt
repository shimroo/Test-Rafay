t-mobile rolls out htc athena as "ameo"





http://www.engadget.com/move over, universal, there's a new sheriff in town. the athena from htc is finally starting to make some public appearances in carrier livery, and we've gotta say, t-mobile pink is suiting this thing just fine. specs for the new reigning king of htc's expansive windows mobile lineup include a 5-inch vga display, an 8gb hard drive to supplement any flash you might have stowed in the minisd slot, on-board gps, quadband gsm plus hsdpa (sorry, yanks -- 2100mhz only), 3 megapixel camera, an xscale core clipping right along at 624mhz, and -- get this -- three styli in the box, two traditional and one multi-function pen. t-mobile's european division will get this as an exclusive for a few weeks as the "ameo," at which point we'd imagine a wider european release is in order. american availability, as always, is an open question.

nintendo shipping ghettostrap replacements to wii latecomers?





http://www.engadget.com/looks like nintendo got tired of slapping its own branding onto every one of the bazillions of beefed-up replacement straps it's been sending out to butter-fingered wii owners the world over. reports are coming in of some sort of ghettostrap, possibly built by a third party, being sent out instead of the fancy nintendo version, leaving fanboys crestfallen at their newfound lack of total wii branding. not exactly the conspiracy of the century, but we want answers, and we want them now!

kobe drops 81, makes history





http://www.nba.com/where were you on jan. 22, 2006? it's a night that will live in basketball lore for quite some time. kobe bryant tallied 81 points against the raptors in a 122-104 lakers win. the 81 is the second highest single-game point total in nba history, behind only wilt chamberlain's 100 over 40 years ago.with no footage of wilt's perfomance around, kobe's night becomes something that the nba has never seen before. people across the league are buzzing about the historic night."i've seen some remarkable games but i've never seen anything like that before," added lakers coach phil jackson, who played against chamberlain and coached jordan.

motorola capri, a.k.a. the razr slider, previewed





 http://engadget.com/the guys over at phonescoop have sure made the site live up to its name today: not only did they get some serious hands-on time with motorola's upcoming razr slider -- codenamed capri -- they also got to preview the next version of moto's much-maligned synergy ui that will show up in such models as the canary and the scpl. at least on paper, the capri seems to offer a very compelling feature set that will probably attract anyone into the razr lifestyle- you're getting a model only slightly thicker and heavier than its clamshell counterpart, but which sports a 2.0 megapixel camera, a2dp-capable bluetooth, and what sounds like a greatly improved user interface. especially noteworthy in the overhauled synergy is an address book that seems to work much more intuitively than past iterations (remember the one on the startac?), allowing you to organize entries by name and search for contacts using multiple letters. although phone scoop was only testing a pre-production model, they have identified some potential problems to watch out for on the final version, such as the unusually crappy quality of what should be a decent camera, and most importantly, a spring-assisted slider that's difficult to activate due to the raised antenna bulge so familiar to razr owners. click on if you want to peep a few more snaps, but you're really doing yourself a disservice if you don't head over to phonescoop for the full gallery and a very thorough write-up...continue reading motorola capri, a.k.a. the razr slider, previewed
