there are few guarantees in life….death, taxes, and the gymrat challenge will sell out every year as one of the most iconic events in the history of grassroots basketball….with unparalelled coverage from college coaches, scouting services, and basketball publications, as well as the most comprehensive & credible evaluation services in grassroots basketball, more players are recruited out of the gymrat challenge than any other event in the nation.
the gymrat challenge is a proven & true test of both basketball skill and will where today’s ncaa, nba & wnba stars have come to earn their reputations over the past three decades….and where thousands of others have come to compete against them to see how they measure up against the best in the nation. since 1998, some of the greatest players on the planet have arrived at the gymrat challenge to compete and be seen, and exited the gymrat challenge having catapulted themselves to the top of recruiting boards everywhere.

originally created as complimentary addition to the legendary gymrat challenge and an avenue to allow top talent to be viewed by college coaches coming out of the pandemic, gymrat live has become the greatest show in grassroots basketball! by invitation-only, the gymrat live field includes representatives of nike’s eybl, the under armour association and adidas’ 3 stripe select basketball circuit….and possibly a few very fortunate high level independent programs….competing head to head in exclusive cross-sneaker brand championship event. these alpha v. alpha match-ups are displayed across the country and around the world in a full broadcast production that provides the brightest spotlights ever to shine on the grassroots basketball landscape. for more information, click the 2025 gymrat live event links below.

2025 boys gymrat live: may 3-4
2025 girls gymrat live: may 10-11


all programs receiving an invitation to compete at gymrat live also become members of the highly exclusive gymrat collective. the gymrat collective is far more than a “circuit”….it’s a movement that offers real value-added benefits to its member programs. gymrat collective teams have the ability to not only compete against the best talent on the continent at two of the most respected events in the history of grassroots basketball in gymrat live and the gymrat challenge, but also to benefit from revenue sharing opportunities to earn important fundraising dollars for their programs.
gymrat live & the gymrat collective are unlike anything else that has ever taken place in the history of grassroots basketball. if you’re part of the gymrat collective, you don’t just play, you earn. nobody does it like gymrat.
