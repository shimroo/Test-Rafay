  god bless the usa!
remember 9/11


it's the veteran, not the reporter, who has given us the freedom of the press.

it's the veteran, not the poet, who has given us the freedom of speech. 
it's the veteran, not the community organizer, who gives us the freedom to 
demonstrate. 
it's the military who salutes the flag, who serves beneath the flag, and whose 
coffin is draped by the flag, who allows the protester to burn the flag.
we live in the land of the free, "only" - because of the brave!


as ronald reagan once said:
both politicians and diapers need to be changed often and for the same reason!
you 
created us

which side of the 
fence

only 
two defining forces have ever offered to die for you, jesus christ and the 
american soldier
one died for your soul, the 
other for your freedom.


vietnam remembered
 in 
loving memory of my dad, a proud marine!
i served this country proudly but i just cannot respect  
men who send our young people off to die when they were not willing to do the 
same for their country!
