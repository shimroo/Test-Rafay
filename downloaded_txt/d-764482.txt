“our experience at village homes was incredible. from the start, looking at model homes and pricing options out, to watching our modular home get set and completed, and finalizing the process, we have nothing but praise for randy, jason, greg, show moreand katherine, and all the guys for treating our home like it was their own. it is our dream come true and we love it! we know everyone at village homes did everything possible for us to improve what we had.”
—chris & mary / shelburne, vt

“my experience at village homes was positive & personal! jason worked with me to design a home that was right for me. he was never pushy, but helped me make decisions that would make sense. when it came time for the delivery & set-up, greg kept me informed show more of the progress and then went over all the details before handing me the keys. because village homes is family owned and operated, they take pride in their business and in the product they sell while giving a personal touch.”
—nancy / braintree, vt

“in my opinion, after meeting with various home companies in the area, village homes staff and products/services surpass them all.”…“our experience at village homes was easy and wonderful. the staff really makes the whole process quite painless, which surprised us as first-time home buyers. show more i cannot possibly convey how helpful and friendly everyone was in this small space.”…“the best thing about my new home is how nice it feels to look around and see beauty everywhere. it is absolutely gorgeous and very well-built.”
—necia & chris / williamstown, vt
