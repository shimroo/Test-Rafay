large cruet - 8 oz.















 


          i have had min for 5 + years. i use it for dish soap.   i love it, get a lot of compliments, and no dish soap waste or mess.  i am going to buy more as presents for family and friends. ( first review i have ever taken the time to write.)

  seize the meal! we believe it's possible to balance cooking with a busy life. we know you love to cook but do you really have the time?
  we're constantly thinking about ways to make cooking easier and more enjoyable for you.

  our products are cleverly designed to fit your active lifestyle. life should be about great food, family, fun, friends, traditions, and precious
  moments. it's about doing the things we really love in life. at chef's planet®, we call it 'zest for life'. sure, cooking is a blast. but it's not
  fun when you don't have the right tools to get the job done. that's where we come in.

  we're cooks just like you, so we understand the challenges you face in the kitchen and we live to solve those problems before you ever
  have to think about them. so now that you have more time, get out there and find your zest for life.
