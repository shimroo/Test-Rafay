news update


02-03-2025
the ar-dv1 firmware has been updated to  v.2412a.

build your own 1.5ghz satcom-acars (inmarsat) receiving system with the ar5700d receiver!
unlock the full potential of your ar5700d
	
the ar5700d receiver, capable of receiving signals up to 3.7ghz, opens a gateway to explore signals and data beyond the usual spectrum. for those curious about what lies above 1ghz, here's a practical and exciting project: decoding classic aero standard signals in the 1.5ghz l-band. these signals, known as satcom-acars, are transmitted by inmarsat satellites to aircraft, especially when they are out of vhf acars range.
at aor headquarters, we created a simple yet effective setup to receive and decode these signals. while not flawless, the system serves as a "proof of concept", combining learning and fun with real-world applications.





getting started: tools and setup
begin your journey with guidance from the jaero software page,(https://jontio.zapto.org/) which offers an excellent conceptual overview. here's what you'll need:
hardware:
- receiver: ar5700d (alternatively ar2300iq, ar5001d with iq5001, or ar6000 with iq5001 options)
- antenna: diy l-band patch antenna (as detailed in the tech minds youtube tutorial) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luvppzopmry
- amplifier: low-noise amplifier (lna), ideally l-band-specific for optimal signal-to-noise ratio. we used the aor ln4000 100mhz-3ghz wide-band amplifier because thatâs we had available for the test, but it is not ideal. you should rather use a specific low-noise amplifier including a filter for the l-band (1.5ghz) for best signal to noise ratio (s/n).
- coaxial cable: high-quality uhf coaxial cable. we used airspyâs youloop 2m long transmission line (blue cable), which is rated up to 18ghz.
- computer: a standard windows pc
software:
- sdr# by airspy: free receiver control software https://airspy.com/download
- vb-cable: free virtual audio cable software https://vb-audio.com/cable/
- jaero by jonti olds: free decoding software (visit site) https://jontio.zapto.org/
-----
why choose the ar5700d receiver?
unlike cheaper sdr dongles, the ar5700d offers:
- low noise floor: ideal for detecting weak satellite signals
- frequency accuracy: ensures precise signal reception
- exceptional image suppression: reduces ghost signals and harmonics
- high carrier-to-noise ratio (c/n): enhances signal clarity

how it works: our setup in action
1. antenna: a home-made l-band patch antenna mounted on a camera tripod, built using a 0.5mm thick copper sheet.
2. signal processing: the ar5700d receiver connects to sdr#, which sends audio to jaero via vb-cable for decoding.
3. decoding: jaero's interface translates raw aero signal data into readable satcom-acars messages.
-----
additional tips for non-i/q receivers
you can actually decode satcom-acars by using the standard ar2300, ar5001d and ar6000 receivers not fitted with the iq5001 option! simply connect the receiverâs line-out to your pcâs line-in or use a usb audio interface if required.

-----
discover new horizons with your aor receiver
this project demonstrates the versatility and potential of aor receivers. we hope it inspires you to explore new applications, learn, and enjoy the fascinating world of satellite communication.
stay tuned for more innovative ideas and projects demonstrating the range of signals you can receive in high-quality, explore and decode above 1ghz using your aor receiver!

ip access now available for aor i/q receivers!
we are excited to announce the official release of ip access for our i/q equipped receivers. after a successful testing phase, users can now stream high-quality i/q over lan and the internet using the spyserver software, courtesy of our partners at airspy.
the receiver models which profit from this enhancement are:
ar5700d
ar2300iq
ar5001d (with the iq5001 option)
ar6000 (with the iq5001 option)
enjoy seamless access and streaming capabilities today!

--------
tips for the best user experience:
1)    handling the "server is busy" message
if you encounter a "server is busy" pop-up when starting the remote connection with sdr#, donât worry! simply wait a few seconds and try reconnecting. this delay happens because the boot-up sequence of our receivers takes a few moments to complete.
2)    fixing choppy audio
if you experience chopped audio during playback, you can resolve it by adjusting the buffer settings:
open the spyserver.config file.
increase the values of input_buffer_size_ms and output_buffer_size_ms to 200.
save the file and restart spyserver.exe. problem solved!
3)    optimizing sdr# performance
for the best performance in sdr#, make sure to:
activate the agc (automatic gain control) feature.
click the "learn" button to ensure proper calibration.

exceptional performance of the ar5700d receiver in challenging conditions (part 2):
the secret behind its exceptionally low noise floor
the ar5700d communications receiver sets a benchmark in the sdr market with its exceptionally low noise floor, primarily due to the ltc2205-14 adc chip. this 14-bit, 65msps adc minimizes noise through its high resolution and fast sampling, essential for preserving signal integrity.
key features contributing to its performance include:

high snr and sfdr: with a signal-to-noise ratio of 78.3db and a spurious-free dynamic range of 98db, the adc excels in distinguishing signal from noise, crucial in varied signal environments. (dither=off   sfdr=103dbfs  @15mhz, dither=on   sfdr=113dbfs  @15mhz)
dithering and data output randomizer: these options help in reducing quantization noise, enhancing the accuracy of digital outputs.
ultralow jitter and wide bandwidth: the adcâs 90fsrms jitter and 700mhz bandwidth ensure precise sampling and handling of high-frequency signals without loss of quality.

the following graph showcases how well the adc handles signal conversion at a fundamental frequency of 14.9mhz, with dithering applied, reflecting its pure performance. it clearly depicts the signal-to-noise ratio and the absence of spurious frequencies, which are critical for illustrating the low noise characteristics of the adc.

the integration of these advanced features makes the ar5700d highly effective and reliable for applications demanding high sensitivity and minimal noise interference.

kudos to the aor distributor in france, prosic, for his honorable initiatives for the blind and visually impaired radio amateurs. last april, members of prosic, unaraf (national union of the blind radio-amateurs of france) and f6kop (french radio club) have been honored guests of an event organised in abidjan, capital of the ivory coast, for the benefits of inipa the national ivorian institute for the advancement of the blind.
prosic and unaraf have already cooperated in the past for the creation of dv1-unaraf, a control software for the ar-dv1 receiver, dedicated to the blind and visually impaired. 

below are some photos of that inipa event in abidjan:

hints on how to decode various digital modes in hf:
aor already offers unique and very powerful solutions for the pc-less decoding of all the major digital modes present in the vhf and uhf bands (tetra, dmr, nxdn, d-star, dpmr, apco 25, yaesu, alinco, d-cr). 
those solutions are:
-the ar5700d, ar-dv1 and ar-dv10 receivers
-the ar2300, ar5001d and ar6000 receivers with the optional ard300 multi-digital modes decoder (except tetra).
did you know that with the help of a pc and 3rd party software, you can also decode plenty of other digital modes in the hf bands (below 30mhz)? you have probably heard of rtty, psk31, fsk, sitor-b, stanag, sstv etc. for your convenience, we have selected a couple of popular decoding software solutions for windows, which are still well maintained and affordable for the casual radio listener.

please note:
-the line-out audio of your receiver needs to be connected to your pc sound card's line-in. mic-in is unlikely to work well.
-the receiver's speaker output, headphones output and discriminator audio output cannot be used for this task.
-ar-dv1 and ar-dv10 cannot be used as they do not feature any line-out.

caution regarding fake news!
aor ltd. would like to raise your attention regarding an alarming increase of fake news regarding its products, circulating on radio related forums, social media groups such as on facebook, and on fake aor websites.

as a general rule and for the sake of common sense, we ask our dearest and honest customers never to trust rumours circulating on internet. the only sources of information to be trusted regarding aor products are www.aorja.com, www.aorusa.com  and the websites of our network of official aor dealers as listed on http://www.aorja.com/aboutus/dealers.php and http://www.aorusa.com/aboutus/dealers.html.

decode digital signals from space!
did you know that our ar-dv1, ar-dv10, ar5700d receivers, or the ard300 external decoder, can allow you to decode d-star repeater voice signals directly received from a amateur radio satellite downlink?
the following array of cubesat satellites has been operational for a year or two:
d-star one isat (norad id: 43879)
d-star one sparrow (43881)
d-star one lightsat (44393)
d-satr one exoconnect (44410)
they all use the same (voice) downlink frequency 435.525 mhz transmitted at 0.8-1.2w..
real-time tracking information available at www.n2yo.com will allow you to find out when those d-star satellites will cross your skies. with that information and providing you have a tracking antenna, our receivers can bring you a new and unique experience.
the official d-star one project website: www.d-star.one
have fun!

hamfair 2019 report:
we would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who came to visit the aor booth on august 31 and september 1, at the hamfair exhibition in tokyo.
ar-dv1 and ar-dv10 being now the number 1 selling digital receivers in japan, this year we put the emphasis on airband & airport listening, under the topic "make monitoring exciting again!".
as a matter of fact, tetra's traffic channel decoding feature introduction on our ar-dv1 and ar-dv10 receivers, have caused quite a stir in the japanese  monitoring community, as never before it has been possible to listen to airport staff communications where trunked tetra is used. the airband enthusiasts can now not only listen to communications between aircrafts and the control tower in am, but also to the exciting things happening inside the airport buildings and on the runway, via the tetra mode!
as a local airport was only a couple of km away from the exhibition hall, visitors had the surprise to be able to listen to "live" t-tc signals at our booth, originating from that airport, just by using a telescopic antenna.

list of exhibited products:

- ar-dv10 hand-held digital receiver (http://www.aorusa.com/receivers/ar-dv10.html)

- military plate-carrier with molle cases for ar-dv1, ar-dv10 and a 14.4v/9.3a soft li-ion battery (https://www.pro-sic.fr/)
- ar5700d digital communications receiver (release end of 2019. details will be published at www.aorja.com once available.)
- ar7400 air band receiver (under development). simultaneous 4 channel air band receiver. scan/search all air band in just 1 second.
