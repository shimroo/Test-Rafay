i just wanted to sing the praises of your company, sales person, and job foreman and his crew. i contracted to have our pool renovated and it was completed within a week, which exceeded our expectations. jeff guite’ was a true professional in his proposal , price and workmanship. your warranty was one of the deciding factors in deciding on your company. the slight additional cost over our nearest bid we felt was well worth the comfort of knowing you will be standing behind the work in the future while we own the home. i now can say i understand why the better business bureau raves about your companies’ performance.

top notch company & people!!! i bought a home in the quarry without a pool. decided on nassau based on reviews, price, and joe their salesman. i was in nj 90% of the time! they not only got the job done faster than originally discussed, but with 0 change orders & 0 extra costs. installing a pool is not an easy task, especially in fl with homes on top of each other. were there a few small issues, of course, there probably always is. but they were taken care of quickly, professionally, and at 0 cost to me. like it should be. joe their salesman was always available to me, even well after the sale. always there to provide status, answer questions, whatever i needed. never once said, go to talk to someone else. brian, the job supv, never once pushed me off or didn't answer me. even a text sent on a saturday night was answered. even on sunday!!! 
i have had pools installed in nj previously. it truly was never this easy. i even pointed out 1 paver with a small dent in it. when i got home the next day, it was already fixed!!! they are that good. also, i met the owner at their office and he was the nicest man & most thankful person i have ever met. 
what's funny, due to 1 review, i almost didn't go with them!!! then it hit me. they have been doing this for 50+ years. i am going to not use them due to 1 person??? what about the other 1,000's of happy people who don't post a word? when your happy, you don't say anything. when you are mad you tell the world. soooooo glad i went with them.
thank you joe & brian & everyone at nassau. loving my pool!!!!
