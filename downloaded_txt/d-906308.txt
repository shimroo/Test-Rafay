private school values 



the mission of the school: to create a special educational and social environment that recognizes and supports each student’s individuality. we stand for openness and honesty in relationships. our school creates an atmosphere of curiosity and friendliness.
we do not divide students by social status, wealth, language or denomination, but focus only on their personal qualities and abilities. we use exclusively original scenarios and programs, realizing the objectives of education, upbringing and development. for us every child is unique. we – for the inner freedom of the individual, which is impossible without respect for the freedom of others. children come to school by education. education for us is an unconditional value and we, as experts in this field, help to get it.






small study groups
study groups of up to 7 students, which speeds up and improves the quality of knowledge of the school curriculum subjects.


personal development
“setting up your own business”, acting, architecture, film art and entrepreneurship.


activity monitoring
monitoring the dynamics of academic activities and individual consultations with parents.




extracurricular activitie

career guidance
we help children choose their life’s work.


it professional training
