					(d-ma) introduced h.r. 10537, the house version of the 
					southern mongolian human rights policy act. this legislation

					bill seeks to address significant human rights abuses and

				southern mongolian young activist temulun togochog testifies 
				before the us congressional executive commission on china (cecc)














           
					... i have never met my aunts, uncles, cousins, or 
															nieces and nephews. 
															i have never 
															celebrated tsagaan 
															sar, the 
															traditional 
															mongolian new year, 
															with my relatives or 
															learned many of 
															their customs 
															firsthand. my 
															parents have not 
															returned to southern 
															mongolia to attend 
															family weddings or 
															funerals, nor to say 
															their final goodbyes 
															to loved ones. despite these challenges, my parents have worked 
															tirelessly to 
															preserve our 
															language, culture, 
															and traditions. when 
															i was little, they 
															sought out mongolian 
															babysitters to help 
															teach me and my 
															sister our mother 
															tongue. this was no 
															easy task, as there 
															were few mongolians 
															in new york. still, 
															i was fortunate to 
															learn some mongolian 
															from the babysitters 
															they found. as i started school, time at homeand opportunities 
															to learn 
															mongoliandiminished, 
															even though my 
															parents consistently 
															spoke mongolian at 
															home. southern 
															mongolians use the 
															traditional script 
															written vertically 
															from top to bottom, 
															a script with over 
															800 years of 
															history. this script 
															was not easy to 
															learn, so my parents 
															arranged for a 
															teacher from 
															independent mongolia 
															to teach me and my 
															sister the cyrillic 
															mongolian script. in the summer of 2018, my father took us to a 
															childrens camp at 
															the mongol-tibetan 
															buddhist cultural center  ....
