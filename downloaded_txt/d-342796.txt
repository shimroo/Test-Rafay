introduction to the bahã¡'ã­ faith
overview
the bahã¡'ã­ faith is a global religion founded in the mid-19th century by bahã¡'u'llã¡h in persia (modern-day iran). it emphasises the spiritual unity of humanity and seeks to harmonise religious, social, and scientific progress.
core beliefs

unity of humanity: all people are equal, regardless of race, nationality, or gender.
oneness of religion: all major world religions are seen as chapters of a single, unfolding divine plan.
justice and equality: promotes the elimination of prejudice and inequality.
independent investigation of truth: encourages individuals to seek truth independently rather than blindly following tradition.

practices

daily prayer and meditation.
observance of a 19-day fast each year.
participating in community-building activities, such as education and service projects.
avoidance of alcohol and drugs, as part of a focus on personal purity.

global impact
the bahã¡'ã­ faith has millions of followers across the world and has been recognised for its contributions to social progress and interfaith dialogue. its teachings inspire efforts in education, environmental sustainability, and the promotion of world peace.
