consulting on getting and using sbir


note: the website is 25 years old and still relevant to sbir. in particular, the news section is a 25 
year history of a long list of companies that played sbir and 
have attracted the attention of the american business press. is sbir a worthy program? whether sbir is a success story and a wise investment of federal
r&d funds
depends wholly on the mindset of the observer because the necessary
financial facts
lie wholly in the records of thousands of private companies.  and
the federal agenies have no equity in whether your business lives
or dies.  




carl nelson consulting helps
small high-tech firms with new technology get and use federal
government
r&d funding for innovations from the small business innovation
research program (sbir). to be eligible you must be (or become) a
mostly
us-owned for-profit small (under 500 employees) firm doing r&d
in
the usa. the money is free - no repayment and no equity taken. you
propose on a government specified schedule for a small award (phase i)
$100-150k to show
feasibility of your idea. if that works, you can propose some serious
money (phase ii) $1m or maybe more to develop some kind of prototype.
then you are
on your own. for more details, see doing
sbir.

ask yourself

what do you want to be?  besides
a government
contractor 

what's so compelling about your idea?
and if
so, why government?

does time matter? 

does business matter as much as science?


what will you do if it works? 

do you mind if government owns your idea? 


can you eat just one
potato chip? many companies live on sbir, some with hundreds of millions of sbir ddollars

concepts you need

  competitive advantage

 figure-of merit

a credible market (could be government)

a compelling story






 nelson's subjects 





getting sbir




if you don't know sbir

how does it work? 
can you get some?
which half of what you know is wrong?
do you need me?



if you already have sbir scars

does your phase 2
proposal sell your idea?
so you lost, now what?
can i schmooze anybody to help you?
how much do you
need me?












contract
negotiation: 

what are you entitled to?
what do the sbir rules really say? 
how does government think?
can you keep the prototype?


presentations:


does your language undercut your story?
should proposals sound like mystery novels? 
can you write a great sentence with verbs?
can you write a great sentence with verbs?




research
and
development:

government r&d;
organization and strategy; 
commercialization and dual-use;
government r&d policy



small
business
america: 

where are the 700 companies with bmdo sbir?
which of the 2800 proposers really have something? 
does the government do what it says it intends?
