geiger counters - professional - digital 












highly versatile and reliable geiger counter - american made 
              
    imagesâ digital geiger counters are practical tools for high school and college educators, helping students explore nuclear energy and radiation through hands-on, real-world applications. from basic labs to advanced physics courses, these counters enhance lessons by allowing students to interact with live radiation detection, making abstract concepts tangible and engaging.   perfect for educational, industrial, and emergency response settings, our geiger counters offer accurate detection for alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays. they excel in safety screenings for diverse materials, from soil to scrap metal, while meeting regulatory standards. each device features a user-friendly design with real-time readings and visual/audio indicators, so students can easily observe and interpret data. assembled in the usa, these counters are built to withstand frequent use in both classrooms and professional environments. comprehensive support is available directly through images, including service, repair, and calibration options. each unit comes with a one-year warranty covering factory defects, offering added peace of mind (wand and gm tube not covered).
