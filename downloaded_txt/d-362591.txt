                            bgc canada acknowledges that our work spans many territories and treaty areas and we are grateful for the traditional knowledge keepers and elders who are with us today, those who have gone before us and the youth that continuously inspire us in the work that we do. bgc canada’s mission statement is to provide safe, supportive places where children and youth can experience new opportunities, overcome barriers, build positive relationships, and develop confidence and skills for life. we recognize that these values are impossible to attain without the ongoing guidance and partnership with indigenous peoples.
