dreams - do they have meaning?


every person on earth dreams pretty much every night,
		and evidence suggests that all mammals dream also.
		it follows then that something extremely important must be going on while we
		sleep and dream, yet in the industrialized world, the majority of people pay
		little attention to dreams, lucid dreams and dream interpretation, and sometimes even short-change themselves on sleep
		because it is perceived as lost time, or at best unproductive.
		
		how astonishing that we generally ignore this third (and possibly far more) of
		ourselves - our dreams. an appropriate analogy to the grandeur of this mass misunderstanding
		is the incredible inertia in the middle ages against the idea of earth being
		other than flat until repeated point-blank evidence like galileo�s observation
		of other planets and their moons as well as the journeys of columbus and other
		explorers across the ocean proved conclusively otherwise. the challenge was
		that people�s everyday experience contradicted the idea of a spherical earth
		because nobody had yet gained perspective from outside of the system in order
		to interpret their experience from a larger view point. airplanes
		and especially photographs from space were not yet available, so there was
		little first hand evidence of a new understanding that was a great leap beyond
		the old interpretation. fortunately, with continuing research and analysis,
		proper understanding grew, and people eventually began to come around to an alternative view. the shift
		in understanding triggered an ensuing surge of exploration as the realization and acceptance
		finally dawned that our world really isn't flat after all.
		
		dreams, in the same way, encompass yet another entire dimension of experience, an alternative world as
		yet unexplored by most, where a fascinating sphere of activity awaits investigation, interpretation,
		and potential harvest for greater meaning and fulfillment in waking life. the challenge is
		again the same � common daily experience for the average person offers little
		proof of this other reality that dreams encompass, let alone the possible value that understanding,
		interpreting, applying and thereby harvesting this other
		dimension of experience can bring - unless one can gain perspective from outside the 9-to-5
		work day framework and the scientific purely-objective analysis of the system.
		
		dream-related mental skills such as dream recall, dream interpretation, and lucid dreaming
		and information on subjects such as the perhaps-bitter-yet-valuable-medicine meaning of nightmares or precognitive
		dreams isn�t often taught in our schools; the majority of our parents knew or
		passed on little about the value of remembering and understanding dreams as we grew up, or the great potential
		that lucid dreams can offer for our personal evolution. therefore it's no big
		surprise that many adults remember few or no dreams, and even less ponder the meaning of dream symbolism
		or set out to research, interpret and mine the jewels of guidance and creative
		inspiration hidden just below the surface of consciousness -- in dreams.
		basically, nobody told us or showed us how dreams can be extremely practical.
		
		current misguided concepts about the value of dreams and dream interpretation not only represent a crucial lack of understanding,
		but also represent and even bring about a lack of connection with the subconscious and our own deeper, intuitive
		mind. this long-standing trend of modern society often disregarding dreams and especially nightmares has created an artificial
		rift within many individuals, and may indirectly or even rather directly be the source for many of our current
		cultural, social, personal, political and planetary environmental challenges.
		
		one solution towards personal integration and thereby eventual rebalancing on
		a planetary level, is for each of us to realize and begin to investigate how our
		personal dreams, at very least, each night offer a direct means to explore and research
		inner reality directly and thereby gain unique, undeniable experiences that have deep personal meaning and creative insight
		to help us solve the problems we face. further, there is overwhelming evidence that dreams,
		lucid dreaming, and dream interpretation can be applied in many practical ways
		to improve waking life, supporting shakespeare's age-old claim by macbeth that
		sleep and dreams are the "chief nourishers in life's feast". dreams do indeed offer
		opportunities for fun, adventure, wish fulfillment, creativity, skill mastery, deep personal
		insight and healing � and dreams offer all this at no cost and with no line-ups!
