                         water ???   we've got water !!

     lake roosevelt is actually the columbia river
						            backed up behind grand coulee dam.

                         the typical operation of the lake,
						                              even in drought years, has the water
						                              up to a useable level for the summer.

      so, when you hear of other lakes drying up because of the
						       drought, come to lake roosevelt !!     "we've got water."
