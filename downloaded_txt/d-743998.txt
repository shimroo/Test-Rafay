gearing down is a private estate situated on captiva island, florida. enjoy the mild gulf breeze while sipping cold drinks in our open floor-plan, island style house. this home is situated privately on a manicured lot overlooking the bay, on the gulf of mexico. sunny days can be spent swimming in your own pool or relaxing on your private dock.

this is one of the nicest rentals you could stay at on captiva. everything about the house is 1st class. the views from the pool and back porch are breathtaking and the convenience to all of captiva’s shops and restaurants cannot be beat. our kids loved fishing off the dock out back while my wife and i could lounge in the pool. 100% as advertised.
