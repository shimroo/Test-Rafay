 training

ayf recommends that each member league adopt a training program for both football and cheer.  proper training enriches the experience for players, competitors and spectators alike. ayf requires those coaches who participate in the ayf national championship tournament to take the cdc concussion course as well as the asep football and cheer training courses and receive completion certificates, respectively. 
ayf members are responsible for selecting and establishing the parameters for  training which are to be completed by their coaches and administrative personnel. ayf suggests that players, parents and  coaches review the course materials at ayfcoaching.com, produced by human kinetics, a leader in sports training publications, also available is the book coaching youth football, written by ayf president, joe galat. another great resource is the nfhs free tackle coure available here.
