						very nice people to do business with.  i live in chicago area and inquired about a scamp trailer they were selling on consignment.  based on my discussion with sale people there, i put down a deposit to hold the trailer.  when i went down to check it out, it was exactly as it was described and clean as whistle.  they had let me know up front before putting down the deposit that it needed tires as the tires on it are original.  everything was tested by their technician and shown to be functional on the trailer.  this is a family run business that takes pride in their customer service!  thanks!!

						we had a blowout that damaged the undercarriage/underlayment, kitchen slide out, kitchen floor, floor supports, vinyl flooring, propane lines and various ancillary items. new horizon rv workmanship was exceptional. we were very pleased with the outcome as our rv looked as good as new. thank you for a job well done!

						having a problem with a/c... 
the technicians came out diagnosed the problem quickly, and cleaned both air conditioners after they replaced bad part....
the techs were very kind in explaining the problem to us and showing us the problem as well... i will call them again for any problems.

						had a leak in my water heater in my 5th wheel. made an appointment with linda to get the rv in to get it replaced. as soon as i got there, they started work on it right away. was finished really fast. really great service and friendly staff and owners. plan on going back for more repairs.

						we've been going through these guys off and on for a few years now , they've been amazing.  anytime we've had an issue with our campers, they helped us troubleshoot and fix the problem. they will never try to rip you off, fair on prices and if you need to sell your rv or camper new horizon will get the job done. they have been more like family to my wife and i . i would definitely recommend them to anyone. i would give 10⭐s if i could.

						i recently purchased a pre-owned travel trailer from new horizons.  monica explained how their consignment system works, i found a trailer and purchased it.  terry explained everything about it ( i have never owned an rv) and he went through a complete checklist to insure that the trailer is in tip top condition.  they were straight forward, and honest throughout the process.  it is great to do business with people who really believe in treating customers right!

						over the past several years, we have used the services of new horizon for repairs on our motor home. this is a locally owned family business with monica handling the consignment lot of used trailers and motorhomes. linda handles the office and parts department with terry and his staff handling all repairs. we have found their prices to be fair and their service to be very satisfactory. even though terry’s repair shop sometimes gets behind, they will go out of their ay to ensure great customer service. i would definitely recommend new horizon if you are in need of rv repair and or parts. glad this business is part of our community.
