happy parent's say









my name is linda telfort and my son preston mckenzie has attended leap ahead learning center since he was 6 months and the school has been nothing but great to him. he is learning new things everyday and reminds me constantly of the great teachers he have. all the staff members including ms.flavia has been very helpful and welcoming. the school is not only a learning place for my child but also family. it is great news to hear ms.flavia will be the new director as she is understanding, helpful and a great role model to have around my son.

linda telfort







becoming a new mom after 15 years was exciting and scary at the same time. finding a reliable place to care for your new bundle of joy was terrifying. from the 1st time i called the center it was a breathe of fresh air. the person on the phone was very pleasant and knowledgeable. i scheduled a tour that same day and filled out all the paperwork right away. they made sure all his shots and physical were up to date and he started the following week. the staff and management team welcome me and my son with open arms.
