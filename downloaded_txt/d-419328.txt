      “i took my son there for a few hours so we both could have a break. i
      didn’t feel judged at all. my boy loved going and was eating a healthy
      snack when i returned. thanks family support center for helping me when i
      felt i had nowhere else to turn.”

      i also learned to appreciate the journey more and not just focus on
      checking things off my list!”
