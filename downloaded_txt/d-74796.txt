i chose mc because of the faculty and students. itâs rare to find a college where both encourage you to be your best self.â

mc isnât like every other university
and we know youâre not like every other student. you connect dots others donât even see. you have dreams and goals that are all your own. mc has a long tradition of helping students like you make those connections and turn dreams into reality. and, if youâre a qualifying resident of mississippi and an incoming high school or transfer student, the speed scholarship makes it even easier by providing full undergraduate tuition.
