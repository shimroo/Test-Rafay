the boniuk institute

the boniuk institute for the study and advancement of religious tolerance aims to understand the conditions which lead to religious pluralism, tolerance, conflict, and violence, and then help people apply its findings in their lives and communities. 








the boniuk institute discovers new knowledge by conducting and sponsoring original research and scholarship, convening leading experts from different disciplines to work together, and then disseminating what we learn to those who can use it to promote meaningful change.
