cheaters shouldn't prosper.

|annoyed]it's very annoying when someone "commissions" you do make them art and then never follows through with payment.  i'm not a department store.  my time and materials are worth money.  two big time offenders are "jessica hynds" copper_squire@hotmail.com  and nelson jeck t_jeck@yahoo.com.if you get an email from either of these people run far away.  they will say extremely nice things to you, and give you multiple sob stories about why they cannot pay you ("i'm waiting for my paycheck"...or "i'm at work now, and the computers here block paypal" or "i was hoping to use my brother's credit card, but he hasn't returned my calls"), and they will even have the gall to send you their address, in the hopes that you will send them the work you did without payment...they will tell you they are going to pay you "next week", but miss deadline after self-imposed deadline...they will e-mail you asking you to send them photos of the work that you've already done (without payment!)...in short, they will try to do everything they can to win your sympathy and "trust."but in the end, they will never pay you for your hard work.

|and one]i recently had a reception for my show at the wyoming cultural center in tunkhannock, pa.  it happened to be on my 31st b-day.  there were 5 large window displays for me to fill in the entrance way to the dietrich theater.  it took quite a while to set up, i'll be taking it all down tomorrow.*sigh*i was thrilled with the number of people who came out to show me their support.  ( pics of the event under here!collapse )

|sleepy]i had these life casts of myself lying around.  you can't see the back of the box well, but it's painted like the sky, the blue girl is supposed to blend with it and sort of represent being invisible.i couldn't decide which way i liked them.
