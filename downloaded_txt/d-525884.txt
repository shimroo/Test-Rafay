improve system performance

understand system performance based on key metrics such as costs, throughput, cycle times, equipment utilization and resource availability.






reduce risk

reduce risk through rigorous simulation and testing of process changes before committing significant capital or resource expenditures.












reduce uncertainty

determine the impact of uncertainty and variability on system performance. run "what-if" scenarios to evaluate proposed process changes.






show your results

visualize results with 2d and 3d animation





































avoid costly mistakes and reduce risk
4 simple steps






step 1 - identify the problem
the key to every successful simulation project is a clear statement of the problem to be addressed and what success looks like.
step 2 - model your process
arena’s flowchart modeling methodology is an easy and intuitive way to model any process without the need for customized code or programming.
