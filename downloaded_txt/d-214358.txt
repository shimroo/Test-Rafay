poincaré conjecture
in 1904 the french mathematician henri poincaré asked if the three dimensional sphere is characterized as the unique simply connected three manifold. this question, the poincaré conjecture, was a special case of thurston’s geometrization conjecture. perelman’s proof tells us that every three manifold is built from a set of standard pieces, each with one of eight well-understood geometries.




 




p vs np
if it is easy to check that a solution to a problem is correct, is it also easy to solve the problem? this is the essence of the p vs np question. typical of the np problems is that of the hamiltonian path problem: given n cities to visit, how can one do this without visiting a city twice? if you give me a solution, i can easily check that it is correct. but i cannot so easily find a solution.




 




birch and swinnerton-dyer conjecture
supported by much experimental evidence, this conjecture relates the number of points on an elliptic curve mod p to the rank of the group of rational points. elliptic curves, defined by cubic equations in two variables, are fundamental mathematical objects that arise in many areas: wiles’ proof of the fermat conjecture, factorization of numbers into primes, and cryptography, to name three.

babbage archive
 oxford’s history of science museum holds important material associated with charles babbage, including components of babbage’s first (unfinished) mechanical computing machine and an archive of his personal notes about his machines. with support from cmi, the museum undertook a project to conserve and digitise this precious archive of babbage material. image courtesy of the history […]
