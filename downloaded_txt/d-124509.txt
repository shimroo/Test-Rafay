the mediterranean garden society (mgs) acts as a  focus for everyone who has a special interest in the plants and gardens of  mediterranean-climate regions. the mgs is a non-profit-making association  founded in greece in 1994 and now has members throughout the world. branches of the society  organise meetings and activities locally. the mgs is a place for discussing  mediterranean plants, cultivated and wild, as well as every aspect of gardens  and gardening in a mediterranean climate. the society publishes a quarterly journal the mediterranean garden with articles  contributed by its members. the garden at sparoza, just outside athens,  is managed by the society to demonstrate gardening that is in sympathy with the  natural surroundings and our philosophy of waterwise gardening. mgs members may  also join in the seed exchange.

              the secrets of bulbs that brighten our winter days are uncovered in this edition. we travel to japan and view the ultimate waterwise zen gardens. we also tour the idiosyncratic gardens of a cliff-top villa in the south of france.



 



              agm april 2025
the 2025 agm will be held in the peloponnese. the programme promises an amazing trip to make the

three fingers of the peninsula.
