bill viola 
1951–2024
 
the unfolding of consciousness, 
the revelation of beauty, present even after death, 
the moment of awe, the space without words, 
the emptiness that builds mountains, 
the joy of loving, the sorrow of loss,
 the gift of leaving something behind for the next traveler.
—bv

july 13, 2024 — it is with great sadness that we share the news of the death of bill viola, one of the world’s leading contemporary artists. 

he passed away peacefully at home on july 12th, at the age of 73. the cause was alzheimer’s disease. viola is survived by his wife and longtime creative collaborator, kira perov, executive director of bill viola studio, sons blake and andrei viola and daughter-in-law aileen milliman. 

          viola was a pioneer in the fields of new media, video, and installation art. for over 50 years his visionary environments, defined by immersive video and soundscapes, focused on the fundamental human experiences of birth, death, and the unfolding of consciousness. by slowing down the images, viola shifted viewers’ sense of perception and awareness to reveal the inner world.

in 2004, the opera scene was taken by storm by the 
          ground-breaking production of richard wagner's opera 
            tristan und isolde in los angeles. this book offers a 
          behind-the-scenes look at how the visionary american 
          artist bill viola created four hours of video as a visual
          complement to this profound psychological drama. 
          it also tells the story of its commissioning by the then 
          paris opera director gerard mortier, who pushed the 
          boundaries of what opera could be by inviting a trinity 
          of california-based creatives to re-imagine a 
tristan und isolde for our times.

          distributed for mercatorfonds, available through amazon, 
          yale university press, barnes & noble and other booksellers.
