for over 20 years miami's club space has been a mecca for electronic music lovers craving marathon raves curated by acclaimed dj's and selectors from across the globe. even in a city known for its after-hours parties, space has garnered widespread praise among audiences by regularly extending night time parties into mornings, afternoons and subsequent evenings. the club's famous terrace features a clear ceiling allowing dancers the rare opportunity to watch starlight turn to sunrise as they get lost and fall in love with the music on the dance floor.
