branded to kill (day 2: favourite movie)





the success of a director like seijun suzuki shouldn't happen.  imagine what would happen if one of the directors from the straight to dvd cheese factory asylum decided instead of making a souless rip off of gi joe and instead decided to make an all out gonzo art film instead.  it's antichrist for the z-fare audience.  that's who suzuki was, back in the 60s. working for nikatsu studios he was tasked with making low rent crime and sexploitation movies.  sleaze and cheese.   bored with making cinematic meat for his employers, he decided to create avant-garde crime cinema.  branded to kill is the last in what unofficially consider to be the last part of his yakuza pop trilogy (the first two are youth of the beast and tokyo drifter), a movie so stylized and so weird that it caused him to be fired from nikatsu and be blacklisted from the biz for over a decade.branded to kill plays to suzuki's strengths, having scene after scene of well framed action sequences as well as a protagonist with a twisted sense of sexuality.  this is the only movie outside of a director like miike or cronenburg who could have a protagonist who needs the scent of a warm bowl of rice as a sexual aid.the set pieces are brilliant as well.  two of ghost dog's assassinations are lifted whole sale from this movie, including the famous butterfly sniper scene that matt fraction acknowledges in the back matter of casanova as being an influence on his work.branded to kill, like most of my favourite movies, sticks with me for sheer audacity and willingness to buck conventional structure.  check it out.

day 1: favourite song





pixies-u-massif i'm to believe my  last.fm account (http://www.last.fm/user/kungfucowboy) my favourite song of the last 5 odd years is lcd soundsystem's 45:33.  but last.fm is trapdoor spider, filling you with false hope before it eats you alive.  the only reason that it tops my list with an elegant 100 plays is that it's part of an album of the same name, a nike+ mix.  it's 8 songs long, all dedicated to getting the blood traveling as fast as your feet.  the downside to this is that all of the songs share the same title. it sucks for stat tracking.  i'd divide this number by 8, do some weird rounding somewhere along the way.so that leaves me with stuff like dan deacon's build voice, easily my favourite track this year next to the animal collective's my girls, which is a sexy shower made of sound.  but is it my favourite song of all time?  probably not!  last.fm doesn't take into account my whole entire life as a music listening entity.  so instead of tunneling deep within myself and narrowing it down to my favourite song of all time, i'm just going to narrow it down to a couple of songs that i really dig.first up is the pixies' u-mass.  nirvana once said that when they made nevermind that it was theme doing their best attempt at a pixies' album.  if you listen to u-mass you'll see that it's pretty close.  the beginning riff is suspiciously close to smells like teen spirit, while the structure of the quiet then loud was aped by grunge wannabes.  this is my favourite pixies song.

the coachella breakdown





with the coachella set times hitting the internet, i've managed to create my tenative short list for the festival.  as of right now, things are looking like this.fridaynoon-2:00  dj mehdii'm choosing this guy to go to first since there isn't that many options once the doors are open.  i figure that an ed banger dj should be a good way to open the festival2:00-2:50 the midnight juggernautsthis is one of the big reasons that i'm heading to coachella and i'm pretty happy that i get to see them pretty early on in the show.  dollars to donuts that they're gonna set the energy bar high for the rest of the day.3:10-4:00  les savy favsi barely know anything about these guys, but kexp says that they do kickass live shows, so i'm totally down with that4:00-4:50  dan deaconi've listened to his album a couple times at the gym now.  he's an electronica artist, but he's not that accessible as far as i'm concerned.  exclaim reviewed one of his concerts and said that there's a lot of great visual stuff that goes along with his music, so who knows?  maybe it'll turn out to be badass.5:00-5:50 the breedersif i had a magical wand, i'd use it and turn this into pixies.  the truth is that i do not!5:50-6:30  vampire weekendit was inbetween these guys and tegan and sara, the first major conflict of the today.  how was this resolved?  if i saw tegan and sara it would mean that i'd have to miss the nation.  as much as i love indie-styled ghost-ploitation songs, i love the national much more.  settled.6:55-7:45  the nationalthese guys are the cat's meow.  one of the big reasons that i'm heading to the concert.  that said, checking them out means that i'm gonna be missing diplo, whose contributions on aralur were pretty damn awesome.7:45-8:35  santogoldthis is another pretty big deal for me, but with the national ending at the same time, i'm not sure that i'll be able to do the full set.  if she ends up sucking in person, it'll make the pain easier.  or better yet, maybe she'll improve and turn into an awesome musical goddess when i appear.  9:00-9:45 datarocksome more dance rock to end the evening.10:45-whenever fatboy slimthis is pretty much a no brainer since i have two testicals and a penis.  i think that checking out jack johnson would ultimately undo that.saturday12:30-1:10 the bird and the beei'd love to trade this with the bees, or possibly the birds, but the beginning of the day is slim picking.  that, and i'm gonna be checking out institubes on sunday1:30-2:20  uffiemy brother chritopher is a proponent of uffie and only because she does the whole "ready to fuck" part of that justice song.  is the song turns literal it shall make for a thrilling and frightening concert going experience.  stay hot, uffie!2:30--3:15 man manthere might be a conflict going on here since the posse i'll be with seems to be hot on kavinsky, but i do dig the man man, so, to me, it seems like man man's gonna take precedence.  sorry 80s electro, weirdass horns and screms beat you everytime.3:25-4:30exclaim claims that these guys suck live, but i do that time to pretend song.  5:00-6:00  erol alkani have no idea about this guy.  i think that christopher gave him some props?6:35-7:20  cinematic orchestraif they go fullbore with this and have their full entire orchestra there, i know that this show is gonna be amazing.7:20-8:10 rilo kileygonna be a little late for this one, and baby, that's bad news.8:20-9:10 m.i.a.this here's the real deal.  i'm totally looking forward to this one.9:30-10:20  yellestarlet of the french tecktonik scene is either gonna be the cat's meow, or the cat's ass.  i'm crossing my fingers for a bunch of americans trying to ape the dance stylings of the french. 10:45-end  princebecause i really don't have that much choicesunday12:00-2:00  institubestwo hours of dance.  i have no idea if they're any good.2:00-2:40  cool kidsi think that this'll be the first and only time that i'll be checking out a hip hop act at the concert.  rolling stone says that these are one of the "bands to watch".  i plan on taking their advice literally, in this cae.2:50-3:35  holy fuckholy fuck, they're canadian, and apperently a decent live band.  i just like saying holy fuck.  that's the real reason people are going to check them out, i'm sure3:45-4:35 manchester orchestranot so sure about these guys, but i gotta kill time somewhere along the way5:30-6:20 gogol bordelloi've been told my many people that these guys are utterly amazing live.  stephen, mike, these guys better be as awesome as you claim6:20-7:20  kid sisterso i lied, it looks like i'm gonna be checking out another hip hop act at the festival8:30-11:00 roger watersi'm totally conflicted by this one.  on one hand, this is gonna be the last time that they're going to be doing dark side of the moon ever here in north america, but, on the other hand, if i were to head to the other tent, i can check out modeselektor, chromeo and simian mobile disco.  not only that, if i do that, i won't be missing any of justice.  i have a feeling that's what'll happen in the end, but still, it'll be a shame to miss roger waters11:00-end  justicethis, i have no doubt, will be the most amazing part of the show~fin~

7 days until coachella 2008





a week from now, i am going to be in the united states for the first time in ten year, coachella 2008.  i've been looking forward to this trip since i made arrangements way back in the dead of winter.  the thoughts of going to the best music fest in north america made suffering through minus 40 degree weather and frostbite worthwhile.  i wouldn't say that the lineup is as good as last year (having fantastic bands like rage against the machine, dj shadow, the arcade fire, ghostface killah amongst others), but this one seems to make up for it with lots of great french dance bands.as of now, these are the bands that i want to see the most at the concert.  it'll be intersting to see how this list compares in over a week after it's all finished.in no particular order1)  kraftwerkthe only kraftwerk that i've managed to hear at this point is the stuff sampled in afrika bambaataa's planet rock and bits of tour de france, so i can't say that i'm an uber-fan.  with that considered, they are the progenitors of electronica music and they've been known to put on a great show.  and with the members of kraftwerk getting older, it's unlikely that i'll ever get to see 'em live again, so i can't knock that.2)  roger watersthere's been a quote floating around the internet saying that roger waters doing dark side of the moon live is akin to having ringo star doing sargent peppers live.  i'm no hater and from what i've read, roger waters puts on a damn fine show.  checking out the dark side of the moon at coachella is a matter of historical curiousity for me, as it's the last time it'll be performed in north america.  i'm not knocking that.3)  m.i.a.i have deep seated fears that m.i.a.'s more of a produced artist than a live one.  my brother christopher, who i'm going to the concert with, says that marc ronson, who's also appearing, says that she lacks finesse live.  this has instilled doubt into my heart of hearts.  but when it comes to technical proficiency, one only has to look to wayne coyne, who isn't a fantastic singer, to see that an artist who has heart and love for their craft can make for an awersome live act.  all the shit that i've read about m.i.a. points to her being awesome live, so that gives me hope.4)  the nationali have no idea if the national are a good live act or not, but i'm a huge fan of their lyrics.  hence, they're an un-negotiable act to miss.5)  midnight juggeranutsif the concert has nearly as much energy this clip here, i'm gonna be a happy man.6)  justicei'm keen on seeing justice for the same reason for wanting to see the midnight juggernauts.  i'm keen on bouncing up and down for two hours straight high on kickass french dance.  7)  gogol bordellothis guys really haven't been high on my radar, and with the exception of wanderlust king, i'm totally unfamiliar with their music.  but that's totally irrelevent.  acording to mike and stephen, my friends whose opinion i greatly trust, they put on a kickass live show.  if they can make a room full of vancouverites shake their asses, you gotta give whoever can do that some major props.

movies i want to see: space is the place





after grindhouse and a discussion with my younger brother, i've decided to check out some more blaxploitation movies.  since everyone's aware of the classics, like trick trucker, superfly, dolemite, and the mack, i thought that i'd try my hand at more obscure stuff.  either that, or something weirder.so weirder i have found.  if you hear the words "space is the place", if you are like me, undoubtedly, you'll remember the song by spacehog from the late nineties.  if you heard the words "space is the place" and were a fan of progressive jazz musician in the 60s, i'm sure that this movie would stir some memories.  i know little of this movie, except that it stars sun-ra, a somewhat famous jazz musician of the era. i checked out some of his tunes and the good stuff reminds me of yoko kano's jazz from cowboy bebop, which is a high compliment.  the rest, is etherial acid jazz.  so if it was a comic book, it would be "what if...the soundtrack to escape from la was done by an acid soaked jazzman"?  jazz is cool.  it gives me a reason to check out this movie.reason two:  the costumes.  aren't they awesome?  much like rappers of today, sun ra has an overinflated self image.  instead of believing himself to be a god of sex, he sees himself as  a literal god.  a god who will save us all through jazz and egypt worship.  who doesn't want that?

aural sex:  music from april 15 to april 22nd





should have updated this earlier, but i am a lazy sob and/or busy one.  onwards!unsurprisingly, pixies are number one again this week.  i attribute this to my listening to their live concert out of winipeg two years ago.  i'm of the opinion that the pixies' live stuff is a hundred times better than their recorded stuff.  unlike most bands, their banter is kept to a near minimum.  the most i heard from the concert recording was kim deal asking the audience if they played to winipeg or not.  this met with a deafening "no!"  the concert screams with so much energy that you can practically see frank black's sweat come out of the speakers.  great concert, worth hunting down if you're into the pixies.the who is number two thanks to their live at leeds album that i pulled off of soulseek at the end of last week.  while the concert on the cd lacks the frantic energy of a pixies concert, it's worth it just to hear all of the who's repertoire from the ages in concerto.new up is man man, a small band that everyone should check out.  man man what tom waits would sound if he cloned himself and inserted him into an art band.  some of the songs, are too short and are a little bit too cacophonous, but there's a couple gems in there.  out of their album six demon bag, their best songs are feathers, black mission goggles (which has the energy of an super powered atomic bomb that can destroy the mother fucking sun!) and van helsing boom box.  the rest is hit or miss, so check yourself before you wreck yourself.  they're also fronting for modest mouse this summer, which is double plus good since modest mouse is awesome (when they're sober).clint mansell's up there since i needed some atmospheric music while i was reading the ruins.  it was the fountain soundtrack.  (rob's mini review of the fountain:  want to see hugh jackman cry and people turn into trees?  this movie is for you!)the embassy's new music that i found through last.fm.  from what i recall, it's swedish, so your millage may vary.  the embassy's techno-lite pop that comes from the earth's gummy centre.  it rots teeth and tickles your ear holes.the rest isn't really worth commenting on since it's old hat.as always, you check see what i'm listening to right now by looking up to the left or  internet stalking me on my last.fm profile.  i got invisible eyes, so i'll see you acoming if you check me out.

the state of my shitty musical taste





i got myself a big ass ipod now that the breakup has hit the fsj area.   music's my vacation.i got myself an 80 gig one thinking that i'd be able to fill it up quickly with my music and tool it up with other dandy things.  as of the moment, i've only managed to put 10 gigs of music in there.  that's my complete cd collection, with a couple of lost exception as well as three years or so of downloading music.  with all that empty space on the ipod, suddenly i've come to the realization that i don't listen to enough music, and that the music that i'm listening to isn't that varied.  so i've decided to do my semi-annual music expanding experiment.  i've decided that since i've mined out all the good stuff from 80s hip hop, i'm going to start checking out more disco and 70s soul.  this is my plan for the future.that said, i'd digging of montreal's new album right now.  i've been rather mixed on of montreal in the past, liking their beat heavy stuff more so than their meandering slow shit.  out of all the songs in hissing fauna, are you the destroyer, the best of the lot is the past is a grotesque animal, an epic 11 plus minute song.  the song builds to an explosion like an aural dam bursting after being bombarded with vicious synth.  i wholeheartedly recommend this amazing beast of a song.
