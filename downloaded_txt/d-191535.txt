we are the people of god in the roman catholic church of holy name in ebensburg, pa. through baptism, we are called together as members of the community of faith established by jesus christ in the power of the holy spirit. we proclaim and witness christ’s good news. united with the holy father and our bishop, we live the mission of jesus through faithfulness to his gospel as understood and taught by the roman catholic church. with the help of the lord jesus, we commit ourselves to work toward a fuller realization of god’s reign on earth, by celebrating christ’s presence in worship and sacrament, by teaching and serving, by building up community and by fostering justice through prayer and action.
