professor petr beckmann published the access to energy, "a pro-science, pro-technology, pro-free enterprise monthly newsletter" for 20 years until
august 1993. he died later that year.

during that time he had a bulletin board system which could be accessed by his subscribers. 
this was called fort freedom.

i first made contact with it on november 18, 1988 (see responses to fort freedom) - 8 years ago, almost to the day of my writing this 
(november 20, 1996)! anyway, because i had to make an expensive overseas telephone call to access fort freedom,
i arranged with prof. beckmann to send me the contents of fort freedom on disk. i received that
in february 1989. i had ideas that i might set up an australian copy of it - but it never happened. 
until now - when i have been able to put it on the internet. so this is fort freedom, as it was in 1989.

i have not changed the contents at all (except for eliminating original bulletin board specifics such as instructions on which
key to press). formatting has been preserved, except for the addition of some hypertext links to other areas in the fort where there
were orginally keystroke instructions. the original documents had banners with the title encased in angle brackets; these have been
changed to square brackets to avoid confusing some browsers. 
my article greenhouse hokum has had hypertext links to the footnotes added
(and that gives me an excuse to mention it here! originally published, with graphics and charts, by copyright publishing, isbn	1875401059.)

because this information is presented as it was then, it will not be updated. i am unable to enter into discussions
about topics therein. however, if you discover problems with the presentation, let me know.

november 1997: fort freedom has doubled in size! many thanks to 
brant gaede (a frequent contributor to fort freedom in the past) who sent me a lot more files later than the ones i had.

12th may 1998: fort freedom has won
the enter stage right conservative site of the day award! [link to that no longer exists.] 
their site is here.


january 2024: i came across some digital versions of some of prof. beckmann's books/articles: 
economics as if some people mattered [pdf, 5 mb]
the health hazards of not going nuclear [pdf, 68 mb]
why soft technology will not be america's salvation [pdf, 2 mb]
einstein plus two (preface_only, plus other items) [pdf, 4 mb]
einstein plus two (complete) [pdf, 82 mb]
[note: because of excess traffic (presumably) caused by web bots, these files are forbidden if the web browser or accessing software has "go-http-client" as its useragent string.]


standard disclaimer: i do not necessarily agree with every view expressed in
fort freedom, nor is there any implication that there is necessarily
any agreement by others who may reference this site.

access to energy is now published by dr arthur robinson, box 1250, cave junction, or  97523.
