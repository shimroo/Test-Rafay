ayahuasca sustainability field report
over the past several years, members of ayahuasca groups and various social media sites have referred to the supply of ayahuasca vine (banisteriopsis caapi, malpighiaceae) in peru as imperiled and environmentally devastated. and yet, the largest ayahuasca retreat centers in iquitos (loreto region) and pucallpa (ucayali region) appear well supplied with this vine. to determine supply, i conducted a multi-site field assessment in the peruvian amazon. 
“cultivation of ayahuasca is very much on people’s minds, both from a sustainability standpoint and from a cost perspective. cultivation of ayahuasca assures sustainability, and also offers full traceability of materials. these are great advantages. additionally, there is a sense among many that ayahuasca, even if it is relatively plentiful in the rio tamaya area, will sooner or later become endangered if cultivation efforts are not widely initiated.” – chris kilham
