started for families, by familiesc.u.r.e. childhood cancer association is a 501(c)3 organization that got its start in 1976 when a group of rochester-area parents, who had lost children to cancer, began to meet regularly to talk about their grief, remember their children’s courage, and begin to heal. it wasn’t long before they realized that together, drawing on their hard-won experience, they could support other local families who were coping with the chronic illness of a child. over the years, c.u.r.e. childhood cancer association has inspired similar groups around the country and its parent advocate program is nationally recognized as a peer-to-peer support model. c.u.r.e. remains the only organization in the area that focuses solely on addressing the social, emotional, financial, and educational needs of families whose children have been diagnosed with cancer or chronic blood disorders.

stories of support 

  







  

stories of supportour c.u.r.e. family stories are the truest examples of inspiration, tenacity, and love. in the face of adversity, c.u.r.e. partners with families to support and ease their mind during the many stages that follow a diagnosis. read our stories of support to hear firsthand from a few of our families and their experience with c.u.r.e. meet one of our families: the misere familya newborn baby is virtually guaranteed to turn any household upside down, but learning that your child has sickle cell anemia when she’s only two weeks old is another level of upheaval altogether. that’s exactly what happened to marie and carl misere and their daughter laila.
