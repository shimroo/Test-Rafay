                      eric: âshe is a busy person. itâs tough to get on her calendar. a friend of mine, he said, âwell i
                      was trying to take lunch over to your mom, but literally canât. she canât squeeze me in!ââ
                      jamey: âthatâs right. you never know which appointments i may have: movies, shopping, lunches at
                      friendsâ. you know, you gotta have people.â

                      jamey: âyou have to keep going to keep going, thatâs what my mom said.â
                      eric: âmy grandma helen had ga, geographic atrophy, which is the advanced stage of dry amd, which
                      is what my mom has.â
                      jamey: âmy mom overcame so many things.â 
                      eric: âshe was always kind of looking out of the side of her eye at me, because she could see
                      somewhat peripherals. i think you guys had a family meeting that decided okay, time for helen to
                      hang up the car keys.â
                      jamey: âand i think giving up driving was worse than giving up her home. you know, itâs your last,
                      really, form of independence.â 
                      eric: âshe was such a tough woman, and so resilient, and so positive at the end of the day no
                      matter what she was going through. and so, you know, with mom having dry amd, we want to make sure
                      that it doesnât progress. she stays on top of going to the doctor and listening to what he has to
                      say about eye care and healthcare in general. but we also know, because of how they were with my
                      grandma, if it progresses, momâs going to be taken care of. as weâve gone through health issues in
                      our family, we always try to find humor.
                      jamey: âiâm sure eric would move in to take care of me.â 
                      eric: âi was going to say siberia, but uh, you just order in. get your deliveries sent over,
                      right?â

                      jamey: âi go to the doctor regularly to get checked. you need to protect your eye when youâre out
                      in the sun. eating certain foods are good for your eyeâleafy green vegetables and things like
                      that. as you age, you know, things change. and if, you know, you would notice any type of
                      difference in your eyesight, you know you go check other parts of your body. you should check your
                      eyes too.â

about ga




            geographic atrophy (ga) is an advanced form of dry amd that causes irreversible vision loss




            ga is a progressive eye disease that causes cells in the retina to die (known as atrophy),
            and lesions to form in their place. sometimes the regions of atrophy can look like a map, hence the term
            geographic atrophy. over time, the atrophic lesions grow and spread across the retina. when they reach the
            foveaâthe area of the eye responsible for sharp, central visionâpermanent vision loss occurs.
          


              see how ga can spread over time and put vision at risk

when ga lesions reach the fovea, it can lead to significant loss of central
                      vision and, eventually, legal blindness.

~1.5 million people across the us are living with ga, but only 1 out of 4
                  individuals have been diagnosed.

            you may have ga and not even realize it




            ga can start to develop with subtle symptoms, or even no symptoms at all
          

            by the time vision loss becomes noticeable, ga may have already spread throughout the eye. partner with your
            doctor for regular eye exams and screening to see if your dry amd is progressing to ga.

 beauty is essential. i was diagnosed with amd 22 years ago and i'm going to go blind. but
                        every time that i look at something beautiful, i remember that i can see. this is an old
                        italian piece, and when we brought it here, i used to put all my photographs in.
 this is my mother and me. it must have been 1948. and she looks happy. i do not.
 when i was a child, my mother's paintings, they were extremely beautiful, i thought. she
                        would paint for hours.
i'm not entirely sure when my mother began experiencing symptoms because she assumed that
                        it was just age. and then she went completely blind.
 [off-screen: whenever you're ready.] 
 i'm ready. creativity is a tool to beautify your environment, to make it something that
                        you and others will enjoy. my mother's art was her own. it was her way of filling the world
                        with the beauty, the color to occupy her mind and erase the bad days.
 she spent five years in a concentration camp, so her younger brothers didn't make it. and
                        as far as i know, no members of her family did. she was a very strong woman, and i think
                        that's where i learned my resilience. but i never really understood what it meant or what it
                        felt like until the day came when i had to use it myself.
 the first thing that i noticed was that the notes on the music pages were swimming. i went
                        to see an ophthalmologist and i said, "my mother has macular degeneration. i'm concerned."
                        and he said, "yes, you have mild macular degeneration in both eyes." and i was devastated.
                        couldn't get out of the chair. they had to help me out of the chair.
 they had to help me walk into the waiting room. although i said nothing to anyone, i was
                        just inconsolable.
for someone who is just diagnosed, i would say this is probably a good time to learn
                        something new. something new that lets you make something that wasn't there before, that
                        lets you know that you can still grow and that balances whatever the loss may have been. i
                        never ask, "why me?" don't waste your energy with that. spend your energy on learning how to
                        make every day the most effective day that you can.
 learning how to use the vision that you have. it's not a complicated thing to change
                        perspective, all you have to do is instead of looking down, you have to look up and out. and
                        you see the world. when it works, one feels a great sense of achievement. and it helps to
                        deal with the next day.

golf is a game i played all my life from 25 to 80. i'd be playing with guys who could see the
                        ball land, you know, further out than 150 yards. but because of my macular degeneration, i would
                        lose it. i was playing with a friend of mine out in palm springs. it was about a 200 yard hole.
                        i hit my shot.
the guys, the young fellows said, "it went in!" i've told people. i said, "well, i couldn't see
                        it." so when these guys were talking about it, it was like listening to it on the radio. but
                        that was pretty cool. and but it was fun. it was quite, quite a experience to have. and my wife
                        was pretty creative. she did this, she did the artwork on this, too, and got me that little
                        trophy holder for the, for the ball, so.
my wife, we met in junior high school, dated through college and and got married after i
                        graduated. and that was in 1961. and then there's the happy couple walking down the aisle after
                        the exchange of vows and the wedding kiss. so we just celebrated our 62nd anniversary. she's
                        just been a fabulous mother, grandmother, a wonderful wife, and my biggest supporter in
                        everything i've done.
as well as my macular degeneration journey. early diagnosis, getting the right help with a
                        retina specialist, getting help from a low vision specialist are critical to help me to, to be
                        able to function. you know, i got a lighted magnifying glass i could use to help me read if i
                        needed it. i got a little monocular that i used to watch tv a little better, watching football
                        plays and things like that on tv.
attitude has a lot to do with it. if you believe you can function normally, it certainly makes
                        it easier to go forward. my wife has mobility issues and she doesn't drive either, but we are
                        able to do just fine. she helps me with things i can't see and i help her get around and do the
                        things she can't do.
and we have a lot of good things ahead of us with family, you know, their lives and their
                        marriages and great grandchildren. a grandson who's in graduate school and playing golf. he
                        wants to try to play professional golf. well, that's pretty exciting to me. my wife, i'd say,
                        you know, we've known each other a long time.
we're together. we have each other to lean on and help each other with our kind of life issues.
                        she's been terrific partner.

defining ga and related terms






ga
geographic atrophy, an advanced form of dry amd that can cause irreversible
                    vision loss.




dry amd
dry age-related macular degeneration, a progressive eye disease that damages
                    your retina.




wet amd
advanced neovascular amd, a serious type of late amd where new blood vessels
                    grow under the macula. vision loss happens when these vessels leak fluid.




retina
the retina is the part of the eye thatâs in charge of sensing light and
                    sending images to the brain. itâs what gives you the vision you need to do everyday activities like
                    reading and driving.




macula
the macula is the part of the retina that makes vision sharper and gives it
                    more detail.




fovea
the central part of the eye where the center of the field of vision is.




atrophy

                    ga causes cells in your retina to die, which is also known as atrophy.
                  




lesion

                    retinal cell death from ga causes patches of dead cells in the eye, also known as lesions.
