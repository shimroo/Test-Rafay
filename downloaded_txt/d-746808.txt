ambec

ambec conveyor systems and packaging machinery have been trusted in the industry since 1960. in the early days of ambec, the company was known for engineering unique tabletop and accumulation conveyor designs. these systems were constructed of stainless steel and powder coated steel, making them among the most durable in the industry. the ambec brand was built on the spirit of innovation with unrivaled dependability and performance. because ambec conveyors are built to last, many of the products we service today were built well before 2005.
since 2005, the ambec legacy has been part of the bw integrated systems family. customers in the food and beverage, container manufacturing, pharmaceutical and consumer markets depend on ambec conveyors for their superior quality. 
today, more than 60 years later, the spirit of ambec lives on at bw integrated systems.
ambec products
bw integrated systems designs and manufactures ambec conveyors and equipment. the ambec product line includes a broad range of solutions for the packaging industry. these products include high-quality laner machines, conveyors, line controls, accumulation
systems, and more. 
ambec products are well suited for systems integration and can seamlessly be added to any packaging line. the result is a more efficient, more reliable packaging line.
ambec product support & service
