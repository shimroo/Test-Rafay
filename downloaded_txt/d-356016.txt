innovations in display
innovations in display tech bring us closer to the digital world
	













yanko design
this e-ink guitar lets you change its design anytime—no paint required

developed by cream guitars in collaboration with e ink, the voltage davinci features a series of flexible, ultra-thin panels seamlessly integrated into its wooden body. unlike led displays, which require constant power and emit light, e ink technology reflects ambient light, making the visuals appear naturally embedded rather than artificially lit. this means the guitar maintains a sleek, classic silhouette without the bulky look of screens.
				








rave
new planar directlight slim led is only 2” in depth and it can install curved, too!

with an installation depth of less than two inches, the planar directlight slim series supports tightly curved video walls while minimizing color shift compared to other led displays. it is also suited for flat video walls in tight spaces due to its slim profile and front-serviceable design. the series features microled technology and is available in 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 millimeter pixel pitches. it offers a maximum brightness of 1,600 nits and a 4:9 aspect ratio for flexible installation options.

this find my device tracker for android will have an e-ink display, if it ships

the “phototag” is an item tracker that promises to work with both ios find my and android find my device networks when it launches, and its key feature is a color e-ink display that can show additional information. the display is customizable to show contact details, a qr code, and more, as well as just showing a picture of the user’s choosing when the device is in a static state. a red “contact” button changes the screen to show additional details.

clay could power the future of screens

researchers from chiba university in japan have developed an innovative, low-power display device using clay materials that harness electrochemical reactions for light emission and color control. displays using electrochemical reactions offer exciting possibilities. these systems have electrodes and electrolytes. by putting the glowing and coloring molecules on the electrodes instead of the electrolyte, displays can be made more efficient and stable.
				








digital trends
this stunning e ink phone is the stuff of blackberry fever dreams

the minimal phone is the “first e-ink qwerty phone,” proclaims the company. this is not just another minimalist phone with an e ink panel that claims to get your phone addiction in order by serving a less-appealing monochrome panel. this one even adds a physical keyboard to the mix. minimal company has essentially combined the retro yearning for a physical keyboard with the idea of an e-ink screen that will help us tone down our digital addiction habits.

everyone deserves privacy on their mobile phones

oled switchable privacy technology is the first built-in display alternative to the billions of dollars spent on aftermarket privacy screen protectors. specifically, it is a liquid crystal layer embedded in the display panel of any device that directs and controls light from the display to combat against visual hackers, snoopers and shoulder surfers. with the ubiquity of oled in mobile, oled switchable privacy represents an impressive breakthrough in display technology for the mobile segment.
