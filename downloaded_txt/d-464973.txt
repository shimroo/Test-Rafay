"grayboy" welcomes you to our site! we've been online since dos (what?) and windows 3.1 was a big deal. [here's a sample] we publish "how to" material, produce radio talk shows and reflect on "the passing parade" of trends and things. we are retooling, so some of our topic areas are sparse or even blank. give us time, it will fill up. we will soon have a major project done: an audiobook on the nuts and bolts of podcasting!
