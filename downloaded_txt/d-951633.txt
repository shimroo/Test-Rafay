i, and all my original yasgur’s farm members want to thank our dear fans for celebrating with us at our recent “osprey” event on sunday august 25, 2024.
 it was so great to see “forever fans” show up and share music with what has become “yasgur’s family”.
thank you all for coming and presenting such precious memorabilia that you are sharing with me and the band from over so many years.

the self-proclaimed “keepers of the flame”  of the spirit of woodstock* have been playing the music of that era for more than 35 years. their love of this music can be heard on their performances. if you have never seen and heard the band, yasgur’s farm, then you are missing out on the most exciting musical happening since 1969!

*from august 15-18, 1969… approximately 500,000 people gathered at max yasgur’s 600 acre dairy farm for “the woodstock music and arts fair”. it was billed as an aquarian exposition. this festival of peace and 32 acts of music over the course of four days, celebrated the best of the sixties youth culture and came to symbolize a generation.
