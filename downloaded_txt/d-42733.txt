 2 – you may transfer your race to another person up to 2 weeks before race day (both parties must contact the race director to facilitate the change in the system).  you must arrange for the other person, the finger lakes triathlon will not find another racer for you.  3 -  if you agree to volunteer at the race, we will roll your registration over to next year.  please note that this is not an automatic process, you need to contact the race director to cancel your registration and confirm your race roll over and volunteer position at least 10 days before the race.
