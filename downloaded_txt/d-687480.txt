 wow! surgemail rocks!!!
        :) i have setup surgemail as a bastion host for 5 of our primary
        domains. we tried every other mail server out there trying to
        find something that works and that could keep up with our mail
        throughput. 

        i'm blown away by just how good surgemail is! it is processing
        hundreds of thousands of messages per day and scanning every one
        for viruses with rav and giving each one a smitecrc spamdetect
        score. the dual piii 1ghz server is only using 1-5% cpu with
        spikes to 20-30% and only 150mb out of 2gb!!! amazing. 

        if you are looking for a reliable and fast mail server, buy
        surgemail!
