other than
                taking your audience directly to the event, the product, the
                location or the people involved, there is no better way to
                communicate a message and tell a story than by the medium of
                moving pictures and sound.

                a good script defines the message clearly and is the foundation
                for a well-planned, efficient production process. the camera and
                the microphone focus on the essential details, often giving the
                audience a greater insight or understanding of the subject than
                they might gain even if they were there themselves. the entire
                package of editing, narration, graphics, music and direction
                ensure high production values with each creative component
                contributing to the overall emotion and meaning behind the
                story.
