people often comment on the passion i show 
                                      for the work of your story matters. the 
                                      reason i am drawn to it, over the international 
                                      work that held me spellbound for almost 
                                      20 years, was expressed perfectly by ellen 
                                      goodman in one of her boston globe columns 
                                      after what turned out to be a daunting attempt 
                                      to sort her attic contents...

                                      "this packrat has learned that what the 
                                      next generation will value most is not what 
                                      we owned, but the evidence of who we were 
                                      and the tales of how we loved. in the end, 
                                      it's the family stories that are worth the 
                                      storage."
-- ellen goodman, 
                                      boston globe columnist
