i was delighted with the care we received from dr. tufaro and his staff. when our dog was well, they accommodated his special behavioral needs and were very cost-conscious about not ordering unnecessary tests.

the staff and doctor are caring about the pets in their care. overall i wish i could give more stars, but we will be coming back here from now on.

eboni b.







i felt they care about the animals the most, giving an affordable and nonsense-free service. i will be returning, and i am so happy i found them.
