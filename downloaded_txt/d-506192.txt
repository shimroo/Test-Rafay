today i weighed myself and came in at 130 pounds.  when i started i set a goal of 125 pounds.  so only 5 more pounds to go.  i am a long way from where i started, i started at 300 pounds on march 31, 2022, it been about 15 months since i started this diet.  when i started the weight was just melting off, now it takes 2 to 3 weeks per pound, so i have a while to go, maybe 2 or 3 more months.  but it will be worth it.

with summer coming buy, and me still on my diet, i came up with a snack, i have always enjoyed popsicals, so what i am doing now, is i am taking those water enhancers that say they have 0 calories and use that as the flavor for my popsicals, and i have some popsical makers.  it is a nice sweet no calorie treat for the warmer wather.

today i did some meal preping for this week.  cooking both in slow cookers.
first dish, is a ham and veggie soup contianing
ham
potatos
celery
spinish
carrots
onions
veggie stock
with the amount of stuff and what i put in it, the whole slow cooker has about 1200 cals in it, this should make enouph for serveral meals.  i put it on tonight so it will be ready for lunch tomorrow.
next on the menu that i preped a chicken curry
1 pound of skinless chicken breast
onion
celery
potato
curry paste
with those ingrediants the whole slow cooker pot has about 1800 cals in it.  again several meals in there, i figure i can steam up 1/8 cup of rice (the rice i have says 1/4 cup is 160 cals)  i will be putting this on tomorrow morning when i wake up so it will be ready for dinner tomorrow.
i am thinking i can get 4 to 5 days of food out of these 2 slow cookers pots.
man i love slow cookers, they make cooking a large amount of food at once, that gives you a good meal and lots of left overs to enjoy over a period of days.

my backup internet.

in the past i have used a 4g t-mobile hotspot, that was costing me about 50 a month for 10gb of data.  but for that same 50 i could get t-mobiles home internet.  so i cancled the hotspot line and added the home internet for my backup internet.  first they say there is no data cap like my 4g hotspot and it is 5g instead of 4g.  i have tested it, my old 4g hotpost would only get to about 40 or 50 mbit on speed tests, the 5g gets between 150 to 200 mbit.  so while my main internet (verizon) is 1gbit and works well, there are times when any isp does go down, and it nice to have a backup internet.  my router has both a wan1 and wan2 port, and can be setup for fail over.  the router will auto switch over from the main internet to the failover internet within 30 seconds of the main internet going down.
i did not really expect to test it out so soon, but on friday i did loss connection to my main internet, but i did not notice till i looked over to my router and saw the wan1 port not flashing, while the wan2 port was flashing.  so it nice to know that it works so well i did not notice it till i looked at the router and saw the backup internet activity light was going off.  this saved me from having to go into the office when my internet went down, i was able to continue to work from home since the backup internet picked right up with no problem (i went though 6gb in the time till the router switched back over, that would have taken 60% of my data on my old 4g hotspot if i had stayed on it, and it would have cut my productivity down since it would not have had the speed to do what i needed it to do)
so for the same price, i get a much better backup internet.

						published on: january 3, 2023 





for about 3 years i have had cable tv (fios) but i been considering getting rid of it to save some money.  about a week ago verizon sent out a notice that they were raising the rates.  so that put me over the line of considering it to pulling the trigger. for tv here what i have setup now.  first years ago i signed up for google music, now defunct but google moved the subscription to youtube and they had the deal for as long as you keep the subscription you keep the intro price, so i have youtube premium.  i also had funimation and crunchy roll even when i had the cable.  to replace the cable, i picked up an indoor antenna (can not do an outside one as i live in an apartment) and it can pick up 11 local channels.  i also picked up a tablo over the air(ota) dvr.  next i picked up a subscription to sling blue, and t-mobile gave me a year of parimount plus.
to go with those subscriptions, i have a good sized dvd/blueray collection of both general shows/movies, and anima.  i also still have my old vhs deck and my old vhs tapes, to watch too.
along with all of those, i do enjoy watching twitch.
all in all, instead of having to pay more per month on the cable tv, i will be cutting my tv bill by 50 (this is after the free year of paramont plus is over, so for the first year it will be more saved)
also over on the core cutting subredit, someone suggested pluto tv (a free service) and they have shows i would like to watch too.  so i will not be with out tv entertaiment if i want.  plus since i play video games, read sci-fi books (have a nice sized collection) and menga (i also have a good sized collection of this too)  i should not be left wanting any entertainment.  i also have other hobbies i can do, for other down time activities.
along with all of this, since i have amazon prime for the shipping, they also throw in prime video, as service i have never used, but that option is also there for more shows/movies to watch.
nice thing on the tablo ota dvr, i can access it over the netwrok so all 3 of my tvs can pull in the ota tv via my home network, so i just plugged the attanna into the dvr, and plug it into my network and all 3 tvs have ota tv via the tablo app on my tvs.

today i hit an important mile stone on my weight lost journy.  today i hit 154 pounds, why is this number an important one, it is because given my hight of 5 foot 6, that puts me at a bmi of 24.9, or stated otherwise i am no longer medicly over weight now, i hit the normal weight for my hight.  my goal is still 125 pounds so i have 29 more pounds to go.  but i am no longer over weight medicly.  it been a long journy so far, as i started out at 300 pounds.  so to date i have lost 146 pounds.
