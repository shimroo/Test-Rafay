the sewanee pledge


your first official act as a sewanee student is to sign the honor code and pledge to live honorably. in that spirit, we introduce the sewanee pledge, our promise to you.















the sewanee pledge  
sewanee has taken a leading role in making a first-rate education more accessible, making scheduling and advising more personal, and making honor central to life on the domain. now, we have deepened our commitment by adding our pledge to new students.

we pledge—to help sewanee graduates secure good jobs and spots at top graduate programs by providing funding for a summer internship or research fellowship.
we pledge—to help sewanee graduates find their place in an increasingly interconnected world by providing you with access to a semester-long study-abroad program at no additional tuition cost.
we pledge—that you will graduate in four consecutive years (with one major). if you do not, sewanee will provide up to one additional year of study tuition-free.

of course, you will have to do your part, too. but if you meet sewanee’s academic and social expectations, we pledge—we guarantee—to make these opportunities available to you. 









 















 


sewanee's pledge to you

the sewanee pledge takes its name from our honor code ceremony. now it is also our promise to you. sewanee students are provided funding for a summer internship or research fellowship, a semester-long study-abroad opportunity at no additional tuition cost, and the ability to graduate with one major in four years.

if you pledge to do something cool, we pledge to cover the rest. 


the pledge facts













200+
approved study-abroad programs
at sewanee, you have the opportunity to go to all seven continents (yes, even antarctica). the world is becoming increasingly interconnected. we pledge that you will have the opportunity to spend a semester learning more about it.




8
weeks
you will get real-world, hands-on, career-shaping experiences during a summer internship or research fellowship. we pledge to give you an opportunity to spend a summer gaining a better understanding of yourself and the gifts you have to offer.




4
years
do your part, and we pledge that you will graduate in four years. if not, sewanee will provide up to one additional year of study tuition-free. are other schools promising you that? we didn’t think so.
















a global perspective


yes, the world is big, but it’s also increasingly interconnected. learn how sewanee prepares students for life as engaged global citizens.






































office of global citizenship



the office of global citizenship connects sewanee students with the world. are you interested in studying abroad or an international internship or research fellowship? we can help you find the program (and the fascinating international destination) that’s perfect for you.

academics


your voice will be heard, your contribution will be expected, and your opinion will be considered (and disagreed with, and challenged, and seen from a different perspective, and pushed in a new direction—and you know what? maybe we’re both right. see how it works?).

















the academic experience at sewanee is unlike any other. that’s not an empty marketing statement. it’s just a matter of … 


fact













>85%
law and medical school acceptance rates
about 95 percent of sewanee graduates who apply to law school are accepted. more than 85 percent of our recommended pre-health graduates are accepted to medical school (that’s more than double the national average).




9:1
student to faculty ratio
sewanee's not an environment where a professor stands up and lectures while hundreds of students scratch out notes. it's a place where everybody stands up for what they think and what they believe in. don’t forget to bring something interesting to say.




98%
first destinations
sewanee graduates get going. 98 percent of our most recent graduating class are employed, in graduate school, or participating in a fellowship or service commitment within six months of graduation.



























scholarship sewanee: undergraduate research

sewanee’s undergraduate research program gives students the opportunity to explore new ideas, sharpen their research skills, and get a head start on a career or graduate school. almost a quarter of students here were involved in mentored research projects last year, in the sciences (of course)—but also in the arts, english, politics, and more.
students have the chance to wow their peers by giving talks and presenting posters during scholarship sewanee, the annual celebration of student scholarship and creativity. 
perhaps an in-depth study of new anti-cancer pharmaceuticals sounds more appealing. or the effects of missionary work in the south; local bat habitats; the gender wage gap; or the influences of tourism on havana restaurant food sourcing? students dove deep into all of these topics and dozens more last year.

finding your place

sewanee's finding your place (fyp) program introduces new students to intellectual, social, and community engagement projects even before their first semester on campus starts. the program builds skills for academic success and civic potential by bringing students and faculty together in an immersive environment.

my sewanee story: lauren joca

from studying parasitic isopods to ripping two-by-fours with a table saw, lauren joca stays busy. she takes five classes, conducts research in spencer hall, and volunteers with housing sewanee. (somehow, she also manages to catch a sunset or two between commitments.)
at sewanee, you learn by doing, so participating in undergraduate research and civic engagement isn’t too much of a stretch for students like lauren.

the useful summer
by bobby silk

each summer, hundreds of sewanee students travel across the country—and the globe—in pursuit of the same thing: an unforgettable internship experience.
thanks to the sewanee pledge, which guarantees funding for a summer internship or research fellowship, and support from career readiness + student success, sewanee students benefit from unparalleled opportunities to gain firsthand experience in their potential career fields. whether they were involved in groundbreaking medical research, worked behind the scenes on a marketing campaign, or advocated for social good at a non-profit organization, most students returned from their summer experiences with a few things in common. they got a preview of what their professional lives could look like, made connections to help facilitate their future job searches, and—most importantly—had the chance to connect their talents and passions with the opportunities to put them into practice.
here is a sampling of how some sewanee students spent their summers as interns.

campus life


we're a community where everyone has a place and there's a place for everyone. group study? we'll bring our notes. rock climbing? we're geared up and ready. jam session? sure, we'll play with you. whatever you want to do, at sewanee, you'll never have to go it alone. unless you need your space. then, we totally get it.

















where will i live? what's going on? what's to eat? you've got questions?


here are (some) answers.













98%
almost all students live on campus.
during your first year, you will live in one of our 19 residence halls. later, you can also chose from five language houses, several theme houses, a women's center, and a hall for our student firefighters (that's right you can train to fight fires, and build houses, too, but more on that later).




80+
student clubs & organizations 
when you go down the list of amazing clubs & organizations at sewanee, please heed these two words of advice: pace yourself. with club sports, honor societies, art & publication organizations, student government, and emergency services, you'll find at least one thing (or 20) you want to join.

behold how good: a photo essay on belonging
by meredith garrett

belonging is connection. it’s mattering. it’s thriving. at sewanee, we’ve created an environment to foster this sense of belonging. we also know that there is no finality to belonging—it’s continual and evolving. that’s why we’ve built a community full of diverse people whose goal is to walk alongside you no matter what.
have a look at some of the real-life people you’ll meet here on the mountain. they were once where you are now—looking for a new community. see what these folks have to say about their experience. they are actively creating a space for you. come visit to see if sewanee is where you belong.

svfd

good neighbors

sewanee’s flourishing civic engagement program reaches beyond the domain to prove that a crucial part of preparing students for success is giving them opportunities to interact meaningfully with the communities and people around them.
we envision a sewanee where students learn to engage this place and make meaningful change. we offer a constellation of opportunities for students including internships, academic certificates, volunteer opportunities and courses. the office of civic engagement facilitates partnerships between campus and community members to develop relationships, knowledge, and skills that improve our common life across the south cumberland plateau.

the sewanee outing program (sop)


on sop trips, students learn valuable leadership and technical skills while gaining a greater appreciation for the natural world.






































joyce & rob



the sewanee outing program (sop) gives students the chance to explore sewanee’s 13,000-acre campus, the surrounding region, and wilderness areas across the united states.













learn from award-winning professors


in his book the forest unseen, biology professor david haskell uses a one-square-meter patch of sewanee's old-growth forest as a window onto the entire natural world. his writing brings the forest and its inhabitants to vivid life. read an excerpt below.










a polar wind rips across the mountainside, streaming through my scarf, pushing an ache into my jaw. not counting the wind chill, it is twenty degrees below freezing. in these southern forests such cold is unusual. typical southern winters cycle between thaws and mild freezes, with deep chills arriving for a few days each year. today’s cold will take the forest’s life to its physiological limits.
i want to experience the cold as the forest’s animals do, without the protection of clothes. on a whim, i throw my gloves and hat onto the frozen ground. the scarf follows. quickly, i strip off my insulated overalls, shirt, t-shirt, and trousers.
the first two seconds of the experiment are surprisingly refreshing, a pleasant coolness after the stuffy clothes. then the wind blasts away the illusion and my head is fogged with pain. the heat streaming out of my body scorches my skin.
a chorus of carolina chickadees provides the accompaniment to this absurd striptease. the birds dance through the trees like sparks from a fire, careening through twigs. they rest no more than a second on any surface, then shoot away. the contrast on this cold day between the chickadees’ liveliness and my physiological incompetence seems to defy nature’s rules. small animals should be less able to cope with the cold than their larger cousins. small animals cool rapidly because they have proportionally much more body surface than body volume.
the relationship between the size of animals and the rate of heat loss has produced geographic trends in body sizes. when an animal species exists over a large area, the individuals in the north are usually larger than those in the south. this is known as bergmann’s rule, after the nineteenth-century anatomist who first described the relationship. carolina chickadees in tennessee live towards the northern end of the species’ range, and they are ten to twenty percent larger than individuals from the southern limit of the range in florida. tennessee birds have tipped the balance between surface area and body volume to match the colder winters here. farther north, carolina chickadees are replaced by a closely related species, the black-capped chickadee, which is ten percent larger again.
bergmann’s rule seems remote as i stand naked in the forest. the wind gusts hard and the burning sensation in my skin surges. then, a deeper pain starts. something behind my conscious mind is trapped and alarmed. my body is failing after just a minute in this winter chill. yet, i weigh ten thousand times more than a chickadee; surely these birds should be extinguished in seconds.
