nursing the nation and the world





nurses are everywhere. they are legion. the ubiquitous nurse is present in the care of children, the elderly, the disabled, and the dying. nurses don't shy away from responsibility — they embrace it. nurses run towards the metaphorical fire. just as firefighters rush into burning buildings and police officers run towards the active shooter, nurses don their gloves and deal with the sputum, the blood, the pus, the emesis, the feces, and the urine — body fluids be damned, there's work to do and nurses do it.

nurse be nimble, nurse be quick





the notion of pivoting in your nursing career isn't a new one, and that readiness to pivot can emerge from a nimbleness of mind and a willingness to read the tea leaves of your career. nurse, are you nimble?

a strategic and thoughtful approach to transitions in life and career





life is filled with moments of transition: marriage and divorce, birth and death, graduation, dropping out, health crises, comings and goings, and everything in between. how we approach transitions can be influenced by myriad factors, including, but not limited to, our social supports; our emotional, spiritual, and psychological health; and the nature of the transition itself.whether it's a professional/career transition like getting fired or graduating from college, or a personal transition such as the birth of a child or the death of a loved one, transitions and how we tackle them matter greatly in the context of our lives, careers, families, personal development, and overall well-being.

when the career cookies crumble





as a seasoned career coach working with nurses and other healthcare professionals, i often hear stories from my clients that are both heartbreaking and maddening. nurses and nursing students go through so much in their careers, and there can be plenty of pain, struggle, and blood, sweat, and tears along the way. and when things go south and a nurse's career seems endangered, it can be a frightening and worrisome time.

no matter the cause of a nurse's career cookies appearing to crumble, there's almost always a way to get things back to the way they should be. i've seen so many varied scenarios of how a nursing career can take a bad turn, and i've seen many nurses turn it around and get back on top once again.

your nursing career report card





remember the days when you'd run home with your report card to show your parents how you did in school? or were you the kid who hid it at the bottom of your bag so they wouldn't see it? well, your nursing career deserves a report card, too. how've you been doing and what grade do you think you deserve?

what's on your nursing career runway? 





your nursing career can feel like a busy airport, a marathon, a bus terminal, a rickshaw ride, or a taxi careering the wrong way down a one-way street. if your nursing career is an airport, and you're readying your plane on the runway in order to take flight, what's on your runway and who's behind the controls?

feeding your nursing career





your nursing career is a lot like your body; it needs to be fed, watered, exercised, and well-rested in order to function optimally. what kinds of nutrition does your career need? what nutritional deficits does your nursing career demonstrate? are you willing to feed your career as well as you feed your own body?

metacognition: thinking about your thinking about your nursing career





in the world of nursing and non-nursing education, metacognition is a common pedagogical concept for nurse educators to consider when working with students on the path to becoming licensed healthcare professionals. metacognition is at its most basic the act of thinking about your thinking. aside from its commonplace setting of education, metacognition can be also considered in terms of how we approach our nursing careers and professional lives. so let's stop and think about our thinking, shall we?

defining nursing career success on your own terms





every nurse and healthcare professional has the opportunity to define success in their own way. however, how many of us allow our nursing careers to be defined by someone else. how can we seize control of our careers and define success on our own terms?

your nursing career and a latte?





just the other day, i was drinking a latte (decaf---i'm an unapologetic caffeine lightweight), and i realized that there's a very appropriate metaphor related to nurses, nursing, and a perfectly brewed latte. it may sound silly, but it may be more apt than you imagine at first.

spinning it positive in nursing job interviews





nurses, when you're sitting in a job interview for a new nursing position, do you feel like you have to constantly be on the defensive? are you anxious about how to respond to questions that seem to be geared towards creating a crack in the foundation of your career and self-confidence? do you tremble at the thought of verbal swordplay?

your nursing career: intentions and positive change





when the new year begins in earnest, many of us nurses start to consider what we'd like to accomplish in our personal lives and nursing careers. we can run around like chickens afraid that the sky is falling all around us, or we can set our intentions and plan for an inspired year.

the conscious creation of your nursing career 





as the year comes to an end, it's always a good time to pause, reflect, and take stock of the current state of your nursing career. as i've often said in my writing, podcasts, and keynote addresses, you can always choose to allow your career to happen to you, or you can instead take inspired action and make it happen. which sounds better to you?

nurse specialist or nurse generalist?





nurse specialists and nurse generalists are both common within the nursing profession and 21st-century healthcare, and both serve important purposes in patient care as well as non-clinical settings. what does it mean to choose to be a specialist or generalist? what are the repercussions for your nursing career? and how can one accomplish both?

six steps to being a better nurse communicator






one of the most important non-clinical skills for a nurse to develop is strong powers of communication. nursing care is built on the foundation of communication -- both patients and colleagues figure largely in a nurse's world, and being able to listen well and speak your truth clearly is absolutely essential both on the job and in your daily life.

lions, gazelles, and nurses: the herd mentality at work





nursing has a hierarchy of power and experience just like any other profession; in fact, it also has a hierarchy that sometimes feels akin to the laws of survival on the savanna or in the jungle. 

have you ever observed that the less experienced and more vulnerable nurses frequently get left on the outside, often falling prey to bullies and "predators"? this is the herd mentality at its worst, and many novice nurses are taken down by bullies and power-hungry colleagues who eat them alive when they're demonstrating the slightest weakness.

10 strategies for feeding the nurse's inner life





in managing their careers and busy lives, nurses can be very focused on the "outer" aspects of life and work: family, chores, shopping, resumes, job-hunting, pursuing education, social media, etc. but how do we keep the nurse's inner life fed and watered? let's explore ten strategies for cultivating that inner life and nurturing happiness, wellness, and personal/professional balance as 21st-century nurses with very full lives and careers to grow.

genius is relative, nurses!





are you a nurse who sometimes beats herself up because you've focused so much on your specialty practice area that you've lost touch with other aspects of nursing? are you highly skilled at reading ecgs but couldn't interpret an abg (arterial blood gas) if your life depended on it? are you a nurse business owner completely removed from the clinical world? there are all kinds of nurses out there, and you really can't know everything, even if you're a real life nurse polymath. genius is relative, and we all have our own unique brilliance and gifts to bring to the table.
