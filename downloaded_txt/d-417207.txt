welcome!
on the 3rd floor of anderson tower lives a unique group of people. we are the computer interest floor, a special interest housing group at the university of rochester whose interests and activities are as diverse and numerous as our members. with a history going back to 1983, we’re just as involved and dedicated to the university community as when we provided some of the few computing resources on campus.
