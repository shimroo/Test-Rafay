on december 1, 1955, rosa parks made history with a simple yet powerful act of defiance. by refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger in montgomery, alabama, she sparked the montgomery bus boycott, a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. parks’ bravery inspired a nation to fight against racial injustice and reminded the world that one courageous act can create ripples of change. her legacy symbolizes quiet strength and determination in the face of oppression.
