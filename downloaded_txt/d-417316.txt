“as a practicing veterinarian, this word embodies both a reminder and a goal in veterinary medicine. we advocate for patients who cannot speak for themselves and for clients by helping them find meaningful solutions and specialized care for advanced illnesses. but advocacy extends beyond the exam room. tvma serves as a tireless champion for the advancement and protection of veterinary medicine and animal care in texas. the tvma community and leadership advocate for our profession by monitoring and engaging in vital legislative discussions—protecting texas veterinary practice while ensuring quality care for both companion and large animals. tvma welcomes all members with open arms, offering countless opportunities to learn and grow within our veterinary community. thanks to tvma’s dedicated volunteers, i’ve gained invaluable insight into the texas legislative process. their work inspires my deepest gratitude and appreciation."
