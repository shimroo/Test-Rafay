st. paul’s has been an historic community of christian faith since 1749.
it has been opening its church doors to pilgrims since 1750.
it gives deep thanks to the mi’kmaq on whose ancestral lands it was built.
it is committed to ongoing reconciliation with them and their land.
 
in its 275th year, st. paul’s continues to fulfill its primary role as an active anglican parish. with a congregation drawn from throughout the halifax area, we continue to proclaim and to celebrate the good news (the gospel) of christ, in word, sacrament and mission to our neighbourhood: to all who call on the name of the lord, and to all rich and poor, men and women, young and old, and to those of all backgrounds, cultures and life experiences. grateful for the creation of our community above the harbour (1749) and committed to the historic preservation of this ancient ‘house of prayer’, we also rejoice in our spiritual role as a living congregation of the world-wide church.
we confess that christ’s life (his incarnation) in all its parts—birth, life, death, resurrection, and ascension—was the full expression of the love of god in the second person of the holy trinity, the ‘word made flesh’. we confess that through his death and resurrection christ has conquered the powers of evil and death in our lives and in our world—and so leads his people to offer peace, justice and salvation to those around them.
if you are a visitor or an inquirer, we invite you to join us week by week!
 
we invite you to this cbc interview with aly thomson, covering our 275th anniversary:

for more than 14,000 sundays worshippers have gathered here to celebrate christ’s death and resurrection, to read god’s word and to hear it preached from the pulpit, to bring before him the needs of the world and to offer him humble thanks for his goodness.









explore history




st. paul’s is the oldest building in halifax and the oldest existing anglican place of worship in canada. founded by proclamation of king george ii in 1749, the building was erected in the summer of 1750.









find sanctuary




a sanctuary is a place of refuge from danger, and many have entered st. paul’s church with that in mind since the mid-eighteenth century. in its early days the most obviously vulnerable have sought refuge, or been carried to it, during catastrophes—the injured, the dying, the dead.
