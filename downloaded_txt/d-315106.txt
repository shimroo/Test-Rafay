  innertalk is a patented subliminal self-help technology that has been researched by numerous independent universities and institutions and been demonstrated effective at priming how you speak to yourself. innertalk subliminal programs are designed in such a way that the change you desire begins from within as a result of changing the way you talk to yourself, changing that internal chatter from self-doubt and worry to assured confidence and self-composure; thereby changing your expectation, attitude, and perception.
innertalk subliminal self-help programs use a special form of dichotic masking that tasks your brain hemispheres according to their specialty, providing for a whole brain experience. this shadowed masking is often thought of as subliminal, but it is in fact quite different than hiding messages 30, 40 and 50 db beneath the music or nature sounds. indeed, you will hear voices from time to time but you will be unable to discriminate the messages. this method insures that the negative programming that produces automatic negative thoughts or ants, is unable to interfere and argue back against the positive statements, as is usually the instance when using just affirmations.
advancing your mind power
your mind is incredible. the brain has been compared to a computer in a sort of bio-computer analogy. the analogy has powerâbut it is an understatement. science has discovered many of the hard wired connections that appear to give the brain/mind so much control over the body (health, wellness, longevity, youthfulness) and our destinies in terms of success, learning, wealth and prosperity. read more...
