real-lifeif you are looking for something a little different, try an in-home real life session. this session is primarily in black and white with a photojournalistic style. these are about the moments in life that often times get forgotten. this is not about posed photos but about capturing your child's life just as they are today. visit our gallery for samples of real life sessions.
