the time tunnel cartoon

above is the latest cartoon from talented artist gordon foulds, paying tribute to the time tunnel and the master of disaster. 2024 has marked the loss of a major star of irwin allen television, james darren of the time tunnel, whilst on a happier note, the year has coincided with the 50th anniversary of irwin allen's the towering inferno. this cartoon brings the two productions together.


the towering inferno 50th anniversary

monday 16th december 2024 marks the 50th anniversary of the world premiere of irwin allen's blockbuster movie the towering inferno. the premiere was held at the avco center cinema in westwood, los angeles on monday 16th december 1974. before the premiere, regular irwin allen stuntman orwin c. harvey performed a daring stunt, being set on fire, and leaping off the avco cinema center roof. a premiere dinner was held that evening at the hilton hotel in beverly hills.

the new york premiere was held at the national theatre on broadway on wednesday 18th december 1974 followed by a supper party with 500 attendees at the four seasons restaurant, hosted by twentieth century fox chairman, dennis stanfill. the premiere beneficiary was the new york diabetes association. stuntman orwin harvey again performed a stunt jumping off the roof of the national theatre.

the san francisco premiere for the towering inferno was held at two locations, the parkside theatre and the alexandria theatre, on thursday 19th december 1974. the west coast benefit premiere was held in honour of the flame youth program sponsored by the san francisco fire department. the photo above shows two fire engines holding up the banner that would be placed on the front of the alexandria theatre. there was a display and demonstrations of fire department equipment by the san francisco fire department at the premiere. note that many san francisco firemen and residents appeared in the movie itself.

a post-premiere dinner was held at the san francisco mark hopkins inter-continental hotel with 300 attendees including robert wagner, natalie wood, and richard chamberlain. the photo above shows san francisco mayor joseph alioto presenting irwin allen with an honorary fire helmet from the san francisco fire department.

the gala european premiere of the towering inferno was held in london at the warner west end cinema (near leicester square) on 29th january 1975. irwin and sheila allen flew over for the event, accompanied by paul zastupnevich. paul often joked that he went with irwin and sheila on their honeymoon. here is a very special and historic colour british movietone film showing irwin, sheila, and paul's arrival at heathrow and their attendance at the london premiere.




land of the giants bumper stickers
 
as it is halloween week, here are some vintage 1960's halloween themed land of the giants bumper stickers. these would have been a great treat to hand out to children who were trick or treating and wearing their land of the giants halloween costumes (captain burton, dan erickson, giant professor, giant witch, and giant cat). there were also super size 3.5 inch buttons (badges) with the same style of my bag design.

help needed with research 

the main focus of our efforts at the irwin allen news network is to document the history of all of the irwin allen movies and television shows and this implies extensive levels of research. we are particularly trying to credit actors and crew who didn't receive on-screen credits in the productions. 
we are also studying  the movies, trying to identify as many people as possible who appeared on screen and this is proving to be a never-ending challenge. we have recently added a gallery of faces from the poseidon adventure and the time travelers amongst others and have several faces we cannot yet identify. if you can help with any of these missing names with corroborating pictures of the unnamed actors, please contact us.
