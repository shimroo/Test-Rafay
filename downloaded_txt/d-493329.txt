face it movement

child abuse is a bigger threat to kids than all other issues combined. kosair for kids is a protector and advocate for all kids. for years, kentucky recorded the worst volume of instances of child abuse and neglect, by more than double the national average. what began as a gathering of ten organizations in 2013, the kosair for kids face it movement has grown into a partnership of 169 organizations dedicated to ending the scourge of child abuse and neglect in kentucky.
