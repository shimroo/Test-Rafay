disclosing payments to hcps and hcos


as an active member of innovative medicines canada, purdue pharma (canada) joins other member companies in voluntarily publishing aggregated sums of payments made to canadian healthcare professionals (hcps) and healthcare organizations (hcos) to increase transparency about our operations in canada. innovative medicines canada built a reporting framework to ensure consistency in the approach. as a key stakeholder within the canadian healthcare system, the pharmaceutical industry plays an important role with patients, caregivers, healthcare practitioners (hcps), governments, as well as payers in canada.
by bringing greater transparency to these valuable and well-regulated relationships we hope to increase understanding of the research-based pharmaceutical industryâs collaboration across the healthcare sector, and contribute to enhancing trust and value for patients, as well as our healthcare system.
collaboration among hcps, hcos and the pharmaceutical industry is essential to improving the quality of life of canadians as it drives scientific advancements, enhances medical education, and promotes health literacy.

preventing the diversion and abuse of prescription drugs


the appropriate management of pain and addressing the effects of misuse, abuse and diversion of prescription pain medications are both serious public health problems. pain affects millions of people each year. pain medications remain a safe and effective treatment for appropriately selected and monitored patients. unfortunately, misuse and abuse and diversion of pain medications can lead to tragic consequences, including addiction, overdose and death. purdue pharma (canada) has been committed to providing resources to support the responsible use of prescription opioids for pain.
as a pharmaceutical leader in pain medicine, we are acutely aware of the public health risk these powerful medications create, especially when they are diverted, misused and/or abused. that’s why we work with health experts and government agencies on efforts to reduce the risk of opioid abuse and misuse without reducing appropriate pain treatment. at purdue pharma (canada) we support a number of initiatives that address the misuse, abuse and diversion of prescription drugs.

safe disposal of prescription medicine


purdue has been an industry advocate of proper storage and safe disposal of prescription medicine. safe disposal keeps drugs out of the hands of children and other people who might use them inappropriately. it keeps drugs out of landfill sites and water supplies. and it prevents the inadvertent use of unused or expired medications. a proud member of canada health products stewardship association (chpsa), purdue helps to fund nation-wide programs that ensure safe and effective collection and disposal of prescription medications. please visit www.healthsteward.ca for more information.
