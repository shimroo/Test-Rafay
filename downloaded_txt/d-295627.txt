we love our pool. naturally we were nervous about such a big project and how everything would work out. the folks at lang allayed our worries and delivered a magnificent project. everyone at our large family party on july 4th had a ball–they were envious of our pool and our entirely transformed backyard.

we love our pool. chris and the entire staff at lang were so professional and a pleasure to work with. there was total communication thru every step of the process and there was never any unanswered questions. the pool came out beautiful — simple and elegant. our favorite option was the salt water generator. it is so gentle on your eyes, skin and bathing suits and we especially love the low maintenance of the system. again, we could not have hoped for a better experience than dealing with the wonderful people that make up lang pools.

we have had two pools installed by lang pools and have been pleased with both. we have recommended lang pools to our friends.

our experience with lang pools ranks as the best construction project we’ve ever undertaken. chris lang prepared an estimate very quickly and gave us a very competitive price. he walked us through every step of the pool building process from preparation of plans and filing with the town to construction and signoff. chris told us that the job would take three weeks and it was completed within that schedule. lang pools also gave us a number of other reliable contractors to perform related work such as the pool deck, stone retaining wall and landscaping.
lang pools also does our pool service and gives us the same great attention to detail as they did during the construction process. we have recommended lang pools to a number of our friends-they even built a pool for friends in our old neighborhood in brooklyn, ny!
we would recommend lang pools for any pool project

lang pools is the most reliable pool service i’ve ever had. i became one of chris lang’s first customers back in the mid-90’s and have been very happy with my service ever since.

we finished construction on our pool for the summer of 2009. nick vitiello was so helpful in providing design ideas for us and staying on top of the build from day one until me and my family jumped in june of 2009. our pool came out beautiful and has been a recreational joy for my family. the follow up service and yearly maintenance has also been outstanding. nick and his crew have always been there for anything we have ever needed and any questions we have ever had. lang does build relationships!!

i wanted to take a moment to let you know how pleased my family and i have been with all aspects of our lang pool experience.from our first meeting with chris in your office last january to opening day over memorial day weekend (as promised), the process went exactly as explained, and you and all of your colleagues were more than happy to answer any question we had along the way (and there were many).
this is my very first swimming pool, and i have to admit that i was a little nervous about it. the cost; the mess during construction; the maintenance; the chemicals. all the nightmares i had heard growing up from friends who had pools. but you guys made the whole experience a pleasure. you explained all the costs up-front, including any extras that we might incur along the way (there were none); your construction crew was neat, courteous and professional; your state of the art equipment keeps maintenance to a minimum (30-45 minutes per week); and the new automatic chlorinator totally eliminates the need to add chemicals.
but best of all is the finished product. i can’t begin to describe how nice it is to look out into my back yard, and see the deck, the fence, and the crystal blue water. our property has never looked so nice. and we use the pool almost every single day. during the week, jennifer and i swim laps when we come home from work, and the whole family swims from morning till night on the weekends. we spend a lot of quality family time together now that we have something that we can all enjoy together! it’s like having a vacation spot in our backyard.
