ethical whale watching with espaço talassa 




we believe that espaço talassa offer the very best whale watching experience in the azores and here's why : 






we have almost 30 years of experience of whale watching in the azores.      


we are based in lajes do pico, recognised as one of the top 10 best spots for whale watching in the world


we use small and efficient boats with limited size groups in order to limit the impact on wildlife.


our whale watching trips have a strong educational element with multimedia briefings before each trip and debriefings on return to shore.


we have our own exclusive lookout post, the watchtower of queimada, directing a maximum of 4 whale watching boats. 


espaço talassa is an ethical company with a responsible travel policy that works to limit their ecological footprint & with social programmes designed to benefit young and underprivileged local people.


we don't offer swimming with dolphins as we believe it is too intrusive for the animal.
