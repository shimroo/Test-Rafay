the worst person in the world today






suffice it to say that i had a horrible day. i’m angry and pissed. work is a bitch sometimes. fuck it. we must just soldier on. tomorrow will be a different day with different people and different problems, plus crossfit. what was i thinking?


i tried to shut it all off today. i watched a movie that was meant to put me to sleep. i played with my grandson. i talked to my boys, my wife and a few friends. it did not work. i’m still here and my mind is doing hate flips. today, the hate is real. 



let go of hate… it’s the right thing to do, but it’s so hard. there are so many horrible people in the world, and not just the idiots from my day, but those that intrude on my thoughts via my media habit. i could make a list. i did...



ken paxton, the attorney general of texas. he wants to put a bobby more, a mentally disabled murder, to death. paxton, for many reasons, is a horrible person, he made my list for today. his unsupported quest to kill a disabled black man can best be described as murder. 



katelyn mcclure, mark d’amico and johnny bobbitt jr. are all horrible people. they concocted a scheme predicated on a lie and all for money. people want to believe the fairy tail, but how can we believe when the heroes of the story are horrible people? 



mathew whitaker, where do i start? everything about the man screams horrible partisan hack and huckster. he advised a company that scammed investors. what pisses me off the most is the damage he is doing to our country. we should be rioting. whitaker is horrible and his appointment is a disgrace. 



at least nuon chea, “brother number two” and the definition of horrible, was brought to justice. genocide… it took too damn long. can we still execute people by being hanged, drawn and quartered? i can think of a whole nation full of people that would be willing to pull the ropes. 


brett kavanaugh got a standing ovation from the org that created him. the federalists society makes the list along with kavanaugh. all horrible. everyone. every. damn. one. unless we have a miracle, kavanaugh will be on the list for decades. 



how about racist public official louis klemp spouting nonsense about the master race? yes. the stupid and the hate is real in kansas. 



there are so many more, assuage, trump and mattis, but who is the worst today? there are so many choices and tomorrow is another day.

a she-monster escapes accountability





dylan mcewen acted in and created graphic child pornography, but a canadian judge decided that women cannot be pedophiles and let her off easy. you know, because science. 

but what the presiding judge would not do was declare mcewen a dangerous offender, which the crown had sought and with impassioned urgency.
 - via thestar.com
i facepalmed when i read the article. it's wrong-headed. the judge should have focused on mcewen’s acts. she acted like a pedophile. she should be treated like one. science does not exclude the possibility of a female pedophile and we have ample evidence of women committing these acts. put dylan mcewen of the pedophile registry. she deserves the recognition.

wait… what? 





i read the news on saturday mornings and sometimes i scratch my head and say to myself,  "wait… what?" take this article: oakland police will stop asking recruits if they were sexually assaulted. it’s 2018. do we really have policies like this one in place? how wrongheaded does something need to be before our leadership takes action? this policy stopped female and minority applicants from joining the oakland police force. it’s a clear roadblock to progress and equality. mayor libby schaaf did the right thing here. we should celebrate people like her. doing the right thing… we should always do the right thing. thanks mayor schaaf… now, can you we do anything about international avenue?

not so proud to be an american








my first read of the day. my reaction was, “are you kidding me?”

a pair of native american brothers who had traveled seven hours to tour colorado state university this week had their visit cut short after a parent on their tour reported them to the campus police. - via www.nytimes.com

revisiting hypocrisy








it’s hard to completely disconnect from blogging. it was such an important part of my life for over a decade. as i read the news, i feel compelled to comment on the issues the piss me off. my interests have not changed. i loath hypocrisy, but i’ve noticed that politics is starting to become rival religion. a lot of this has to do with president trump, but also think that the hypocrisy of our political reality is in the front of my mind as well. 

i’ve noticed a lot of pastors making the news. i see that the clergy sexual abuse continues unabated. i used to think that perhaps i was making some small difference, but i see now that this was not case. the cases keep hitting the news. 



baptist pastor and high school teacher joseph “joey” smith was arrested for statutory rape. the orginal newspaper article listed smith as a pastor, a subsequent edit removed that from the article. i’m guessing that valley view baptist church in whitwell, tn might have concerns about tainting it’s reputation? 



pastor gerardo “jerry” martinez of miricle christian church in new port richey was arrested for sexual battery against a 17-year-old parishioner. he convinced her parents to let her stay after a servcie so he could pray over her. the parent heard “pray over her.” i’m thinking the pastor said “prey on her.” why else would parents turn their daughter over to a pastor without supervision and why would they allow it continue over several months? the parents were not arrested for neglect, but they get to deal with knowledge that they failed as parents. 

martinez is an excon truned pastor who teaches spiritual healing. he was trying to cure the victim of demon possession. becuase, that’s a thing. 



the church of england has another scandal with the rev stennett kirby, who was caught on video using cocaine and watching porn. oops. rev. stennett is on sick leave while the church investigates. nobody was hurt, let the dumb bastard watch porn in peace. 



rev. brian sean dicken was arrested for taking indecent liberties with an underage girl. dicken was the pastor at church of christ at mountain view, where the alleged abuse took place. any mention of dicken or his arrest was removed from the church website (i looked). they don’t even list anyone working at the church, just this message, “our team consists of elders and ministers as well as other select members who work in harmony with each other to lead the ministries of ccmv.”

the article about the arrest is behind a paywall, so i don’t have much more. i’m not going to subscribe to winchester star for one damn article. 



these four were just a few of the pastors clogging my feed. if you want an eye-opening experience, read the pastor arrested subreddit on reddit. check this out…

priest accused of sexually abusing a 12-year-old
pastor arrested, accused of raping teenage boy, breaks silence
arrested pastor please guilty to sexually assaulting 5 juveniles
ex-pastor pleads guilty to hidden juvenile bathroom camera case
ex-priest who fled to philippines pleads not guilty to sexually abusing kids
former youth pastor charged with child exploitation, possessing child porn




the arrests just keep coming. this will never end.

and so passes a demon





i am happy to hear this news. every day he lived was a slap in the face of the victims of clergy sexual abuse. cardinal bernard f. law, whose stature as archbishop of boston and america’s senior roman catholic prelate was shattered in a maelstrom of scandal, acrimony and resignation in 2002 after revelations that he had protected abusive priests for years, died wednesday. he was 86 and lived in rome. - via www.nytimes.com

the christian machine





this is a fascinating article about evangelical author and speaker jen hatmaker’s fall from favor. her sin… she did not support trump. it’s worth a few minutes just to see how the christian machine works. “this year i became painfully aware of the machine, the christian machine,” she wrote in april on her blog. it was good friday, a somber day for christians to observe the crucifixion of jesus. hatmaker wrote that she understood now the machine’s “systems and alliances and coded language and brand protection,” not as the insider she had long been, but “from the outside where i was no longer welcome.” during the election season, she added, the “christian machine malfunctioned.” it laid bare the civil war within her christian community. - via politico magazinehorrifying.

a church cover-up of sexual assault





the pastor of a church in hamilton montana allegedly urged the victim to not report sexual assaults to the police as the pastor was more interested in protecting the rapists because he was a sex addict. “the pastor then asked for all the details of their sex life and specific instances where defendant forced himself on her. female 1 reported that the pastor urged her not to make any reports to law enforcement, tell other members of the church, or defendant’s place of employment,” the affidavit continued. - via www.rawstory.comthe pastor’s name and the church’s name are protected in the reports i’ve seen. hamilton is a small city with a lot of churches, but i’m willing to bet it’s a baptist church. the alleged rapist is seth wirick, 30 of hamilton montana.
