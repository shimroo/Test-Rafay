applied mathematics re-structuringmathematics and applied mathematics are joining forces!

the applied mathematics department was re-structured, administratively, in july 2021.
all undergraduate and graduate programs in applied mathematics are continuing as usual, but will now be administered as part of the department of mathematics. faculty members specializing in applied mathematics have also joined the department of mathematics. the math department is excited to welcome these "outward-facing" mathematicians to our faculty complement! programs and faculty specializing in theoretical physics and scientific computing have moved to the department of physics & astronomy. engineering math inquiries should be directed toward the department of physics & astronomy.
