“i booked a party last weekend june 5th for my son's 5th birthday. our handler was kristin and i just wanted to write to say how much we all enjoyed the experience. my son was so excited and he is still talking about the party. i must say it took me sometime to convince my husband to go along with this party but to his surprise he really enjoyed it (he even held the snakes).
 again, i really do appreciate everything. ”

“dear mr. clint, this was definitely the best birthday patrick has ever had!! the way you handled your beautiful snakes was impressive enough, but the way you handled the 20+ screaming kids was a truly amazing feat!! they had so much fun and learned so much, too. i can¹t thank you enough. i¹ll do my best to spread the word. ”
 -your huge fan, holly


“thank you for a fantastic presentation last tuesday evening in lincoln. your topic mix of animal behavior, identification techniques, medical/clinical, etc. was educational and entertaining. you really impressed my six-year old son, both with your instructions regarding what to do when you see a snake and with the opportunity to handle a variety of snakes--especially hurricane joe.”
 -vincent


“clint, i wanted you to know how wonderful you were on saturday. it was one of the best parties we have ever had! i can not stop telling people and e-mailing the pictures to friends. this from a woman who really did not care for snakes at all! michelle was great at communicating with me and you were right on time and i am sure stayed longer than you should have. keep up the great work!”
 -robin


“clint, thank you for your wonderful presentation at naomi's birthday party on sunday. everyone had a terrific time and the kids were still talking about the snakes when they returned to school on tuesday. the photos of the kids are amazing and their expressions are priceless as they held the snakes. i still cannot believe that my daughter was so willing to reach into a bag and pick up a snake!!  thanks again for providing a very unusual birthday party--it is one we will remember for a long time!!”
