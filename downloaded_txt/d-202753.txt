the $10 credit freeze.

september 22, 2017 david 


in the wake of equifax hack and other ss number holders, i thought it time to do a another security freeze.  
i’ve done this to my account before, when i had a few accounts opened in my name.   during that time,
creditors would have to call me before opening an account. 
this new freeze, cost $10 for 7 years.  free to cancel it anytime.
the fees vary by state
now, i don’t plan to open any credit cards or buy a house, or even get a store card.  if that applies to you,
consider the credit freeze!
