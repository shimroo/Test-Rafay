helen volk
after 26 years personally helping people let go and de-clutter their lives, i retired from the hectic pace of running a successful business.
after a few years of giving my attention to other matters, many requests for de-cluttering help over the years, and the massive changes in how we live which have generated yet more questions about de-cluttering and organizing our space, i’ve decided to bring back beyond clutter to do on-line programs.
i’m currently in the development stage and will let you know when i am ready with new on-line workshops and other programs.
for books to help you work through clutter issues on your own, you can purchase my ebooks through amazon.com. go to my books page for more information, or put “helen volk” in amazon.com’s search engine.
i am grateful for all the support i had from clients, students, organizations and the media. i wouldn’t have been so successful so quickly without your faith in me and my work.
i look forward to new beyond clutter – and other – adventures.
thank you!
