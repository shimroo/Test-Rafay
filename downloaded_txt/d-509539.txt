no fees unless you win



in personal injury cases, we charge no fee until and unless we win your case.
this means that if you hire us, you will not pay any attorney fees until we settle your case or obtain a verdict for you.







how we will win your case

with decades of successful experience, the lawyers of the law offices of bailey & burke have earned an excellent reputation and respect of their peers in the legal community as well as among judges and opposing attorneys.
we accept accident cases with varying degrees of injury and damages, and each one receives the full support and personal attention of our legal staff. we follow every reasonable lead, hire the best available experts, and utilize the most current and innovative technology to give you an edge over the opposition. we employ the latest techniques to clearly demonstrate the severity of the injuries sustained by our clients. by thoroughly preparing and clearly demonstrating all the injuries and damages sustained by our clients, most of our cases are favorably settled out of court without going to trial.










$8.4 million verdict
insurance bad faith claim – our client was in a car accident sustaining serious and lifelong injuries. total insurance coverage that was available to the person responsible for the accident was $300,000. the insurance company did not make a prompt and reasonable settlement offer. they denied liability and offered $0.00. after a lengthy trial in the federal court the judge found that the insurance company committed bad faith and ordered the insurance company to pay $8.4 million to our client.







$7.5 million judgment
car vs suv- our client a 20-year-old female was driving a car and went through a stop sign. her car was t-boned by an suv. our client sustained multiple fractures, permanent scarring and a traumatic brain injury. we settled her claim against the driver of the suv for his insurance policy limit and brought a liquor liability claim against the bar that served her alcohol. when the claim could not be settled we filed suit in the worcester superior court. the case resulted in a judgment of $7.5 million.







$1.75 million – structured settlement.
brain injury – passenger v. driver – an automobile driven by a teenager was speeding, left the roadway and collided with a tree, causing our client, a rear-seat passenger to sustain a head injury. after we filed suit against the teenage driver and his parents, we structured a settlement for our client with a guaranteed payout of 1,750,000.







full insurance policy limit was recovered
wrongful death – pedestrian v. auto – our client was walking on the side of a roadway and was struck by a drunk driver. our client, a father of two children, died as a result of the injuries he sustained. a claim was brought against all responsible parties and the case settled out of court for the full amount of the insurance coverages. after settlement we established a trust to provide for his minor children.
