subject:oh yeah, i have a live journal
security:public
mood: amused

i got kind of curious about what was going on in everyone's lives, and then i figured an update from me might be somewhat overdue.um...last time i left off i guess i had gotten somewhat settled in here in orlando, but then mike and rei turned out to be pricks and most of the people i knew were mutual friends and that kind fucked things up since i stopped talking to them.well, since then i met some new people, dated a girl for a few months, decided i'd rather be a software engineer than a mechanical engineer, decided to move to tn after my 21st, did a lot of partying and crap like that until i realized it wasn't me (and recently took up reading again, which felt amazingly good), decided to try and recover some of the passion for life that life had kind of killed in me, started playing table-top rpgs (vampire and dnd so far, with a besm game coming up, despite that i got sucked into all of this with the intention of playing mage), decided i'm moving to montreal after i get my degree (for a few years anyway), decided to try and have a tri-city twenty-first birthday party (in orlando, pensacola, and new orleans), doubled the size of my collection of industrial music, and became painfully addicted to 4chan and ed.kind of half-assed, but anything moar would result in a lot of tl;dr anyway. so, live long and prosper, good night and good luck, update again in another 6 months or so.

so i just saw the most attractive girl in all of the flying spaghetti monster's glorious creation at my apartment complex this morning.i was walking back from walgreens and she was by the office waiting for the shuttle. i decided to try for the highly improbable possibility of getting showered, dressed, and packing my backpack before the shuttle came so i could talk to her.somehow i managed a feat i never had before and probably never will again and managed to put away the stuff i'd just gotten, showered, dressed, and everything else in what must have been about three minutes and got to the shuttle just as it was leaving.unfortunately she sat on the little row thing in the front instead of the regular seats. i sat next to her, she smiled and seemed nice, but between her having had headphones on and the fact that i had a person on the other side of me as well, i couldn't find any way to start a conversation without seeming really weird.but yeah. i am going to talk to this girl at some point now and do it without seeming really creepy. this is my goal.

"there's no such thing as a soul.we humans are lucky, we're above such things.we aren't bound by any eternal soul, we have the ability to choose who we are at any given time, and to be anyone we'd ever want to be.we aren't bound to our lonely, isolated egos for all eternity, talking to dead relatives and floating around in the clouds, we're given the chance to become god, to die and become nothing, and thus become one with everything."

i want to dye my hair black again. the last dying seems to have faded really quickly. it might not have been permanant dye though, i did the whole thing on impulse and didn't really pay attention to anything like that.it seems i'm stuck in pensacola until next week. kind of cool, since i'll have time to do absolutely nothing. on the other hand, it will kind of suck, because if i were in tn i could be working so i'm essentially wasting money by being here any longer than necessary.and i've been complaining about this endlessly, but again, i have way too much crap, and it's all disgustingly dusty.

my party was better than i thought it was.i was pissed because i thought it only lasted for about three or four hours, but it turns out i blacked out for a couple of hours so it was actually a lot more substantial than i thought.

so the party is done with. the cleaning still has only just begun.i don't feel like writing and i don't really remember the details too well anyway, but in a nutshell, it was a good party, in fact, ignoring the end i might even go so far as too say great party. it probably wasn't significantly better than one i could have had at someone else's house though and probably wasn't worth at least $80 in booze and various expenses and a solid two days of cleaning.i'm just glad i have good friends though that returned some order to things after people started going nuts, as i was dead to the world within the first hour or two.and thanks to anyone who showed up. i hope you didn't get punched by anyone or that i didn't lean on you too much.

i finished my last final yesterday and can hopefully enjoy a week of slack before i need to really get moving on moving. after my physics final i went and got coffee with matt and harrassed him to come back to the internet where the cool people are. seeing him again was nice. now on my agenda: laundry. it might not sound like too much slack, but you can't even imagine how much i've been looking forward to having the time to actually wash my laundry again.

...i really hate the way thunderbird defaults to one of my particular email addresses when i'm sending mail, so that when i'm sending a rather official email, one that the reply from which will decide the next four years of my life, to a person with a french sounding name who is probably a québécois and staunch catholic, it comes from "rosycrucifixion@cox.net".god dammit i'm an idiot.

subject:the zinfandel abomination...
security:public
mood: tired

so, having one of those rare instances last night of being in possession of both time and money, i decided to go bug randy to procure alcohol for me for my party (still two weeks away but i had time then so i figured why not). i was going to drive him but an old friend of his called him who had just gotten back in town after being away from pensacola for two years, so we wait for her to show up and we all go in her suv since my metro doesn't like having more than two passengers. we get to the store closest to randy's house and the actual store is closed and all that's opened is the drive-thru.were i driving i would have just gone somewhere else, but i didn't want to be rude and bother randy's friend to go somewhere else so i just went along with the idea of going through the drive-thru. so we pull up to the window and randy attempts to order what i'd asked for, only, this whole situation being rather rushed and confused, i hadn't given him all of the details and he didn't remember a lot of what i had told him. so we have this terrible situation of randy sitting there trying to order the liquor, not knowing what i want, and thus just waffling and irritating the woman working there. eventually he has the rather clever idea of asking me for "advice" on what "he" should get, and so we have this ridiculously transparent exchange that goes something along these lines:pissed off employee woman: "umm...okay what sizes do you want?"randy: "ummm....err...*looks over at me* what do you think i should get?"me: "well...um....what's that size that's smaller than a liter?"randy's friend: "a fifth?"me: "er, sure, yeah, you should probably get that size...in my opinion."randy: "okay...everything in a fifth."pissed of employee woman: "is that everything?"randy: "..."me: "...yeah."randy: "yeah."*woman walks off*me: "oh, hey, i also really wanted to get a bottle of wine, could you ask if they have a good table wine or a pinot noir?"*randy and everyone else in the car say ask something along the lines of "what are you talking about?" and "why would you want wine? drink beer!"*pissed off employee woman: "okay that will be fifty f--"randy "hey, uh, could i get some wine too?"*pissed off employee woman kind of stares blankly*me *whispering and still attempting to be discrete for some reason*: "just ask for whatever is the best table wine."*randy says something i couldn't hear**woman walks off**woman comes back with large bottle of wine*pissed off employee woman: "that good?"randy: "sure."me: "um..."at the time i figured since it didn't come in a box or a jug it would probably be safe, but after inspecting it i discovered it to be a pale red zinfandel that's very sweet, meant to be drank cold, and was described (in one of the very few positive remarks i found about it) as very "chuggable."...yeah...not quite the chianti or pinot noir i was hoping for. however, i haven't actually tasted it yet, and if nothing else it was all incredibly amusing in its stupidity.

i just realized i really need to update my interests on here. i don't think they've changed since i was sixteen (when i made this journal i just copied and pasted them from my old one).nothing really happening. i'm just going through the motions, trying to get through these last few weeks of school with a decent grade. the only thing really exciting to me at the moment is planning the going away party i'm throwing. thinking about it and planning it this much will probably only lead to dissapointment and wasted effort (you can't plan parties after all, at least not after the age of ten), but it gives me something to look forward to and keep me going through these last few weeks (kingsport is not really something i look forward to. i'm not really attached to pensacola except through a few of my friends, but kingsport is possibly worse. where i'm going after that i'm looking forward to, but that's too far away for me to get too into at the moment).
