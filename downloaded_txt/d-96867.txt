                                    baggett can offer
                                    you
                                    or your
                                    client...
                                

                            curt has examined documents and/or testified in
                            every state in the usa and over a dozen
                            countries. he has offered opinions on over 5,000
                            cases since 1990 and has appeared in court as
                            an expert witness nationwide on those cases that
                            needed his testimony.
                            

                            curt baggett has appeared on such respected national
                            tv programs as cnn, cnbc, and even
                            "texas justice" and "judge alex".
                            

                            curt baggett is court qualified and certified by the
                            american bureau of document examiners
                            and the american institute of applied science.
                        
 

                            actually, in over 90% of our
                            (client cases)
                            , our forensic document
                            examiners never have to appear in court, saving our
                            clients hundreds of dollars in court and
                            court preparation fees. because of our understanding
                            of the law and the exhibits we provide, the opposing
                            side often settles out of court or drops
                            the case altogether. we have the experience,
                            knowledge, and skill to help you or your attorney
                            prove a
                            forgery
                            or not, to help
                            build a case for
                            fraud
                            , or to obtain freedom for the falsely accused. we
                            are the nation's
                            top handwriting experts.
                        




                            as world wide court qualified
                            
                                forensic

                            , (handwriting experts) we know how tricky the
                            opposition can be. we
                            can guide you to the truth about the handwriting and
                            hopefully to victory. attorneys love to
                            work with us and fear being on the wrong side of our
                            testimony.
                        

                            unlike many "
                            forensic document examiners
                            " who routinely charge $1200
                            or more to just look at your document,
                            
                                i

                            for most people, this is all they need to decide on

                                        marriage and my army career! it was
                                        really hard to prove when a forger
                                        signed my
                                        name and made it look like i did it!
                                        thanks to you the truth will prevail.
                                        thanks a million again and again!

                                        today and he reiterated that the irs
                                        revenue officer was further persuaded in
                                        his

                                        of your finding that my signature had
                                        been forged on the tax return. as my
                                        attorney
                                        put it, "that was money well
                                        spent." i thank you so much for
                                        that.
