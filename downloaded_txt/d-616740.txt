fema halts rule that protects against future floods 
bynews editor 
february 14, 2025february 18, 2025 



we already know what the cycle of flood-rebuild-repeat looks like. this means that billions of dollars in disaster aid will be wasted and people will be put in harm’s way.
 

 






from the director’s desk | policy matters 

rising to the challenge: ensuring flood resilience in an era of change 
bychad berginnis, cfm 
february 13, 2025february 18, 2025 



in this column, i want to focus on how we, individually and collectively, can rise to the challenge and ensure that flood resilience remains a cornerstone of public safety and prosperity.


 






research & reports 

throwing the numbers out with the bathwater 
bychristopher taormina, cfm 
february 12, 2025february 12, 2025 



the convenience of bathtub modeling allows for quick calculations over large areas, but  water, and subsequently flooding events, do not behave this way.

bynews editor 
february 11, 2025february 11, 2025 



this year marks 20 years since hurricane katrina, making new orleans a fitting place to reflect on past challenges, celebrate resilience, and explore the latest advancements in flood risk management.
