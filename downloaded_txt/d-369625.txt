baking for people & planet.




    our purpose
  














real bread, no shortcutsour certified organic, sourdough breads are made with water, salt and organic wheat, transformed through the unhurried magic of fermentation. in a world that moves fast, we proudly go slow.




    our breads
  


















































family founded, future forward



from our humble beginnings as a family bakery in the catskills, we’ve dedicated ourselves to sourdough, people, and planet. over 40 years in, we work hard to serve folks simple, honest breads and foods that speak to the best in us.




    our story
  






































where to find usour breads are available throughout the northeast at grocery stores, at our nyc farmers’ markets, and at our hudson valley cafes. we strive to make good bread available for all.

sourdough for allnot all bread is created equal. long fermentation leads to bread that is better for your health, naturally longer lasting and tastes delicious, without nasty preservatives. we believe the world deserves more real, honest bread.




    why sourdough?
  


















































our hudson valley cafeswe operate cafes in boiceville, rhinebeck, and woodstock featuring breads and pastries from our carbon-neutral bakery. we serve foods that embrace approachable sustainability, prioritizing plant-forward options, sourcing local produce during the hudson valley growing season, and working with mission-aligned purveyors.
