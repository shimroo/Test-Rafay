agreement on the nile river basin cooperative framework









 
 



the text of the cooperative framework agreement (cfa) outlines principles, rights and obligations for cooperative management and development of the nile basin water resources.  rather than quantifying 'equitable rights' or water use allocations, the treaty intends to establish a framework to "promote integrated management, sustainable development, and harmonious utilization of the water resources of the basin, as well as their conservation and protection for the benefit of present and future generations".
