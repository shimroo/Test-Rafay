national black farmers association president, john boyd, called today a huge win, historic $2b payout for discrimination in farm lending  



boydton, va, usa, /prnewswire/ -- national black farmers association baskerville, va., july 31, 2024/ -- the national black farmers association (nbfa) has championed a major victory for african american farmers and their families in the united states. after years of protests, lawsuits, and failed bills, the organization, led by president john boyd, has successfully secured a $2.2 billion payout for discrimination in farm lending from the united states department of agriculture (usda). this historic payout comes as a result of the inflation reduction act (ira) section 22007, signed into law by president biden nearly two years ago.approximately 43,000 farmers will each receive payouts of up to $500,000, with the average award being $82,000. these funds are meant to provide financial assistance to farmers who have experienced racial and other forms of discrimination from the usda prior to 2021. this victory marks a significant step towards justice for black farmers, who have long been fighting against systematic discrimination in the farming industry. the nbfa, founded by john boyd 40 years ago, has been at the forefront of this fight and has led the way in advocating for change.boyd reflects on the long and difficult road to this victory, stating, “no matter how it is sliced, the $2.2 billion in payouts is historic. in 1999, black farmers received a $1 billion payout. in 2013, a $1.25 billion payment was made in a late filers’ lawsuit settlement” the nbfa has also been instrumental in paving the way for similar settlements with hispanic, women, and native american farmers, as well as the related cobell case settlement.despite the progress made with this payout, boyd acknowledges that there are still challenges faced by black farmers. these include banks denying them access to operating funds and farm ownership loans, as well as recent allegations of racial discrimination by companies like john deere. however, he sees this victory as a symbol of hope for those still fighting for justice.boyd’s decades-long lobbying campaign has not been without its challenges. he has faced hateful phone calls, mail, and even death threats throughout the years, but his determination to fight for the rights of black farmers has never wavered. he emphasizes that this payout was not a blanket settlement, and that a neutral third-party administrator, midtown group, has carefully evaluated each farmers case. the application process was lengthy and complex, compounding the pain and frustration felt by many farmers.as boyd reflects on the long journey to this victory, he questions whether it was all worth it. but his answer is a resounding ‘yes.’ he explains, “the answer is an unqualified ‘yes’ just for the few moments today of listening to stephen benjamin, senior white house advisor and director of public engagement, share the details regarding award notifications and check disbursement to dfap applicants. “this victory is not just for the nbfa, but for all black farmers and their families who have endured discrimination and struggled to make ends meet.”to learn more about this historic victory and the ongoing work of the nbfa, please contact john boyd via email johnwesleyboydjr@gmail.com. the national black farmers association is a non-profit organization dedicated to advocating for the rights and well-being of african american farmers and their families. through education, advocacy, and support, the nbfa fights for civil rights, land retention, access to loans, and economic development for black farmers across the country.contact: information@prnewswire.com














boyd collaborates with kj marley to address white farmer claims of reverse discrimination & lawsuits blocking $5billion in debt relief 















boydton, va., nov. 22, 2021 /prnewswire/ -- white farmers are suing for reverse discrimination to prevent $5billion in emergency relief for black, native american and other farmers of color. civil rights leader john boyd and kj skippa mak marley collaborated with kara brewer boyd, association of american indian farmers, to release a song "the land" to highlight historical and ongoing broken promises, broken treaties, racial discrimination and land loss suffered by native americans and black farmers in the us.

"the land" featuring john boyd jr. and kj skippa mak marley speaks volumes to the challenges we still face.john boyd, jr., founder and president, national black farmers association, 4th generation black farmer in mecklenburg county, virginia  sued the us dept of agriculture (usda) and received a fact of finding  for racial discrimination which led to the 1st usda discrimination  settlement by an individual. boyd went on to assist 10,000s of other  black and minority farmers to file discrimination complaints, lawsuits  and class actions against usda. farming is our oldest occupation. in  freedom we treasured having land to work for ourselves, our families and  racial progress. "forty acres and a mule," was an embedded aspiration.



kj "skippa mak" marley, son of kymani marley,  is an international hip-hop artist infusing reggae and dancehall, while  invoking the unmistakable musical spirit of his legendary grandfather bob marley to speak truth to power."i  think it's shameful on behalf of white farmers who didn't reach out to  me to say they have any sort of issue with this—they went straight to  federal court," boyd said.the american rescue plan act (arpa) of  2021 program represents remedial relief for black farmers who have had  to fight usda discrimination through the courts to get loans in the  first place. "this is not 'reparations' as it's been explained by white  farmers, it's not a 'windfall,' it's not a new loan program," he said."in  30-plus years of advocacy, i have never seen this level of racial  tension in america. as i strive to encourage a new generation, time is  against us. it's been white farmers the whole time who have gotten debt  relief from usda, and all of these years it was black and other farmers  of color who were not getting it. that's why i went through the courts  and congress to get remedial action. it finally passed under the covid  spending bill," boyd said."i never heard them say it was harmful  when they got debt relief," said boyd. "it's a continuation of what  black farmers have been facing in this country, what you're seeing going  on in these courts."we want our land, we want our money, and we want reparations! pay us now!!!"the land" featuring john boyd jr. and kj skippa mak marley speaks volumes to the challenges we still face.the land on spotifythe land on apple music

“president biden must move quickly to protect black farmers now that he has repealed promised debt relief for black farmers provided in the american rescue plan act (arpa) of 2021 because white farmers were claiming reverse discrimination. we have days, not weeks and months, to save many black, native american and other farmers of color from ruin. black farmers are facing record costs for inputs like fuel and fertilizer and soaring land costs while battling droughts and extreme heat. we cannot and will not trust a president who doesn't honor his commitments to have a sit-down meeting with me and breaks his promises during a 40-year record high cost of inputs and food crisis facing america,” stated boyd in 2022.

thu, january 27, 2022, 10:58 ambaskerville, va., jan. 27, 2022 /prnewswire/ -- john boyd, president of the national black farmers association (nbfa),  today called out pepsico for continued discrimination after a year and  half of all talk and no contract following a verbal commitment.boyd calls out pepsico, all talk and no contractsfrom wikipedia, the free encyclopedia pepsico,  the giant food and beverage company, seems to value a positive public  image less than profitability. most recently it has added dismissive  treatment of black farmers to a long list of complaints about its  negative environmental impacts (deforestation and pesticide use)  exploitation of water resources and global plastic pollution, according  to a wikipedia report.in  addition, pepsico, which was created in 1965 by pepsi's merging with  the frito-lay brand, not only has been repeatedly criticized by  environmentalists. public health advocates have complained about its  high-calorie, poor nutrition products along with other snack and drink  companies. in 2019, a johns hopkins university  student group dedicated to food sustainability and human ethics  protested the campus dining office's contract with pepsico, calling on  that unit to reject "socially and ecologically unsustainable practices  of profit-hungry corporations."yet, the multi-billion-dollar  leader in its category seems to regard social responsibility, and health  standards and environmental concerns as optional values. it has vowed  to uphold commitments to those issues, but has declined to release public  information documenting progress on changing company practices. although  coca-cola, its main competitor, has bigger sales, pepsico within the  north american market is the largest food and beverage company by net  revenue ($70 billion income reported in 2020).nbfa  raised concerns over the gargantuan company's failure to contract with  members of the nbfa to provide agricultural products that form the  foundation of their firm's processes. only white farmers have been  afforded the opportunity to share in pepsico's enormous profits. it  prefers the superficial responses to public opinion such as changing the  brand image of its stereotyped figure aunt jemima. pepsico immediately  reached out to the nbfa on june 19th 2020 in the face of such controversy.however,  as pepsico indicated they wanted to do business with nbfa members, the  company insisted that our growers share personal information through our  national data base. a year and a half later, when nbfa growers met all  the required elements for a potato delivery contract, the company's  executives apparently had lost interest in keeping its part of the  bargain.in an appalling stunt, pepsico executives recently  notified the president of the nbfa that it would not be moving forward  with any contracts for nbfa members."pepsico had decided to "move in a new direction" that would not include nbfa black farmer members, we were told.our  outrage at this kind of bullying discrimination is not just about hurt  feelings. our livelihood and financial stability is at stake when we  encounter such blatantly low-level business practices. some black farmers  have actually lost their farms amid this unethical and inhumane  treatment. the nbfa is seeking legal counsel regarding pepsico's verbal  commitment for a potato contract.










john boyd, president and founder, national black farmers association





as a shareholder of the pepsico corporation, i am calling on pepsico chairman and chief executive officer ramon laguarta  to meet with nbfa leaders and respond to the hardship and realities his  company's latest recent discriminatory act has caused." boyd's  statements follow pepsico's announcement that it will no longer use the  aunt jemima brand, long criticized as a racial stereotype, to sell  pancake mix and syrup.for interviews, please contact john boyd at johnwesleyboydjr@gmail.com or at 804-691-8528.http://blackfarmers.org http://www.johnboydjr.comview original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boyd-calls-out-pepsico-for-all-talk-and-no-contracts-for-national-black-farmer-members-301469906.htmlview original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-black-farmers-association-calls-on-pepsico-others-to-do-more-business-with-black-farmers-301080388.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/boyd-calls-pepsico-talk-no-155800373.htmlsource national black farmers association

black us farmers awaiting billions in promised debt reliefthere was a time when black farms prospered.just  two generations out of slavery, by 1910 black farmers had amassed more  than 16 million acres of land and made up about 14 percent of farmers.  the fruit of their labors fed much of america.now,  they have fewer than 4.7 million acres. black farms in the u.s.  plummeted from 925,000 to fewer than 36,000, according to the u.s.  department of agriculture’s latest farm census. and only about one in  100 farmers is black.what happened?
