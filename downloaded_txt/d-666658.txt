due to the kings’ dedication to the llewellin breed, this line of  premiere upland game bird hunting dogs has been preserved for future generations. the diligence of their breeding program in the 60’s, 70’s, and 80’s has ensured the continuation of this magnificent birddog. it is estimated by the registry associations that over 95% of llewellins registered trace their lineage back to king llewellin kennel. many credit al king for the preservation of this breed but he would always give equal or more credit to his friend dez young of the hunting with hank outdoor life network series. al’s goal and the one we maintain here is to provide the absolute best “foot hunting birddogs like your grandpa hunted.”
