quoth the raven, "welcome!"







hugin
("thought") is a huge, ancient raven, a familiar
  and messenger of the norse god odin, usually found perched on the old
  fellow's shoulder. computers are like that, aren't they? large, brooding, and
  inclined to raucously utter noises of ill omen.
welcome to "hugin" . . . but be caw-tious.
