we're still on lj! a multi-fandom friending meme  


since a lot of us are noticing the empty spaces in our friendslists that were once filled with talkative, active posters- i figured i'd use my icon journal to start a multi-fandom friending meme for those of us still active on livejournal to find others that are still around in our fandoms.in case you've never been involved in one of these- this it how it goes. reply to this post with the survey below and link this post to your friendslist so more people will come post their survey. then people will browse through the replies to see if there's anyone they'd like to friend. then just reply to them and ask to friend. simple as that!a few little rules:1) keep all images pg-13 or below!
