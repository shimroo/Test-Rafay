thank you for visiting.  unfortunately, this site has 
been in a state of inactivity for quite some time.  as time has passed, 
and interests changed, the need for another fan site diminished.  while 
the name "cybersunbeam" is deeply rooted in its "fangirl" roots, it has 
come to mean more than that as time has passed. the intention is to re-purpose the site to new interests while still keeping something reminiscent of the site's humble beginnings.however inspiration has yet to hit, and for that the site is still without purpose.
