a must see stop on any trip to charleston, s.c.
boone hall plantation was founded in 1681 when englishman major john boone came to charleston and established a lucrative plantation and gracious home on the banks of wampacheone creek. the family and descendants of major boone were influential in the history of south carolina, the colonies and the nation. in 1743, the son of major john boone planted live oak trees, arranging them in two evenly spaced rows. this spectacular approach to his home symbolizes southern heritage and will take root in your memory for many years to come. it would take two centuries for the massive, moss-draped branches to meet overhead, forming today’s natural corridor and a scene that nbc daytime television says is “a must see stop on any trip to charleston, s.c.” boone hall has also been recognized as the #1 plantation in the charleston area by usa today 10best.

        boone hall is also one of america's oldest still working farms.      









           exploring the gullah culture         

the history of the past is important. the difference is in how that history is presented.
“exploring the gullah culture” is a unique presentation where that difference can be experienced first hand.  boone hall is the only plantation in the charleston area to present a live presentation of this unique culture adapted by enslaved africans.
true descendants of the gullah people present the history of this culture through storytelling, song, and dance that is at times educational, at times entertaining, and at times…very moving and emotional.
these gullah ladies share uplifting spiritual messages of love and understanding of how through overcoming the hardships of the past have brought them to a better place today.
