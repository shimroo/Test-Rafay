                                to whom it may concern, i’ve had the privilege of meeting bailey back in september 2021 when arranging our newly formed relationship with nz uniforms. part of my role as general manager of nzma and nzis was to oversee this set up and ensure the transition was as seamless as possible., i’m pleased to say my dealings with nz uniforms has been extremely positive and the person that has been instrumental in making this happen has been our account manager bailey ross. right from the start bailey was warm, welcoming and extremely professional., bailey has really listened to our business requirements and provided experienced advice, flexibility, amazing communications and her humorous transparent personality to guide us through this transition with enjoyable ease. i can tell bailey is an asset to nz uniforms and has broad range of talents that will see her go far through many industries., nga mihi nui

                                amid a brand identity refresh i reached out to nz uniforms to get some help with new work clothing for our operations team. i used the “book a sales rep” function on their website and i was contacted by bailey the next day. from the get-go bailey was responsive, super patient and gave great advice. she made it so easy that i didn’t seek out quotes from alternate suppliers for this project. our order was a large mixture of sizes and clothing styles, when it arrived not one item was missing or incorrect. our team are now 100% compliant, look slick and are proud to be wearing their newly branded clothing. 10 out of 10 would recommend bailey and the team at nz uniforms, the entire process is really customer centric and delivers a great result.

                                in 2019 marsden partnered with new zealand uniforms, a leader in the school uniform space, to be our exclusive provider and seller of marsden uniforms. with 24/7 access to online sales, home delivery, and a broader range of products from which to choose as well as a retail outlet, uniform shopping is easy. we moved to nz uniforms because the economics of running our own uniform shop didn't make sense. our families now have access to retail stores that are open six days a week and the ability to purchase uniforms and accessories online 24/7. working with nz uniforms to make the switch was both pleasant and professional. they have worked hard to source quality materials that match our specifications and patterns exactly. they've also helped us streamline our offerings so that we don't have too many or unnecessary products available. we're excited to move forward with nz uniforms supporting marsden.

                                after dealing with nz uniforms for two years the opportunity arose to extend our contract. with the extra mile that nz uniforms goes to, to make sure everything is delivered on time, the exceptional quality of the garments, the friendly and helpful staff it was a no brainer to put pen to paper for a further five years. loving the journey.

                                moving to nz uniforms was a good decision. we have had outstanding personal service. the team responsible for our school are easy to contact, responsive to any changes, requests or problems. nz uniforms is always looking out for good quality fabrics, and efficient uniform manufacturers to give us the best uniform options. the quality of our uniforms is great, and our students really enjoy wearing them. we have worked with the nz uniform design team to create bespoke motifs and clothing for groups like our polyclub and our netball teams. having the added benefit of a sponsorship fund to help access extras like dance gear, a gazebo for sports events and running kit is such a bonus.
