the bittersweets are a nashville-via-san francisco duo who walk a precarious line between darkness and light. they weave accessible and almost familiar melodies through a lyrically rich dusk horizon. sometimes leaning towards folk-tinged americana, other times veering into pop and rock, their music always seems to be searching for something that none of us can find, lurking just beyond the shadows.and hannah meyers' voice turns out to be the perfect delivery mechanism for navigating this space, having “a delicious knack for simultaneously rocking out and whispering in our ears,” as the boston globe writes. not infrequently, her voice melds in harmony or unison with her life and musical partner chris meyers until they are no longer distinguishable and become one. you have likely heard their music during a television show or seen them opening up for one of your favorite acts. after attending a sold out show in colorado, influential music blogger/promoter heather powell browne potentially described their music best, writing, "this was the best show i've seen out of the last 100 shows, maybe. it broke my heart and fixed it all in one night, and i couldn't breathe." in 2021, they began releasing a song each month, a practice that they plan to continue indefinitely.
