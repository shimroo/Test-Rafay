welcome to the 28th year! 
first time? brilliant. the bleat is updated m-f. it's what we used to call a âblog,â but isnât just a list of links. youâll see. the updates are weekly additions to some selected sites, which are both huge and easily sampled. 
the substack is where my newspaper column went after management decided it was not necessary in the new vision of the paper. ok fine i'll go make my own clubhouse and it'll be more popular than yours and you can't join and you'll be sorry
what's new this year? more of the same and then some. there are a few personal sites that have been around this long, and still update. do they update as regularly, or produce as much original content? i doubt it. a round of sarcastic applause for your host, i suppose: hereâs your perseverance award! 
the web was different in 1996, to state the obvious - but this site hasnât changed, just grown. the graphics have gotten better (i hope) and the content has gotten . . . wider, to fit the larger screens, only to run up against the smartphone era. given what i do here, thereâs not much hope of adjusting to the new paradigm, and since i am but one man, no chance of me rewriting the whole damned thing.                    
overall idea:  the internetâs most diverse,
                      idiosyncratic, and individually curated pop-culture
                      museum. note: thatâs the last time iâll use âcurated.â
                    itâs pretentious. 
but itâs true! i am pretentious. also, this site is a
                      one-man effort, assembled over two decades, its
                      innumerable sub-sites gathered together under general,
                      vague rubrics.

what is the
                                  institute? a good question. it began
                                  as a repository for odd things i scanned - and
                                  by âscanned,â i mean i took pictures with a
                                  video camera, and used a frame grabber to get
                                  the images. cheap scanners didnât exist. 
as time went on, anything that
                                  was âvintageâ or âretroâ and could be gently
                                  mocked went into the institute.

here's
                                  the main page. some of the popular sites:
the
                                  gallery of regrettable food. the classic
                                  from 1997, it spawned two books. still updated -
                                  with a
                                    huge addition in 2019, and more coming in 2021.
interior
                                  desecrations: bad interior design of the
                                  60s and 70s.
the
                                  gobbler: the grooviest motel in wisconsin.
                                  redone in 2019.
the
                                  art of art frahm: the effect of celery on
                                  underwear elastic.                                
the
                                  permanent collection of impermanent art:
                                  what if we treated advertising illustration with
                                  the same pretentious analysis we use for museum
                                  art?                                
and much, much more.

                                depending on the year. this site began as a

                                in size. as time goes on, various sites are
                                moved to places where they fit in a bit better.
