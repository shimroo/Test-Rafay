are all state laws that regulate massage therapists illegal?
 in 1989, amta initiated legal action against the maryland state board of physical therapy examiners et al because the board assumed it had a legal right to regulate massage therapists. amta claimed that the board's action was illegal for reasons set forth in its complaint filed on december 8, 1989. these reasons included violation of the right to commercial speech and violation of antitrust laws. part 6 of this report presents some sections of amta's complaint.
we believe present-day regulation of massage therapists by state boards (of massage therapy, chiropractic, nursing, medicine, etc.) may be illegal because it violates the same laws that amta accused the maryland state board of physical therapy examiners of violating in 1989.
we believe amta's complaint provides evidence that state regulation of massage therapists may be illegal.
we believe state regulation of massage therapists, by the above-mentioned boards, may be illegal for the same reasons that amta considered it illegal for the maryland board of physical therapist examiners to regulate them.
we invite you to examine the evidence.
