home of the 4.3l vq 350z!!!
if you want a vq35 to out-perform the 2011 370z and g37, let us build it.


va tech college of engineering students brought one of their electric motocycles to the jgy dyno facility and performed a series of tests.

you can see here a motor, an intercooler kit, exhaust, clutch, and flywheel shipping all the way to alaska! we can also ship to other countries, i.e. bahamas, africa, russia, austrailia, etc. give us a call and ask us about our awesome shipping prices.



want your car worked on at jgy and can't get it here?  no problem!  we will connect you with the shipping guys.  surprisingly, it's very cheap.  this 2.4l sr car shipped back to just north of florida for only $500.  a sentra from nj to here costs just $550 for the customer.  a sentra from washingston state costs only $1100.  now, you have no excuses.
