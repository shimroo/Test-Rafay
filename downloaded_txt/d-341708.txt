‘john slusar’s epic racecourses  here today and gone tomorrow reveals that over the past 350 years 1,500  courses have closed. actually, epic’s not a muscular enough word. the 4 volumes  are the equivalent to wisden compiling a list of every cricket green ever  played upon. or the train enthusiast’s record of every locomotive built. it is  history in meticulous, eccentric micro-magnification. at some point over the  centuries anywhere worthy of a name had a race meeting. and slusar records  details of every single one.’ melanie reid:-the times 23rd january  2017. read the times review and the racing post review.
