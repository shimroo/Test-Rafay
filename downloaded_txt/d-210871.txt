six years later and the move to hosted wordpress


topics:
administrivia,
plans



maybe you noticed on danieljohnsonjr.com that i'm moving to wordpress.  if not, here's a heads-up.i've played around with free hosting since i first set up my geocities site back in 2002.  i still have "dan's links" set up as my home page on my browser.  (stop laughing. it's worked for me. ;p)i've got me some web hosting and am slowly working my way in moving my blogs to hosted wordpress.  i'm having to learn about nameservers and public_html, fantastico,  and all that fun stuff.  but i'm really looking forward to playing with php and mysql, since i've done a lot of sql server development for work.if things here appear a bit wonky for awhile, that's why.  also, if you'd like to offer some free advice during the transition, feel free to leave it in the comments, or contact me through the usual channels.-----check out my other blogs:daniel johnson, jr.get that job!journey inside my mind blogjourney inside my mind podcastquotesblogtwitter.com/danieljohnsonjrconnect on linkedininteresting things i've readrelated tags: journey+inside+my+mind journeyinsidemymind jimm daniel+johnson+jr

happy anniversary to us!


topics:
anniversary,
marriage



thirteen years ago jennie and i embarked on this wonderful adventure that is marriage.  in some ways it feels like only yesterday; in others, it feels like quite a while.  i love how time is elastic like that.i haven't typically been one to give greeting cards, so i hope that she'll be impressed when she gets the one i'm giving her, even if it came from a card store. it reads:baby, when i think about us,i can't help but lovewhat we've become.yes, those early daysof you and me were amazing.but now, we've easedinto this deep, soulful groove...the kind that fills inall the missing beatsof a man's lifewith what's real and true...you're the rhythm to my rhyme --smooth and steadyas a heartbeat.you complete me, baby.and while i've lovedevery stage of us,i wouldn't give anything for this one --the one where weknow each other by heart.you're the woman who grooves me.always have. and, baby...you always will.happy anniversaryi noticed that ed from ed's mixed bag played my request for ingrid michaelson's "the way i am" on his latest show. thanks, ed! -----check out my other blogs:daniel johnson, jr.get that job!journey inside my mind blogjourney inside my mind podcastquotesblogtwitter.com/danieljohnsonjrconnect on linkedininteresting things i've readrelated tags: journey+inside+my+mind journeyinsidemymind jimm daniel+johnson+jr anniversary marriage ingrid+michaelson eds+mixed+bag
