welcome to the hummingbird website!
hummingbirds are amazing little creatures, which is explains why we are all so infatuated with them! they can flap their wings 80 times per second, creating a "humming" noise which gave them their name. they can also rotate their wings in a figure-8 pattern, allowing them to hover like a helicopter. in fact, hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly both forwards and backwards! their long, slender bills help them reach nectar from tubular flowers. 
historically, hummingbirds were hunted for their feathers. today, their population risk is due to habitat loss and destruction, both in their nesting grounds and overwintering habitat. fortunately, there are many hummingbird-lovers out there who create backyard habitats with beneficial plants and hummingbird feeders to help them refuel on their migratory journeys.
