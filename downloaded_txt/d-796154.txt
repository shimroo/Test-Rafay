interview: dark days: the alex jones interviewby rich rosella good conspiracy movie can be a fun time, but when it moves into the arena of real life the concepts can get a bit disturbing. in the documentary terrorstorm, filmmaker/radio host/writer alex jones lays out some heavy duty ammo that paints some very shadowy edges on our blissful day-to-day existence. doc recently spoke with jones to get his outlook on the big reach of the u.s. government, and things that he believes it is doing to move us toward what he calls "dark times."

interview: you're killing me, buster: talking with tony haleby joel cunninghamarrested development is dead!  long live arrested development!  with the release of season three on dvd, one of the best (and most unjustly canceled) tv comedies of all time is officially over and done with.  a few weeks ago, digitallyobsessed.com had the chance to chat with a certain hook-handed man about the series' cancellation, jason bateman's beauty regime, and the perils of performing a scene with one of the funniest tricksters in the business (i'm sorry, illusionists?a trick is what a whore does for money).interview: eat your vegetables.  just, not the talking ones...by joel cunninghamsince 1993, big idea has been teaching better living through produce with veggietales, a show in which limbless, talking veggies impart the morals and wisdom of the bible with heart and plenty of humor.interview: the amazing kreskin: the power of suggestionby rich roselldoc recently cornered the very busy amazing kreskin, who has nearly 60 years under his belt as a mentalist and thought reader. with the release of the amazing kreskin dvd he is venturing into new territory, but he took some time to talk about his influences, predictions, mediums, as well as his thoughts on houdini.interview: ray harryhausen: portrait of the animator as zeusby mark zimmerthe great stop-motion animator ray harryhausen chats with doc about the new king kong collection, his thoughts on cgi, and the dark secret he's keeping from jennifer jones.

interview: wyler on wyler...and ben-hurby david krausscatherine wyler, film producer and daughter of director william wyler, chats with doc about ben-hur and her father's legendary career.interview: a different kind of zombie: an interview with marius pencznerby rich rosellmarius penczner wrote and directed the 1982 cult classic i was a zombie for the f.b.i., a throwback to 1950s sci-fi/g-men serials made for an astonishing meager $27,000. the film developed some underground sea legs after airing on usa's night flight in the mid-1980s, and in 2005 is getting special edition dvd treatment from rykodisc. penczner, with a long career in music videos, commercials, and political spots, spent some time with doc reminiscing about the production and how it has evolved.interview: a raven and a writing desk: the immortal elizabeth gracenby mark zimmerthe star of highlander: the raven talks about her amazing life as a television star, a former miss america, and a political football, and also lets us in on her next project.
interview: last man standing: adrian paulby mark zimmeradrian paul rocketed to stardom in the 1990s in the syndicated series highlander, which has recently just completed the release of its six-season run on dvd from anchor bay entertainment.  doc recently chatted with adrian paul about season six, the series as a whole, and his new career as a humanitarian.
interview: pauly shore isn't dead. or is he? no, he totally isn't.by joel cunninghampauly shore is dead!  no wait, he isn't, he just wrote and directed a movie imagining how a phony suicide might benefit his flagging career.  did he make the right move, or commit cinematic hari-kari?  you decide, as doc chats with the weasel himself.interview: greg the bunny lives: a conversation with series co-creator dan milanoby jeff rosadowhy didn't greg the bunny score for fox? despite great reviews, a cast that had just begun to jell and a small but growing audience, the spring 2002 mid-season replacement was pulled barely a month into its run. but just like many too-good-for-television projects whose popularity increased once cancellation slips are distributed (star trek, twin peaks), "fabricated-americans" who knew better the first time around are celebrating the complete series on dvd in a classy-two disc release from fox home video.interview: blinded with science: paul zaloom steps out from beakman's worldby rich rosellbeakman's world was one of the bright spots of children's television in the early 1990s, a manic, high-energy show that made science fun and easy to learn, for kids as well as adults. paul zaloom had the role of beakman, the guy with the 3-foot-high 'do and the bright green lab coat.

doc recently had the opportunity to chat with zaloom and uncover not just a few tidbits about the show, but of the adventurous and unusual projects he has been involved with since.interview: monster hit: patty jenkinsby mark zimmerour mark zimmer was there when patty jenkins spoke with the press in a q&a session about monster and its recent release to dvd. interview: who is the mole?: a post-game chat with corbin bernsenby jeff rosadoas fans of reality television fare continue to come down from the double-whammy high of amber brkich's win and marriage proposal on survivor all stars, carry on endless debating over whether bachelor jesse made the right choice by picking jessica over tara, and discuss the fantasia vs. diana singing showdown on american idol, there's no better time than the present to chat with one of the tube's most unforgettable participants from the past season: corbin bernsen of abc's celebrity mole.

interview: ginger rogers from 42nd street to cinderella, via chicagoby mark zimmeras a few of rogers' movies have finally hit dvd, and doc talks about her films and the digital medium with one of the people who knew her best.interview: look at him working: paul mccartney animation director geoff dunbarby jeff rosadomention the name paul mccartney and several different images come to mind: consumate singer-songwriter, master showman, devoted dad, shrewd businessman, innovative bassist, and animal rights activist easily emerge. but what you may not know is that the former beatle is a huge fan of animation, and lists vintage disney and looney tunes amongst his favorites. over the last 20 years, mccartney has made quite a name for himself across the pond as an executive producer of animated shorts, in collaboration with award-winning director geoff dunbar. interview: let me tell you about tonight's specials: ordering off the menu with berman and pulciniby jon danzigerhusband-and-wife filmmaking team robert pulcini and shari springer berman have received all sorts of good notices recently for american splendor, but years before their movie about harvey pekar, they made a smart and wistful documentary about the closing of chasen's, one of hollywood's most storied restaurants.  on the occasion of the dvd release of off the menu, berman and pulcini spoke with doc about their fondness for this, their first film, the impact it has had on their professional lives, and perhaps most important, about chasen's signature dish.interview: if your selection is capturing the friedmans, press 1by jon danzigerandrew jarecki's debut feature, capturing the friedmans, has rightly earned comparisons with the films of kurosawa, ophuls, and frederick wiseman.  this story of a family rent apart from without and within by charges of child molestation has been widely celebrated for its craft and its sinuous narrative; and of course a film with this kind of inflammatory subject matter will invariably have some detractors.  on the occasion of its dvd release, and shortly after being nominated for an academy award, jarecki spoke with doc about the film, the menace of birthday party clowns, and his previous, more entrepreneurial public venture, as one of the founders of moviefone, which has since been sold to aol time warner.  (you've selected capturing the friedmans!)interview: annie revisited: an interview with aileen quinnby rich roselli suppose it might be big news for the morbidly curious if the little girl who played the title role in the 1982 john huston-directed musical, annie, grew up and turned into a foul-mouthed wild child. that, i'm glad to report, is not the case here. when doc recently had the chance to sit down with annie's aileen quinn, to discuss movies, theater and of course dvds, it was difficult to imagine anyone that could ever be more pleasant, friendly, or just plain nice to talk to. she even went above and beyond the call of duty and graciously fielded a question or two from a young fan, doc's own 12-year-old junior correspondent, samantha rosell.

quinn seems to have certainly risen well above the child star pitfalls that have tripped so many others, and if you can find someone out there who is nicer i will gladly eat my hat.interview: a classic act: george feltenstein and the crown jewels of warner home videoby david krausssure, he faces bottom-line financial and marketing considerations, but feltenstein's ultimate modus operandi is much the same as the old motto of mgm:  "do it big.  do it right.  and give it class."  and for feltenstein and the rest of his warner team, unqualified success has followed.  interview: the real crime: on the "scenes" with dominique formaby rich rosellwith his 2001 debut, scenes of the crime, french-born writer/director dominique forma attempts to tell a purely american crime story, starring jeff bridges, with distinct and subtle french cinematic undertones. 

doc recently had the opportunity to find out his thoughts on breaking into the film business, the differences between french and american movies, and the challenges involved in putting together a feature film for the first time.interview: the kids are alright again: a conversation with john albarianby jeff rosadohuntington beach, california native and loyola marymount graduate john albarian has come a long way from playing air guitar on his tennis racket to classic rock staples like "won't get fooled again." with a wildly diverse résumé including an internship for lethal weapon director richard donner, a stint at playboy and an editor for several mtv projects, albarian eventually wound up at pioneer at the dawn of the dvd era, becoming one of the industry's most prolific producers of music-oriented titles, including the kinks: one for the road, queen: we will rock you, miles davis: live in munich, and psychedelic furs: live at house of blues. but his pride and joy comes in the form of his most recent project: the two-disc special edition of the heralded documentary, the kids are alright, a musical celebration of the who. interview: journey back to neverwhere: a conversation with neil gaimanby joel cunninghamneil gaiman attracted a cult following with his sandman comics, but his talent is impressive enough that the mainstream has taken notice—his novels good omens (which he co-wrote) and american gods were award-winning best sellers, and attracted a shiver of circling film executives hungry for a bit of the writer's magic blood.  before he was offered the chance to direct a film based on his series of comics about a beautiful, feminine death, however, he wrote a miniseries called neverwhere for the bbc, which is now coming to dvd from a&e.interview: staring at the underbelly: an interview with documentary filmmakers joe berlinger and bruce sinofskyby rich roselldocumentary filmmakers joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky teamed up to release 1991's haunting brother's keeper, and over the years have gone on to tackle such diverse subjects as satanic murders and rock and roll with the same unflinching honesty.

doc had the opportunity to speak with berlinger and sinofsky on the eve of the 10th anniversay dvd release of the award-winning brother's keeper, and get some insight into the documentary filmmaking process.interview: andy sidaris: bullets, bombs, and babesby rich rosellafter a long and celebrated career with abc sports, andy sidaris became the undisputed king of the all-important girls-and-guns genre, working as a writer, director, and producer. he is responsible for a string of twelve (so far) mindlessly fun titles, all starring an array of playboy playmates.interview: patrick macnee: the man with the bowlerby mark zimmerjohn steed was one of the most iconic characters to come out of the 1960s, with his unmistakeable bowler hat and bumbershoot. patrick macnee, who portrayed the unflappable steed, has been indelibly associated with the television series the avengers for four decades, fighting crime with style and wit alongside an array of some of britain's top actors&#8212and especially actresses.interview: painting the body human with judy chinby joel cunninghamaward-winning makeup artist judy chin recently put the finishing touches on her work for the julie taymor film, frida, earning herself an oscar® in the process.  it was just another in a long line of successful jobs for the increasingly in-demand artist, who also created some truly memorable imagery in darren aronofsky's requiem for a dream.
interview: patrick lussier bites backby rich rosellpatrick lussier, the director of the speculatively inventive dracula 2000 has, of late, found himself holding court over of a pair of bloodsucking sequels, both shot in romania: dracula ii: ascension and dracula iii: legacy. the followups continue the story of one of the horror genre's favorite undead characters, who here is endlessly tracked by a weapons-wielding, tibetan-born italian priest/vampire hunter.

doc recently caught up with the busy director to pick his brain on vampires, romania and shooting two films simultaneously.interview: writing 25 hours a day: a talk with screenwriter david benioffby joel cunninghamdavid benioff never expected that his book, the 25th hour, would be made into a film, and he certainly didn't think that it would fall into the hands of a filmmaker as talented as spike lee.  though he's fairly busy these days writing screenplays for big-budget epics like wolfgang petersen's troy, benioff took the time to talk with digitallyobsessed about creative control and the difficulties of taking a novel from script to screen.  interview: how to make a good "chick" flick: a chat with tom bradyby joel cunninghamtom brady followed up his career writing for critically acclaimed shows like the simpsons, sports night, and home improvement with a few not-so-critically-acclaimed rob schneider comedies—he wrote 2000's the animal (co-starring survivor's colleen haskell), and just recently signed off on the dvd for the hot chick, his first directing gig and one of the worst-reviewed films of 2002.  interview: is that a rabbit in your pocket...?by mark zimmermost actors are lucky to find themselves in one acknowledged classic.  joanna cassidy has had pivotal roles in at least two, blade runner and who framed roger rabbit?, and with her featured role in the hit hbo series six feet under as the acerbic margaret chenowith, she seems to be adding a third classic to her lengthy filmography.  doc chatted with joanna on may 6, 2003 regarding recent dvd releases and her current projects.interview: ron jeremy exposedby rich rosellhe's probably the best-known male adult film star of all-time, and until the documentary porn star: the legend of ron jeremy came along, it's likely that most people didn't know much about the guy nicknamed the hedgehog. with 25 years in the industry, and well over 1,600 films, jeremy certainly deserves the tongue-in-cheek handle "the hardest working man in show business."

doc recently had the chance to catch up with ron jeremy and find out a little more about the adult film industry and how the documentary came to be.interview: jon jacobs: the boy with the hungry eyesby jeff ulmerhe describes himself in the title of his new novel, the book of omens, as a "self-made movie star," and while he may not be a household name, that hasn't stopped the multi-talented jon jacobs from taking his future in the film industry into his own hands. his do-it-yourself approach has built him an impressive body of work in the past seven years—starring roles in twenty independent features, a handful of directorial credits, writing five screenplays and a novel. interview: talkin' sweet home hollywood with andy tennantby joel cunninghamdirector andy tennant has had a long and varied career.  he started as an actor in movies like grease and midnight madness.  he directed first for television, then for the silver screen.  he found success (ever after), disappointment (anna and the king), and finally, he found reese.  sweet home alabama was a surprise hit in the fall of 2002, posting the biggest box-office take of any movie to open in october.

now, the movie that made reese a megastar is coming to dvd.  tennant chats with digitallyobsessed about his propensity for working with blondes, the importance of having a sense of humor, and 16th-century philosophy.  no, really. interview: conversations with kevin smith2by joel cunninghamkevin smith, the popular director of clerks, chasing amy, jay and silent bob strike back, and the upcoming jersey girl, has always been nothing if not upfront with his legion of fans.  he posts essays outlining his film's production on his website, visits comic book conventions around the country, and has developed his college campus "lecture series" into a cottage industry (but don't let him hear you call them lectures—he thinks he's a random idiot with very little to teach his thronging devotees).interview: one conversation about many things: an interview with jill sprecherby kevin clemonsthe central theme of jill sprecher's thirteen conversations about one thing is happiness, and to speak to jill one immediately recognizes her as an authority on the subject. raised in wisconsin before moving east to new york, sprecher made her debut with the sharply written clockwatchers, a film also co-written with her sister karen. sprecher's gift for humor as well as sharp insight into nearly every aspect of life is as evident one-on-one as it is in her scripts. digitallyobsessed had a chance to speak with ms. sprecher about the release of her critically touted second film.

interview: the river wild: an interview with laurie and david shapiroby rich rosellthe brother and sister documentary team of david and laurie shapiro are responsible for creating keep the river on your right, a truly remarkable film that chronicles tobias schneebaum. schneebaum, a new york artist/anthropologist, disappeared into the amazon in 1955 with no guide, no map, and with only the vaguest of instructions: "keep the river on your right." his nearly year-long adventure amongst a tribe of cannibals, which schneebaum documented in a book of the same name in the early 1960s, was the impetus for the shapiros to take him back to the amazon 45 years after his original adventure.  their film, though, is much more than a travelogue; it is a spiritual, moving experience that is equally surreal as it is touching.

interview: filmmaking trance: director matt perry interviewedby jesse shankswriter, filmmaker and sometime doc contributor matt perry recently directed the short film trance, which will debut at the sacramento festival of cinema on october 5. recently, he discussed the making of the film with digitallyobsessed. the film is notable for its wide-open collaboration between the director and his 30 actors.  perry invited the actors to create, from scratch, an entire movie in a single day.  the actors not only starred in the movie but are given writing credit—they created their own scenarios on the morning of filming, with perry acting as shepherd for the project.interview: the 6th beatle: a hard day's night with victor spinettiby debi lee mandelvictor spinetti appeared in all three beatles movies and enjoyed lifelong friendships with "the lads."  the candid, animated and oh so charming "6th beatle" shares his experiences with the fab four, beatlemania and the making of a hard day's night. while humor is still apparently his trademark, spinetti is a thoughtful man who also speaks many words of wisdom.interview: spectrum is green: gerry andersonby dan lopezin 1955, gerry anderson's involvement with a.p. films (a company he co-founded) led to the production of the adventures of twizzle, a british puppet show that was quite popular in its day.  because animation proved more profitable to produce&#8212and that he was good at it&#8212anderson moved into the world of marionette animation that would soon become the domain defining most of his career.  eventually working under lew grade, anderson produced projects like <b>fireball xl5</b>, <b>stingray</b>, and, of course, <b><a href="powersearch.php3?search_string=thunderbirds&schoice=1&exact_match=yes">thunderbirds</a></b>, arguably his most familiar and popular production.  later productions such as  <b><a href="showreview.php3?id=3650">captain scarlet</a></b> and <b><a href="showreview.php=3772">ufo</a></b> cemented anderson's reputation in the world of sci-fi television.  </i></p><p class="storycard">interview: <b><a href="https://digitallyobsessed.com/r-displayinterviews.php?id=34">james belushi: still top dog</a><br>by debi lee mandel<br><i>the doc participated in a press tele-conference with jim belushi wednesday to promote universal's upcoming release of<b> <a href="showreview.php3?id=3675">k-9: p.i.</a></b> to dvd. topics ranged from dogs and kids to, well, dogs and kids. our hosts opened the forum so that we all had free access to this very comfortable and amiable star. belushi may refer to himself as "second banana," but there's little doubt he's an alpha male. and yes, there's "talk" about a fourth <b>k-9</b> installment....</i></p><p class="storycard">interview: <b><a href="https://digitallyobsessed.com/r-displayinterviews.php?id=33">the mind of the man: ron howard</a><br>by debi lee mandel<br><i>academy? award-winning director ron howard held a press
