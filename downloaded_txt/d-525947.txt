the spirit of the enneagram!the 9 lives program will be there for you during each challenge, milestone, relationship, and achievement.

  

9 lives shows you the aspects that live within all of us and how they present for you.  in learning more about your true nature, you can begin to see the difference between reacting and responding, surviving and thriving.  this interactive program allows you to see that there is a choice that lies between the two and that you can make conscious decisions to respond to all that your soul contract entails.

your journey starts herefor over 20 years, i have been developing and growing a connection to spirit, and i am grateful to be a bridge between worlds for so many of you. but it is also part of my mission to teach you how to do this too! i often tell my clients and audiences that no one is closer to your departed loved ones than you. your connection was always there, and will always remain, just in a different form. i am happy to share the tools and practices that i have learned from spirit to help you continue that connection and build authentic faith.
