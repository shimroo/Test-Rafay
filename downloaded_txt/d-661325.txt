advanced illumination - bl2 series high intensity back-lit backlights


the bl2 series provides a highly uniform and high intensity, diffuse backlight source, primarily used for creating object silhouettes of high contrast or imaging through semi-translucent materials.


bl2 backlights are pre-engineered for scalability, allowing for size configurations in 1″ increments up to 46″ in length and width.


this backlight series is offered in 5 wavelength options and can be configured with either a polarization or collimation film.


as with all advanced illumination products, this series is built for tailorability while still maintaining a standard lead time of one to three weeks.


each side of a bl2 is equiped with m6 nut channels, allowing for quick and easy mounting. this series comes with our lb111 mounting brackets.

advanced illuminationadvanced illumination - al150 series bala (broad area linear array) bar lights



designed for machine vision applications that require broad illumination over a wide area with controlled fall off.



this bala (broad area linear array) bar light series is expandable in 1″ increments up to 82″.



applications requiring an even wider area of illumination can utilize two bala bar lights aligned in parallel, facing each other.



al150 derivatives include al4424 (4″), al4554 (9″) and al46120 (20″) (which represent legacy part numbers)





al4424-660open box



 

advanced illuminationadvanced illumination - rl4260 medium aimed bright field
the rl4260 is characterized as a medium aimed bright field ring light. 
precisely aimed leds provide a level of lighting control not found in traditional illuminators. 
a range of standoffs and fields of view may be specified at the time of order. 
the ring light is available in a wide range of wavelengths from uv to ir, including a 3 channel rgb version. 
diffuser and polarizer options are also available. 
the large inner diameter of the ring light can accommodate lenses up to 55mm in diameter. 
the light can also be ordered with an optional mounting ring.
