 calculators and computers wanted

if you have any old (built before 1985)
calculators or computers made by hewlett-packard
that need a new home, i'm interested in talking to you.


my calculators page is here.


my "computer rescue" page is here.


a more comprehensive list of things i'm looking for can be seen
here.

 gps service interruptions

the united states coast guard maintains a webpage with
notices of gps service interruptions that could disrupt
navigation with commercial gps receivers.  you can see the
current notices

here.

 cellular security

some of the encryption systems employed in cellular and pcs mobile
telephone
systems have been shown to be relatively easy to crack.  more information
can be found in the cellular and
pcs pages.

 telephone number database

paul timmins has a database that allows you
to look up technical details on telephone numbers
in the united states, including service providers
and switch information.  try it out
here.

 mapping




the u.s. department of the interior has an interactive
mapping service for the united states that can generate useful
and informative maps.  the national atlas of the united
states is available here.


the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has put
their nautical charts on-line
here.


 odds and ends



some screen shots
of a user interface design - from a movie.


for a trip back to a more pleasant time, read
this advertisement
from the bell telephone company ("ma bell") circa 1940.
they actually advertise the pleasant demeanor of their operators!

 i received an interesting comic book produced by,
of all people, general electric.  it extoles the virtues
and nearly unlimited possibilities of atomic power - from
the vantage point of 1948.
click here to read more.

 bell labs has a fun
text-to-speech
demonstration that allows you to hear a synthesized voice speak
any phrase you enter in a variety of languages.  as joe bob briggs
would say, check it out.

 nasa has a interesting set of web pages

here
describing early computers used in space missions.

 the cable news network (cnn) apparently does not have
anyone left who understands basic science.  during their
coverage of the space shuttle columbia re-entry accident they
had
this graphic at the bottom of
the screen, reporting that the shuttle was moving at 18 times
the speed of light.


 urban life




escrimador at the chinatown/gallery place metro station.



do you measure up?



a question you should not have to ask.



dangerous drink.
