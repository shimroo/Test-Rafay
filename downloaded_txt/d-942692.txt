i contacted paradise pools in november for a consultation on getting a pool. john sweeney is the owner and he personally came out to give us a quote. we instantly felt comfortable with him and his process. one of the first things that stood out was his attention to detail and the safety of our children in the pool. he right away got to work designing our dream pool! shortly after our consultation john had a drawing for us. after a few changes we jumped on board and started our pool at the end of january. our pool was finished at the end of april just in time for the heat! during the process of our build everything went smooth with no issues. we got everything we wanted in our pool and our kids are having a blast!!! john's team is very experienced in what they do and are true professionals! our pool exceeded our expectations and we are very happy with the results! i would definitely recommend paradise pools to anyone looking to build a pool.

as we were finishing the build of our new home, we decided to make a dream come true and install a lap pool. our general contractor asked around, and was told paradise pools was the only way to go. we met with john sweeney, and immediately sensed his passion for pools. john designed our dream pool... and then we worked our way back to the actual budget - no fault of his, just naivety on our part. he was always helpful and professional, and ultimately designed and built exactly what we wanted according to our budget - and it's still a dream pool. there were no surprises in the process, and his professionalism continued through to the very end and beyond. a year after the completion of our pool, we're still dealing with some pebble tech discoloration issues - again, no fault of his, but our issue as we figure out the well water. i called john the other day, he picked up the phone immediately, and said, "how are you doing, jason?" i reminded him of our discussion a year ago, and he reiterated his high standard, and his intent to help us solve the problem. best things about working with john: 1) he has a sense of himself as a professional businessman, and lives up to that standard; 2) no hidden charges or surprise add ons - straight shooter; 3) his dedication to making sure his customers are happy. i was really surprised to see the bad review on yelp, and find it highly suspect - this is not the john sweeney we know. i would highly recommend paradise pools, and john sweeney's team. thank you for the amazing pool, john!

paradise pools made our backyard dreams come true.  we weren't sure exactly what we wanted but when we met with john, he was able to use his years of experience, take into account the size of our family and our lifestyle, and consider our budget to create the perfect outdoor escape.  we shopped around before going through paradise pools, but no one else offered a complete package that was tailored specifically to us.  john was not just willing to discuss the tiniest details with us thoroughly and more than once, he encouraged us to do so.  he gave us a lot of different ideas and options, but never pressured us.  throughout the pool building process, john and craig answered all of our questions and were available any time we needed them.  we couldn't be happier with our entire backyard and have used the pool or the spa almost every day since they were finished. we recommend paradise pools wholeheartedly!

after 3 and a half years of loving our own private paradise pool, i guess i should write a review for the builder , john.
we had 3 different bids and designs for a new small ,7500 gallon pool, but felt john understood our needs and desires best. their team of sub contractors were awesome. we knew ahead of time the days they would be working on the pool and could plan accordingly .
permits were all pulled by paradise, landscaper installed new plants prior to the build so they would have a chance to grow , lighting was done for the awesome nite time effects. it's been a pleasure working with john & craig and having their cell numbers to text is great because with any questions, they reply asap!
love our hawaiian paradise pool since we can only be on island a couple times a year.

it's been a pleasure working with john & craig.

i can not thank you enough for our beautiful pool! the quality & craftsmanship are amazing. it is a life saver for my sanity with our energetic 3 boys and friends. the design & placement flows with our backyard. many comment about believing it has always been here, because it fits seamlessly. i am beyond grateful for the opportunity to have you design & build our pool. we will enjoy it for many years to come.
i need to write this last august at the completion of our pool! however, i am even more grateful now after utilizing it for a season! thank you again for working with us, your expertise, as well as expediting the build to ensure we could enjoy it before the weather turned.
with deep gratitude,

paradise pools i feel is the #1 premier pool builder in visalia hands down. my wife and i had a vision and a budget going into the pool building conversation with john and he delivered. i respected the value of john's experience and attention to detail when it came to my expectations. i understood their was several pool builders that were claiming they could build a pool for a "cheaper" price but definitely saw the compromise in attention to detail and finished product. we successfully had our pool completed 2 years ago and still to this day i get nothing but compliments! in my line of business i speak to people everyday that are interested in building pools and i always refer them over to paradise pools. again, i can't thank john enough for building a pool that my wife and kids will enjoy for years to come.fabian z.
