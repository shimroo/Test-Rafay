desktopx in action


				desktopx is a revolutionary program that makes the windows desktop fully object-oriented. it enables users to take their desktops to the next level by enabling windows to support a host of new desktop content.  
			





overview
				desktopx is a program that lets users build their own desktops.  it does this by giving users access to desktop objects. these objects can come in all sizes and shapes.
				they can have scripts attached to them, they can be combined together to form mini applications or turned into an entire desktop.
				
objects - 
				desktopx supports desktop objects. objects can be live data or just images. they run as part of the desktopx environment.
				
widgets - 
				desktopx objects can be exported as mini-applications called widgets. widgets are similar to objects except they are actual programs (.exes) that run in their own memory space.
				

gadgets - 
				desktopx widgets can be exported as stand-alone programs (.exes) called gadgets that require no additional files or run-times to be installed.
