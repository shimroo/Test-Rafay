bet you missed me.....





well, hellena had to take a sabbatical from the news for a while due to work and a growing sense of cynicism, but it's time for a comeback. there is just too much ripe stupidity in this world for hellena to keep her mouth shut any longer. here is the story that prompted the resurrection of the blog:lactivists: where is it ok to breastfeed?babytalk magazine generates controversy with nursing covernew york (ap) -- "i was shocked to see a giant breast on the cover of your magazine," one person wrote. "i immediately turned the magazine face down," wrote another. "gross," said a third.these readers weren't complaining about a sexually explicit cover, but rather one of a baby nursing, on a wholesome parenting magazine -- yet another sign that americans are squeamish over the sight of a nursing breast, even as breast-feeding itself gains more support from the government and medical community.and the quote that broke the handbasket:"i shredded it," said gayle ash, of belton, texas, in a telephone interview. "a breast is a breast -- it's a sexual thing. he didn't need to see that."it's a breast, people. we all have them, and nursing a baby is not the same as doing a strip-tease. when o' when will the human race evolve beyond their sophmoric fear of body parts?

can some please explain this phenomena?





 hellena has lost count, but here is the latest in the long line of silly teaching twats who could not control their base carnal desires, to play hide the salami with one or more of her underage students. wtf? what is it that these ill-bred horny pedophile bitches-in-heat see in getting their hole filled by a 13-16 year old boy? are they unable to cut it with men their own age? are they off their anti-depressants? for the life of hellena, she just does not get it. key-rist, buy a fucking vibrator already.technorati tags: pedophile white trash sex

flashback: major general smedley butler





a timely reminder of where we have been, and a wicked reminder that "those who do not learn from history are destined to repeat the same."war is a racket. it always has been.it is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. it is the only one international in scope. it is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.a racket is best described, i believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. only a small "inside" group knows what it is about. it is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. out of war a few people make huge fortunes.in the world war [i] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. at least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the united states during the world war. that many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns. how many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows.how many of these war millionaires shouldered a rifle? how many of them dug a trench? how many of them knew what it meant to go hungry in a rat-infested dug-out? how many of them spent sleepless, frightened nights, ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets? how many of them parried a bayonet thrust of an enemy? how many of them were wounded or killed in battle?after you read this, do a little research on one prescott bush, and one george herbert walker to see who was profiting from wars way back when. guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh? follow the money, people, follow the money.......technorati tags: war military politics george bush morons

a 9/11 film worth watching





mark morford of the san francisco gate wrote a contemplative editorial about the still unanswered questions from 9/11. there's any number of plausible to ridiculous theories about the events of that day, but outside of the questions raised in the editorial, mark led hellena to the most lucid and sobering 9/11 film she's seen since the tragedy. the 3 hunter thompson quoting young men who put this film and the follow-up film, loose change 2nd edition, have done as fine a job as any seasoned investigative reporter could have mustered documenting the details. if you have an hour and a half of time, watch it. hell, make the time and watch it. it's that worth it.technorati tags: 9/11 news politics

operation predator nets a 3rd perv at dhs





apparently brian j. doyle wasn't/isn't the only dhs official with a hard on for little girls. frank figuero faces trial this week on charges of exposing himself to a teenage girl last year at a mall. in january of this year michael burks, police officer, and dhs agent was popped for child sex trolling.what the hell is wrong with these men? how many more perverts are lurking under the cloak of a "respectible" job?hellena is speechless, but recommends the rude pundit's take on why the republican's hate the children.

well this is all we need now.....





 can anyone believe this smug, arrogant cowboy is in control of our nation, much less in control of our nuclear war capabilities? president george w bush is said to be so alarmed by the threat of iran's hard-line leader, mahmoud ahmedinejad, that privately he refers to him as "the new hitler", says seymour hersh, who broke the story of the abu ghraib iraqi prisoner abuse scandal. great. two egomaniacs in a pissing contest with each other using nuclear weapons. let's hope hersh missed the mark with this story.

hellena's been busy.......





... you know, fighting social injustice, leaping tall buildings and all that. well, ok, hellena has just been working her real job and finding little time to blog this past week. don't despair, though, hellena has been keeping a list of goodies to serve in the almost-weekly roundup:• chevy tahoe ads you won't be seeing on tv. found this at dr. atomic• are you ready for some tongue kissin'? well, what do you expect from a drunk and unruly country outlaw?• for the second time, allegations of  halliburton serving contaminated water  to our troops. • the  raping & pillaging of medicare.• ann coulter sticks her man-sized foot in her mouth again. then reportedly drank the coffee served by the people she had just insulted.• homeland security officer, brian j. doyle, arrested after trying to seduce what he thought was a 14 year old girl. yup, the morals and ethics of our leadership is just par none, huh?• cynthia mckinney punches an officer,  screams racism, then apologizes after being threatened with an arrest warrant. hey cynthia, you weren't wearing your congressional lapel pin. someone tell this woman to shut up.• and john mccain can kiss our butts, too. hugging falwell makes us react like that.random cool quote of the week"christianity has a built-in defense system: anything that questions a belief, no matter how logical the argument is, is the work of satan by the very fact that it makes you question a belief. it's a very interesting defense mechanism, and the only way to get by it – and believe me, i was raised southern baptist – is to take massive amounts of mushrooms, sit in a field and just go, 'show me." - bill hicks, comic extroidinairetechnorati tags: entertainment news politics religion ann coulter

they can't read when they graduate.....





... but, hey, as long as they git sum uf that ol' time relijun, georgia is happy. atlanta (reuters) - georgia lawmakers have approved a measure to fund elective bible courses in public schools, raising concern among civil liberties groups the classes could violate the u.s. constitutional separation of church and state. isn't this what sunday school is for? it's been a while since hellena was darkening the doorstep of any high school, but she does remember this: there were precious few enough hours to squeeze in the necessary courses. and with georgia consistantly falling at the  bottom of the charts in education in a state to state comparison, seems they can hardly afford the distraction of another elective course. if this is to be enacted as just a historical teaching of biblical history & archeology, and not as an indoctrination for students as the legislators say, then hellena proposes that all religions be included in a comprehensive course that covers the world's belief systems.

and the conservative push begins...





...against adoption by gay parents. at the forefront of the debate emerges one debra maggart, republican rep in sumner county, tn. according to maggart, most gays and lesbians are unfit to parent because they have "emotional dysfunctions and psychological issues." yeah, hellena doesn't know any heterosexual women or men who are  dysfunctional. there's no soccer moms doped up on mood inhibitors in this god-fearing country.is anyone else thinking of snl's church lady here?turns out ms. maggart is divorced, which makes her oh-so-stable and qualified to be a single parent, yet she believes children need "the optimum family unit, and that is a mother and a father." apparently, maggart hasn't checked the divorce rate of heterosexual couples lately.an excellent write-up from guerilla women tn here.isn't that special?
