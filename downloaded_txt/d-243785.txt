the 
		blue knights® 
		international law enforcement motorcycle club 
		is the oldest and largest law enforcement motorcycle club in the world. 
		founded in bangor, maine in the spring  
		of 1974 by seven municipal police officers, the blue knights has grown 
		to over 20,000 active members and 606 chapters
located in 29 
		countries, representing all facets of sworn law enforcement 
		internationally. membership in the blue knights is open to active and 
		retired full-time and active reserve sworn, governmental, law 
		enforcement officers that ride (any make) motorcycle off-duty.

make no 
		mistake, 
		we 
		are the good guys.

we are (or were) full-time or reserve, 
		police officers, sheriff's deputies, highway patrolmen, federal, state 
		and county law enforcement 

agents and investigators that love riding 
		motorcycles. not just one brand or type of motorcycle, but all kinds 
		from cruisers to sport bikes.  you name it, we ride it!  
		we feel that everyone should be free to ride whatever bike they choose, 
		as long as they ride it safely. law enforcement camaraderie is much more 
		important to us.

the ca vii 
		chapter was chartered in february 1991 and is the oldest 
		(continuously chartered) wcc chapter in california. we are also one of 
		the largest chapters in the 

west coast conference  
		we currently have over 22 members from various law enforcement 
		agencies throughout the greater san francisco bay area.
 



		the focus of our chapter is on safe and enjoyable group motorcycle riding. 



 motorcycle 
		safety foundation.
the ca 
		vii chapter serves members from alameda, san mateo, contra costa, 
		solano, san francisco and (northern) santa clara counties as well as any 
		other blue knights' members that wish to be affiliated with our chapter.


among the blue 
		knights' members,"there are no strangers, only friends you haven't met!"
