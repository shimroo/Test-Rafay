welcome,
the northwest center for reproductive sciences (ncrs) is the northwest’s premier infertility clinic. we offer new hope for infertile couples by providing the latest advances in infertility treatments in a “patient-friendly” environment – from diagnosis and treatment to success.
the ncrs is a partnership of four principal senior physicians and scientists who have been featured in the seattle magazine “top doctors” issue. the senior staff members, including physicians, laboratory scientists and administrators, each possess over 20 years experience in the reproductive medicine field.
drs. kennedy, letterie, opsahl and wiemer invite you to learn more about their dedication to patient services and care at ncrs.

are we infertile?

infertility is the inability to conceive or carry a child to delivery. the term is usually limited to situations where the couple has been unable to conceive for one year without using birth control. approximately 40% of reported cases of infertility are due to problems in the male; another 40% to problems in the female; the remaining 20% are of unknown cause or due to problems in both genders.
