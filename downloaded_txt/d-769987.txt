iâm brent danger michalski. yes, danger is my legal middle nameâitâs a long story, so maybe we can chat about it sometime. ð¤i am a seasoned and innovative ios developer with over 25 years of software engineering experience, and more than 12 years dedicated to ios development. my passion for ios development runs deep, and i genuinely love what i do.one thing iâm not is a designer. i can write code all day and bring projects together to look amazing, but at heart, i am first and foremost a developer.even this website was designed and developed in xcode! iâm using the ignite framework to develop this site completely in swift!sharing knowledge and mentoring junior developers brings me great joy (sounds corny, but itâs true), and i strive to foster an innovative, collaborative, and fun environment while creating high-performance, accessible, and easy-to-use apps that users love.my official journey in tech began back in 1997, and since then, iâve led numerous successful projects, including the development of the geoint app store for the u.s. intelligence community (wired: the dodâs app store does this one crucial thing to stay secure) and the edward jones ios app. i specialize in swift, swiftui, and cutting-edge development methodologies like test-driven development (tdd).in addition to my technical skills, i bring a quirky sense of humor and a passion for continuous improvement. i believe that loving what you do transforms work into something youâre happy to do every day.i have a deep love for learning and experimenting with new technologies, from ai, augmented reality, and machine learning to 3d printing and iot. when iâm not working on something related to ios, you can find me tinkering with raspberry pi or exploring the latest advancements in tech.thank you for visiting my portfolio. letâs build something amazing together!apps & projectsintercard inventory appthe intercard inventory app simplifies inventory management for arcade operators. it provides features for tracking, managing, and auditing arcade game inventory, ensuring accurate and efficient operations.appswiftxcodegithubuikitstoryboardsautolayoutcombinelldbcrashlyticsfirebasesqlapiresttestflightedward jones appthe edward jones app enables users to manage their financial goals on the go. features include viewing account holdings, performance, and activity, connecting external accounts, tracking progress towards goals, messaging with the edward jones team, and managing documents. the app supports check deposits, fund transfers, and robust security measures to protect user data.appswiftxcodegithubuikitstoryboardsautolayoutcombineasync-awaitfastlinkyodleelldbcrashlyticsfirebasesqlapiresttestflightoauthencryptiontokenmy shortcuts for xcodemy shortcuts for xcode is your ultimate companion for xcode productivity. this app empowers ios developers to streamline their workflow by offering a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts and quick actions, enabling you to navigate xcode with unparalleled efficiency. whether youâre a seasoned developer or just getting started, this app will help you master xcode and boost your productivity.appswiftswiftuixcodefirebasecombinestorekititak appthe itak (team awareness kit) app is a powerful geospatial tool designed for real-time collaboration and situational awareness. it supports features such as team location tracking, sensor information integration, live video streaming, chat communication, and offline mapping. this app is vital for various users including military, law enforcement, first responders, and commercial sectors, providing robust and secure capabilities for managing critical operations.appswiftxcodegithubuikitvideomessaginglivefeedsgeoint app storethe geoint app store was truly a pioneering, and highly innovative project and solution for its time, sadly, as of august 27th, 2021, the national geospatial-intelligence agency (nga) closed the innovative geoint application provider program (igapp), and the geoint app store is no longer providing access to commercial apps. working on the geoint app store, represents a defining moment in my professional career. it also is tough to use as an example of your work because you canât show it to anyone.appgeointswiftobjective-cjavascriptawsxcodesqlnosqldockerjenkinsintercard iservice appthe intercard iservice app assists technicians in maintaining arcade games by providing easy access to service logs and allowing them to take games in and out of service. the app enhances operational efficiency by offering a user-friendly interface for game maintenance.appswiftxcodegithubuikitstoryboardsautolayoutcombinelldbcrashlyticsfirebasesqlapiresttestflightturd herderyes, you read it correctly. i created a game called turd herder that, honestly, everyone who played it loved it and thought it was fun and funny. turd herder is a whimsical and entertaining augmented reality (ar) game that leverages appleâs arkit to deliver a unique and amusing gaming experience. inspired by a playful tutorial, turd herder transforms a simple concept into a fun and engaging game where players hunt for virtual poop emojis scattered around them in the real world. the objective is to locate and tap on these emojis as quickly as possible, making it a delightful challenge for players of all ages.appswiftxcodeavfoundationcoregraphicsspritekitarkitgithubuikitaugmented realityparticle emitterscreated with ignite
