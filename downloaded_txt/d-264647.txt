who we are…
carlisle arts learning center is a not-for-profit visual arts school and gallery serving the community with varied, affordable, and engaging art experiences. calc offers art classes to the general public and free high-quality gallery exhibits all year. we give member artists an opportunity to share and sell their work both in the g.b. stuart gallery and in our member-supported sales area, and additional exhibit opportunities are available annually. exhibits often include artist demonstrations, discussions, or workshops.



 











lifelong learning
we offer classes and workshops in a variety of media for everyone who wants to explore creativity, expression, and ongoing education opportunities at all stages of life.



 











creative youth
calc’s signature youth programs define our commitment to the community by strengthening the next generation of creative minds.  artworks, artlab, summer art camps for kids, saturday workshops, and school’s out: art’s in sessions are just the beginning of the programs we offer — many at low or no cost thanks to the generosity of our members, donors, and scholarship supporters.



 











connecting
it is all about people! we use art to bridge differences, build community, instill self-confidence and communicate about important topics and themes. in this ongoing mission, we aim to engage our neighbors and expand relationships through the arts.



 











ceramics
our in-house ceramics studio provides a welcoming environment for community members interested in clay. independent studio hours and classes for all age groups offer opportunities at any experience level. 































 











a heartfelt thank you
to our 2025 summer camp sponsor!
