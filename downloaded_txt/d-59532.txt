your questions, answered.



how do i get a design?

use our design tool or request free help from our expert team. need assistance? check out easyclosets help hub for tutorials and tips.



how much does an easyclosets project cost?

since our closet systems are fully customizable with a wide range of options, the prices vary. our design tool provides real-time, transparent pricing so you can see what factors into the cost of your project. by cutting out commissioned in-home designers and installation crews, you save up to 40%.



i have an odd-shaped closet. can i still use easyclosets?

yes! easyclosets solutions can be custom designed to accommodate odd-shaped spaces and obstructions such as windows, vents, etc. our professional designers can help you determine the best way to optimize your unique space.



do your closet systems stand on the floor, or hang on the wall?

both options are available, but we recommend wall-mounting for added floor storage and easier cleaning. unlike floor-mounted systems, our wall-mounted systems don't require molding alterations or shimming for uneven floors.



is installing an easyclosets system difficult?

no experience is required to install an easyclosets system because it really is easy. we thoughtfully designed our products to save you time, with pre-drilled holes, pre-cut shelves, pre-inserted cams, pre-assembled drawer boxes, and custom instructions.
