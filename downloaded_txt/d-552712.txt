	 letters from cato: the anti-anti-abortionists
    


my friend, paul zummo, writing at letters from cato, takes on some of the putative "pro-lifers" who now make their living attacking actual pro-lifers in exchange for the approval of their new-found followers among the leftist mob.paul begins by noting that the overturning of roe and casey are by no means a done deal. there is no final decision at this point, and the justices are still free to change their minds. we've been down this road before in both webster and casey itself:i don’t have much to add on the substance of the leaked decision that may spell the end of roe. pro-lifers have had too many lucy pulling the football away moments to feel comfortable until the decision is actually handed down.he then notes that if the decision stands, it's a pretty big deal:... many conservatives have been quite happy to laud the draft opinion. personally, i refuse to read it until dobbs is formally and officially decided, but those who have read it, at least among actual conservatives (more on that in a moment), have universally and unapologetically praised it...then paul gets to the crux of his post:what i would like to discuss are the erstwhile conservatives and catholics who have either thrown cold water on the decision or else have actively derided it. i won’t even bring up the folks at the grifter project. everyone already knows their principles are subject to being changed by the highest bidder, so i will go on ignoring them as every good and decent person should.no, i would like to talk about the more “enlightened,” principled conservatives, especially those whose mission is to conserve conservatism.paul follows with a discussion of the various weasel-word responses to the leaked draft of justice alito's opinion from such formerly "principled" pro-life conservatives as evan mcmullin (some of y'all voted for this fraud), bill kristol (who once wrote a piece for the weakly substandard titled (in all caps) "roe must go"), jonathan last (who "was once a staunch pro-life advocate and author of books like what to expect when no one’s expecting" and who once wrote “i’m one of those anti-abortion nut jobs who thinks that every embryo is sacred life and abortion is killing an innocent.”), and last, but not least, mark shea (who once actually thought with the church instead of just pretending to while actually aligning himself with the dnc platform).  this one, in particular, rankles:[mark] shea calls the evident reversal of roe a pyrrhic victory, but perhaps he is upset because it’s a victory he has assured us for decades was never coming because the gop has been playing us. now that two decades of doomcasting have been proven to be bogus, shea wants to pretend it is utterly meaningless...these people have shown that they would rather “own the right” than rejoice at what *may* turn out to be the greatest pro-life victory of our lifetime … a result for which they all once openly advocated. back when they at least pretended to be pro-life. but they’ve all been frauds all along. “it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world, but for [‘likes’ from rabid pro-infanticide leftists]?”

	 do justice. love mercy. walk humbly.
    





he
 has shown you, o man, what is good. and what does the lord require of 
you but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your god?
~ micah 6:8
_________________________

"i now make it my earnest prayer, that god would have you, and the 
state over which you preside, in his holy protection, that he would 
incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of 
subordination and obedience to government, to entertain a brotherly 
affection and love for one another, for their fellow citizens of the 
united states at large, and particularly for their brethren who have 
served in the field, and finally, that he would most graciously be 
pleased to dispose us all, to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean 
ourselves with that charity, humility and pacific temper of mind, which 
were the characteristicks of the divine author of our blessed religion, 
and without an humble imitation of whose example in these things, we can
 never hope to be a happy nation."
~ his excellency, george washington
circular to the states | sunday, 8 june 1783 
_________________________

some thoughts:

do justice
* black lives matter. period. no buts.

* the response "all lives matter" to the black lives matter movement is
 the equivalent of the "seamless garment" response to the pro-life 
movement. standing alone, they are nice-sounding and even laudable 
sentiments. juxtaposed against the justice movements to which they are a
 response, they have the effect -- and perhaps even the intention -- of 
undermining those justice movements.

* both / and. it is entirely
 possible to criticize, protest, and call for the reform of shortcomings
 in society and in our criminal justice system that unduly and 
negatively impact the lives of african-americans, while at the same time
 criticizing and calling for an immediate cessation of ongoing riots 
resulting in violence and destruction of personal property.

* 
order precedes justice, and both precede freedom. in a review of a 
biography of founding father and first chief justice john jay a few 
years ago, the imaginative conservative noted: "a civ­i­lized so­ci­ety 
must have order, justice, and free­dom. the se­quence is es­sen­tial. 
with­out order, noth­ing can func­tion. once order is es­tab­lished, 
jus­tice can come into being and once order and jus­tice pre­vail, 
freedom can arise and flour­ish." the rioting and violence needs to stop
 -- order needs to prevail. only once order is established can we then 
move to the very necessary work of seeing that justice toward our 
african-american brothers and sisters can be achieved. there is much 
work to be done. liberty and freedom follows from that. if only some of 
us are free, then none of us are free.


love mercy
* walk a 
mile in a man's shoes. if you don't fully understand what black lives 
matter is all about, try to put yourself in the place of those who do. 
not the violent rioters who hijacked the legitimate protests in order to
 push for revolution. no, i'm talking about putting yourself in the 
shoes of people for whom their skin color makes every traffic stop a 
"what if ...?" and even if you think that's bs (and it's not), at least 
have some empathy for the individuals who do feel that way. ask yourself
 why they feel that way. and try to imagine that there might be some 
legitimacy to their concerns.

* rioters and their apologists are
 not showing much mercy to anyone who gets in their way. beatings and 
even deaths have occurred. homes, businesses, livelihoods, life savings,
 neighborhoods have been destroyed. most often, those hurt by the 
destruction are those for whom the protests are supposed to help. and 
the response of the rioters and their apologists? "f*ck 'em, they have 
insurance." no, not all of them do. and it's not even clear that 
insurance will cover riot damage. as others have pointed out, this 
elitist response is the "let them eat cake" of this particular crisis 
(and with the previous crisis and the "let them eat cake" response of 
the very same elites -- covid, remember that? -- not even over yet).

* we need to stop seeing people as nothing more than the sum of their 
skin color and their political beliefs, and start loving them as 
individuals and fellow human beings. it's okay to disagree. it's not 
okay to hate. in fact, it's imperative to love.


walk humbly with your god
* needless to say, everyone could use a good dose of humility right 
now, including yours truly. no one has all the answers. no one is right 
all the time. no one is wrong all the time. there is no 
one-size-fits-all approach that is going to work for everyone. there is 
no magic wand that can be waved to fix everything. there is no 
ideological solution that is going to bring about heaven on earth. 
contemplate that you might be wrong about something. imagine that your 
ideological opponent might be right about something. think about ways 
you can serve others humbly and without regard to whether they might 
think differently, look differently, smell differently, live differently
 than you do.

* seek something higher than yourself. for many, 
that will be god. seek his will in your life and in this world, not your
 own. "thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." that's not a call 
for utopia; that's a call for you to be like him, to seek him, to 
reflect him in living out your life. for a sadly increasing number, that
 "something higher" will not be god. for you, seek out what there is to 
love about humanity. seek what it is that compels you to do good for 
all, not just most or some. seek out what there is to love in each 
individual person, as a person, even when you dislike or disagree with 
them -- seek that individual's personal well-being, by seeing them as an
 individual, not as a statistic.

* pray.

	 i may be pro ecclesia, pro familia, and pro civitate, but i no longer call myself "pro-life"
    


for quite a while now, i have been contemplating briefly -- for just one post -- coming out of blog retirement to explain why i no longer refer to myself as being "pro-life". i had it all written in my head, and had only to actually sit down, revisit my old blogger interface, and start typing.

fortunately, eric sammons, writing at catholicvote, has saved me the trouble by writing, essentially, the very apologia i had planned:

... no matter the reason, by calling every issue a “pro-life” issue, we 
dilute and fracture the brand. we make other, less important issues as 
important as the abortion issue. we needlessly divide pro-lifers over 
prudential issues about which we should be able to respectfully 
disagree.

as for me, i’ve come to realize that i’m no longer pro-life. just 
call me anti-abortion. it’s accurate, specific, and tells the whole 
world that i’m unabashedly opposed to child-killing.
so, no longer refer to me as "pro-life" -- not if being "pro-life" means i also have to accept a hodgepodge of dnc platform positions
 pushed by lefty catholics and the usccb bureaucracy. i want to oppose 
abortion on my terms ... not the terms of people who, in the end, don't 
really give two squirts about ending abortion. call me "anti-abortion".(and with that, i sign off.)

	 alternate title for david mills' piece at crux today:  crux still telling converts "shut up!"
    





alternate title for david mills' piece at crux today:  crux still telling converts "shut up!"

david mills admonishes that "newcomers to the church should speak less, listen more." and here's the thing. on one level i do agree with what mills writes
 about converts needing a period of reflection, adjustment, and 
additional mystagogy -- of getting our feet wet, so to speak, before 
pronouncing on any and all things catholic. in retrospect, i wish i had 
waited before i began to blog about catholicism shortly after i 
converted almost a decade-and-a-half ago (i only had been catholic for 9
 months when i "took up the pen" in the catholic blogosphere.)

but then mills completely goes off the rails:

"... he may be full of book-learning. but of the real catholic mind or 
imagination - the catholic paradigm, the way catholics see the world - 
he knows little. the new catholic **must work for many years** to get 
that, and **never will get it fully**. (emphasis added)

"most 
converts, as i wrote in the new oxford review, will never think and feel
 exactly as do cradle catholics. they do by instinct what we will always
 do by analysis followed by choice.

"for a long time, and perhaps
 a very long time, the convert will see the catholic thing as you see a 
garden through a bay window, not as you see it when you’re standing 
amidst the flowers. he sees its design and beauty, but doesn’t feel the 
sun or smell the flowers or enjoy walking barefoot on the grass. nor 
does he know what it is like to get caught in the rain or stung by a 
bee, or to spend hours weeding. he has to spend many years outside to 
know what life in the garden is really like..."

what a crock! 
this is fetishizing the cradle catholic experience as being the *real* 
catholic experience, and holding up any alternative to that as somehow 
less than. i used to do this exact same thing that mills is doing when i
 was a new catholic. i used to lament that i would never be able to 
experience the faith with the instinct and the ethos of a cradle 
catholic. that i would somehow always be an "incomplete" or not "real" 
catholic like all my brethren born into the faith and that i had somehow
 been "deprived" of my "birthright" as a "true" catholic.

now i 
recognize that for the utter horseshit that it is. it is nothing more 
than fetishizing cradle catholicism ... in the same way many people 
fetishize the conversion experiences of the new catholic. converts are 
no less or no more "real" catholics than are cradle catholics. we all 
have our gifts that we bring to how we live our faith and we all have 
our shortcomings. and none of those gifts or shortcoming are inherent, 
innate, ingrained, implicit, instinctive, distinctive, or integral (or 
whatever other word or clinical diagnosis you choose to plug in) to 
being either a cradle catholic or a convert. and they are most 
definitely not fixed or inalienable based upon such status.

st.
 paul was no more or no less competent to speak out against st. peter 
for his having been a convert than were any of the other apostles who 
had been with peter all along. it is high time we stop criticizing and /
 or fetishizing the experiences of our fellow catholics based on whether
 or not they are cradle, convert, or revert catholics. how 'bout we all 
just be catholics?

update
upon further reflection, this piece (and it's "speak less, listen more" headline) is actually far more condescending than "shut up!"it's more like "shhhhh."

update #2for more background on the anti-convert dustup taking place at crux (funded by your knight of columbus dues) and elsewhere, read paul zummo's excellent post at the american catholic.

update #3 
deal hudson has written an excellent response to mills' piece ... also published at crux. labels: converts

	 the new catholic debate: is it ever ok to punch a heretic?
    



catholics can't agree on whether violence is an appropriate response to heresy

from saloon.com:

arius, leader of the anti-homoousian christology movement and advocate for the father's divinity over the son, was
 punched in the face by bishop nicholas of myra while bragging about the success of arianism in spreading the heresy denying the consubstantiality of the father and son  throughout europe, the middle east, north africa, and also in various germanic kingdoms.




illustrations of the punch were seen more than a million and half times. arius has said he’s not a heretic — even though his “arianism” has devolved into supporting heretical tendencies.


the punch has spurred a flurry of parodies and memes on facebook:































although the number of views of the memes and the glee with which the 
memes are being shared suggest many find it fun to watch someone who professed heresy at an ecumenical council get clocked, a serious debate over the act is 
going down over: if you see someone espousing the views of arius 
in public, should your knuckles meet their jaw? the church needs answers, 
apparently. even the new york times jumped into the debate:


there
 was little substantive debate online about the ethics of punching bishop arius. facebook is not a place where minds are often changed, and the 
supporters and opponents of the sucker punch were unmoved by one 
another’s quips.



opponents
 of the punch tended to say that violence had no place in theological 
debate. supporters tended to say the punch was funny, and more than a 
few compared bishop arius’s attacker to famous punchers from pop 
culture, like batman.

a glance at history indicates that violence towards heretics has been something christians have advocated for a while now.





thankfully, the times didn’t bury the most important hidden gem:


bishop arius's sore jaw resulted from a sucker punch in what he described as “a safe space.” (it was a church-sponsored event, after all.) he said he thought the attack happened, in part, because he was in the 
wrong place at the wrong time — sitting next to bishop nicholas.



maybe the question shouldn’t be, “is it ok to punch a heretic?” but, “if 
you don’t want to be punched in the face, maybe you shouldn’t 
preach heresy to the faithful?”

	 wikileaks confirms democrat conspiracy to "plant seeds of revolution" in catholic church, vindicates catholic blogs that exposed front groups
    



in case you're wondering, the "middle ages dictatorship" that is the catholic church and her bishops is right there in the middle of hillary clinton's so-called "basket of deplorables". and the clinton team had a plan to rid themselves of these troublesome priests by "plant[ing] the seeds of the revolution" against the catholic hierarchy and its teachings via infiltration and subversion.


some of us caught on to this plan a decade ago...

vindication. yes, an opportunity to gloat. to say "i told you so." 

not a very pretty sentiment, but that's about the only thing that could bring me out of blogging retirement (but only for this one post) in the electoral annus horribilis that is 2016.

so it turns out that what we knew all along about the soros-funded democatholic front groups catholics in alliance for the common good and its sister organization catholics united was, in fact, 100% on the money. we have an admission right out of the horse's mouth (or, rather, out of the horse's leaked emails). i haven't the time nor the inclination to get into a long retrospective detailing the war of words that i and other like-minded bloggers waged over several years -- beginning a decade ago -- against catholics in alliance for the common good and catholics united. instead, i will direct you to the links below, which will more than fill you in and give you a taste of what was being said and what was at stake.

in short, my part in this drama began a decade ago during the 2006 elections, when catholics in alliance for the common good published a catholic voter guide that played down the priority given by the church to traditional life issues in favor of a hodge-podge of issues straight out of the democrat party platform. at first, i began by just blogging about and linking to what others were saying about this mysterious group who had suddenly appeared on the scene in the midst of a mid-term election. as the evidence poured in, especially evidence that linked the group to funding provided by none other than george soros, it soon became clear that catholics in alliance for the common good was little more than a front group for the democrat party and its efforts to blur the lines on life issues with catholic voters.

and then, the week before the november 2006 elections, our own catholic chronicle -- the usually fairly orthodox newspaper of the diocese of toledo, ohio -- published a front-page puff piece on the efforts of catholics in alliance for the common good in our own diocese to promote their vision and their voter guide (the story reported the efforts in a straightforward manner, without questioning the problematic aspects of the group and its voter guide).. the proverbial you-know-what must've hit the fan in the chancery offices once the very orthodox then-toledo bishop leonard blair (now archbishop of hartford, ct) caught wind of it, because the article was gone from the chronicle's website within a matter of hours after it was published. alas, it was too late to remove the article from the print editions, which went out the weekend before the elections on the following tuesday to parishes diocese-wide. so, in response to the chronicle's article, i penned a letter to the editor taking the chronicle and the main protagonist of the article, prof. richard gaillardetz, to task for the misrepresentation and manipulation of catholic teaching. the chronicle eventually published my letter, along with a few others disagreeing with the article and its timing, a couple of months later. following the letter's publication, the response from the catholics in alliance crowd was swift and predictably unpleasant. you can read the comments here for a taste. this war of words against catholics in alliance for the common good and catholics united (and various offshoots like catholic democrats, etc.) went on for several years and took many twists and turns, which you can read about in the links at the bottom of this post.

in the end, it is my belief that, ultimately, those of us leading the charge against these groups lost that war (at least in the short term covering 2006, 2008, and 2012). catholics in alliance for the common good and catholics united accomplished their aims of convincing catholics that voting for a party that views government-funded abortion on demand as a sacrament, and that views the destruction of the traditional family as a prerequisite to achieving its policy goals and destroying the institutions -- such as the church and other religious people and organizations -- that might stand in that party's way of achieving said policy goals, was not only morally acceptable, but was, in fact, the most catholic way to vote. see, e.g., doug kmiec.  "these groups are merely drawing attention to long-ignored issues of importance to catholics," some said. "these groups are doing the church a service by focusing on the need for a 'consistent ethic of life'," they said (never mind that these groups never talked about such life issues as abortion, euthanasia, or the sanctity of the family). entire blogs were established for the purpose of propagandizing the issues that the democath groups argued were being ignored because of catholic voters' allegedly "obsessive" focus on "a narrow spectrum of issues regarding family and sexuality" (i.e. the sanctity of life and the family). sometimes, these blogs had well-meaning founders who definitely raised important issues for catholics to consider when they were deciding how to vote, but these blogs often quickly devolved into democath propaganda organs as certain bloggers and frequent combox commentators used those fora to press forward the agitprop that ultimately undermined the good of the catholic church and her teachings in favor of the pursuit of democrat party policy goals. far too many catholics who should have known better allowed themselves to be swayed by the arguments of those whose only purpose was to weaken the resolve of catholic voters to stand for the catholic church's teachings on the primacy of life and family issues, and instead were duped by these malefactors to trade that birthright for a mess of feel-good leftist policy pottage. and that party repaid them by, among many other things, suing nuns to force them to provide birth control in their medical policies. and, in response, catholic voters had so weakened their resolve to stand for traditional life issues, that they re-elected the guy who has consistently attacked their church. which was the goal of catholics in alliance for the common good and catholics united all along. today, there is no identifiable "catholic vote" left to speak of thanks to the likes of catholics in alliance for the common good and catholics united.

so, it turns out to be a rather bittersweet bit of gloating, at best, when i read the latest wikileaks email dump, which includes a 2012 email exchange in which hilliary clinton's current campaign chairman, john podesta, openly brags about being involved in efforts to infiltrate the catholic church and foment a "catholic spring" (i.e. a bottom-up rebellion against the church hierarchy and its teaching authority akin to the "arab spring" -- albeit without the violence, one hopes -- that led to revolutions in egypt, libya, and syria). the means of fomenting this takeover of the church? why, none other than catholics in alliance for the common good and catholics united:

hi, john, 
this whole controversy with the bishops opposing contraceptive coverage even though 98% of catholic women (and their conjugal partners) have used contraception has me thinking . . .  there needs to be a catholic spring, in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church. is contraceptive coverage an issue around which that could happen.  the bishops will undoubtedly continue the fight.  does the catholic hospital association support of the administration's new policy, together with "the 98%"  create an opportunity? 

of course, this idea may just reveal my total lack of understanding of the catholic church, the economic power it can bring to bear against nuns and priests who count on it for their maintenance, etc. even if the idea isn't crazy,  i don't qualify to be involved and i have not thought at all about how one would "plant the seeds of the revolution," or who would plant them.


just wondering . . .

hoping you're well, and getting to focus your time in the ways you want.

subject: re: opening for a catholic spring? just musing . . .



we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a
moment like this. but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now.
likewise catholics united. like most spring movements, i think this
one will have to be bottom up. i'll discuss with tara.  kathleen
kennedy townsend is the other person to consult.
(emphasis added)



that there is what we call a "smoking gun". again, we knew all along what these groups were up to, but they always had some plausible deniability along with their apologists making the case that they were honest-to-goodness "faithful catholics"™️ just arguing for a "consistent ethic of life" (again, albeit one that never ever quite mentioned abortion). but this podesta email is a validation and vindication of the efforts of myself and like-minded bloggers such as, for example, rich leonardi, to expose this infiltration of the catholic church by political subversives bent on "plant[ing] the seeds of ... revolution".

if you have the time, i encourage you to read as many of the links below as you can to get some indication of what these subversive groups were up to and the efforts to which bloggers were going to expose them. you might find of particular interest the links detailing how former ohio gov. ted strickland (a democrat who is now challenging u.s. sen. rob portman for his senate seat) had a man at catholics in alliance for the common good whom he also appointed to head up the ohio faith-based initiatives office and who was, at the same time, running a prostitution ring. yep.

"[a] great blog[] to read." ~ fidelis
"well done!" ~ dale price
"we should all be pro ecclesia ... jay provides the best round-up of news interesting to catholics and christians i have found ... full stories, great links, and pithy, on-the-nose comments" ~ bill hennessy
"take your browsers on over to the informative and uplifting blogspace of jay anderson, esq." ~ fumare
"an easy-to-digest roundup of the relevant commentary, combined with jay's own insightful remarks" ... "jay always links to interesting stuff, but his best pieces are when he takes the time to add his own commentary. i particularly enjoy his scottish history posts, but his perspectives on issues of law, politics, culture and faith are really why i read enjoy his blog so much. just be careful you don't go blind when you're hoping of a picture of andriana lima in a bathing suit, and get one of teddy kennedy in a bathing suit instead. ~ paul at thoughts of a regular guy
"jay anderson is definitely my hero now." ~ micharl r. denton at for the greater glory
"jay anderson takes his faith seriously... his disdain for “malthusian nonsense” on issues of population and child bearing reflect an uncompromisingly pro-life position... agree or disagree, jay anderson’s blog is informed and relevant, and demands consideration as we look into how religion figures into the way individuals participate in the national discourse." ~ stained glass politics
"my friend jay anderson at pro ecclesia always produces posts well worth reading.  today he outdoes himself ..." ~ donald r. mcclarey at the amerian catholic
"jay possesses a wide range of knowledge and always has something new and interesting to say in the areas of politics, church, and family. his comments are right on. he is a staunch defender of the culture of life." ~ jean at catholic fire
"in the tradition of newman and chesterton" ~ college catholic
"my friend jay anderson at pro ecclesia has been deceived by the anti-christ" ~ rick lugari
"[a] blog i admire because of the level and tone of the reporting--there's always a lot of good stuff to read about on this blog, and the editorial remarks are always logical ... you can tell an intelligent blogger, though, when even venomous comments are worth reading for the little tidbits of information that they provide about the subject at hand..." an example of intense catholic engagement with the world ... i find his posts so compelling ... this is my opportunity to single out a blog i don't mention much, but read very faithfully. ~ literacy chic at words, words
"a genius ... at communicating so much with such efficiency" ~ julie d. of happy catholic
"the flower of southern manhood incarnate forced against his will to move to a foreign country ... ohio." ~ lair of the catholic cavemen
"the insightful and fearless jay anderson" ... "if you haven't already done so, check out jay anderson's pro ecclesia. you can thank me later!" ~ holy fool
"a wonderful catholic site ... jay anderson's pro ecclesia site has always impressed me with it's very high caliber content and writing and i recommend it highly as a beautiful and well organized catholic site that i'm sure you will enjoy reading and coming back to often." ~ frank trainor
"excellent blog" ~ zach brissett of in toon with the world
"pro ecclesia * pro familia * pro civitate is a great site to visit nearly every day, ... definitely worth looking at." "one of my other 'have to read' blogs." ~robk at kyrie eleison and catholic dads
"an informed opinion" ... "thinking blog ... political allegience asides, jay's posts rarely disappoint" ~ evangelical catholicism
"one of my favorite bloggers ... you can only hide genius for so long ..." ~ causa nostrae laetitiae
"rather interesting blog" ~ joee blogs of a catholic londoner
"blog of note ... pro ecclesia, pro familia, pro civitate ... if you haven't visited this blog before, you might want to take the time to do so." ~ memories of a catholic wife and mother
"justifying my links ... first up is pro ecclesia by jay anderson. he deals mostly with the intersection of family, politics, and catholicism... mr. anderson is a prolific blogger with multiple posts a day. one can keep abreast of church issues by visiting his blog alone. his articles are well-written and the site-design is attractive... a very worthy addition to asymmetric." ~ nelson guirado of asymmetric
"a very interesting conservative catholic blog and well worth a read." ~ the dunadan at cally's kitchen
"yes, it's the inimitable jay anderson from pro ecclesia. you have to be really secure in your manhood to wear a skirt kilt ..." ~ tony miller of manly men
"a good blog." ~ the roving medievalist
"jay is a stalwart conservative, a big c conservative, after my own heart. i read his web log everyday ..." ~ brian duffy at one oar in the water
"a fine pro-life web site" ~ vital signs blog
"i actually like jay's blog for more than his obvious good taste in humor. he's a conservative in politics but doesn't place that above his faith. he's a family man who often has very good observations on what makes a family tick (or not). and he works hard to be a faithful catholic. all these things make it easier to swallow his status as a lawyer. if you notice the title of his blog (pro ecclesia, pro familia, pro civitate), he also puts things in the proper order: god, family, country." ~ christine at domestic vocation
"... jay anderson's excellent pro ecclesia" "... nothing short of brilliant" "... jay anderson ... is one of the best catholic bloggers out there"~ creative minority report
"i can't help but think kmiec is talking about you [in complaining about his "torment" by "right-wing" catholic bloggers]. i honestly can't think of anyone who took him on more piercingly than you. great job. hopefully your criticisms wake him up." "i'm with jay. after a great argument like that how could you be against him?"~matthew archbold of creative minority report
"my favorite catholic bloggers ... pro ecclesia * pro familia * pro civitate — the always faithful jay anderson writes one of the best catholic political blogs around.  i really love it when he gets angry." pat archbold of creative minority report, writing at national catholic register
"here are some more 'blogs that i've had to put off-limits: pro ecclesia: ph, r, c, t, o [ph - phariseeism; r - republicanism; c - clericalism; t - traditionalism; o - offensive (anti-womyn, anti-glbtna, etc)]" ~ fr. tim at spirit of vatican 2 "catholic" faith community
"blogger reflection award ... jay anderson at pro ecclesia * pro familia * pro civitate. i have to love a lawyer who promotes orthodox catholicism, family, citizenship, and devotion to my dear patron, st. thomas more." ~ anita moore at v for victory
"if you check out conservative blogger jay anderson, you will see even more invective addressed toward kmiec... jay anderson is a little more reasonable ... but he does constantly misrepresent the views of liberals in order to push his own agenda. now as far as that goes, maybe [his] criticism of kmiec is right." ~ the platonist
"political analysis from a catholic perspective. excellent insight ..." "favorite catholic commentary ..." "... quality commentary without compromising the faith... a well written blog offering commentary on hot topics ... and other political tertiary topics. this knight of columbus is a convert with a passion for law ... if you want to flesh our difficult politically related topics such as stem cell research to abortion, this blog has it all for you." ~ tito at custos fidei
"[one of] my genuine must-reads just about every day." ~ g. thomas fitzpatrick at recta ratio
"this blog is great, i find myself blogging, or not blogging a lot of what is posted over there. on top of that the title of the blog was one that i wanted originally, only to find that it was taken, and well represented" ~ defend us in battle
"i trust that our readers will understand after reading jay’s post why pro ecclesia is one of the few blogs i check in on every day." ~ donald mcclarey at the american catholic
"godwin’s law begets anderson’s law ... unfortunately we are seeing anderson’s law in effect pretty much daily." ~ ken at the billings free press
"go to that blog at your own risk" ~ the michigan daily
"there aren’t a lot of manly blogs in the catholic blogosphere, in the sense of men talking about manly things... it’s a frequent topic at pro ecclesia and thoughts of a regular guy, but it seems the list thins out quickly after that." ... the desire to be holy and the desire to be a good father thrives [at] ... pro ecclesia ... jay anderson’s popular blog ..." ~ eric scheske, national catholic register
"a new breed of theological conservatives has taken to blogs ... to say the church isn't catholic enough... enraged by dissent that they believe has gone unchecked for decades, and unafraid to say so in the starkest language, these activists are naming names and unsettling the church... john allen, vatican analyst for the national catholic reporter, has dubbed this trend "taliban catholicism." ... on the internet and in the church, conservatives are having the bigger impact... however, the conservative catholic activists insist their faith, especially church teaching on abortion, inspires all their work." ~ associated press
"to apply the term 'neoconservative' to me or any other southerner is an oxymoron. the south is arguably the most conservative region in the country, but there ain't nothin' 'neo' about our conservatism. we've always been pro military and have favored a muscular u.s. foreign policy going back to the earliest days of the republic ... the appellation 'neoconservative' by definition doesn't apply to the traditional conservatism of southerners." ~ me

st. thomas more, pray for us

o glorious st. thomas more, patron of statesmen, politicians, judges and lawyers, your life of prayer and penance and your zeal for justice, integrity and firm principle in public and family life led you to the path of martyrdom and sainthood. intercede for our statesmen, politicians, judges and lawyers, that they may be courageous and effective in their defense and promotion of the sanctity of human life - the foundation of all other human rights. we ask this through christ our lord. amen.
bishop michael satarelli of wilmington, de
(ht: catholics in the public square)

______________________________

thomas more, counselor of law and patron of statesmen, merry martyr and most human of saints:
pray that, for the glory of god and in the pursuit of his justice, i may be able in argument, accurate in analysis, keen in study, correct in conclusion, loyal to clients, honest with all, courteous to adversaries, trustworthy with confidences, courageous in court. sit with me at my desk and listen with me to my clients' tales. read with me in my library and stand always beside me so that today i shall not, to win a point, lose my soul.
pray that my family may find in me what yours found in you: friendship and courage, cheerfulness and charity, diligence in duties, counsel in adversity, patience in pain -- their good servant, and god's first. amen. ______________________________ prayer to st. thomas more for lawyers and judges
dear scholar and martyr, it was not the king of england but you who were the true defender of the faith. like christ unjustly condemned, neither promises nor threats could make you accept a civil ruler as head of the christian church. perfect in your honesty and love of truth, grant that lawyers and judges may imitate you and achieve true justice for all people. amen. ***** lawyer's prayer "give me the grace good lord, to set the world at naught; to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of men's mouths. to be content to be solitary. not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof." ***** litany of st. thomas more, 
martyr and patron saint of statesmen, politicians and lawyers ***** novena to st. thomas more ______________________________ ~ quoth st. thomas more ~ "the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest." ***** "what does it avail to know that there is a god, which you not only believe by faith, but also know by reason: what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him?" ***** "the things that we pray for, good lord, give us grace to labour for." *****

prayer of saint thomas more
give me, good lord, a full faith and a fervent charity, a love of you, good lord, incomparable above the love of myself; and that i love nothing to your displeasure but everything in an order to you.
take from me, good lord, this lukewarm fashion, or rather cold manner of meditation and this dullness in praying to you. and give me warmth, delight and life in thinking about you.
and give me your grace to long for your holy sacraments and specially to rejoice in the presence of your blessed body, sweet saviour christ, in the holy sacrament of the altar, and duly to thank you for your gracious coming. amen.
