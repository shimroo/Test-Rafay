lincoln's bike shopcycle works was started in the summer of 1981 with 5 bikes and $300 in accessories in the shell of a former car wash. since then we have expanded to our present location with more than 1000 bikes in stock. we have been able to grow by following one principle, "quality, service and selection is everything!"
