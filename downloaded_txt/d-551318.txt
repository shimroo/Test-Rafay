our legacy
a gathering of guests
since 1803, the golden lamb has been a gathering place — for neighbors, travelers, statesmen, presidents, families and friends. our legacy runs deep, infused with the spirit of hospitality, accented by the flavors of history, and framed by inspiring events. for more than 220 years, we’ve delighted guests with excellent service and memorable food and drink in an atmosphere found nowhere else.

from our farm to our table
inspired by the rich history of the agricultural heartland that we call home, we pride ourselves on using high-quality, fresh products sourced locally, including from our very own farm in nearby oregonia.

	        stay the night
	    


since our inception as a stagecoach inn, we have hosted overnight visitors. today, guests can sleep where presidents have slept, walk the same halls as the likes of charles dickens and mark twain, and become a part of a legacy more than 215 years in the making.
