the pontifex maximus and his lawyer: glenn greenwald and his strange far-right blind spot









-->






[cross-posted at daily kos.]you may be like me, confused about how nationally known
pundits who label themselves “progressives” can go on fox news and encourage
tucker carlson in his attacks on liberal democrats. or how they can tell their
readers that the threat of white nationalism and its violence is “nonexistent,”
or that calling attention to the threat of hate groups and neo-nazis is exactly
like the neocons blaming all of islam for 9/11.





but this has been happening with increasing regularity
within a certain faction of “progressive” journalists who, as it happens, are
also convinced that russian interference in the 2016 election is a complete
non-story—particularly glenn greenwald and michael tracey.



over the weekend, tracey tweeted out his view that the
threat from white nationalism is “nonexistent” and that liberals were being
politically overwhelmed by the hysteria of it all:








i replied with an extended
thread pointing out the many acts of white-nationalist terrorism before and
after charlottesville, more than enough evidence that the violent hate being
stirred into action by the new generation of young fascists is a
serious problem that deserves our full attention. we are being inundated in
a disturbingly large wave of hate crimes, against an increasing range of
victims. we’re even seeing assassination attempts being made by far-right
ideologues who believe they are doing the bidding of the authoritarian figure
they worship—namely, donald trump.





these trends are not contained just to the united states, of
course. from norway
in 2011 to christchurch
in 2019, the problem of rising fascist authoritarianism and its attendant
violence has become a global one. we’ve seen authoritarian regimes take power
in hungary, in turkey, in the phillipines, and the results have all been
predictably brutal and frightening for anyone who believes in open democracies.




one of the worst examples of this, of course, is in brazil,
where the ascendance of the
proto-fascist authoritarian jair bolsonaro to the presidency has been
accompanied by assassinations
of his opponents and a surging tide of hate crimes that has resulted
in hundreds of deaths and thousands of assaults targeting the lgbt
community—mirroring, perhaps on a more intense scale, what we are seeing in the
united states. (certainly bolsonaro is more openly fascist and thuggish than
trump.)



so when greenwald, who lives in brazil and is highly active
against bolsonaro and his regime, published a tweet describing the kind of fear
and loathing that exists within the lgbt community in rio because of the
regime, i
politely reminded him that, while many communities (including the
immigrant and muslim,
as well as
lgbt) in the united states are under a similar cloud of fear, especially
amid the current rising
tide of hate crimes, people like tracey—who greenwald frequently promotes
in his twitter feed—were actively hurting our efforts to combat the problem by
dismissing it as “nonexistent”: they “want to tell us that having white
nationalists killing people in acts of targeted terrorism in our streets and
houses of worship is just a figment of our overactive liberal imaginations.”



greenwald—who apparently has a different interpretation of
“nonexistent” than i do—responded
that tracey was saying “no such thing,” rather, that he was “saying it's
important to keep the threat in perspective & not be alarmist about it so
politicians can't exploit it.” we went to and fro, with me pointing out that
“alarmist” is a label that could just as easily—and just as unjustifiably—be
plastered on him as on me. and that i’ve been documenting the rise of this
problem for years, which he full well knows.



i also pointed out that, in the not terribly distant past,
he has himself been an enabler of fascist movements, much as tracey is being
now. so he dismissed me as a liar.



well, here are the receipts. it’s a little story i call “the
little pontifex maximus who wanted to make america white again and his lawyer.”





ben klassen

it all kind of begins in 1956, when a man named ben klassen
invented an early version of an electric can opener and patented the device.
klassen was a tinkerer who had made a killing in real estate; he was one of the
cofounders of silver springs, nv, and had walked away with a bundle. klassen’s
invention was a wall-mounted design, and he made another bundle off his patent
for the first few years, mostly in industrial use. however, other designs that
were cheaper, more portable and applicable to household appliances came along.
by 1962 he had closed shop.



having made a couple of small fortunes (mostly in real
estate), klassen decided to become a politician. a longtime member of the john
birch society, he ran for the florida house from his home in broward county
1966 and won on an anti-busing, anti-government platform. he only served one
term. klassen also headed up a local group supporting george wallace’s
presidential candidacy. 



after losing his seat in 1968, klassen decided the
republicans and democrats were too corrupted by jews and founded his own party,
the nationalist white party, in 1970. the nwp was aimed at recruiting white
christians: “we believe that the white race was created in the image of the lord...”
was no. 1 on the party’s official 14-point program. but it fell apart quickly
when klassen began expressing doubts about christianity.





klassen explained his apostacy in later books.

his main concern (elucidated at length in later works) was
that jesus was a jew and the entire christian faith was thus the tainted
offspring of judaism. klassen regarded the jews as children of satan and
believed no worthwhile religion could come from them. so he decided to found an
entirely new religion, separate from christianity and judaism, predicated
essentially on the worship of whiteness. he called it creativity, and his
organization the church of the creator.



klassen’s first book, nature’s
eternal religion, explains the theology (such as it is) in detail: white
people are the obvious cream of god’s creation, and as such should be held as
the repositories of god’s will, the holders of all religious, political and
economic power. it’s also incredibly crude and vile, essentially
third-grade-level racism expressed with sixth-grade-level intelligence. klassen
insisted on the persistent use of degrading stereotypes and epithets regarding
all nonwhites and jews. he reveled in it.





klassen moved to rural north carolina and set up his church
operations near the rural town of otto in 1982. he continued to churn out
texts, notably the white man’s bible—a
sort of refined version of the earlier texts—and an autobiography, against the evil tide.



here are some more prime pages from these texts. as i said,
this is some of the most vile and hate-filled white supremacist propaganda
you’ll find anywhere. the david dukes and richard spencers are sagacious
compared to klassen. klassen’s one major contribution to white supremacism was
coining the war cry “rahowa!”, which is a shortened version of his core credo,
“racial holy war.”














the church of the creator didn’t attract a large following,
but those who did join were fairly predictable as far as white-supremacist groups
go: vicious, violent, thuggish, and not terribly bright. if anything, they
seemed to attract a particularly cretinous stripe of hater, many of them
criminals. over the years they collected
a very extensive track record.





george loeb

one particular case brought real strife to klassen: the 1991
shooting of a black man in florida named harold mansfield by a church of the
creator acolyte named george loeb. the victim’s family took klassen to
court. 



fearing the lawsuit might result in him having to hand over
his church and property to a black family, klassen in 1992 sold it at a steep
discount to william pierce, leader of the infamous national alliance hate group
and author of the turner diaries.

klassen by now was rather elderly, and there was already a scramble within the
cotc membership for church leadership after his departure from the role of
pontifex maximus. in 1990, klassen had announced he would turn the job over to one
rev. rudy stanko.



based in billings, montana, stanko was a “deacon” in cotc. he was a former
cattleman who had been sent to prison for selling tainted meat to montana
schoolchildren. it was during that prison stint that he was converted to the
faith, such as it was. upon his release, stanko returned to billings in the
late ‘80s and began proselytizing on behalf of the cotc and formed a relatively
active “church” there. he also penned a book titled the score, an anti-semitic screed that blamed jews for his
imprisonment.





klassen adopted stanko’s cause and promoted his work at the
creativity newsletter. eventually, this led to klassen anointing him his
successor. stanko, however, let his imminent maximushood go to his head. before
the change had been made official, he began announcing his plans to move the
church headquarters out to montana. this did not sit well with klassen, who
wanted to keep the church in the south.



klassen's creativity church in south carolina





so klassen cancelled stanko’s ceremonial anointment
announced that he was changing the successorship, handing the title of next
pontifex maximus to a pizza delivery man from baltimore named charles altvater,
who was later arrested for attempting to firebomb a cop’s car.



klassen by then had already changed his mind again, and
instead named a milwaukee man named mark wilson as the successor. that lasted a
few months before finally settling on a man named rick mccarty. upon being
named leader, he moved cotc back to florida.



church members were continuing to commit violent hate
crimes, in ways indicating its spread nationally. in the pacific northwest, a
couple of young cotc members bombed
naacp offices in tacoma and a seattle gay bar in july 1993. two more cotc
members, geremy von rineman and his girlfriend jill scarborough, were part of a
group of neo-nazis charged
in los angeles with plotting to bomb the city’s largest black church, also
in july 1993.





apparently depressed by his wife’s recent death from cancer,
and the looming likelihood that his church was about to be sued out of
existence by the splc, working with the victims of cotc hate crimes, klassen
committed suicide on aug. 7, 1993, with sleeping pills.



his worst fears shortly came true. representing the family
of harold mansfield, george loeb’s victim, the splc took rick mccarty and cotc
to court in 1994 and won handily, with mccarty not contesting. it won a $1
million judgment and seized all of its assets.





seizing the opportunity, a 20-year-old white supremacist
from peoria, ill., named matthew hale announced he was dissolving the
organization he headed, the national socialist white americans party, and
reforming it as a religion: the world church of the creator. the remaining
creativity true believers all quickly lined up behind him. this included rudy
stanko, who still had a fairly active creativity church group spread throughout
montana. he also had come into possession of most of the stock of klassen’s
library of books.



this is when i became more intimately familiar with the
“creativity” religion, due mainly to the recurring criminality emanating from
its ranks in the pacific northwest, and in montana particularly. at the time, i
was reporting on the activities of the militia of montana and the montana
freemen (i met my wife while working in missoula and still have family
scattered around the state). stanko’s little congregation of haters, true to
form, had been committing hate crimes in the billings area: defacing a native
american home, entering a black church during worship and threatening
congregants, knocking over markers in a jewish cemetery.





things came to a head around the holidays in 1993, when
someone threw a rock through the window of a 6-year-old billings boy who had
placed a menorah in his window. the faith community, outraged, organized a
public response in which everyone in town put menorahs up. the response led to
a pbs documentary titled not in our town,
the making of which itself led to the formation of a national organization with that name,
devoted to enabling communities to stand up to hate groups and their toxic
effects. they do great work to this day.



stanko’s group became more muted in their activities, though
they were known for going around and leaving copies of klassen’s vile books on
people’s doorsteps, apparently as a kind of proselytizing. the montana human
rights network collected most of these.



even though his operations were based in illinois, the wcotc
held its annual national convention in the western montana town of superior
every year, likely due to the prevalence of montanans in the church’s
membership. matt hale appeared to enjoy the annual trips.





back in illinois, hale had gone to law school at southern
illinois and obtained a degree and passed the bar, intent on using it on behalf
of his ‘religion.’ however, the illinois bar had other ideas: a special panel
refused to admit him, denying him a license. so
he sued.



hale’s case attracted media attention. he began hiring
lawyers to assist him in his legal battle – notably, he seemed to have a thing
about hiring _jewish_ lawyers specifically. the first attorney he hired was none
other than alan dershowitz. however, hale soon discovered that dershowitz’s
fees were extraordinarily high, so he dropped him and turned to the services of
another
jewish attorney, robert herman of the st. louis firm schwartz, herman and
davidson.



eventually he hired a young hotshot jewish lawyer from new
york to spearhead his legal challenge. hale liked to trot this young man out
for the press as proof (for dumb reporters who hadn’t bothered to crack open a
klassen text) he didn’t hate jews. his name was glenn greenwald.



yes, that glenn
greenwald. as most of us know now, greenwald has a long track record of
defending the civil liberties of even the most questionable of cases, and they
frankly didn’t come much more questionable than matt hale. in any event, this
case launched his legal career, and probably ended it too. greenwald never
practiced law afterwards.



from a purely abstract and legalistic standpoint, it’s
possible to make a case, as greenwald has, for a jewish attorney to defend the
civil rights of a militaristic anti-semite and neo-nazi. and from the first
news story i read about his involvement, i understood this. the ethical case,
however, is not so clear. after all, hale’s group was primarily engaged in the
business of depriving minorities—particularly blacks and jews—of their civil
rights through hate crimes, threats, and intimidation. they saw spreading such
hate as one of their own rights.








so, from where i sat in montana, spending time with the
frightened victims of wcotc thugs, someone who was defending their ability to
use the levers of the legal system essentially was enabling their “right” to
deprive other people, vulnerable people, of theirs. more to the point, in a
world in which there are myriad opportunities to defend genuinely needy,
innocent people being wrongly deprived of their civil and free-speech rights, i
struggled to understand why any humane and capable attorney would devote their
efforts to defending neo-nazis’ rights.



the most disturbing aspect of greenwald’s advocacy on hale’s
behalf, however, involved the viciousness with which he attacked hale’s
critics, as well as the strange and frankly dishonest twists of logic and
rhetoric he deployed. it went well beyond the usual legal advocacy, as we’ll
see.



hale’s legal case wound through the state bar’s appeals
process. he had two more hearings before the bar. on june 30, the second and
final appeal was rejected. hale had also looked into getting a license through
the montana bar but couldn’t. he
was out of luck.





benjamin smith

two days later, july 2, his longtime second-in-command—a hotheaded
young man named benjamin smith, 21, whom hale had recently named “creator of
the month”—went on a killing rampage targeting minorities wherever he could
find them. 





he first took drive-by shots at orthodox jews in chicago’s
west rogers park neighborhood, wounding nine. next he drove to skokie, where he
encountered a black man walking with two of his children outside his home. the
man, as it happened, was former northwestern university basketball coach ricky
birdsong. smith shot and killed him in front of his children. 



smith drove away from skokie and headed to northbrook, where
he shot at an asian-american couple but missed. on july 3, he drove through
urbana, springfield, and decatur, shooting and wounding two more black men and
an asian man. in bloomington, ind., he murdered won-joon yoon, a 26-year-old
korean indian university student as he walked into his church. smith also shot
at but missed about nine other people. police soon tracked him down back in
illinois on july 4. after a high-speed chase, he shot himself in the head and
crashed his car into a metal pole. still alive, he shot himself once more in
the chest, finishing the job.





in evanston that week, a public memorial provided an
opportunity for all of the victims of smith’s rampage to mourn. there is an annual
race held to this day in evanston in ricky byrdsong’s memory.



a few months later, the center for constitutional rights led
a lawsuit filed on behalf of the victims against matt hale and wcotc. here are
excerpts from the original story published in the april 6, 2000, edition of
american lawyer:





elevating the profile of last
july's racially-motivated shooting spree to still a higher level, the new
york-based center for constitutional rights has filed suit against the white
supremacist group it claims is responsible for the two-state tear that left two
dead and nine wounded.



in a federal lawsuit filed here
tuesday, lawyers for a decatur pastor wounded during the spree allege world
church of the creator leader matthew f. hale not only encouraged, but conspired
with shooter benjamin nathaniel smith to "commit wholesale acts of
genocidal violence in furtherance of their self-proclaimed 'racial holy war'
against any and all african-americans, jews, asians and other ethnic
groups."



…



this is the second such suit filed
against hale, an illinois bar applicant who has been denied a law license on
moral fitness grounds.



indeed the center's suit appears to
link hale's rejection into the bar to smith's "rampage." in late
june, the state bar's committee on character and fitness again denied hale's
petition to join the bar. smith, who had testified as a character witness for
hale that april, began shooting two days later. "immediately after the
illinois state bar's decision and as part of the world church of the creator's
war, smith ... began a rampage of genocidal violence," the lawsuit states.



and while hale himself has linked
the shootings to his bar application in the past, he said tuesday that it's
ridiculous to think he had any control over smith.



"certainly i had a lot of
contact with ben smith, i never denied that for one minute," hale said.
"if every lawyer who knows someone who commits a crime is a conspirator,
the legal profession would cease to exist."



hale's lawyer, new york attorney
glenn greenwald, took a similar tact in responding to the suit.



"it's all just guilt by
association," said greenwald, who isn't sure yet whether he will be
representing hale on this latest federal action.



he did, however, seem interested in
taking the case on. he compared it to the first suit, which alleged hale
ordered smith to target minorities.



"all they can say matt hale
did is express the view that jews and blacks are inferior,” he said.
"there's just no question that expressing those views is a core first
amendment activity."



further, greenwald said, "i
find that the people behind these lawsuits are truly so odious and repugnant,
that creates its own motivation for me."



take note of greenwald’s comments. it’s common to see some
hyperbole on a defendant’s behalf in such cases. what’s not common is talk like
this: "i find that the people behind these lawsuits are truly so odious
and repugnant, that creates its own motivation for me." (also, note how
greenwald bandies the phrase “guilt by association” to describe matt hale’s
culpability in the rampage. many of glenn’s critics would become accustomed to
hearing the same phrase, abused in exactly the same fashion, in the years
ahead.)





he was also interviewed for an august 2000 los angeles times piece describing
how civil-rights groups were using civil courts to bankrupt hate groups.
greenwald was quoted thus:



"nobody has found a shred of
evidence that matt hale even knew about the crimes, let alone participated in
them," said his lawyer, glenn greenwald. civil rights groups "have
said their intent . . . is to bankrupt these hate groups by forcing them to put
their resources into litigation so they don't have any money for anything else,
which i think . . . is an abuse of the court system."



"by suing us, they demonstrate
the correctness of our cause," hale added. "they're demonstrating how
desperate they are to stop us."



yes, for some reason, survivors of a shooting and families
of the victims do, indeed, become desperate to stop neo-nazis replicating their
murderous rampages.



moreover, there are a number of noteworthy issues here
regarding greenwald’s truthfulness. first, in fact, it shortly emerged that not
only had hale just given smith his group’s top award, he
had spent 16 hours on the phone with smith in the two weeks before the
rampage.

even more significant is greenwald’s view that the standard tactics used by the
splc and other civil-rights groups to bankrupt hate groups that actively
deprive minorities of their civil rights (both via advocacy and action) via the
civil process is “an abuse of the courts.”



in his subsequent attempts to help hale get his law license,
greenwald’s rhetoric was similarly over the top, as in this
lawsuit before the illinois supreme court in 2001 (which, unsurprisingly,
failed badly):



the denial of matthew hale's
application to practice law in the state of illinois embodies the most
egregious -- and most dangerous -- constitutional abuses which have, again and
again, been resoundingly declared by courts in this nation to be patently
unlawful. in sum, hale, a well-known and vigorous advocate of racist and
anti-semitic ideas, was barred from the legal profession and denied his
livelihood because the individuals sitting on the committee of character and
fitness for the state of illinois happened to disagree -- strongly -- with
hale's political and religious views. to describe the denial of hale's
application to practice law, then, is to illustrate the profound dangers it
poses to the most basic and valued liberties guaranteed to all citizens by the
united states constitution.





eventually, greenwald ran afoul of the courts on ethical
grounds, when he
recorded interviews with witnesses in the lawsuit brought by one of ben
smith’s victims without their knowledge or permission. the magistrate judge
granted both motions, finding defense counsel's conduct unethical under two
separate rules: local rule 83.58.4(a)(4), prohibiting ‘dishonesty, fraud,
deceit or misrepresentation;’ and local rule 83.54.4, stating ‘a lawyer shall
not ... use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of
[another] person.’”



hale explicitly depicted smith’s “free speech martyrdom” as
a good thing. indeed, here’s how matt hale was quoted in a july 2000 peoria
journal star article examining the effects of smith’s murder spree, headlined
“hate changing us in good, bad ways.”



the past year has been a roller
coaster ride for matt hale. 



hale, 28, has found himself known
worldwide. his organization, the world church of the creator, couldn't have
asked for better publicity than what it got after smith's shooting spree, which
ended in smith's suicide. 



"it's what ben would have
wanted," hale said from his east peoria home, which also doubles as his
group's headquarters. 



while refusing to disclose numbers,
hale said the world church has grown greatly, and he credits the media with
spreading the word. 



an oak park-based watchdog group,
the center for new community, issued a report last week saying the group has
gained about 100 members since last year. still, that puts the world church at
only about 300 members - far less than the numbers hinted at by hale. 



hale failed in his attempts to get
a law license - a matter he says probably played a role in one-time morton
resident smith's decision to begin his killing spree. 



for hale, the immediate legacy is
that he, an unlicensed attorney, finds himself the defendant of several
lawsuits brought by the victims' families. a little-known group in oregon even
filed suit against hale and his world church, alleging hale's group stole their
name and tarnished it. 



all the work and talk by religious
groups, hale says, hasn't done anything to change the climate of tolerance in
peoria. 

"i think these so-called plans
and programs are a joke," he said. "when people say we are combating
racism, that's a crock - everywhere i go, i see racism." 



any discussion of race or hatred
must involve him, hale maintains, since his religion is based upon the notion
that whites are superior to all other races or religions. 



"until they invite me to the
table, we have a monologue, not a dialogue," he states flatly.





judge joan h. lefkow

as the story notes, an oregon church called te-te-ma truth
foundation, based in ashland, which had some years before copyrighted the named
church of the creator for their multiple congregations, sued
hale’s organization in federal court for trademark violation. hale
initially won that lawsuit: district judge joan h. lefkow dismissed the
trademark case in 2002. however, an appeals court reversed her decision,
forcing her to order hale to remove the world church’s name from its websites
and literature.


judge lefkow then became the early victim of what we now think of as a “troll
storm,” but in this event by rabid neo-nazis around the country. white
supremacist radio host hal turner said she was “worthy of being killed” … “it
wouldn't be legal, but in my opinion it wouldn't be wrong." photos of her
home were posted on the web.



the whole enterprise blew up for good on january 8, 2003,
when matt hale was arrested for conspiring to murder judge lefkow. an informant
had assembled a collection of video and audio evidence showing him doing
exactly that. he was convicted
in april 2004.



while hale was awaiting sentencing, on feb. 28, 2005, a man
entered judge lefkow’s home and murdered her mother and her husband. initially
assumed to be related to the hale case, it turned out to be a
man angry over another case.



hale’s allies
on the web and elsewhere celebrated. “i can barely contain my glee,” one of
them wrote.



matthew hale was handed a
40-year prison sentence a few weeks later. the judge called it an “extreme,
egregious attack on the rule of law.” hale called it “a horrible miscarriage of
justice.” greenwald concurred, telling the
new york times that hale had been “wrongly imprisoned.” the interview
occurred when it emerged that hale had attempted to send a coded message of
some kind through greenwald via his mother. he denied he had delivered it.



the church of the creator promptly fell
into complete disarray. in montana, one key member who happened to have
possession of the stock of klassen books that rudy stanko had originally
obtained decided to defect. he
sold them all, $41,000 worth, to the montana human rights network for $300.
as often happens with such orgs when they begin to decay, the wcotc continued
to rack
up an impressive and disturbing record of hate-fueled violence.



now, as someone who tracked the wcotc carefully due to their
presence in the northwest, i was familiar with most of this information at the
time. as i said, though i understood and, on general principle, respected
greenwald’s reasons for taking on hale, i had questions about how he went about
it.





so i was surprised in a good way by much of what i began
reading at greenwald’s blog, unclaimed territory, in fall of 2005. it was
smart, thoughtful, and quite insightful about what he rightly saw as an
executive power grab in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy. i began citing it
favorably at my own blog, orcinus,
which at that point was also pretty well established (i opened shop there in
january 2003). one of the first times i did so, in fact, was to defend
him for having taken on hale as a client, with which critics tried to smear
him.



there were stumbles—such as his now-infamous
(and disavowed) post describing the “parade of evils caused by illegal
immigration”—that harkened back to my earlier concerns about his work. the
disavowal, written years later and defensively blaming “obama cultists,” is
also less than persuasive.



i also was an admirer of greenwald’s terrific 2006 book how would a patriot act? defending american
values from a president run amok. having just wrapped up my
study of the japanese american internment, i wrote a number of posts
concurring with its thesis. 



i finally met glenn in person at the 2007 yearly kos
gathering in chicago, the year before it was renamed to netroots nation. we
really only had a brief conversation, and so even though i was bursting with
questions for him, i never got to ask them.



questions like: 





·     
do you have any regrets about everything that
went down around having matthew hale as a client?

·     
did it ever bother you that the organization
whose rights (not altogether clear in any event, since you lost all the rulings
on his law license denial) you were expending your expertise defending was
itself in the business of depriving vulnerable minorities of their civil
rights?

·     
did it ever bother you that by trying to make it
possible for hale to practice law, you were actively assisting wcotc’s explicit
efforts to become part of the mainstream – that is, normalizing them?

·     
do you still believe using the civil courts to
bankrupt hate groups for their followers’ criminal acts, as the splc, center for
new community, center for constitutional rights, and many others do, is an
abuse of the system?













i continued to cite greenwald’s work quite bit over the
years anyway. but beginning in the fall of 2007, as he increasingly promoted
the presidential candidacy of rep. ron paul, i
chimed in by pointing out paul’s long record of dalliances with the far
right. my then-blog partner sara robinson and i began publishing a series of
posts about ron paul and this history. it culminated with a
post i composed with the help of readers, detailing the long legislative
record of paul’s extremism in congress—some 161 bills, all linked.



a couple of days later, greenwald attacked me at salon. it
opens: “i’m not trying to be ron paul’s advocate, but still, outright
distortions and smears are distortions and smears.”



i responded the next
day, pointing out that those “distortions and smears” were comprised of a
laundry list of legislation with links. also known as cold dry facts.



now, someone correct me if i'm
wrong, but my understanding is that a smear by definition is false. and i'm
having difficulty fathoming how a post comprised almost solely of links to
legislation paul has sponsored -- 161 of them, in fact -- could constitute a
smear. in the world of the blogosphere, the posts don't get much more
fact-oriented.



in one of his updates, greenwald countered with his favorite
phrase.



for reasons i’ll detail at another
time [ed note: he never did], i found virtually all of that to be unpersuasive,
relying almost entirely on lame guilt-by-association
arguments that could sink most if not all candidates (the only arguably
disturbing evidence in this regard is this 1996 houston chronicle article,
which neiwert didn’t mention [ed. note: actually, i did] and the pro-paul
response is here).



as i pointed out, that’s not how “guilt by association”
works, no more than you can dismiss matt hale’s ties to ben smith’s rampage
with by waving that phrase about.



the problem with ron paul isn't
that he has irrelevant associations with far-right extremists—it’s that he
seeks out their support, openly advocates their agenda, and receives financial
and ideological support from them. … those grim realities make his associations
all too relevant, especially for a public official in the position of a serving
congressman, and now, presidential candidate.



… [t]his isn't "guilt by
association"—first, the argument isn't that paul is a racist per se, but
that he is an extremist who shares a belief system held not just by racists but
other anti-government zealots as well. paul is identified with their causes not
simply because he speaks to them, but because he elucidates ideas and
positions—especially regarding the irs, the un, the gold standard, and
education—identical to theirs. this is why he has their rabid support. there is
an underlying reason, after all, that paul attracts backers like david duke and
the stormfront gang: he talks like them.



second and perhaps most
importantly, there are legitimate reasons for anyone to raise objections to
paul's associations, speaking before the patriot network, the cofcc, and
similar groups—he's a public official, and he is lending the power of his
public office to legitimizing radical-right organizations like this. think of
why it would be wrong to appear before the klan, or the cofcc, as trent lott
and hayley barbour have done in the latter case. 



it's not merely what it implies
about your own beliefs and standards—it’s that you've lent the power of your
public office to empowering and raising the stature of racists and extremists.
you of course have the right to do so—but the public has every right to
criticize you for it as well, as it should. after all, what this comes down to
is not so much beliefs and values but judgment. one expects, after all, a
congressman to display better judgment than to appear before a group of
nutcases. ron paul didn't, and hasn't, for a simple reason—he’s one of them.



and just as his associations with
far-right extremists have empowered those groups—a favor now being returned in
the form of their avid support for him even as he attempts to strategically
distance himself from them—his recent stunning successes mean the further
empowerment of these groups. and that is why, over the long term, we ought to
take much greater pause in considering the value of his success.



before signing off, i offered one
more missive, which glenn sniffed at and dismissed.



at this point, it had become manifestly clear to me that
greenwald has an immense blind spot—an inexplicable one, really—when it comes
to far-right extremism and its spread into the mainstream, and the toxic
effects of that spread. 



this isn’t a matter of whether greenwald is a racist or an
extremist or an anti-semite or anything like that. i don’t believe he is, even
remotely. i’m glad i defended him initially. and no doubt, glenn will dismiss
this entire piece as a lie and a smear in which i make him out to be a racist.
but seriously, i don’t believe for a minute that he is.



i just believe his sort of principled rigidity on
free-speech issues blinds him to the real-world effects of fascism—particularly
how it manipulates free-speech principles in order to destroy them. fascists
use people like greenwald to leave a trail of wreckage.



it’s not about whether or not he’s racist—which, after all,
would indeed make the whole issue one of guilt by association. that’s not the
point of all this. no, this is a question of judgment: if you’re so
short-sighted that you can’t see how your ethical choices wind up enabling
harmful behavior, then exactly how astute is your judgment in any event?







it’s not guilt by association, it’s the guilt of association: people in responsible
mainstream positions who lend legitimacy to people from far-right hate
groups—whether klansmen, skinheads, neo-nazis, or militiamen—are exercising
profoundly poor judgment. lending them that legitimacy not only normalizes
them, it empowers them. it helps fuel the twisted psychology of the far right
that inevitably, like a law of physics itself, produces violent horrors and
ruptured communities. ask the folks in billings, or in illinois.



the closest anyone has come to getting an answer out of
greenwald about the questions about judgment raised by his work on matt hale’s
behalf was in an
interview in rolling stone in 2013. his answer was typically self-serving,
and certainly indicates a lack of any regret: “to me, it's a heroic attribute
to be so committed to a principle that you apply it not when it's easy ... not
when it supports your position, not when it protects people you like, but when
it defends and protects people that you hate."



all very noble-sounding of course, but it hardly squares
with the reality of how he conducted himself. there is no indication glenn
hated hale or wctoc in any of his dealings with them; indeed, you can easily
find expressions of admiration both in his public remarks and his legal filings.
but his expressions of hatred for center for constitutional rights and splc
were vivid, not to mention anyone who dared oppose his cause. equally vivid
were his dismissal of the families of ben smith’s victims for being “desperate
to stop us”—and assertion that their desperation proved the “correctness of our
cause.” 



over the ensuing years, he’s manifested this blind spot, and
supremely bad judgment, many times. once he posted
a tweet promoting an ad by the far-right conspiracist outfit the oath
keepers, soft-pedaling them as “a coalition of former police, military and
public officials.”



more recently, of course, he has appeared frequently on fox
news with tucker carlson. carlson’s record of
promoting white-nationalist causes and ideas clearly doesn’t bother
greenwald. in
the process, of course, he has become exactly what he once derided
caustically: a “fox news liberal,” one whose appearance on the network is
mainly used to help forward right-wing talking points and destroy the left.
he’s now a useful tool.



and now he is defending his fellow faux progressives as they
join carlson in his campaign to minimize and defend fascist white nationalism
as not really a problem.



but apparently, fascist authoritarianism is only a problem
in brazil. because glenn lives there and he is seeing the consequences in
person. perhaps greenwald should try living in the states again, so he can
experience firsthand that the
consequences are here too. it’s not clear what alternative universe michael
tracey is living in, however.
