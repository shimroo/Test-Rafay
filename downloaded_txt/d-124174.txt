chloe serranoclass of 2024
“i came to fullerton college for an education but left with a second home. fullerton college’s faculty and staff authentically and holistically care about their students in and out of the classroom.
the ethnic studies department was transformational to my life and supported me in my journey of living unapologetically. associated students gave me the platform to advocate for students and create campus change.
i am immensely grateful for my time at fullerton college and the life long community i have built. it was at fullerton college that made me realize my potential is limitless.”
