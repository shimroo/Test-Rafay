malta holiday homes & villas
planning a group getaway and craving privacy with a serene, relaxing holiday in malta? consider renting one of the listed holiday villas in malta with a private pool. choose from a diverse selection of villas and character houses in popular seaside villages like st. julians, mellieha, and marsascala. prefer a more rural escape? explore options in rabat, zurrieq, and zejtun. these villas, bungalows, and farmhouses can accommodate groups ranging from 2 to 20 guests. when booking, ensure you enter the correct occupancy, as some villas charge per villa while others charge per person.
for smaller groups, holiday homes in malta are an excellent choice. you'll find a variety of apartments, studios, and penthouses in valletta, st. julians, paceville, sliema, mellieha, st. paul's bay, bugibba, qawra, and other charming villages across the maltese islands.
remember, malta is a small island, so everything is conveniently close!

gozo farmhouses & holiday apartments
consider splitting your holiday between malta & gozo ! a visit to malta wouldn't be complete with a short visit to the neighbouring and relaxed island of gozo. this is where you will get the authentic meditteranean feel to your holiday. if you are after somewhere which is quiet and laid back, where you can spend lazy days and chilled evenings in an island with a slow pace of life then a trip to gozo is a must on everyone's calendar intending to spend a holiday in malta.
gozo offers the typical meditteranean lifestyle, it is smaller, quieter and greener than malta and over the years the island has become a popolar choice for familiy holidays, many of which return year after year. this is a great place to spend your vacation and enjoy barbeques by the pool, country walks, secluded beaches, kayaking, hiking, cycling, diving, snorkelling and a slow pace of life in an idyllic meditteranean setting.
plan ahead and book early, choose from a wide range of traditional farmhouses & villas in gozo and holiday apartments in seaside villages of marsalforn, xaghra, qala and more. 

hotels in malta & the best places to stay
if you want your breakfast ready, your bed done, your towel changed, have that concierge on call and you want to be pampered, then you have no other choice but to choose a hotel in malta. malta has a wide choice of hotels that cater for all budgets, from leading 5 star hotel chains and boutique hotels to the cheaper 3 star hotels or bnb options. if you are after a cultural holiday, choose a boutique hotel in valletta or the three cities, whether you enjoy visiting museums, churches, palazzos, bastions, art galleries, restaurants, wine bars, outdoor cafes or piazzas, be sure that valletta and the three cities have it all. valletta is also the main hub for public transport so getting around the island from here is relatively easy. if you're more into the sun and sandy beaches then you should be looking north towards mellieha, qawra, bugibba and st paul's bay, whilst if you want to be in the financial and entertainment disctrict with a huge selection of bars, pubs, clubs, marinas, casinos and a lovely promenade, then the best place to stay in a hotel would be in st julians, sliema or paceville. alternatively, if you want to exerience the typical fishing villages of the south then look into marsaxlokk and marsascala.

malta car rentals
is it absolutely neccessary to rent a car when on holiday in malta ? probably not, since the island is relatively small and ride hailing cabs, public transport and sea transport are plenty, however havng your own car makes it easier to explore the islands and get the most out of your visit to malta. through our global partner you may also book car rentals with the malta international airport as a pick up and drop off point.
with prices starting at only eur 20 per day and in most cases free cancellations, you have a massive choice at low rates from leading global car rental suppliers like avis, hertz, first, thrifty, goldcar, europecar, carwiz, sicilybycar, green motion and many more.
book your malta car rental early for the best prices !

malta & gozo beaches
distance is not much of an issue, malta & gozo are small islands and getting to the beach or sea side is usually only a short distance away, wherever you are staying. of course the best option would be to rent a car as it gives you the flexibility to explore the island's beaches, coves, inlets, historical locations, churches, shopping malls, band clubs, festas, etc which are dotted around the island. alternatively one may opt to use the public bus service or sea transport with several new routes, reaching every corner of the island.
surrounded by lovely blue mediterranean sea, the maltese islands, (malta, gozo and comino) are rich in culture and history and ranked as one of the safest holiday destinations worldwide, which has earned this little archipelago and its people an excellent reputation in the travel and hospitality industry.
however its not only about safety,  its about the overall good feeling factor malta has to offer and the mediterranean lifestyle enjoyed by its people. there are numerous articles about the benefits of the mediterranean lifestyle, where everyone seems to agree that the food, the excellent climate and overall lifestyle of mediterranean countries contributes largely to good health and happiness.
the maltese islands are no exception, enjoying short mild winters and long warm summers, blessed with blue skies and sunshine for most of the year, which probably makes the maltese the envy of their european neighbours further up north. this is probably the reason why more than three million tourists visit malta or gozo for their holidays every year.
