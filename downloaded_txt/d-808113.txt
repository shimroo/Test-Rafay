 “…. his artistry… is nothing short of amazing. dazzling picking, expressive voice, unique and interesting songs. he is a showman in the best sense of the word and just wowed our audience.  i think they would have followed him anywhere.”
— rich warren, formerly of wfmt “midnight special”, chicago, il







“if there is anyone not familiar with jack’s incredible songwriting and prodigious performance skills, my sympathies to you. a jack williams show is a slam-dunk win-win-win for all. one of the most enlightened and entertaining performers i’ve ever encountered.”
— dave humpreys, two way street coffeehouse in downers grove, il
