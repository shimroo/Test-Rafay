crack in your asphalt 


featured 

repairing a crack in your asphalt parking lot
asphalt cracks do happen, and the best preventative medicine is continued maintenance.  as with anything, having knowledge about a specific subject helps you to make the best decisions when it comes time for maintenance and care.   as always i turned to the experts of asphalt paving and repair to help get some great content for this article.
over time, there isn’t much you can do to avoid cracks in your asphalt parking lot, driveway or roadway. even with a good asphalt paving job, professionally done with the best materials, it begins aging the minute it cools down. the oil that binds it together weakens, and the movement of the ground, in combination with the effects of moisture and the sun, cause it to deteriorate. once a crack appears, moisture reaches below the pavement’s surface and softens it, or in cold climates freezes it, causing it to expand. the pavement around the crack then starts to deteriorate, which makes the problem worse. for this reason, it’s best to tackle the issue before it gets out of control.

wheel stops installation project
it is pretty funny that the last post i did was all about parking lot striping, and today i am writing about parking lots again.  one of my clients asked if i could install wheel stops and speed bumps in their parking lot up in the dallas area.  not knowing much about either of these, i reached out for help to parking lot striping plano to get some much-needed assistance.   john, was a great help when it came to all things related to wheel stops and speed bumps and i found it much easier just to subcontract this work out to him instead of making the trek up to dallas to do it myself.

not all jobs are right for a handyman 


featured 

this job was not right for me
there are times when as a handyman, you are approached with a job that is simply not the right fit for your equipment or expertise.   i was recently approached by a client that owns a business that is in need of having the parking lot restriped.  although i did appreciate the offer for the job, and also the confidence in me to do a great job, i did have to turn down the job.   i do not have the proper equipment to do the job correctly, and i would not allow myself to do a bad job for a client.   i didn’t fully turn this job down, instead, i referred it to my good friend ronnie, who does parking lot striping in houston, tx area.
i have known ronnie for years and i know for sure he is an expert in his profession.   not only does he have the proper equipment, crew, and knowledge, but he also was willing to take on the job.  he even agreed to allow me to assist on this specific job so i can learn the process.  having experience still does not fix the issue of me not having the proper equipment, but i will worry about that if ever approached again about a parking lot striping job.

popcorn ceiling removal 


december 17, 2016january 19, 2017 

how to remove popcorn ceiling texture
popcorn ceilings are a kind of ceiling that were quite popularly used in construction in the 50’s through to the 70’s. they are also commonly referred to as cottage cheese ceilings or acoustic ceilings. popcorn ceilings were applied either by spray painting or painting on, and were popular due to their ability to hide imperfections, as well as their bright white appearance.
as time has passed and building technology has evolved, popcorn ceilings have quickly gone out of style, and are often thought to make a space seem a lot older than it actually is. popcorn ceilings are also notorious for making rooms look darker due to the multiple shadows created by the popcorn effect. as a result, many people are now opting to get rid of their popcorn ceilings in favor of more visually appealing styles.
