              		do you know where your porsche was built?
you may have seen reports in the news that porsche is investigating the possibility of building cars in the united states due to possible tariffs. while there has not been confirmation from the manufacturer whether this is true or not, it is worth revisiting where porsches have been assembled in the past and currently.

              		my porsche experience at the autobahn country club
i was invited to a porsche experience last september, by porsche fort wayne. the event took place at the autobahn country club in joliet, illinois. this is a great way to experience new porsche models, and i was grateful for the opportunity. the invitation stated that we had to wear closed-toed shoes, so i assumed we would be driving on track.

mart fresh is a bi-weekly column in which we pick what we think are the "freshest" porsches currently available, and then attempt to explain our reasoning. up this week are a 19587 356 speedster, 1976 912e, 1980 924, and 2007 911 gt3.
