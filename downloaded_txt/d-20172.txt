doc hemp and becky hemp's blog






  
		welcome todoc and becky hemp's blog site!
		



		 this is no longer my dental site, even though it was never an advertisement for new patients and i didn't ever give any contact info, 
		 the new ca law requires too much private info, photos, etc on employees   so ... it is now a blog on many subjects and not a dental website! 
		 pictured below is our waiting room 
		 









 







 conservative dentistry means looking for reasons not to drill! what god gave us is much better than the best of us can do! 



 	"if you don't care that much about your own teeth"
 	"you need to find a dentist that thinks as little of them as you do!"

  i hope to never retire! my heros are  dr. bob .. robert 
  horseman dds .. he was a fighter pilot in wwii, humor columnist for the ca dental journal at 90 years old now, 
   and has finally retired this past jan 2010 from dentistry  .. my goal was to work one day longer than he did .. 
   but he set  the bar way too high..geeze! plus i am very lucky to have made it this long .... years of racing motorcycles, cars,
   etc.  plus ... (11 yrs so far after lg. melanoma sx)
    
   another of my heros is sol (bud) silverman .... prolly the best oral pathologist to ever walk the planet! ... udate 8/19/2013 ... he is still working 
   2 days a week at ucsf teaching and diagnosing the most difficult cases,  auto immune, etc. at 87 years old! .... as per ole doc carpenter his 
   cohort he is still playing his full court basketball every tuesday morning before he starts his day!  i have sent countless cases down to ucsf for
   him and his department to diagnose.

 for your edification, what may appear in many of my extant comments  to be just a patois of misspelled words and poor punctuation is actually 
	a very distinctive and cerebral exercise,  searching for just the right combination of words to reach all levels of those trying to reach a deeper 
	understanding!  .... for the timorous, i would be reticent to not say that this multifarious, ubiquitous, eclectic style is still tasteful and erudite though not
	 quixotic and didactic.
because of this i do not wish to be classified as passe, truculent, hackneyed, somnolent, loquacious or taken sycophantically! there might be some
 verbosity & prolixity - but ...... hey! most of my thoughts are mesmeric, pragmatic & blithe yet still filled with lores & 100% probity to placate, 
 yet not abrogate, to the incurable dogmatic, parsimonious, anal retentive! this is certainly not meant as a pejorative to be opprobrious, vituperative
  or to be contumelious to any race, color, creed, religion or nation!
i just hope this aphorism has not been too plethoric for some. i also hope obfuscation due to misinterpretation will not lead to pusillanimous attempts
 at a malicious retort to my comments!
