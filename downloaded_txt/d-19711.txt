practice information
independent hawerageneral practitioner
the advent of phos (primary health organisations) has changed the face of general practice, but it's emphasis on "populations" over individuals (see population vs individual practice) and the imposition of management into the doctor-patient relationship has been unacceptable to this practice, and many others who simply left. we elected to remain an independent private service which proved to be unprofitable.  patients can expect care directed to their particular health needs with advice and management based on what the evidence shows is best for them, although not necessarily the cheapest nor the most politically correct. however they must expect to pay for this service themselves although there are some funding supports available.




 

our general practice deals with virtually every branch of medicine:
surgery, ent, obstetrics (no funded lmc services after 2018), gynaecology, internal medicine, pharmacology, geriatrics, dermatology, psychiatry, paediatrics, neurology and emergency medicine (serious emergencies are best managed at the emergency department = ed).
