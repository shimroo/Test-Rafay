 "coming to the tdwi conference has allowed me to find new opportunities with companies that i have been trying to talk to for months, as well as connect with vendors that i never thought there was a potential for partnership. i am thoroughly impressed with the attendees at tdwi events. i have done other conferences where you get low level audiences that just want the swag bag. at tdwi, i made amazing contacts.”
