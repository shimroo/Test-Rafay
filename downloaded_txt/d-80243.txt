patient testimonials

i gave birth in the labor and delivery unit 2 weeks ago and can’t say enough good things. i was treated so well, and had a one to one nurse almost the entire time i was there. the nurses were incredibly helpful, and nurse kerri helped me so much during the most difficult parts of my labor. we were able to stay in the same room the entire 5 days we were there. i would literally give birth again tomorrow because of how positive of an experience i had. thank you to everyone who helped me!liz macnaughton  my husband was seen at landmark er for a-fib because of covid. the staff were spot on with care. brittany was the rn and dr. mohammed are top notch. great work!!! highly recommended.joyce cureton  my mother has many health issues and the er staff at woonsocket landmark has saved her life multiple times. the care she’s given when admitted is also very good.the medical staff do their best under difficult working conditions.people need to be more appreciative and give the doctors, nurses, and support staff appropriate credit for the work they do.joe hoyt
