grgid is responsible for the operations and maintenance of its water system, sewer system, streets, storm drain system, streetlights, maintenance of open spaces and parks and recreation. because of grgid's size and accessibility to its residents, many inquiries are fielded that are not within grgid's control. in these cases the district will assist the resident in filing an inquiry with douglas county. grgid is asked to review all proposed housing and commercial projects that desire to locate within the district's service area. the district's recommendations are then forwarded to douglas county community development for review and then forwarded to the douglas county commission.
