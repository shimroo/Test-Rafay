the basic objectives of the international institute of informatics and systemics (iiis) are: 
to contribute to the identification of synergetic relationships among the areas of the systems approach, cybernetics, and informatics, as well as between them and society.
to foster, promote, and stimulate anything that can provide support and catalyze postmodernist methods in the postindustrial information society, especially regarding the emerging and growing plurality of conceptions of what is and/or should be science, technology, and engineering.
to foster, promote, and stimulate the tolerance required for the emergence of plural reasoning, alternative methods, and diversity of rigor in thought.
to foster, promote, and stimulate the tolerance required for the integration of knowledge and solutions in: a) the different fields of science and technology, with the spirit that has given rise to the systems movement (systems theory and methodology), and b) the different cultural, epistemological, ethical, praxiological and esthetic realities, within the context of the postmodernist phenomenon.
