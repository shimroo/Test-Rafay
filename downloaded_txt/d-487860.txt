listserv is a collection of electronic 
        discussion groups which are online forums where people discuss a 
        particular topic by receiving and posting messages using e-mail or the 
        web. in addition, listserv is a convenient resource for sending 
        announcements to  a group of people by using a single e-mail address to 
        reference the group.
note that electronic discussion groups are also
        called "distribution lists" or "lists." to subscribe to a list, you 
        must know the name of the list.
the following items provide information and instructions for participating in discussion groups hosted on listserv.temple.edu.
