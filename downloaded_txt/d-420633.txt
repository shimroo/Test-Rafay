explore the natural world

from far-off fieldwork, to complex computational models and carefully-crafted lab experiments, our students and scientists work side by side investigating the interconnected systems that shape the world around us, providing key insight to help guide humanity toward a sustainable future. join us.

explore the natural world










we’re curious.




our research is fueled by shared curiosity. how did the earth come to be? what sequence of events produced a world where life can thrive? do microbes influence the atmosphere? what role do the oceans play in regulating the earth’s temperature? how many earthlike planets are out there? can we ever predict earthquakes? or landslides? is it possible to capture and store carbon emissions safely underground?
delving into questions about the processes that influence the natural world and sustain life on earth, our students and faculty cross boundaries between disciplines, fostering research collaborations unmatched by any other program.
