welcome to nightguide miami, your single source for nightlife information.  nightguide miami brings you information that includes miami - dade club locations.  
additional south florida nightlife information is available at nightguide fort lauderdale, which covers 
broward county, greater miami's neighbor to the north.

greater miami's legendary night scene sizzles with possibility, driven by fashion and entertainment industry mavens. dubbed the sun and fun capital by jackie gleason in the 60s, miami beach has since evolved into america's riviera and a latin hollywood, with theatrical flair. made-in-miami television and motion pictures are all memorable, and celebrity spottings are de rigueur especially in and around the south beach nightlife scene, on the dance floors of hipper-than-thou clubs, at live latin jazz bars, and tablehopping in lounges of chi-chi restaurants that transform as evenings progress from cafes with guava cheesecake dessert courses to all out revelry at wee hours nightclubs. staying on top of what's hot poses a challenge, as ever-more fabulous concepts open each season. 

just north of downtown, overtown -- one of miami's oldest african-american neighborhoods -- is on the upswing, revitalizing an entertainment district. saturated with cuban culture, calle ocho, little havana's main drag, is lined with eateries and places where sounds of salsa and merengue fill the air. south of downtown, coconut grove -- new year's site of the king mango strut political spoof parade -- awaits with restaurants, movie theaters and bookstores. lovely coral gables, home of the university of miami, teems with top dining enclaves and galleries presenting the creme de la creme of art. little wonder that miami consistently ranks at the pinnacle for singles scene action and latin beats, and nowhere is this more apparent than in clubs of the moment, where djs spin the latest house music. tourists, locals and celebrities mingle at happening live music clubs in little havana. from live music venues to elegant global gatherings, miami glitters with stars and excitement.
