buy s.o.s. paperback, kindle, audio




war comes to paradise: between february and may of 1942 german u-boats operated with impunity off the florida coast, sinking nearly two dozen freighters from cape canaveral to key west and killing five thousand people. residents were horrified witnesses of the attacks â the night skies were aflame and in the morning the beaches were covered with oil and tar, ship parts and charred corpses. the germans even landed teams of saboteurs charged with disrupting war efforts in the factories of the north. this novel is based on those events. for my own purposes, i set the tale in the fictitious town of juno beach on the banks of the equally fictitious seminole river â all in the very real palm beach county, a veritable wilderness in those long ago days. among the witnesses were my grandfather and grandmother, who operated an orchard and ranch in the area.

buy hate parallax. paperback, kindle, audio




from library journal: a kaleidoscopic treatment of the vietnam war, this long novel maneuvers back and forth between the american viewpoint and, to a lesser extent, the vietnamese. from october 1967 to january 1968 the military on both sides, as well as vietnamese civilians, struggle to kill each other and/or survive. major shannon and general sinclair and men of the first squad are highlighted, as are general duan and his aide lau. there are brief flashbacks to civilian life. the authors have created a frighteningly realistic overview of battle, punctuated with vignettes of individual triumph and failure. the climax is the tet offensive and bloody recapturing of a city. three things finally emerge: the necessity for survival, the stupidity of war, and the suggestion that america might as well have been on the other side. recommended.

the third volume in the far kingdoms series brings amalric antero a new quest â for the kingdoms of the night, whose existence may hold the answer to the survival of his city! this authorized edition adds a new preface by allan cole explaining the origin of the series. "cole and bunch continue one of the most satisfactory recent fantasy trilogies, the saga of amalric antero and his kin. amalric, now an aging widower whose sister rali (of the warrior's tale) has vanished and who thinks all is well, is visited by the great-granddaughter of his old, sorcerous mentor, janos greycloak. it turns out that the far kingdoms (the kingdoms of the night) have not, as was thought, been found after all. those kingdoms remain key to the survival of amalric's city, orissa, in the face of growing dangers, so amalric must go questing once more in a dark-toned, even grim, tale that sees him succeed only at a high price. cole and bunch bring readers all the virtues they have previously displayed as they deftly balance world building, characterization, action, believable magic, and simple, sound use of the english language to produce a conclusion that, like its predecessors, is highly recommended." -- booklist
