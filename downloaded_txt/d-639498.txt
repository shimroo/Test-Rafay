featured item:  m14 
		stainless steel gas cylinder shims
 the least expensive way to 
		improve m14 accuracy. a must-have for standard and unitized gas systems.

a loose gas cylinder/front 
	band creates vibration that travels through the barrel faster than the 
	bullet leaves the barrel.  shims eliminate gas cylinder/front band 
	movement, and can be installed by the do-it-yourselfer.
