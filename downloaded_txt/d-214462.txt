faq 










what is the best test to choose?

the best test to choose is the one that is suitable to what you need at the moment!for example, if you want to quickly discover the most common 1st degree bugs or you are just in a hurry choose ‘speedtest’.if you are testing as you develop and what testers to follow your test plan and coverage choose ‘daily’.







how to choose the correct test with testpoint's wizard?

the correct test is the one you need, so , let’s divide it into needs and then relate it to a pre-set wizard option.you want to catch 1st degree bugs that most of your users will find, or you want to verify your production main scenario’s functionality, or you  are in a rush….choose speedtest.you want to focus on  flows/features/version/regression , actually test while you dev and before you launch….choose ‘daily’you want a combination and the freedom to combine between of the 2 above options plus determine your test time frame plus the option to  test in specific countries . choose ‘my way’for enterprise or specific needs or just conveniency choose ‘managed testing service’







what are the advantages of testpoint with online testing?

unique in the app testing world, testpoint allows independent, cost effective, quick and high quality results , like no other testing service in the traditional market today.







what do i have to check before testing with testpoint?

the minimum requirement is that your app is available , up & running with the most basic flows.







what is the difference between ios testing and android app testing?

when you submit your tests you need to submit it separately. why? first, because an android app cannot be installed on an apple device and vice versa, that is trivial.second,  on android app testing you can supply your apk file or a link to download from  while with ios app tests you need an enterprise/testflight license or a link to the appstore for testers to install.third, there are inherent differences in the uk/ui between the platforms, today they are minor but in many cases the same app is designed and acts differently on those 2 platforms.







how is desktop app testing different from mobile app testing?

different world entirely….a desktop app designed  to work on pc’s/ mac’s , with different operating tools and scope.think about the use of famous games in the market, the use of a high-end pc with pro keyboards , mouse and high speed network is a must! the mobile experience cannot replace it. the same go’s for desktop app testing vs mobile app testing.







does app or website expected traffic change the type of test needed?

yes, it does. to be accurate – it adds a test type called stress/load.for example , if you expect a thousand daily users and up to a hundred concurrent ones then you should test your app at least 10% more than that,so, eleven hundred during the day and one hundred and ten concurrent. tip-make sure your app is fully functional ready and with good quality before you do any stress/load testing.







who are testpoint's testers?

testpoint testers come from all over the world, some of them are professional testers and some are technical-oriented users.to become a testpoint tester, a tester goes through a tough screening process where testpoint verifies that the tester can communicate and correspond well in english. second, a tester goes through an online exam to check how many and how well he finds the implemented bugs in it.and third, even if a tester passes, he gets an initial rating that keeps on changing by the customers and our community manager when he participates in a live test cycle.testpoint platform always chooses the highest rated testers available per test cycle,always.







why is app testing important?

because no one wants to have buggy software that does not work or works badly… your users expect high quality products as you do when you use others yourself, the market is competitive and if you ‘fail’ on quality then the alternatives are 2 seconds away, be the one that the users go to and not the one that they go from.







how is online crowdtesting better?

quick feedbackwhen you launch a product, you want to know as soon as possible if there are any issues with it. with traditional testing methods, it can take weeks or even months to get feedback. with online crowdtesting, you can get feedback in a matter of days or even hours.cost-effectiveonline crowdtesting is a very cost-effective way to test a product. you don’t need to hire a large team of testers, or even pay for their travel and accommodation. all you need is a group of people who are willing to test your product.real-world conditionswhen you test a product in the real world, you are more likely to find problems that you would never have thought of. this is because people use products in different ways and in different conditions. by testing in the real world, you can find problems that you would never have thought of.large coveragewith traditional testing methods, it can be difficult to test a product thoroughly. this is because you can only test in a limited number of environments and with a limited number of people. with online crowdtesting, you can test with a large number of people in a variety of different environments. this means that you are much more likely to find all the problems with a product.access to new marketswhen you launch a product in a new market, it is important to test it thoroughly. with traditional testing methods, it can be difficult to get access to people in the new market. with online crowdtesting, you can reach people in the new market very easily. overall, online crowdtesting is a very efficient and cost-effective way to test a product. it is quick, thorough, and provides you with access to new markets.how so i set the test and scope to my testers? define your goals. before you start crowd testing, it’s important to define your goals. what do you want to achieve? what problems do you want to solve? answering these questions will help you determine the best approach for your crowd testing initiative.select the right platform.there are several crowd testing platforms to choose from, so it’s important to select the one that’s right for your needs. consider factors such as availability, set up, test launch and response time, price, features, and the size and location of the crowd.exploratory vs clear and concise test cases. exploratory testing (free testing without a test plan) can be highly valuable and insightful when testing with the crowd since they will go intuitively go through the flow as your real users will, thus, finding most important flows and issues that your users will surely encounter. if you are focus on specific flows and scenario’s such as onboarding, new feature, reproduce a bug, etc…. then a clear and concise test cases are essential for a successful crowd testing initiative. be sure to include all the necessary information, such as steps to go through and their respective expected result.manage your crowd. once you’ve launched your crowd testing initiative, it’s important to manage the crowd. this includes monitoring progress, providing feedback, and answering questions.analyze the results. after the testing is complete, it’s time to analyze the results. this includes reviewing the test cases, analyzing the data, and identifying any issues. mobile app testiong, like ios app testing or android application testing can be a valuable addition to your software testing strategy. by following these tips, you can ensure a successful crowd testing initiative.











crowdtesting online – pros and cons 










what is crowdtesting?

as the world becomes more and more digital, the need for comprehensive testing of digital products increases. unfortunately, traditional testing methods are not always able to keep up with the pace of development.this is where crowdtesting comes in. crowdtesting is a type of testing that uses a large number of testers from all over the world to test a product in a short amount of time. this is an ideal method for testing digital products because it can simulate real-world usage and find bugs that may have otherwise gone undetected.there are a number of advantages to crowd testing. first, it can provide a more realistic assessment of how a product will be used in the real world. this is because crowd testers are more likely to use the product in a variety of different ways, and in a variety of different settings. this can help to identify potential problems that may not be apparent in more controlled testing environments. second, crowd testing can be a more cost-effective way to test an application. this is because a larger number of people can be recruited to participate in the testing process, and the testing can be conducted over a shorter period of time. finally, crowd testing can help to build a community around a product or application. this can be beneficial for both the developers and the users of the product.crowd testing can help to create a sense of ownership and involvement in the development process and can also help to generate feedback that can be used to improve the product. despite the advantages of crowd testing, there are also some potential drawbacks. first, the large number of people involved in the testing process can make it difficult to maintain control over the testing environment. this can lead to problems such as false positives (where a problem is reported that does not actually exist) and false negatives (where a problem is not reported that does exist).second, crowd testers may not be representative of the target audience for the product. this can lead to problems if the product is intended for use by a specific group of people but is tested by a group that does not share the same characteristics. third, crowd testing can be a time-consuming process. this is because a large number of people need to be recruited and coordinated, and the testing itself can take a significant amount of time. despite these potential drawbacks, crowd testing can be a valuable tool for testing products and applications. when used correctly, it can provide insights that would not be possible to obtain through traditional testing methods.







the software testing and crowdtesting markets in numbers.

the software testing market is growing rapidly as more and more organizations recognize the importance of quality assurance. to put it in numbers, the global software testing market is expected to reach $50 billion by 2022, up from $32 billion in 2017, according to marketsandmarkets.







crowdtesting is a rapidly growing market with immense potential. 

the global crowdtesting market was valued at usd 700 million in 2018 and is expected to reach usd 4.72 billion by 2025, growing at a cagr (compound annual growth rate) of 32.1% during the forecast period (2019-2025). the growing need for quality assurance and the rising demand for agile and devops practices are the major factors driving the growth of the crowdtesting market. in addition, the increasing adoption of cloud-based crowdtesting solutions and services and the growing trend of digital transformation are further fueling the market growth. however, the lack of awareness about crowdtesting among smes and the concerns regarding data security are restraining the market growth. the cloud-based segment is expected to grow at the highest cagr during the forecast period. cloud-based crowdtesting solutions and services offer several advantages, such as pay-as-you-go pricing model, scalability, and flexibility, which are fueling their adoption among enterprises. the north american region is expected to hold the largest market share during the forecast period. the region has been at the forefront of the adoption of new and emerging technologies. 







why is crowdtesting so important to my project?

when it comes to launching a new product or website, it’s important to make sure that everything works perfectly before making it available to the public. that’s where crowd testing comes in. crowd testing is a type of testing that involves using a group of people (the “crowd”) to test a product or service. this can be done in person or online, and it’s often used to find bugs or errors that may not be obvious to the developers. there are a number of reasons why crowd testing is so important: it allows you to test on a larger scale. when you’re testing something yourself, or even with a small team of testers, it’s easy to miss things. but when you open up testing to a larger group of people, you’re more likely to find any errors or bugs that may exist.it gives you real-world feedback. crowd testers are typically ordinary people who will use your product or service in the same way that your target audience will. this gives you valuable feedback that you can use to improve your product or service.it can save you time and money. if you launch a product or website without testing it properly, you’re likely to run into problems down the line. this can cost you time and money as you try to fix things that should have been caught before launch.it can help build buzz. crowd testing can also be a great way to generate buzz for your product or service. when people see that you’re taking the time to test things properly, they’re more likely to have confidence in your product and tell their friends about it.







pros of online crowdtesting: 

-can provide valuable feedback from a large number of people in a short amount of time -can be a cost-effective way to beta test or gather user feedback during development -can help you identify user experience issues early on 







cons of online crowdtesting

-feedback may be inaccurate or biased -platforms can be expensive -may not always be available when you need them– it can be more difficult to reproduce results and to find and fix bugs.  – crowdtesting also requires more coordination than other types of testing, and it can   be more expensive. 







crowd testing without limitations…

now crowd testing had become accessible to all companies and ventures, even for small entrepreneurs at their earliest ‘garage’ stage.testpoint had made it easy, fast, accurate, and cost-effective for all.reduced friction and substantial time by offering an easy-to-use crowd testing project submission via the testpoint site.test projects can be launched at any time, anywhere, and on every platform independently by the customerit’s a race to the top. testpoint crowd qa and testers are screened and rated, first by testpoint community managers and dynamically in active projects by customers.per initiated project, testpoint always selects to top rated ones available.cost-effective and affordable.testers inputs starts within hours from project initiation.test project can be completed within a day….easy to manage, communicate and control testers inputs via a dedicated customer dashboard per project…
