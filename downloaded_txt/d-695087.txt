												love is our resistance!
in light of the attacks on the lgbtqia+ communities, we will not be silenced, intimidated, erased or go back into the closets‚Ä¶and there are people of faith who believe in the dignity and agency of all god‚Äôs children! and we will continue to love out loud! if you are queer and haven't gotten married yet...here's your chance! if you have been married for decades...it's time to renew your vows!
valentines day
12 pm: mass renewal of vows
1 - 3 pm: weddings performed by local clergy 
at:
hollywood united methodist church
6817 franklin ave, hollywood, ca 
at noon we will have a renewal of vows / promises (we want as many couples present for this as possible.)
at 1 pm we will begin individual marriages.

****you must pre-register for the marriages***
if you would like, we are also arranging free one-hour pre-marital sessions with either local therapists and/or clergy to be done prior to 2/14.
we will not be charging for this day, however, we will be asking donations that will go towards local organizations that specifically supports lgbtqia+ communities of color and immigration issues.
