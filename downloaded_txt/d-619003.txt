memories
of the war in vietnam.  from the 
delta to the dmz.

 

 




















here you will find memories of the 
war in vietnam brought to you by a veteran of that war.  
thank you for visiting. 
please remember the lost and missing 
soldiers and sailors of the vietnam war.
here we seek to tell the story of the 
war from all perspectives.  we welcome pictures and stories and poems.  
this page is about you the veterans of vietnam, and i need your help to tell 
this story to a whole generation.  the war in vietnam was criticized 
widely, yet we face the same problems today.  those who fight in battle do 
so at the risk of losing their own lives and the ones that they hold dear.  
that old axiom of war has changed little in thousands of years.
this site is about veterans of the
vietnam war.  it's intent, though, is to relate the war to those who never
served.  we need to understand what has happened in our history. knowledge
of the past is the most important thing of all.  without knowing what has
gone before, we will continue to make the same mistakes again.
vets, i need your help to tell that
story.
