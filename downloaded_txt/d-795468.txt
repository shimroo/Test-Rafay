about our resort

lost creek opened for business in june 2003 with 5 cottages and today we have 20 cottages with all the modern amenities one would expect of a higher end four season cottage resort. the property that lost creek is on was the former riding stables started in 1951.
lost creek resort is a very family oriented business hosting several family groups/reunions every summer.  we are located on the outside edge of the waskesiu townsite which does attract families or those who prefer quieter surroundings.  amenities on our property include a large fire pit area – with picnic tables and plenty of chairs to sit around by the fire, including a large yard with lots of open area for kids to play.
