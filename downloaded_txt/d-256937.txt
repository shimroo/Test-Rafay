these two books are about how we really can remove the rich from power to have real, not fake, democracy with no rich and no poor. it's not easy, but it is possible. if you would like to see this goal achieved then you really must read these two books before you decide it is impossible.

the people as enemy: the leaders' hidden agenda in world war ii
by john spritzler, challenges the "good war" myth about wwii.



the "war on terror" purports to be a         "good war" just like world war ii. but was world war two in fact a "good war"?          this book says "no."
it's  available
                    from  amazon.com: (u.s)(canada)  (u.k.)  (france)  (japan)  (austria)  (germany).

this i believe 
(yo  creo en esto) 
people are signing this statement (online or hard copy) to let others know they are not alone in wanting a revolution for an egalitarian world with real equality--no rich and no poor--and real, not fake, democracy. the signatures are being displayed in public on large posters like this one and this one. most of the people who stop and read the statement on the sidewalk outdoors, where we collect signatures,  sign it. try it and see for yourself how many people agree to sign it in your community. (here is a version using smaller font size with room for more signatures.) here are photos of people collecting signatures on a sidewalk.

a pamphlet by john spritzler and dave stratman, with supplementary articles here
please download, print, share and discuss "thinking" with your friends, neighbors and co-workers. (also feel free to distribute these related leaflets: from occupation to revolution and an "advertisement" of thinking about revolution.)
 
we can change the world (the book as pdf)
new democracy works for democratic revolution. welcome to our website! we hope you will explore it and share what you find with friends, family and coworkers. 
most americans want a society based on real democracy and equality and on the solidarity and friendship that already exist among ordinary people. but ordinary working people do not run the show. 
we live in a dictatorship of the rich. our world is dominated by a  wealthy elite  who control the big corporations and the government. the elite few enjoy unlimited wealth and privilege, while the majority live in constant fear of losing their homes, their livelihoods, their health, their freedom in a growing police state. there is no such thing as democracy in a society where money is power and most people don't have any.
we need a revolution to defeat this undemocratic elite and build a better society. revolution is possible because most people despise the values of inequality and greed and domination that characterize the powerful. most people believe in equality and solidarity and democracy. ordinary people already try to change the world when they defend and promote these values in their everyday lives. the constant effort of ordinary people to do the right thing--to stick together, to share what they have, to listen to and help others, in spite of the persistent messages of capitalism to just "look out for number one"-- is the realistic foundation for a new world.
billions of people around the globe are already in motion to make a new world. the struggle for revolution will define the 21st century.

turn the world upside down: john spritzler's blog #1
end class inequalty: john spritzler's blog #2
real democracy = ordinary people make the laws: a blog to replace the state legislature with 100 randomly selected adult residents of the state serving terms of just one year, designated the commonwealth jury, that will have all the legislative and other powers of the current legislature. [this was an attempt in 2008 to use a ballot question to promote discussion by the general public about the lack of real democracy in our current fake democracy. the solution it proposes is not as good as what is discussed in "thinking about revolution" written more recently. on december 2, 2012 the boston globe promoted the idea of a randomly selected legislature, as discussed here.]
