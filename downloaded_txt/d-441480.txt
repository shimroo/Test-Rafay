fighting for transit workers and riders across the dc region!
















we move this whole region!



atu local 689 is comprised of more than 15,000 members and retirees performing occupations within the many skilled transportation crafts for the washington metropolitan area transit authority (wmata), metroaccess, fairfax connector, dash, loudoun county transit, arlington transit, dc circulator & streetcar, among others.  local 689 was established on january 19, 1916 and is a member of the amalgamated transit union (afl-cio/clc), the largest labor organization representing transit workers in the united states and canada. 













fighting for workers everywhere.we organize workers to collectively bargain with their employers. we’ve won historic contracts that made transit careers a pathway to the middle class. we won’t stop until all workers are treated fairly. 













fighting for transit riders.we recognize that we serve a vital public service: moving the residents of the dmv to where they need to go. we’re at our strongest when working hand in hand with riders to improve and expand public transit. we’ve constantly fought for expanded and accessible public transit, opposing cuts of any kind. 













fighting for our communities.we understand that we can use our power and leverage to improve the lives of all workers in our region. for that reason we stay involved in our communities and in politics to promote policies that benefit working people.














 

our power comes from our members.we know that we are stronger when we work together.  we’re able to achieve great things when our members get involved. so get involved and find out how we can turn a transit job into a transit career!
