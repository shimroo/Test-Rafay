carl hayden bee research center
mission: the mission of the carl hayden bee research center (chbrc) is to conduct research to optimize the health of honey bee colonies, through improved nutrition and control of varroa mites in order to maximize production of honey bee pollinated crops.














cold storage research
this website provides the latest research findings and information on overwintering colonies in cold storage. the site has information on when to put colonies into cold storage, and which colonies to put into cold storage. we also provide access on this site to a program (cold storage overwintering tool) that helps beekeepers choose colonies to put into cold storage based on sizes and varroa populations in september.














beepop+ 
beepop+ is a honey bee colony population dynamics program providing daily predictions on honey bee colony size based on location, time of year, queen strength and the lifespan of worker bees
click here to access the model 














honey bee nutrition and microbiome research 
using a combination of laboratory and field approaches we further our understanding of the diversity, abundance, persistence and functional capacities of the microorganisms that occur in the hive environment, the alimentary tracts of queens, workers and developing larvae














usda grand challenge synergy project 
creating pollinator landscapes and overwintering practices to increase pollinator populations in a changing climate














varroa mite research
the varroa mite (varroa destructor), an ectoparasite of the honey bee apis mellifera, is the most serious pest of honey bees inflicting more damage and higher economic costs than all other apicultural diseases














continuous monitoring of honey bee colonies 
developing the use of sensors to model bee colony dynamics and to monitor bee health productivity and performance














queen health
examining the effects of honey bee stressors (seasonal, nutritional, microbial/pathogenic, and agrochemical) on queen health, productivity, and interactions with workers.
