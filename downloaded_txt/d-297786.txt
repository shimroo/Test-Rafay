    why honduras?

 when the world looks at honduras, it sees statistics.

 over 66% of hondurans live in material poverty20% survive on less than $1.90 per day

 leave or get left behind? 
with their lives defined by what they lack, hundreds of hondurans leave their country each day in search of a better life. those who stay are often left with the challenges of material poverty, violence, and lack of opportunity.
 we see honduras differently.
at heart to honduras, we see the honduran people as capable, competent friends. we see communities with resources. we see young people with a future. we see heroes who are writing beautiful stories of belonging, hope, dignity, and endless possibility.
 we see rural honduran communities as
a place to truly belong.

  this is where heart to honduras has excelled for the past 30 years: bringing god’s people together in authentic, reconciling, life-giving relationships, awakening both hondurans and north americans to our shared rootedness in jesus christ
