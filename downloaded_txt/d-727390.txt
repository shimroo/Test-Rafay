book reviews

 

“when jenni says in this book that she had to get weak to find her strength, you better believe it. she’s one of the strongest people i have ever met, and this book of hers is mighty indeed. it will make you laugh, make you cry, and make you see the wonder and beauty of life. read it now, and you’ll share some of jenni’s strength.”
—jonathan eig, new york times best-selling author of luckiest man: the life and death of lou gehrig

 
 


book reviews

 

an honest and sobering glimpse into our daily struggles, of first being diagnosed, and then living with als. jenni fights forward with grace, demonstrating that even under these difficult and painful circumstances; being present in the moment and making space for joy, humor, and love, opens the door for meaning, and gratitude in each and every day. jenni you inspire me!
—nanci ryder, hollywood publicist, co-founder of bwr public relations, diagnosed with als in 2014

 

this book is incredible. so raw and real — and inspiring. it puts life into perspective in a way you’ve probably never seen. it brings joy, anger, tears and laughter. i soaked in every single word.
—dana benbow, indianapolis star features writer

 

beautifully done – i would of given anything to have read a book like this to prepare ourselves . . . you are going to help and inspire so many people. amazing – thank you both for coming into our lives. 
—kathy shawver maffei, close friend of nanci ryder for over 20 years

 
 


for a story of terminal illness, this book is overflowing with joy, optimism, good humor, and the love of life. every page reminds us of how fragile our lives are, but also of abraham lincoln’s maxim that “most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.” jenni berebitsky has made her mind up to be happy, and to be strong, and to lend her happiness and strength to the people around her—including those lucky enough to read this courageous memoir.
—ben h. winters, author of nine novels, including most recently the new york times bestselling underground airlines

 

we are all just one bad diagnosis from stepping into the unknown territory that jenni and her family have traveled. like pioneers, they’ve blazed a trail for those who follow and they’ve done it with humor and pragmatism. 
—mary doria russell, author of the sparrow, a thread of grace, and doc 

 

as jenni says, “i’m always thinking,” which the reader sees clearly in her creativity and ways of connecting to the world around her. she is not helpless. at varying points in her disease progression, she opens her own naturopathic medical practice, officiates at her brother’s wedding, and participates in a sprint triathlon—twice. and throughout the entire story, jenni shows us what a difference a wry sense of humor can make, especially when we are in our most vulnerable states. jenni berebitsky’s memoir has the reader reconsider the idea of what it means to be healthy and fully alive. she reminds us that “angels can appear out of nowhere,” and that if we are paying attention, and if we are always thinking, we just might see them.
 —melissa keller, author of crazy is relative

film reviews

 



we are very proud that your filmmaking captured the tenacity and zest for living life to the fullest that jenni berebitsky has in spite of dealing with the hardships of als. her courage is an example for all. as a neuroscientist, i understand, to a small extent, what a struggle jenni is persevering through and using the blessed spiritual strength to remain strong for her young son and champion husband.
—robbie singh, research scientist & business analysts

 
 


“sometimes there are good souls that lend a little of their magic that make a moment, a creative idea, a challenging event into something so beautiful and indescribable that carries the power and spirit to profoundly transform many. jenni berebitsky is that angelic emissary, and grateful – the jenni berebitsky story is a powerful testimony of the good, the great, and the divine creative energy coming together to provide a testament of the possible against the backdrop of impossible; dazzling light amidst the immense odds; an amazing grace and courage that the higher spirit only entrusts to a few to inspire millions. this project is about this lesson and the one assigned to deliver it! we are being invited to experience the ultimate triumph of the human spirit!! once the word gets out, this creative endeavor is likely to find resonance, not just arts audiences in paris, sydney, toronto, or mumbai film festivals, but across the human landscapes and unexplored regions of the human mind and spirit. congratulations to eveyone involved in this project!!!”
—kp singh, author, writer, public speaker

 

i came to support my friend amy. and then i started to watch the movie. you made me ugly cry
— r. c. thorne, actor & producer

 

what a truly special story this is… i am so moved after watching, as i was when reading jenni’s book. the book and film together make such a powerful pair, set to inspire many!
— marissa decuir, president, jks communications

 
 


jenni is an inspiration and when she speaks about receiving and giving help it reminded me that as jews that is the concept of mitzvot. jenni’s courage and perspective on life and death have fed my heart and mind in ways that no high holiday sermon has done ever.
– ilene s. uhlmann, director of chicago jewish film festival

 

was deeply moved by this inspiring woman, her family, her story. yes, we are all indeed actively dying, it’s what people like jenni are doing with their living that makes this world a better place. wonderful, thought-provoking film! looking forward to reading her book.
—autumn mcewen mcalpin, writer, producer, director of side gig productions

 

despite its unabashed celebration of the human spirit, grateful is, rather gratefully, not a film filled with greeting card sentiments. there’s a thread of realism throughout grateful, a realism that seems to be enveloped by the immensely loving circle of family and friends who surround berebitsky on a regular basis.
—richard propes, the independent critic

 

it was no surprise to me that grateful received audience choice award at our film festival… having viewed the film many times privately and with large audiences, the sensitivity associated with the subject is first rate. i particularly like the way viewers can be overwhelmed with emotion and then — within the same scene — it has you laughing. fabulous! i’m wishing you continued success and sincerely recommend grateful to everyone.
—craig prater, president, heartland international film fesitval

 
 
 
 




jenni berebitsky legacy award

 

longtime heartland film friend jenni berebitsky was diagnosed in march 2009 with als (lou gehrig’s disease). accompanied every step of the way by family and friends who cherish her, jenni lived courageously and joyfully with the challenges (and, as she sometimes added, gifts) of the relentless disease.
nine years into her als journey, jenni published her memoir als saved my life…until it didn’t. the book captures jenni’s humor, zest for life, and inspiring solutions for all manner of obstacles. less than a year later, the documentary short film grateful: the jenni berebitsky story was released and won, among other tributes, the audience choice award at the indy shorts international film festival.
the jenni berebitsky legacy award now annually recognizes one short film in the indy shorts lineup for the best embodiment of jenni’s spirit and legacy. its presentation honors one film best capturing the triumph of the human spirit and a person’s capacity to inspire others.
