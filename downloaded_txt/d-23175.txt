                    listerhill credit union is a nonprofit financial cooperative improving lives in our community.
                

a credit union is a nonprofit cooperative owned and operated by its members. this is what distinguishes a credit union from other financial institutions. members put their money in a variety of savings accounts, and that money, in turn, is lent to members. after operating expenses and reserve requirements are met, income is returned to all members in the form of dividends and comprehensive financial services.
