about



our missionwe welcome you to deepen your relationship with the spirit of god that we see in jesus as a community open to all, centered in worship, religious education, care for the environment, and compassion for neighbors, local and global.our visionto cultivate our spiritual and worldly resources to bring healing, hope, justice and peace to our community and the world.



























our values








            faith & spirituality
          










our approach to faith and spirituality meets people wherever they are on their journey. we view spirituality as a dynamic way of life that allows for a deepening of faith, a collective sense of belonging, and a growing intimacy with the always accessible yet ever transcendent nature of god.








            vibrant worship
          










we embrace the rich heritage of the episcopal church while exploring other traditions and cultures, both ancient and modern. our worship experience is enhanced by the excellence of our music program, the presentation of liturgy as relevant to our lives, and the beauty and elegance of our historic victorian gothic church.








            openness & affirmation
          










openness lies at the heart of our community, embodying a commitment to inclusivity where individuals of all races, cultures, genders, sexual orientations, and family structures find acceptance and belonging. as an open and affirming parish, we prioritize programming that supports the holistic development of people of all ages and backgrounds, fostering an environment where diversity is celebrated, and everyone is welcome.








            community outreach
          










our outreach initiatives promote social well-being, care for the environment and compassion for our neighbors both local and global. through various programs, events, and partnerships, we extend care and concern to those in need both within our parish and the broader community, taking a loving approach to providing emotional, physical, and spiritual support.








            fellowship & fun
          










we create opportunities for joyous gatherings for the parish and the wider community to celebrate fellowship, deepen our relationships with one another, and partner with other organizations to raise awareness and funds for their good works.
