welcome
49 west brings art, music, and community together with great food and drink in an ambiance inspired by the traditional european coffeehouse.
breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served daily. our bar offers an intriguing selection of beer, wine, spirits, and cocktails. delectable desserts, baked goods (we make ’em!), and a full array of coffee confections–made with locally roasted, fresh coffee beans–are sure to please every palate.
this is the place to meet and greet in annapolis. our friends call 49 west “annapolis’s living room.”
in our intimate listening room, we present the best in local live music nightly. jazz, american roots, folk, indie, bluegrass, boss nova, and classical artists highlight the rich diversity of annapolis’s music scene–details are on our calendar of events. reservations are strongly recommended, so please call us at 410-626-9796.
we look forward to serving you!
