​it was 1996 in san diego's gaslamp quarter when cathy guthrie and amy nelson met at a bar…where they both worked.  one was a tramp and one was devastatingly pure.  with a ukulele and an acoustic guitar, they formed a band for the same reason kids join gangs— just to survive, but also to unleash the brilliance that was poking them from within.  don't believe the rumors. folk uke is not totally amazing. they're just kind of amazing. if you find yourself at a folk uke show, you are in for a treat— but maybe not the kind of treat that you like the taste of.  come to a show and see for yourself. better yet, buy their albums first and you may save yourself the trouble. and if you make it to a live folk uke show, do your best to enjoy it…and then give them two more chances.  they are hit and miss, but so are you most likely, and that is their charm. we live to inspire and we're tired of writing in third person.love, cathy & amy​
