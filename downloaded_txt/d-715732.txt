“hi… thanks for stopping by.  as a performer i need a place to share what i do… and this is it.
of course it’s just a sample, but enough to get a good idea and feel if i’m a good fit and that
i’m what you’re looking for. 
you won’t find a long bio or history of my career. though it’s vast and has been described as
“impressive”, let’s face it, that’s not why you’re here. your concern is what’s happening now and how
i can make your event a success, musically!
i will tell you that i’ve been playing publicly since i was 12, have done everything from an acoustic solo act to
recording an album with an original rock band in my early twenties and doing that whole “rock star” thing,
and almost everything musically in between. it’s why i can offer such a wide range of styles and song selection. 
enjoy looking around checking out the photos and videos. when you’re ready to schedule and create
a mutually rewarding musical partnership, email me and i’ll be sure to get back to you right away. ”  tom nicoli
