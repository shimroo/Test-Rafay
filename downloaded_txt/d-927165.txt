about us
simply scandinavian is maine’s full service scandinavian importer.  thomas, a/k/a “tom” or “sven” (swedish & norwegian american),  grew up in rural northern maine (caribou, new sweden and westmanland) which is rich in swedish culture. having resided in southern maine for several years and ultimately recognized a strong need for a full service scandinavian importer for scandinavians all over northern new england.
when we established the business on june 1, 1998, tom left behind his corporate occupation in employee benefits to fulfill his life long dream of becoming an importer of wonderful products from all over scandinavia. the passion to deliver extreme service with a sharp eye to high quality, truly unique and beautiful hand picked items has blossomed into a long sought after shopping experience in portland, maine for scandinavians and non-scandinavians alike. we welcome your personal visit on your next journey to portland’s old port.
in april 2004, we expanded into two locations, just a short walk apart. the original location on exchange street, which offered foods and the second location on market street, which had all the goods.
in july 2005, the simply scandinavian family grew. anna & anders (the resident, dachshunds) were born on tom’s swedish/norwegian mormor’s birthday. these ‘tax’ (liten röd hunds) have stolen the hearts of many a visitor.
in january 2006, simply scandinavian became a stand alone business on market street. 
in march 2012, we relocated to brighter, more spacious storefront at 19 temple street, within a couple blocks of the previous locations, in the heart of portland’s downtown district. we are conveniently located at the entrance of the temple street parking garage and have several short duration parking meters at our storefront.
thomas, marty, anna & anders invite you to visit them on your next journey to portland or on the web.
