talking about the consortium


students from each of our member institutions share how the five college consortium enriches their campus experiences.




















racial equity & justice
a core element of the mission of five colleges, incorporated is to support and sustain a robust academic community in the connecticut river valley through the programs we manage on behalf of our member campuses. doing this community-building work well requires that we engage and empower all members of the community. to that end, five colleges endeavors to be an anti-racist organization, that we may better fulfill our purpose and serve our member campuses.
