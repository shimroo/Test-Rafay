what people are saying






cs testimonials (home page)





















“i’ve had some wonderful manuscript reads from cornerstones over the years. their feedback on my first manuscript was invaluable in developing my writing; without it, i don’t think i’d have ever started my second. now, after signing with the soho agency in 2020, i have a two-book deal with headline.” – jessica irena smith, the summer she vanished (headline, 2023)






















“it took me a while to realise there was no shame in asking for professional advice [...] my cornerstones editor provided me with the perfect blend of enthusiasm and constructive criticism. my book went on to win a three-book deal with constable, an imprint of little, brown. no literary consultancy can guarantee you will get published, but cornerstones clearly have the calibre to help you get there.”– tom benjamin, a quiet death in italy (constable, little, brown, 2019)






















“from the moment i first started working with cornerstones, i felt like i was in a safe pair of hands. they made great editing suggestions, from the minor to the major, and were also a fantastic support whenever i had a crisis of confidence. i don’t think i’d have had the courage or the confidence to submit to agents without them.”– polly phillips, my best friend’s murder (simon & schuster, 2021)






















“i think, for me, the most important aspect of working with cornerstones is the feeling of taking yourself seriously as a writer. it is a big investment to think of having professional feedback in this way but i’d received so many rejections while also feeling that i couldn’t give up on these characters and this story just yet.”– julie ma, happy families (welbeck, 2021)






















“i had some wonderful mentoring with cornerstones at first draft stage which was incredibly helpful, and through the support of helen and the team, i worked towards a final draft and managed to get myself an agent.”– kate macdougall, london’s number one dog walking agency (bonnier, 2021)






















“i’ve just had the thrilling experience of signing with a top agent, which would not have happened without cornerstones’ help. helen and her team read my ms from start to finish, provided invaluable feedback, arranged agency introductions and here i am! it was worth every penny and i can’t thank you enough.”– vanessa moore, one thousand days and one cup of tea (octopus, hachette, 2021)






















"my cornerstones editor was thorough, detailed, and always positive. i could not recommend them more to get your manuscript in shape. thanks to the team i went on to secure an incredible agent and publisher. thank you cornerstones for making a dream come true!"— ericka waller, dog days (transworld, 2021)






















"without working with alison at cornerstones, i'm not sure that i would have finished the book. she filled me with much-needed confidence and was a guiding light throughout the difficult first draft."— charlotte levin, if i can't have you (mantle, pan macmillan, 2020)






















“cornerstones offered crucial help at a time when i really needed it. thanks to the team for matching me with the right editor: my manuscript transformed from something that had previously only given me panic into a story that inspired confidence.”— roshani chokshi, the gilded wolves (wednesday books, 2019)






















“i would describe cornerstones as a doorway into the world of publishing (having first walked round the outside peering in through the windows).”– beth merwood, the five things (the wild rose press, 2021)
