the many voices of the los angeles novel edited by julia steincambridge scholars publshing


view extract 

descriptioneditor biocontributors


as this volume shows, los angeles novels changed 
greatly beginning in the 1960s as the population of the city became 
multi-national. for decades, latino/as have written critical novels of 
resistance about la, and, in the 1970s, their novels came of age while 
influenced by south american magical realism. the book also highlights 
that african-americans have authored brilliant los angeles fiction for a
 number of years, while women transformed novels dealing with hollywood,
 detectives, and science fiction. in addition, lgbtq writers—both anglos
 and chicano/as—have created innovative works, while men’s novels that 
explored 20th century class conflicts have been recently rediscovered.

anthologies about the los angeles novel 1984-2003





 
previous anthologies about the los angeles novel: all are
interesting but out-of-date as the these anthologies were published from 1984
through 2003. a lot more good los angeles novels have been published from
2003-2021.
fine, david, editor. los angeles in fiction:  a collection of original essays 1984-  l.a. literature as 1930s noirs.  traces boosters to bust of 1930s to hollywood
novels, crime and detective, and then immigrant, ethnic, and apocalyptic
fiction. fine calls la fiction begins with helen hunt jackson’s ramona (1884)
and mary austin’s the ford (1917) 
and then 1920s novels—the “gentle satires” of harry lee merton’s merton
of the movies (1923) and mark lee luther’s the boosters (1923) and
later in the decade ryan’s angels flight and sinclair’s oil. then
he talks of detective/crime writers “focus on crimes committed and buried in
past time” which detective discovers. also hollywood novels like aldous huxley after
many a summer dies a swan (1939). 
fine, david. imagining los angeles:  a city in fiction. 2000. “first literary
history of la in 50 years.” 80% after ch. 1 intro,  ch 2 on boosters, ch. 3 on 1920s fiction on
movies and oil; ch. 4 on hard-boiled 1930s; ch. 5 on detectives; ch. 6 on
hollywood novels; ch. 7 on poor—fante and bukowski; black writers arna
bontemps, chester himes, walter mosley; chicanos oscar acosta, ron arias,
thomas sanchez’s zoot suit; ch. 8 black dahlia post-war misogyny against
women’s independence and zoot suits by luis valdez and h. 9 surviving
apocalypse with braverman’s palm latitudes; john rechy’s the
miraculous day of amalia cortez;  and
t.c. boyle’s tortilla curtain; and surviving apocalypse in kadohata and
carolyn see’s golden days and making history
murphet, julian.  literature
and race in los angeles. 2001.- detective fiction (post-chandler of james
elroy’s la quartet novels and walter mosley’s easy rollins series of novels),
multi-cultural poets (coleman, luis rodriguez, and sesshu foster), adolescent
noir fiction (bret easton ellis and dennis cooper—two wealthy young white
males), and  anna deveare smith, a black
woman from ny’s take on 1992 l.a. uprising
timberg, scott and gioia, david, editor. the misread city
new literary los angeles   2003.
focuses skenazy’s essay on detective novels (cain, chandler, ross mcdonald, and
post-1970s james ellroy, joseph hansen’s gay detective novels, michael nava’s
gay chicano investigator, sue grafton, walter mosley) and fictional apocalypse
(david fine says common theme of la fiction from 1920s-present is “betrayal of
hope and collapse of dreams” p. 66). fine says women’s novels of la show even
in disaster reason for hope (isherwood’s a single man, braverman’s palm
latitudes, cynthia kadohata’s in the heart of the valley of love, carolyn
see’s golden days and making history). i’d add alison lurie’s the
nowhere city

hello,
'
on  march 18, 2005, on this blog i published "top 40 novels of los angeles."  if you grew up as a teenager i like did in l.a., the radio would have top 40 rock 'n roll songs. of course, the los angeles has had many fine novelists with strong voices published in the last 17 years.

now i
am pulling together an edited collection of essays called the many voices of
the los angeles novel and i would like to invite you to consider submitting
one or more chapters.
 



the
abstract/call for the collection is here:

los
angeles novels began with helen hunt jackson’s 1888 novel ramona on persecution
of native americans. latino/as, african-americans, and asian-americans have
written brilliant los angeles novels for decades. women transformed the
hollywood, detective, and science fiction novels. gay writers have refashioned
detective novels while men’s novels show 20th century class conflicts.

julia
stein was an oral historian of los angeles. she has published five books of
poetry, two anthologies of poetry, and co-authored the book shooting
women:  behind the camera, around the world.  stein has published journalism
for decades and was an english professor at santa monica college.

a
chapter should normally be no longer than 6000 words, and should be original
and previously unpublished. if the work has already been published (as a
journal article, or in conference proceedings, for example), the publisher cambridge
scholars press will require evidence that permission to be re-published has
been granted.

to
see the call on the publisher’s website, please click here:

https://www.cambridgescholars.com/t/editedcollectionsliterature

and if you scroll down you see the announcement for my los
angeles novel collection of essays.  click
the title “the
many voices of the los angeles novel” and you will get the submission form
to download and fill out.

 please feel free to ask if you have any
questions.  send completed submission form
to admin@cambridgescholars.com
and one to me steinjulia44@gmail.com

or you can just send the form to me,
and i can send it on to the publisher.
