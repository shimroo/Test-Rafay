barley-based gluten-free beer â more questions than answers
an excellent assessment of a new paper in food & chemical toxicity on the allergy insight blog. how safe is gluten based beer which has been treated with enzymes to degrade the gluten fragments? can tests designed for solid foods really be valid for liquids such as beer? read on.






call for adult allergy sufferers
dr rebecca knibb and her team at aston university are looking for participants for their survey designed to under
            stand  the quality of life, anxiety and self efficacy of adults with food  allergy. understanding the role that self efficacy has in food allergy  management will help them develop interventions to help adults manage  their allergies. your insights could provide vital information concerning the issues surrounding managing food allergies as an adult. for more information and to sign up.







vegan labelling and the 'may contain' issue
the huge growth in the number of vegan products on the market should be a massive bonus for those with milk or egg allergies. but â  so many of them come with pal/may contain warnings for milk and egg, that it has also been a cause of great frustration and no small degree of acrimony.

vegans and the allergy community are coming from very different places. and then there is the food industry â with a whole different set of priorities â and the regulators/enforcers who have to police the territory.

at a very interesting seminar organised by the chartered trading standards institute  it soon became clear that there are basically four players involved. read on...







the specific carbohydrate diet - an overlooked approach to gut issues
the specific carbohydrate diet was  created in 1924 by a us  pediatrician  sydney valentine haas (1870-1964). he used the diet  (affectionately known as the banana diet) to help children with failure  to thrive, protein malnutrition associated with celiac disease, and  inflammatory bowel disease. it was subsequently developed, with guidelines and recipes by elaine gottschall in her 1987 book breaking the vicious cycle: intestinal health through diet. in an interesting article in this month's townsend letter, christine bowen decribes how it resolved   her lifelong intestinal issues, the research that has subsequently been done to validate dr haas' theories and the success she has had with her own patients on the diet.






could wireles monitoring devices be killing racehorses?
could the unprecedented 8-fold rise in horse deaths at churchill downs, home of the kentucky derby, in may and june this year be connected to the wireless devices fitted on april 29th to all horses racing there? arthur firstenberg and the cellphone task force suggests that they could. read on.









tourette syndrome  controlled by diet and rigorous elimination of chemicals
an article in the excellent latitudes magazine about 18 year old eli who was diagnosed with tourettes syndrome after developing eye, noise, throat and head jerking symptoms when he was 7. by following the feingold diet and eliminating chemicals from the family home eli's tics were brought under control - except when he went back to school each january after the school carpets had been cleaned with a harsh chemical cleaner. now 18 eli, who has just accepted a scholarship to play college baseball at wallace state cc, remains on the feingold diet and aware of environmental triggers - and tic free. 
                   read eli's full story here on latitudes.







new distribution for dr janice joneja's histamine books
dr janice joneja is recognised as a world expert on histamine intolerance â or, to be more accurate, histamine excess - a condition affecting up to 1% of the world's population but rarely recognised by conventional medicine.â her books on the conditon and their accompanying cookbook have been hugely successful on amazon and are now available through a number of other outlets.  see here for full details.

cough medicines that include pholcodine can cause anaphylaxis
pholcodine is a drug that is to be found in a wide range of cough medicines. unfortunately pholcodine has a similar molecular structure to the muscle relaxing drugs which are routinely given to patients about to undergo operations. if that patient has recently (within the last year) had an allergic reaction to pholcodine they could easily react to a muscle relaxant administered prior to an operation. read more....







 itâs the environment, stupidâ¦..
in a recent bsaci on line symposium professor stephen holgate called for urgent action to tackle the environmental causes of the global explosion in allergy cases: the loss of biodiversity, pollution, diet and urbanisation. a timely call but the evidence has been there for many years. read on...






trehalose intolerance
trehalose intolerance is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme trehalase, which is required to break down the dietary sugar trehalose into glucose in the gut, for absorption. it is found mainly in mushrooms, particularly shiitake and oyster mushrooms, but also seaweed / algae, shellfish, insects, sunflower seeds and yeasts. as an additive, it is sometimes used to prolong the shelf life of dried food â especially in japan.  5 september 22 for more see the allergy insight blog here. 






facebook group for those with total food allergy
john scott who suffered for many years from total food intolerance (finally resolved through helminthic therapy) has now started a facebook group for total food intolerance sufferers. as he says, âthanks to the complete lack of effective treatment options in the medical kit bag and typical dismissal of the condition as psychosomatic by medics, some sort of support group is desperately needed'. for more on total food intolerance follow the links from this blog post. read more.
