president's messagefebruary 2025
dear paacc members:
each year we present our state of the state to acc to share our accomplishments. in 2024 we had some amazing successes!  check out the below report of what we’ve done together as a team this past year.
non-competes in pa
phc4 has created a survey to understand the prevalence and gain insight on non-compete agreements impacting health care professionals in pa. the organization plans to use the findings to inform a broader effort; the study of the impact of act 74, fair contracting for health care practitioners act on the commonwealth.
phc4’s survey of licensed health care professionals in pennsylvania is intended to aid in studying the occurrence of non-compete agreementsfrom 2025 to 2027. this first survey collection period is planned for february 15, 2025, through april 15, 2025. the intended respondents are those health care practitioners that currently provide, or have provided in the past, hands-on patient care in the commonwealth. we encourage everyone to participate in the survey to show how non-compete agreements have affected your ability to practice. the more feedback phc4 receives from providers who are adversely affected by non-competes the better chance we have to sway future legislation. access the survey here after february 15th.
board certification
i just recently received my yearly bill from abim to maintain my board certification. there has not yet been a final decision from the american board of medical specialties (abms) on the approval of a true cardiovascular board independent from the abim. as a reminder, it is important that everyone continue to maintain their abim certification (including paying the $220 every year) and doing their moc credits until/if the new board is approved.
 
cvteam educational series continues
our cv team has their next educational forum scheduled on february 20th on “clinician perspectives: understanding trauma-informed care” at 12:00 noon. although there is no charge for this event for members, we do ask that you register for each session you are able to attend so we can send you the zoom link 24 hours prior to the meeting. please note: an application has been submitted for ceus for each session and you must register for each session separately per ceu rules. access the link here.
 
wicmaccs
our women in cardiology section is co-hosting a mid-atlantic retreat at heart house in washington, dc on february 22-23 with other state chapters in our region. this is a great opportunity to learn from and network with colleagues with a dinner experience saturday night followed by a cme conference on sunday. please register here.
we continue to welcome feedback and are excited about growing and having more members get involved. please check out our website at www.pcacc.org, follow us on x @pachapteracc, and reach out any time via president@pcacc.org with questions, ideas, needs or if you would like to get involved in paacc activities.
