"does trying to figure out what to do with your 
                          doggy pal during happy hour make you cock your head

 famous quote: 
                          "from the oyster to the eagle, from the swine to 
                          the tiger, all animals are to be found in men and each 
                          of them exists in some man, sometimes several at the 
                          time. animals are nothing but the portrayal of our virtues 
                          and vices made manifest to our eyes, the visible reflections 
                          of our souls. god displays them to us to give us food 
                          for thought."

-- victor hugo, les misérables, 1862
