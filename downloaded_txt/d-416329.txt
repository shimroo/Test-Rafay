salgenx 3,000 kwh sodium flow battery


the battery that stores energy and processes simultaneously while self healing and optimizing itself

the salgenx sodium flow battery is unique, in that it can not only store electricity, but perform simultaneous processing functions.â¢ store grid-scale power â¢ store thermal energy (including cogeneration)â¢ perform selectable revenue processes according to highest revenue on-demand (ai tunable logic may select from charging to thermal storage, and more)the 4-6 hour flow battery charge rate can be discharged at any time and the stored energy can be held almost indefinitely.our new cathode materials can do the following:â¢ self-healing electrodeâ¢ self-optimizing materialâ¢ while charging, the system will automatically enhance itself and build conductivitymultiple cathode materials are available for use with the same type anode.you can use a tesla megapack to master 100 of the salgenx 3,000 kwh batteries and save $31 million.$1.2 billion usd in pre-orders ready for first license buyer/manufacturer.

the market for grid scale batteries in energy storage

the global grid-scale battery market is experiencing rapid growth. in 2023, the market was valued at approximately usd 6.82 billion and is projected to reach around usd 84.07 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of 32.2%. this surge is driven by the increasing demand for energy storage solutions, particularly to support the integration of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar into power grids.tesla has been significantly ramping up production of its megapack energy storage systems. in 2023, tesla deployed almost 15 gwh of battery energy storage, which is a 125% increase from the previous year. in the first half of 2024, tesla deployed a record-breaking 9.4 gwh of energy storage in q2 alone, indicating rapid growth in this segment.tesla's energy business, primarily driven by megapack sales, generated $1.6 billion in revenue in q1 2024, with projections that energy storage could represent 15-21% of tesla's overall revenue in the coming years. tesla currently produces megapacks at its lathrop, california, factory with an annual capacity of 40 gwh, and plans to double that capacity with a new factory in shanghai.at the current pace reported by the tesla earnings report in october 2024, they is expected to produce up to 10,400 megapacks per year by 2025. the demand for these types of batteries is incredible.in november 2024, tesla just announced it has produced 10,000 megapacks at the lathrop facility.

global energy 5000 bf shipping container lumber dry kiln plans


5000 bf container lumber dry kiln plans 

the 5,000 bf container kiln consists of one 40 foot high-cube aluminum shipping container. the first kiln built in 1992 was a 15,000 bf size and worked great. this first container kiln had several innovations, including the use of a direct fired heat pipe (furnace type dry kiln) and a conifer sawdust burner. kiln plans are $199.95

global energy shipping container lumber dry kiln from 1992


global energy container kiln plans

global energy designed and developed the container kiln back in 1992. the purpose is to give access to portable sawmill owners, furniture makers, and small business the value added profit of dry kiln lumber and quality hardwoods.we are now offering plans for our epic container dry kiln system, which we developed in 1992. the system has been copied by lots of groups over the past 30 years (validating its profitability and access to the small commercial sawmill proprietors).kiln plans are $199.95
