new jersey symphony




















allison loggins-hull can you see? originally written for the new jersey symphony chamber players and now re-written for full orchestra, can you see? is cool and glassy on its surface, but the waters underneath are rolling in this tour-de-force concert opener by the symphony’s new resident artistic partner.



















frédéric chopin piano concerto no. 1 one of the most astonishing creations of any 19-year-old, chopin poured his beyond-his-years splendor into his first concerto, and it has stayed an audience favorite around the world for 200 years.



















johannes brahms symphony no. 1 a könig specialty, brahms’ first was decades in the making—but oh, it became a triumph of drama and soaring lyricism well worth the wait.

nimbus dance | samuel pott, artistic director & choreographer
new jersey symphony




johann sebastian bach prelude from cello suite no. 2
behold the majesty and wonder of solo bach, as principal cello jonathan spitz spins this mesmerizing theme from thin air.



caroline shaw valencia
the valencia orange, described as “a thing of nature, yet so complex and extraordinary” inspired this expertly-crafted spring quartet.



















qasim naqvi god docks at death harbor (piano quintet version) naqvi calls this piece “a vision of our planet years from now … the quiet and peacefulness of a world restoring itself.” nimbus dance joins with brand new choreography, titled “dark water.”



igor stravinsky divertimento from the fairy’s kiss
stravinsky loved the romantics like tchaikovsky, and created this charming and lilting divertimento after him.



















igor stravinsky suite from the firebird a tale of a deathless, tyrannical overlord in battle with a handsome young prince who’s aided by a magical bird. the firebird has one of the most exciting finales in all classical music, brought to life here with nimbus dance at center stage for the newark concerts.

adam tendler piano
new jersey symphony




















claude debussy clair de lune debussy’s original piano solo, clair de lune, probably exists in more versions than the beatles’ “yesterday” and for good reason, as none before or since have captured in music the true magic of moonlight.



nico muhly sounding for piano and orchestra (new jersey symphony co-commission)
new york-based pianist adam tendler, “currently the hottest pianist on the american contemporary classical scene” (minneapolis star tribune), makes his new jersey symphony debut in this hymn tune-filled concerto by broadly popular contemporary composer nico muhly.



















sergei rachmaninoff symphony no. 2 melodies too numerous and beautiful to track—so don’t try. just let this sweeping romantic symphony, the inspiration for the song “never gonna fall in love again,” work its magic.

robert schumann overture, scherzo and finale
bursting with a love of life in the months after his marriage to clara, robert schumann created three fantastic movements–one shy of a full symphony but which stand magnificently on their own.



















gabriela ortiz clara a fascinating depiction of the 19th-century composer-pianist clara schumann’s inner life as imagined by one of mexico's leading contemporary composers.



















johannes brahms violin concerto a favorite of new jersey symphony audiences, vadim gluzman returns with his signature singing tone to play what brahms began as simply “a few violin passages,” but turned into one of the greatest of all concertos.

pytor ilyich tchaikovsky polonaise from eugene onegin a lavish ball scene, the dashing hero and heroine twirling in splendor—a fun, festive dance lifted from tchaikovsky’s opera.



billy childs diaspora
inspired by maya angelou and other poets, childs’ new concerto was written for the amazing steven banks, who says the music “follows the trajectory of the black experience from africa before slave trade to now, going forward in hope.”



















ludwig van beethoven symphony no. 9, “choral” the sheer volcanic power of beethoven’s music makes the ninth’s message soar. “brotherhood! joy!”—our world needs these clarion calls now more than ever.
