printer ink tips
when it comes to printer ink, we've been there, done that, now serving 200 tips in 13 categories ranging from buying ink cartridges to using toner.











											is there a way to print magnetic ink recognition for my business with my hp?
									 	

the troy font and toner kit for hp printers
if your office has a need for magnetic ink recognition printing (micr), rather than purchasing a separate printer with the capability, you may be able to upgrade. micr is the set of characters and symbols you see on financial institution documents and bank checks. hp printers can use the troy font and toner kit to perform micr type functions like printing checks or other financial documents. you can also switch back and forth between printing standard documents and those which require micr printing. the kit essentially provides you with the software for the necessary fonts, as well as a toner cartridge. the troy font and toner kit for hp printers is appropriate for schools, financial institutions and the publishing industry.

											how does the dell ink and toner management system work?
									 	

the dell ink and toner management system
if you're considering using dell products, you may have heard of their dell ink and toner management system. the dell ink and toner management system is dell's answer to keeping their consumers aware of ink and toner levels. the dell ink and toner management system operates so that you'll always be notified long before you run out of ink. you get notification of low levels of ink or toner in your machine. dell lets you go directly to the ordering page of your specific product so that you can replace your low ink or toner immediately. you'll be able to get a new cartridge before your old one runs out. this direct ordering system allows you to order straight from dell without the cost of a middleman markup. the toner and ink cartridges qualify as part of their recycle program, as well.

											is there a recycle program for epson toners?
									 	

the epson toner recycle program
if you're using epson toner, you can help the environment by participating in the recycle program. epson has a recycle program that is free of cost for its aculaser cx11n epson toner cartridges. all you have to do is go to the epson website and find the recycle program page. on the recycle program page, you can fill out a form to receive prepaid shipping labels to attach to your packaged, old epson toner. epson also offers a discount for the future purchase of their toner through their own website. 
if you're not a user of the aculaser cx11n epson toner series, you can still recycle items like printers, scanners and other hardware. epson is currently offering a $5 off discount that is good towards future purchases of items at the epson store for returning items though their recycle program.

											could my toner cause smearing on my printouts?
									 	

how to solve toner smears
if you're seeing toner smears on the edge of your printouts, you could have dirty media guides or other issues causing the faulty printouts. toner smears are easily correctable in some cases. to get your printouts looking crisp and clean again, there are a few tricks you can try with your toner. 
wipe the media guides clean of any dirt and debris with a dry cloth. make sure your cloth is free of lint before you clean out your media guides.check the type and quality of paper you're using, as certain media are prone to smearing.check the temperature of your fuser to make sure it's not too low. in your printer driver, make sure that you are matching the appropriate paper type with what your toner is printing on. choosing the wrong medium could cause toner smears.

											is there a way to fix faded prints without having to buy a new ink cartridge?
									 	

redistributing hp toner to correct faded prints
if your prints are coming out faint, it may be time to replace your hp toner. however, when time is tight and you need to finish a job quickly, you can attempt to redistribute your hp toner to finish the prints. the steps to redistribute the toner with an hp laserjet are below: 
first, open the printer door and remove the hp toner cartridge from the printer.hold the cartridge at each end and use a gentle motion to rock the cartridge from front to back.replace the cartridge in the hp laserjet and close the door. it's important not to expose the hp toner to prolonged light as this could cause damage to the unit. you can cover the cartridge with a piece of paper if you need to leave it out for more than a brief period.

											why do i get a low toner message after i’ve refilled my printer toner?
									 	

dealing with low toner messages after refilling printer toner
occasionally, you might find that after refilling printer toner, you still get a message that you have low toner. obviously, this shouldn't be the case if you don't have an empty toner cartridge. what sometimes happens is the printer doesn't have notification that it needs to restart its toner calculation. regardless of whether you're installing a cartridge after refilling printer toner or you're installing a new original manufacturer toner cartridge, you need to make sure your laser printer is getting the correct reading. the laser printer reads a chip to verify the toner level. if your refill cartridge lacks this element, you can still bypass the default system to get your laser printer to read the original chip. for specific instructions on circumventing the low toner message, consult your laser printer manual.
