how does dr dispatch work?
truck management software that’s easy to install and even easier to use.
after dispatching trucks for a decade, former diesel mechanic rick holland decided to start a brokerage. he then created a software solution to manage his own two-person brokerage and two-truck carrier company. dr dispatch truck management software has since grown to help countless other trucking industry professionals—and it’s still growing today.
