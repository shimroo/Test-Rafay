ccsf stories






 



 




community
last year, the rise media team focused on telling stories of our community of all-stars. from every constituent on campus, each one of these subjects had one thing in common: stellar attitude, leadership, vision, and inspiration. although this semester is not without its challenges and uncertainty, we wanted to kick of our virtual semester with a feel-good message from our all-stars that welcomes everyone back to what ccsf does with perfect certainty: community.

rise all-star student bryan daley
in a world that's full of politicians, finding a true leader can be challenging; not so, with our latest all-star, 2019-2020 student trustee bryan daley. prepare to be inspired by this wise, young leader and activist who is moving the needle on progress.

a good artist always comes out with something new
the main attraction here is the art teachers are awesome. if it's not good, they tell you and help you improve it. i love coming to city college.
