	 a day without electricity
	 
    

on sunday, i found out just how hard it was to live without electricity in my life.  without electricity, i woke up with the sun, because the sun was the only thing that provided light for me throughout the day because we were not allowed to have and open flame in the dorm.  when i first wake up, i automatically turn on the computer to check my email. i couldn't do that because it would be against my fast.  i had to eat raw foods because most of the meals in the dining hall were cooked using electricty.  i couldn't take a shower because i'm sure electricity was used to pump water to me.  so i was dirty throughout most of the day.  it was pretty boring in my dorm room without electricity because i couldn't watch tv or go online so i spent most of the day outside walking around.  when the sun set, i couldn't go back to the dorm because there would be lights on everywhere.  i realized how important of an infrastructure electricity is and how much we as humans have depended on it.  this fast helps me hold the amish or people in third world countries who live their whole lives without electricity in high reverence.

	 transportation fast
	 
    

it was pretty easy for me to not use a transportation vehicle in 36 hours.  i have not gone off campus since the weekend before last, and it easy for me to go everywhere on foot.  i am glad that there is food, shelter, entertainment, and education within walking distance on campus.  i think the uw is the perfect size for walking because if it was any bigger, i might have to use a bicycle to get to my classes.  i live in mcmahon and i have this one class at condon hall by lander which takes me about 15 minutes to walk.  i sometimes skip it because it is my first class in the morning and i don’t want to walk that far.  not using any transportation technology really gives me second thoughts on the places i want to go because distance is a big issue on foot.

	 welcome to the blog
	 
    

greetings all. this is group 3 for the blog assignment, and kira rombeau is the team lead for this blog.you will have weekly posting assignments for the blog as described in the syllabus. some weeks, the post will be about the readings, some weeks will be the technology fasts, and some weeks will be about other topics.for the week of october 17, please post (no more than 200 words) about your technology fast. since our current unit is about transportation, for this post you will either (a) try to abstain from using transportation vehicles or infrastructure for up to 36 hours, or (b) be conscious about what transportation vehicles and infrastructure you are using. i expect just about about everyone will do option b. the format of your post should be conversational, and we are interested in learning about what choices you make about using transportation options. remember that the goal of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to be thoughtful about your transportation choices. so, if you usually drive, but you choose to take the bus, tell us if that choice affected your schedule, what you choose to take with you, how you plan your overall day. if you  use your bicycle on the roads, tell us about how the road infrastructure affects your use of the bicycle. think about whether your use of transportation technologies is essential a matter of convenience. does where you live affect your available transportation choices? post the results of your technology fast by class on wednesday the 19th.
