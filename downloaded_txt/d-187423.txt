what clients are saying…

 











maggie + john
chad is the absolute best!!!! he is a fun and super sweet guy who puts you at ease immediately (which is so important!). he fit right in with my friends and family on my wedding day, and he made john and i feel so comfortable in front of the lens, and that definitely comes across in our photos. our photos turned out so beautifully; not only does chad have an amazing artistic eye, but he has a gift for capturing very real and genuine moments between people. like i said, chad is the best!!!! he was the most important and very best vendor we worked with. highly recommend!! one million stars!!!



 











carolyn + christian
we could not have asked for a better photographer! he really captured us at our absolute best! i was impressed with chad's ability to capture the candid moments without forcing us to do a lot of uncomfortable poses. he made us feel comfortable and brought out our fun sides! if you are looking for a wedding photographer i literally could not recommend anyone higher. i have already had more than one friend ask for his info after seeing our pictures. fantastic!
