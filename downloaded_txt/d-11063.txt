shasta's 'lakes'
more than meets the eye - shasta lake, keystone of the central valley 
      project, is the largest man-made reservoir in california. when full, its 
      365 mile shoreline exceeds that of san francisco bay. 
      
 shasta dam was constructed between 1935 and 1945, and the lake was filled in 1948.

       the construction of shasta dam impounded three major north state rivers: 
        the pit, mccloud, and sacramento. referred to as arms, each one retains 
        its own character, environment, history and recreation opportunities. 
       people who have never been to shasta lake may get the impression they 
        are seeing several lakes as they pass by on interstate 5. in a way, there 
        really are more lakes than one. 
       the rugged country, ragged shoreline, and sheer size of shasta lake 
        tends to break the lake into different areas, each with its own opportunities, 
        moods, and settings. 
       for more information or help, the shasta lake information center is 
        in mountain gate, telephone (530) 275-1589. 
       lakehead area(google map)
 the lakehead area, with its fast pace and easy access off interstate 
      
      
      
      
      

        5, offers a wide variety of services and recreation pursuits. it is convenient 
        for those planning a short visit or an extended stay. it is located near 
        a community which has many services. 
       from the antlers boat ramp or a number of marinas, skiing, houseboating 
        and fishing are easily accessible on the sacramento arm of the lake. 
       forest service and commercial campgrounds are available, or there are 
        resort cabins for rent. at lakehead you can choose between a campfire 
        supper, full course meal, pizza or burgers for dinner. 
       for a vacation full of variety and action, the lakehead area is a good 
        choice. 
       salt creek area(google map)
 salt creek is easily accessible from interstate 5 and wonderfully suited 
        to the overnighter, boater or fisherman. yet, it is not as active an area 
        as lakehead. 
       camping facilities range from a commercial recreation vehicle park to 
        the forest service drive-in or the more secluded walk-in camps. 
       the salt creek area is also the gateway to the gilman road area and 
        the mccloud arm of the lake. 
       gilman road area(google map)
 the gilman road exit off interstate 5 provides access to the mccloud 
        arm of the lake and a world removed from the noise and hurry of the freeway. 
        the forest service campgrounds here can best be described in one word 
        - relaxed. 
       the area boasts 5 family camps, several group camps, the dekkas rock 
        day-use lake access and picnic areas and launching at the hirz bay public 
        ramp. the gradual shoreline below most campgrounds makes moorage convenient. 
        complete boating services are available at the marinas in the o'brien 
        area to the south. boating, hiking, fishing, hunting and even spelunking 
        are popular activities in this area. 
       sold on the mccloud arm ---if so, here are two words of caution --- 
        supplies and bears.  keep food in secure containers inside vehicles: 
        clean tables thoroughly after meals; use garbage containers; and do not 
        feed or tease the bears. 
       o'brien area(google map)
 the o'brien area is at the hub of the lake and provides central access 
        to all arms. though rural in nature, the area offers a wide variety of 
        opportunities. each marina and campground appears isolated amidst the 
        thick oak and pine forests and the steep, rugged country. 
       the o'brien area is a sharp contrast to the lakehead area. although 
        both offer similar facilities and recreation choices, each is a unique 
        outdoor experience. at o'brien, there are resort/marinas, a public campground, 
        launch ramps and the lake shasta caverns tours. 
       jones valley area(google map)
 east of jones valley, on the pit arm, lies much of shasta lake's subtle 
        beauty. bald eagle, osprey, and sportsmen all fish together in the finest 
        bass habitat on the lake. here also, boaters discover wildlife, challenging 
        skiing, and solitude in its long, meandering coves. 
       forest service facilities include: the jones valley campgrounds, jones 
        inlet beach camping area  and the jones valley 
        public boat ramp. the two resort marinas have complete services. additional 
        stores, gas, restaurants, and taverns can be found nearby along bear mountain 
        road. 
       whether exploring, escaping, or improving skiing techniques, the jones 
        valley area is a good place to begin the adventure or end the day. 
       shasta dam area(google map)
 directly behind shasta dam is a wide basin formed by the confluence 
        of the sacramento and pit rivers. spectacular views of mt. shasta and 
        mt. lassen backdrop the steep shores and islands in this area. 
       although there are no overnight facilities near the dam, lodging is 
        available in the nearby communities. boats may be launched at centimudi 
        ramp, and services are available at several nearby resorts. 
      



where to go?
          it depends on what you want to do . . .

      there are literally hundreds of coves and bays within the 365-mile shoreline 
      of shasta lake. wooded flats, steep, rocky hillsides, secluded creeks, an 
      occasional waterfall, and thousands of acres of mountainous country surround 
      the lake. 
       a broad spectrum of facilities, ranging from primitive to luxurious, 
        supports the many, varied recreational opportunities offered. at the upper 
        end of the scale, there are 10 marinas and a number of resorts; most offer 
        rental cabins, motel-type accommodations, or trailer parks with hookups 
        and showers. 
       for the more independent visitor, the forest service manages 22 campgrounds. 
        these vary from vehicular campgrounds, which will accommodate trailers 
        up to 30' (no hookups), to walk-in camps; group camps which will accommodate 
        up to 120 people; and a special feature at shasta lake, boat-in campgrounds. 
        most campgrounds have piped water. some have flush toilets, but the majority 
        have pit or vault-type facilities. 
       shasta lake is one of the few in california where visitors can camp 
        along the shore. some areas are "restricted", such as a bald eagle or 
        osprey nesting site, but even so there are several hundred miles where 
        shoreline camping is permitted. 
       to assure that the privilege of camping along the shoreline is not lost, 
        help keep the area clean. pack it in, pack it out. please dispose of trash 
        at the boat ramps, and do not leave it at the floating toilets. 
       a campfire permit is required for building campfires or using gas or 
        charcoal stoves (such as hibachis) along the shoreline. this permit is 
        free and may be obtained from any forest service office. 
       deciding where to go and what to do at shasta lake can be a bewildering 
        and frustrating experience for a newcomer. the following information is 
        intended to serve as a guide to help you get around. more detailed information 
        and brochures are available at the shasta lake information center, and, 
        during the summer, from campground hosts at many of the national forest 
        campgrounds. 
       swimming
 shasta lake has no developed swimming areas. however, some of the resorts 
        do have pools. many people swim from the shore near their campgrounds 
        or from boats. during the summer, the water is comfortably warm; but visitors 
        are urged to avoid areas with heavy boat traffic. swimming is prohibited 
        at boat ramps. 
       hiking
 the trails at jones valley, packers bay, bailey cove, shasta dam and 
        hirz bay provide moderate hiking and good access to shoreline, fishing, 
        oak woodlands and occasional secluded creeks or vistas. since the summer 
        days are often hot and dry, be sure to carry water. better still, hike 
        trails when the weather is cool. hiking trails are generally open all 
        year. 
       lodging
 motel accommodations are available in the lakehead area and at bridge 
        bay. cabin accommodations are available at many resorts and marinas. 
       trailer camps
 hookups are available only at commercially operated campgrounds and 
        resorts. many forest service campgrounds will accommodate small trailers. 
        large trailers, 22-30 feet, are not advised in the bailey cove, jones 
        valley, lakeshore east or mccloud bridge campgrounds due to narrow parking 
        spurs. 
       tent camps
 shasta lake offers both conventional and walk-in camps. walk-in campgrounds 
        provide a central parking area, but equipment must be carried a short 
        distance to the campsite. the jones valley and lakehead areas are popular 
        with skiers, as are some of the camps on gilman road. fishermen often 
        prefer the quiet waters of the mccloud, off gilman road, or the back country 
        areas of the squaw and pit near jones valley. 
       boat access camps
 four campgrounds on shasta lake are accessible only by boat. these camps 
        have tables, stoves and toilet facilities (pit or vault). situated in 
        the more remote areas of the lake, these camps offer a unique camping 
        experience away from headlights and traffic. 
       picnicking
 picnic facilities are available at fisherman's point, near shasta dam; 
        bailey cove; and dekkas rock. each has tables, stoves, and restrooms. 
       boat launching
 the forest service maintains six public ramps, with parking areas, which 
        provide access to most areas around the lake. bailey cove, centimudi, 
        and jones valley ramps are often congested on summer weekends. packers 
        bay, antlers and hirz bay are recommended alternatives during periods 
        of heavy use. low water ramps are located at jones valley and centimudi. 
        additional launching facilities are available at the marinas. 
      waterskiing
 popular everywhere on the lake, the sacramento arm and jones valley 
        areas are particularly favored. the water is generally calm and ideally 
        suited to this sport. skiing can be hazardous in the pit arm where snags 
        and floating debris have not been removed. waterskiing is prohibited in 
        some of the smaller coves and bays; these areas are posted by buoys. 
      fishing
 everyone has a favorite "hole". the jones valley area provides the best 
        access to the pit and squaw arms - considered by many to provide the best 
        overall fishing. other popular spots are located where the major rivers 
        and streams empty into the lake, such as mccloud bridge, on the mccloud, 
        and riverview (lakehead) on the sacramento arm. 
      things to see and do around the lake
 shasta lake is one of the dominant features in northern california. 
        visitors can see the lake from antlers bridge, o'brien rest area, and 
        the pit river bridge on interstate 5. the three shastas - shasta dam, 
        shasta lake, and mt. shasta - can be seen from the shasta dam vista point. 
       operated by the united states bureau of reclamation, shasta dam provides 
        a variety of services including irrigation, power, and flood control. 
       shasta caverns began forming over 250 million years ago in the massive 
        limestone of the grey rocks visible from interstate 5. the caverns, located 
        off the shasta caverns/o'brien exit, are privately owned and tours are 
        offered year-round. 
       explore the natural and human history of shasta lake by taking a self-guided 
        nature trail. the hirz bay nature trail is located in the hirz bay campground, 
        and the samwel cave trail is located one mile south of the mccloud bridge 
        campground. 
      areas of historical significance
 interesting historical sites can be found throughout the area. for instance, 
        a trail blazed up the sacramento river by michael laframboise in 1834 
        later became the oregon trail. it was used extensively by traders, trappers, 
        and gold seekers before being improved to a stage road. in 1872, the central 
        pacific railroad followed the same route as far north as dunsmuir.

have a fun and safe visit to shasta lake.
boat safe and sober
swim safe and don't swim alone.
do not jump from houseboat to houseboat.
keep children well supervised and properly equipped with personal flotation devices.
boaters must watch for debris, underwater obstacles and shallow areas. most are not marked.
always remember to have an orange ski flag up when your riders are down in the water. watch out for other riders who are down in the water. also watch for ski ropes in the water.
don't ride on the bow of the boat (this includes patio boats).
remember light-colored clothing, hats, sunscreen, sunglasses and drinking water.
a beach towel for covering your legs from the sun works good, too.
make sure the water is clear of swimmers and all people are accounted for before starting or moving any boat.
buckle up and drive safely.
never leave children or pets alone in closed vehicles. california can get very hot. vehicles can become too hot for pets and people even with the windows open.

make sure your pets always have shade and fresh water.
it's a good idea to carry some drinking water in your vehicle for emergencies.
