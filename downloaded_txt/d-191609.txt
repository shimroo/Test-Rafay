palliative care aims to improve the quality of life for patients and families facing the problems associated with a life-limiting and/or life-threatening illness through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments and appropriate interventions.
end-of-life-care is care provided to patients and their families when they are approaching a period of time closer to death, which may be exemplified by an intensification of inter-disciplinary services and assessments such as anticipatory grief support, and pain and symptom management.
peolc is both a philosophy and an approach to care that enables all individuals with a life-limiting and/or life-threatening illness to receive integrated and coordinated care across the continuum. this care incorporates patient and family values, preferences and goals of care, and spans the disease process from early diagnosis to end of life, including bereavement.
