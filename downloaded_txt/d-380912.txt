nbc interview with mother, child, and inventor
i downloaded this video myself from the 
        seattle nbc king tv evening show in november, 2005.  it is 
        totally clean and has no bad software. it was produced by saint 
        bryan of king tv 5 in seattle, washington and kxas tv in dallas, 
        texas. it is 2025, twenty years later, and it is still the best alien abduction video on the internet. 







space shuttle video
the second video was made by a bay mounted camera on the space shuttle and was obtained by the freedom of information act.  it shows alien space craft  in a thunder storm over florida. 
 look and listen to the video as i tell you how to get the same video from nasa 
 for free so you can see and check its authenticity for yourself.
