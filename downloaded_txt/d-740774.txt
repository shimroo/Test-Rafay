extended
perceptual ability



to
explore and identify evidence of individuals who have demonstrated
certain exceptional super sensory, and
precognitive abilities.  since the cold war with the soviet
union
had come to an end, the united
states
endeavors to maintain parity with the ussr
in their research and development in remote sensing applications have
taken a back seat.  directors of the college have been contacted
by certain groups, whose congressional funding had been terminated, to
continue the
work and to develop an international fellowship.  


an
interactive website will be made accessible to prospective gifted
individuals to take
a  precognitive test, to determine their predisposition to certain
extended perceptual abilities.  this test was formulated through
the association with former para psychologist graduates of duke
university,  department of psychic research, as well
as, several government intelligence agents who have and continue to
work with remote sensing techniques.  


successful
candidates will then be contacted and further tests will determine
their specialty.  those candidates with the highest scores will
then form the nucleus of our fellowship society, similar to mensa international, who's only one
qualification for membership is to score in the top 2% of the
population on a standardized intelligence test.  this fellowship
will then offer its services to benefit humanity.







studies
in comparative religions


to
create among other curriculum a department that would feature studies
in comparative religions



to
invite authors, religious leaders of different faith from around the
world, including to participate in an open
discussion forum, with total audience participation.


these
discussions will be broadcasted simultaneously and interactively
on the internet by real time live video.  these videos will be
available on the college website library



to
have open chat rooms available world wide on the college website to
allow unrestrained and open dialog of free expression on religious
ideologies, philosophy, social values, ethics and morality from around
the world.

honorary doctorate degrees in theology will be issued to students who
submit for review a thesis on  comparative religion which
demonstrates a good knowledge of the three main world religions. 







theological
– archaeological museum




the
palm beach theological seminary college in collaboration with
archaeological discovery ventures llc would include a theological
archaeological
museum. 
a.d.ventures is world recognized for its discovery of hernan cortes
treasure featured on the cover of time magazine and a claimed as “the
greatest treasure ever found” 

 
the palm
beach
theological
seminary
college
has an exclusive proprietary association with archaeological discovery
ventures llc. through their founder victor
benilous who remains the president and ceo of a.d.ventures  and
the chancellor of the palm beach theological seminary college.






this
museums unique theme would emphasize the influence of religion, during
the early explorations of the americas and the
church's thirst for gold and hunger to indoctrinate the new world into
christian domination. this would be the only museum in the world that
would emphasize this theme.
