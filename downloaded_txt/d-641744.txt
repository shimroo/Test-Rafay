daniel caldwell
american, born 1962daniel's paintings have spontaneous brush strokes depicting subjects in a colorful impressionist style.  “i paint in response to beauty i see in life and want to share the joy of this journey in art." daniel grew up in miami florida. he spent his formative years sailing, fishing, and diving in biscayne bay and islamorada, florida keys. he started to draw and paint at a young age encouraged by his mother gigi who was an accomplished artist and interior designer. daniel fell in love with surfing at age 13. he dove into the emerging surf culture in the early 1970's. he pursued the surf passion attending high school in cape hatteras north carolina. there daniel was mentored by artist friends who lived simply in a small island community. this was an influential season as daniel developed an eye for sketching the commercial fisherman, rustic fish houses, and wooden boats. also he gained a heart for the historic coastal community and the wetlands. "i fell in love with the work of winslow homer's atlantic coast maritime subjects and his watercolors in the tropics. "in 1980 daniel moved to hawaii to attend college and earned a b.a. in art direction & advertising at the university of hawaii, manoa. at night he continued to hone drawing and painting skills at the honolulu academy of arts, a fine small museum with a surprising collection of masterworks. living on west coast had its regional art influence as well. daniel discovered the early california landscape painters and the contemporary works of wayne thiebaud and richard diebenkorn, members of the bay area figurative movement. "i was drawn to diebenkorn's 50's and 60's period of expressive confident brush strokes, layering of rich color and dynamic compositions. "  daniel returned to south florida in 1986 to work as an art director and vp of sales in his family's silk screen printing business which sold design and printing services to the cruise ship industry worldwide, professional tennis, world cup soccer and f1 racing.over the last 12 years daniel has moved his career into painting full time, working on figurative subjects, waterfront scenes and beach culture. he is also painting a series of works about life in out islands of the bahamas. daniel has a studio on eleuthera in the bahamas. the creative community there inspires much of his work. he is showing in art events in south florida and gaining gallery representation. his paintings are in private collections around the country and in the uk. he is also represented by the princess street gallery in harbour island, bahamas.  daniel is married to liz, a loving wife of 25 years and they have three children. "i am grateful to god for blessing me with this talent and the opportunity to have a career as an artist."web content provided by charles carey 2015. all rights reserved.

sally lawson
sally lawsonsally grew up in atlanta, georgia and have lived in richmond, virginia for 29 years. i have been married to my husband, fontaine, for 42 years and we have 3 children and 5 grandchildren...all in richmond!while i did not study art in college (i graduated as a registered nurse), i have always pursued creative things such as sewing, flower arranging, painting furniture, interior design and even cake decorating. i honestly feel like art found me! i started painting in 1995 without any formal training and continued to paint on my own for about five years.since that time i have studied with many richmond artists such as david tanner, jane joyner, laura loe, curney nuffer, marjorie perrin and david elsea. i have also studied with jill steenhuis from provence, and at la romita school in umbria, italy. i have learned something different from each one of them and have discovered that painting is an unending process of learning.i am drawn to many different subjects, but the common thread between them is color!! i use bright colors in my paintings and i find great satisfaction in the joy it brings my clients and me. i love the richness of oils and often paint with a heavily loaded brush or palette knife for texture. many of my paintings are of the landscape.i am constantly amazed at the beauty and intricacy of god's creation and i often ask for his guidance while i am painting. i have shown my work at arts around the lake at the university of richmond, crossroads arts center, cafe caturra, revival, artworks, fraiche and many other locations around richmond through the bon air artists association.currently, i am exhibiting and selling my work at princess street gallery in harbour island, bahamas, and in richmond at revival furniture consignment, janet brown interiors, and expression self and art.painting is my true passion and i consider it a privilege to pursue it throughout the rest of my life! i hope you enjoy viewing my paintings as much as i enjoy creating them.web content provided by charles carey 2018. all rights reserved.

joanne mcgovern
joanne mcgovernjoanne mcgovern has had a passion for art all her life.  canadian born and educated in toronto, ontario, joanne was prolific in the toronto art scene. with an early focus on figurative and still life painting, she later turned her attention to landscapes.  following in the footsteps of the canadian group of seven, she drew  inspiration from the natural beauty of georgian bay and killarney, ontario.  much of joanne's work was acquired by private homes and corporate offices in toronto.  she participated in several group shows and had her first major exhibition at the mcmichael art gallery in kleinburg, ontario.in 2004, joanne set off to travel the world with her paints and easel and became a full time artist.  during her travels, joanne was inspired by harbour island and in 2006, took up residence.  joanne continues to be captivated by the islands' light, colours and architecture, but  most of all, by the amazing spirit and character of the "briland" local people.  joanne's love of the island is reflected in her work.joanne is a plein air impressionist painter who's main influences include robert henri, claude monet, van gogh, and wolf khan.  you can find mcgovern's work in many harbour island residences, ocean view club, coral sands hotel and at the princess street gallery.   web content provided by charles carey 2018. all rights reserved.

jules duffy
jules duffy american - b. 1965“i often find myself in the moment thinking, how can i express on canvas?”jules duffy has been involved in the arts since childhood —drawing, photography, stained glass and painting, as well as interior design. those media all come together to influence her recent work.   through her photography background jules has developed a strong compositional acumen; one she feels is critical to her process.  while at school, she instituted a stained glass program and worked professionally in the field.  working with stained glass infused the importance of not only color but also the shapes themselves.  these elements are evident in her painting. after graduating with a fine arts degree from dickinson college in carlisle, pennsylvania, jules founded jules duffy designs, a successful interior design firm in madison, new jersey, where she is the principal designer. with over 30 years of experience, and a strong passion for color, jules finds oil painting to be the ideal pairing with her business.  “i paint to feed my soul and to leave a legacy on canvas of the remarkable world i experience. seeing the world through a colorful, painterly eye has given me a greater appreciation of my environment.   the play of light, color and composition will initially capture my attention, but the feeling i have about my subject will ultimately decide what i choose to paint.  i strive to engage the viewer into my work and give them a glimpse of the moment.”her body of work includes landscapes, seascapes, interiors and still life.jules can often be found near the ocean at her home in bay head, new jersey.  as an avid traveler, jules was especially captivated by harbour island, bahamas, over 15 years ago.  she returns regularly “to paint my happy place, renewing my energy.”  jules also spends time in maine where she has shown work at the david lussier gallery in kittery, maine.  she participates in the perkins cove plein air event, ogunquit, maine, annually.  jules is represented by the princess street gallery, harbour island.  her work is in private collections worldwide.

barbara young
photographerb. 1920barbara young took her first photographs in february 1958 with a browniecamera while visiting harbour island in the bahamas. when her photographer brotherarthur saw them he said,barbara, you've got the eye! but you need a better camera.within two years her photographs were in the permanent collections of the museum ofmodern art in new york and the baltimore museum. today her work is represented in anumber ot museums and in many private collectionsrecently she has been recognized as one of the earliest pioneers of color artphotography and a champion ot that medium to museums in an era when conventionalwisdom insisted that only black-and-white images deserved to be called art. herphotographs - both those that feature nature and landscape subjects and her deeplyhumanistic essays on the isiand peoples of the caribbean -display the elegant andprecise use of light and color to evoke a mood that eventually won over even the mostdetermined skeptics.glen mcnatt,art critic for the baltimore sun april 11,2007.) inapril 2o08 her work was included in an exhibition at the university of maryland baltimorecounty paradoxes of modernism" along with 78 of the most important photographersfrom the 1920s to the 1970s.young returned to harbour island every year for 40 years both to rest from herbusy life as a psychiatrist and to take photographs.she took pictures ot the people whichshe gave to her subjects in the days before they had cameras.she recorded weddings.funerals, the first visit of the prime minister after bahamian independence in 1973, aswell as the men at work on land and sea, the women weaving and selling their strawwork, and the children at play.but she is best known tor her studies of the clear light and shadow on thevillage houses and her images of the beach and sea.tom beck, curator of photographyat umbc,wrote at the time of her retrospective in 1987.barbara young's photographspossess not only an uncomplicated beauty. but also a rich personal quality....[her] visualinsight into herself and the world....there is a primordial biblical quality in many of theimages....the frequent use of metaphor endows barbara young's photographs with anundertone of mystery....

tim forman
tim is an impressionist landscape artist. he enjoys oil painting on canvas with both brush and knife. through his work, tim seeks to lift the spirits and inspire awe above our day-to-day lives.“as you can see, i like to paint clouds and water.”born in 1986, tim grew up in sunny south florida. some of his favorite past times are the beach, fishing in biscayne bay with his dad, and stargazing. he first picked up the brush at nine years old under the instruction of peter olsen. during these formative years, he learned to paint what he observed.“my dad and grandfather were the ones who encouraged me to keep painting through my teenage years.”by 17 years of age, tim was receiving the occasional commission. at one point he worked in acrylics but soon switched back to the oils to which he was accustomed. it was at this time that he discovered the works of florida landscape artist, a. e. backus. tim greatly admired backus’s work and began taking note of his interpretation and style. “backus really trained my eye for landscape and composition. i think he’s one of the best.”tim is primarily a self-taught artist. his work is the result of dedicated practice. he has learned the indispensability of observation and hard work. “i try to learn about what i’m painting. that helps me paint better. i also read and learn from other artists, implementing what works and disregarding what doesn’t. i have to keep learning and growing as an artist.”tim’s painting process begins with observing the beauty of nature. he uses field sketches, plein air paintings, and photographs to compose his pieces. in the studio, tim composes and edits his ideas. painting in layers with both knife and brush, he creates his landscapes to portray the splendor and simplicity of the natural world around us.in recent years, tim has moved his painting into the public art scene. although he is new to the world of art, he has bright prospects for his professional career as a fine artist. “i enjoy painting and i know that it is a wonderful gift. i hope to share it with others.”tim has a vibrant and sincere faith, which gives him purpose and wonder in his art. he says, “i enjoy the beauty of nature because it points me to the one who created everything. stars, clouds, water, and wind all give a glimpse into the imagination of god. to him, i am most thankful.”

stacey lawrence
artist’s statementi find it fascinating to explore where intentional and experimental efforts merge. i have found that by relinquishing control and momentarily detaching, my creative process is heightened and my artistic expression is honest. it is this combination of certainty and unexpectedness that lures me to create and defines my relationship with my art.

michel brosseau
french, born 1954michel brosseau was born in nantes and lived in bordeaux for many years. both cities are on the atlantic coast of france and have rich maritime histories, highlighted by prosperous trade with the west indies in the 18th century. “the scent of cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon still vaguely hangs in these ports today,” says brosseau. the french artist is known for his nautical paintings and draws inspiration from his childhood memories. “i strolled the docks between the sugar and rum warehouses,” he says. “and i think it’s this nostalgia for a traditional sea lifestyle that used to fascinate me and still does.”brosseau’s education is atypical for a painter—he studied political science as an undergraduate and received a master’s degree in law. although he painted during and after his years at school, he worked as a journalist and a political activist upon graduating. he could not stay away from his true passion for long, however, and eventually returned to painting full time.from a young age, the sea captivated brousseau. “my first paintings were devoted to maritime themes mixed with surrealism,” he says. paintings from his teenage years depict flying boats or parting waters, like the iconic scene from cecil b. demille’s 1956 film “the ten commandments.” as brosseau developed, his style moved closer to realism. his oil paintings have a distinct look—graphic and contemporary—that he uses to explore the philosophical implications of marine life. “the fascinating part of the sea is that it’s a total and paradoxical universe,” brosseau says. “there is always the fascination with going out to sea and the anticipation of returning to port.”while his style is consistent, brosseau experiments with different techniques and themes. he rarely paints open seascapes and his canvases frequently include animate and inanimate symbols of the nautical world—toiling sailors, faded buoys with chipped paint, weather-battered rowboats. “maybe i prefer the maritime places, objects, and artifacts of the sea culture to the sea itself because i can tame and control them,” brosseau says. at the heart of his work is an awareness of the austerity of life—at sea and ashore—and the different ways humanity reacts to nature.“i found this a bit in martha’s vineyard,” he says, “this opposition between the palladian refinement of 18th century new england architecture and the odds and ends of menemsha harbor.” when brosseau first visited the vineyard he was struck by the diverse wealth of scenery the island presents to a painter. “whatever the topic, there is always an atmosphere to be captured,” he says. inspired by the vineyard’s majestic sailboats, tranquil harbors, and quaint landscapes, brosseau began a series of paintings dedicated to the island’s nostalgic charm. his work has been featured at the eisenhauer gallery in edgartown since the summer of 2006.later on, brosseau stumbled upon harbour island, bahamas, often referred to as the martha’s vineyard of the tropics, and fell in love with the historic seafaring dunmore town which was founded in 1648 and for centuries was a ship building capital for the region. there he found no shortage of fresh inspiration and returns often to paint. since 2012 his work has been featured at princess street gallery on harbour island, bahamas. he is also a featured artist at catharine miller gallery in london.web content provided by charles carey 2018. all rights reserved.

emily buchanan
emily buchanan was born in beverly farms, massachusetts. she began painting as a child with her grandmother, eloise gardner on the north shore of boston. emily attended middlesex school, and bates college. she later studied painting at lyme academy, the national academy of art, and with the boston school painter paul ingbretson. buchanan works primarily around her native new england when weather permits, painting regularly in northeast harbor, maine, martha's vineyard, nantucket, squam lake in nh, and the adirondacks. in winter, she paints in palm beach, fl, malibu, ca, and the bahamas. buchanan did the painting for the official 2014 white house holiday card, and architectural digest called it "exquisitely rendered". main street magazine said that "she is one of those rare breed of artists who truly speak in a visual language taken directly from life".perhaps the most meaningful quote, however, was from quest magazine. quest said that "her paintings bring all of those wonderful places, and the emotions that they evoke, to those who can't be there".she is represented by mark murray fine art in ny, ny, as well as other galleries on the east coast, and by the princess street gallery on harbour island in the bahamas. her work is widely collected in private and corporate collections.

stephen scott young
american, born 1957in 1985, florida artist stephen scott young won first prize in watercolor in american artist's national art competition. since then his career has flourished and his paintings have met with critical acclaim.people compare young with artists of the past, such as winslow homer. that comparison is accurate, but young's primary influences go back even further, to the old masters. the first two artists who captivated him were vermeer and caravaggio; when he first started painting he was given picture books about their work.after graduating from high school, young studied for three years at the ringling school of art in sarasota, florida, where he concentrated on printmaking. he began working with watercolor as early as 1976, but his mature style emerged in the mid-1980's. from that point his work has developed surprisingly smoothly, toward ever-increasing depth of space and ever-greater facility in handling the human figure.his paintings show that he has looked closely at the watercolors of both winslow homer and thomas eakins, the two greatest american realists of the 19th century. young's subject matter is to that of homer, who also visited the bahamas and made paintings of black models. in fact, a few of young's paintings are a virtual recreation of homer's compositions.for his sense of dramatic design and luminous, clear color, young perhaps owes most to homer. his execution, however, is essentially different and is influenced more by eakins, who built up his watercolors in a more constructed fashion with careful stippling. eakins taught him, as it were, to draw with watercolor. young owes his careful accuracy and his ability to create figures that are not simply flat but have volume and weight to eakins.a virtuoso realist in the classic tradition, stephen scott young remains an anomaly on the modern scene. major collectors avidly seek his watercolors, but for the most part they are enthusiasts of 19th-century painting who hang his works beside those of the great realists of that century, such as homer and eakins. it is impressive, of course, that young's paintings can survive this stern test and hold up with the best painting of the american past. in some ways, however, this classic character of scott's work has led critics to miss its present-day relevance.young's paintings are not simply nostalgic but address the concerns of contemporary life. visually, they possess an indisputably modern abstract power of design. thematically, they deal with issues of race and human dignity that are particularly troubling and pertinent to the current american social condition.scott young has had many one man exhibitions:the john surovek gallery, palm beach the norton gallery of art, west palm beach, florida the hunter museum of art, chattanooga, tennessee the greenville county museum of art, greenville, south carolina museum of fine arts, st. petersburg, florida the arkansas arts center, little rock, arkansas the butler institute of american art, youngstown, ohio jacksonville art museum, jacksonville, floridathe princess street gallery, harbour island, bahamasthe rich gallery, london, englandweb content provided by charles carey 2015. all rights reserved.

christopher crofton atkins
christopher crofton-atkins first learned to sketch from his father in lima, peru. living on the pacific coast, his earliest work recorded the local imagery with charcoal and watercolor. a love of the outdoor life marked him from childhood when he would hunt duck and dove with his father on the coastal savannahs, and fish for jack and corvina off the beaches near lima. his earliest sights and sounds were viewed through the prism of a latin world. it was a young, unspoiled world, full of empty shorelines teeming with bird and sea life. formal schooling took christopher to england, from where he traveled extensively throughout europe. there he developed an interest in oil painting and was tutored privately at a studio in london. he pursued his interest in oil painting at university in canada under the direction of john goodwin lyman. lyman, formerly the art critic for the montrealer, had founded the contemporary arts society of montreal. lyman was a mentor for christopher's love of painting the tropics. he encouraged christopher to continue painting what lyman liked to call "god's own sea and sky," a world which he had found in the caribbean islands. christopher continues to paint in lyman's tradition on location, and in his studio on martha's vineyard.

americanabout the artist (by the artist)at 67 i am back to my roots: my father at his drawing board, my high school art award at graduation in 1966, and a scholarship at the university of buffalo in fine arts.but it was the ‘60’s, and i had better break out! down to nyc and selling ties in bergdorf goodman to get my body in motion in another world. and suffice it to say that the last three decades gave me other artistic outlets. modeling in nyc and paris lead me to acting study with lee strasberg and stella adler. i was so green that i didn’t know the historic importance of the group theater and the actors studio. but i studied and made my way as an actor from ny to la during the 70’s and 80’s. by the early 90’s i had moved to the east end of long island, ny with my husband and began careers in documentary filmmaking, photography, and the parenting of christian and molly. in 1996 i was one of the co-founders of the elementary hayground school in bridgehampton, ny. my husband and i were particularly proud of helping to create an artistic, multicultural environment for our kids and the entire community of the east end. whenever i captured a sense of place, i pulled out my paintbrushes and some new watercolor paper. the fields and sea of sagaponack inspired me to paint during those beautiful days. i am now settled in pomfret, vermont. my husband sam neustadt, a renowned architect and master finish carpenter, and i built a very small “farmhouse” in pomfret, vt. and i have felt the sun on my skin as i painted from the back of my open car, and had my watercolors freeze on the brush, as it reached the paper in early december in the green mountains. i love en plein observation of the light and am having trouble going inside. but a home studio awaits us as well.my goal now is to settle into a regular practice of painting. anywhere we go in this world. brenda web content provided by charles carey 2016. all rights reserved.

michael hayes
americanmichael hayes discovered harbour island, bahamas many years ago. and in a short time, established himself as an important local artist. he paints the people of the island using the traditional techniques of the the oil painter. his canvases are large and arresting. the figures depicted are life-size. obvious influences are the masters rembrandt, velazquez and carravagio. like them, his paintings demonstrate accurate draftsmanship, dramatic lighting, rich saturated colors and expressive brushwork. he has obviously studied their work very closely. more importantly, hayes' paintings, like the masters, reveal a deep psychological insight into his subjects.hayes hails from the artists' community of eureka, northern california where he is a leading painter and instructor. he has mastered most genres of painting including still life and landscape. but he is, perhaps, best known as a portrait painter. he has many commissioned portraits to his credit, including notable figures such as boxer joe frazier and football hall of famers ronnie lott, dave casper and jim otto.as an instructor, he emphasizes a classical approach to painting passed down from the great realist painters of the past. he has taught throughout the world including portugal, paris and tokyo.web content provided by charles carey 2016. all rights reserved.

american, born 1962artist statementmy first thought when i start a new piece is not about capturing the image as it is, but more so about creating a mood and figuring out the aspects of how i am going to achieve a desired effect.  the color and brightness that i choose bring dimension to the surface, drawing the viewer into that particular piece. i want my surface to be stimulating, engaging the viewer to look closely and have fun with the art.    i am not afraid to use color.  when i am working, i look for patterns and colors that might not necessarily “jibe” in the eyes of most people, but creative juxtaposition is what inspires me.   many of my images are slices of life and are a result of my own past experiences that i connect with.  i am drawn to using retro imagery for the fact that it represents a fleeting era of simplicity while also being humorous and slightly ironic.     my process is mixed media using photos, collage materials and other fine art processes to achieve the desired effect and mood.   using these mediums affords me the freedom to experiment.  when i work, i am constantly layering and adding various elements to my piece, building up textures and colors.  i start with a drawing, and then decide how i want the work to feel but more often than not, the mood changes and i end up with a piece that is unexpected.    this for me is what i enjoy. i feel blessed that i am able to create and express myself and it is a gift that i never take for granted.  “one eye sees, the other feels”-paul kleeweb content provided by charles carey 2015. all rights reserved.
