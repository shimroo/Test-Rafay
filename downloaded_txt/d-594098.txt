happy black history month! what a month it has been for black history making already! there is no questioning the fact that black folx have had an incredible impact and influence on every aspect of history, and that is exemplified by this playlist of creators making music for children and families. this playlist is over 5 hours long but could easily be infinite. please share this with your networks and young people and maybe discover some new artists or just sit in awe with the incredible music being created by black family music artists.

"i'm really excited that my peers in the recording academy voted for my album 'world wide playdate' to join the ranks of the other great albums in the best children's music album category. i'm ecstatic for the kids who appeared on the album, including the genesis academy cheer squad from my hometown of atlanta, ga, my niece and god-daughter. as an independent artist, i'm happy that the nomination helps expose the album to more people. i believe in the messages on this album so as people discover divi roxx kids, i hope the music touches the hearts of kids and the kid in everyone."

diversity and inclusion
cmn stands in solidarity with the black lives matter movement across the world. we are committed to cultivate a welcoming and affirming space, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in our organization and the world at large. we recognize the positive power of music to shape children’s sense of fairness and justice, to teach the enormous importance of often-marginalized cultures to our music traditions, and to amplify the voices of bipoc (black, indigenous and people of color), lgbtqi+ communities, and people of all abilities. we pledge to lead with humility, to continue our advocacy and support our members in theirs.learn about cmn's guiding principles and community agreements
