history 



the center for behavioral neuroscience was established in 1998 by a grant from the robert w. woodruff foundation. in november 1999, the center became one of the national science foundation’s science and technology centers and expanded to include seven institutions in atlanta, georgia (georgia state university, emory university, georgia institute of technology, morehouse school of medicine, and the three schools in the atlanta university center: clark atlanta university, morehouse college, and spelman college) and other community partner organizations.
the cbn’s original scientific focus was the neuroscience of social behaviors in the areas of affiliation, aggression, fear and reproduction and the emotional and regulatory processes that underlie them. in the intervening years, inclusion of additional behavioral neuroscientists at the participating institutions resulted in an expansion of the cbn’s activities into the areas of memory, cognition, reward functions of the brain and positive emotional states. that process continues today as the cbn responds to the changing landscape of neuroscience and the evolving needs of its member institutions.
