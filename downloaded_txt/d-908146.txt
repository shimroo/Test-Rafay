bohica sessions
hi friends, fans & neighbors!  since the last update, we've survived the great texas ice age.  there is something horribly wrong with waking up one morning and discovering that the temperature
 is -4f.  that's minus four.  we didn't care for it much either and we were certainly happy to thaw out and get back to normal weather.  that was just freakin' weird, man.

after the great thaw, we got right back to work on the next release of the bohica series.  bohica xxi!

xxi features five brand new songs from the bohica folk as well as a couple of tunes from the archives.  as always, bohica showcases the writing talents of amos staggs, earl musick and mark merritt.  
some seriously cool (and deep) tunes with this volume, and we're really pleased with it.  we hope (and think) you agree.

so, please have a listen, download, copy and share with family, acquaintances, friends (real or imaginary.) remember, it's f'n free! 
stay safe, wash your hands and as always... peace.
- the bohicans.

click on the bohica image above (or below) to go to the bohica session site.  or you can simply go to www.bohicasession.com.  listen to the tunes, download 'em, share 'em, burn 'em, pirate them - it's entirely* up to you.  sky's the limit, here.  but the basic gist is listen to it - like it?  share it! repeat.  hey, it's fnfree.

bohica xxii is up next! rock on.


#bohica #fnfree 
peace!
