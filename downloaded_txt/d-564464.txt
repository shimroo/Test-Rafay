gallery organization
the contents of each shop is the complete responsibility of that artist and although every attempt is made to insure that every member of this gallery is of the highest integrity it not our intention to be censors or babysitters. art is an individual thing and what appeals to one may not appeal to all. the entry page for each artist will contain a summary of the type of art they produce. if what is described is not to your taste please return to the gallery page and choose a different artist.
