our satisfied members







 we choose hvcc over 35 years ago because of the location, amenities that were offered to fit our needs, and because word of mouth was that “hidden valley country club was the best in the area“ when we moved here from virginia beach. those words are so true!
trish rappold 





 what initially drew us to hidden valley was being able to play the best golf course in the roanoke valley and enjoy time at the pool. however, we have found it has also been a wonderful place for us to meet new people, eat delicious food, host gatherings for our closest friends and family, and enjoy a variety of other events! hidden valley is the perfect place for our growing family!
