											hawaiian music 

								is native to the
									islands of hawaii located in the united states of america. this includes free
									hawaiian music, hawaiian ukulele songs, hawaiian luau music, iz, over the
									rainbow, hawaiian song lyrics, and free hawaiian music mp3. the history of 
											
												traditional hawaiian music

popular
												hawaiian songs

									including: 
hula
													music


luau
													music 
, 
											"native hawaiian ritualized dance", mele "native
												chanting",
											
"hawaiian reggae music"

											and
												paniolo, or
												
"hawaiian country music" 
.the three most predominant instruments played in
													hawaii and used in both early and modern day local performances
													are the "steel guitar", "slack key guitar" and the
													"ukulele" because of hawaii's lack of metals and minerals
													other than volcano lava, musical instruments were created from
													trees, plants and shells. the basic instruments of hawaii
													included the "ipu", a drum made out of a gourd,
													the "ipu heke", a double gourd drum, the "kala'au",
													sticks that were struck together, the 'ili 'ili,
													two flat smooth stones that were clicked together,
													the "ohe hano ihu", a nose flute made from wood,
													the "conch shell", a large ocean shell that was blown
													into to produce deep resonant tones, the "pu ohe", a
													trumpet made of bamboo, and the "puili",
													slit sticks made from bamboo. these were the
													instruments of ancient hawaiian times, and are still used
													today in modern hawaiian music as well as in

																			major music festivals in hawaii
																		include the merrie
																				monarch hula festival, which
																		brings together hula groups from across the
																		world, as well as a number of slack-key and
																		steel guitar festivals such as the: big
																			island slack key guitar festival,
																		steel guitar association festival and the
																		gabby pahinui and atta isaacs slack key
																			festival. april's aloha week is a
																		popular tourist attraction, as is the
																		moloka'i music festival held around labor
																		day. there was also a hawaii international
																		jazz festival, which ran from 1993 until
																		2007. the annual pacific rim jazz festival
																		occurs in mid-autumn at the hawaii
																		convention center. the annual manoa jazz &
																		heritage festival takes place in early
																		autumn at the andrews amphitheatre on the
																		university of hawaii at manoa campus. hawaii
																		is home to a number of renowned music
																		institutions in several fields. the honolulu
																		symphony orchestra is an important part of
																		the state's musical history and is the
																		oldest orchestra in the united states west
																		of the rocky mountains, founded in 1900. the
																		orchestra has collaborated with other local
																		institutions, like the hawaii opera theatre
																		and the oahu choral society, which sponsors
																		the honolulu symphony chorus and the
																		honolulu chamber choir. hawaiian folk
																			music includes several varieties of
																		chanting (mele) and music meant for
																		highly ritualized dance (hula).
traditional
																					hawaiian music

																		and dance was
																			functional, used to express praise,
																			communicate genealogy and mythology, and
																			accompany games, festivals and other
																			secular events. the hawaiian language
																			has no word that translates precisely as
																			music, but a diverse vocabulary exists
																			to describe rhythms, instruments,
																			styles, and elements of voice
																			production. hawaiian folk music is
																			simple in melody and rhythm, but is
																			"complex and rich" in the "poetry,
																			accompanying mimetic dance (hula), and
																			subtleties of vocal styles... even in
																			the attenuated forms in which they
																			survive today".

																		
																			today's more "contemporary
																					hula music",
																				
"hawaiian
																							ukulele songs" 

																				and "luau
																							music" 
																					include a
																						blend of various ethnic
																						traditions including;
																						island rock, pop,
																							soul and hawaiian
																								reggae
																								music. the

																													though

													statehood day commemorates hawaii's admission as a state
													on august 21, 1959. in 1898 the united states annexed
														hawaii, which was declared as a necessary navy base for
													the conduct of the spanish-american war. the united
													states interests coveted the islands for some time. during world
													war ii, oahu served as the command post for the us operations in
													the pacific. large portions of hawaii were turned over for the
													us military bases. after the war, two-thirds of the residents
													favored statehood. however, because of the many ethnicities
													present, there was resistance to hawaii's statehood from
													the segregated southern states. a primary election took place in
													hawaii on june 27, 1959, and various statehood propositions
													received many votes on that day. following the certification of
													the election results, president eisenhower signed a
													proclamation on august 21, 1959, declaring hawaii to be the
														50th state. this was known as admission day until 2001
													and is now known as "hawaii
															statehood day" .
