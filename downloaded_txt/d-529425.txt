powering sustainable rail: an insider’s look at the evolution of trip optimizer™

it all started in 2005. a research and development team was working on the concept of a battery-electric locomotive. to support this effort, a group of engineers was studying driving patterns of train operators to understand what it would take to charge and discharge a battery-operated locomotive. in doing so, they discovered that there was an enormous amount of variation between one operator and the next. the recognition of this variation in driving patterns had two impacts: first, it made the regenerative braking models...

smart hpt: a brilliant way to save fuel and reduce emissions

in the journey to higher levels of fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions, control of horsepower per ton (hpt) is essential here’s why: horsepower demands vary based on train make-up, terrain, and other operating conditions. when railroads build trains, they need to make sure that they have enough locomotive power to get over the steepest grade (ruling grade) on the route. what typically happens, however, is that the ruling grade is just one small segment of an entire trip...

next generation distributed power: activating the future of freight rail through enhanced communications

wabtec’s locotrol® distributed power system was launched over fifty years ago and during that time has become the leading control and communication system, enabling coordinated braking and traction power distribution between lead and remote locomotives on over 21,000 locomotives in 17 countries. the locotrol system has the unique distinction of enabling the operation of the world’s longest and heaviest train – approx. 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) long, weighing 99,732 tons, with 8 locomotives hauling 682 ore cars...
