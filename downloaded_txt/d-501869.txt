misclassification suit


 the builders association of minnesota (bam) has filed a federal court injunction against a newly passed misclassification bill affecting construction businesses. bam argues the legislation, scheduled for march 1, 2025, is overly broad and violates constitutional rights and labor laws. the bill’s 14-factor test for worker classification is criticized as vague and disruptive to industry norms, potentially increasing home costs. bam seeks to protect minnesota’s construction sector and homebuyers through legal action, aiming to suspend the bill pending court review. president dale juntunen asserts the lawsuit’s goal is to prevent harmful impacts and secure industry rights in minneapolis’s us district court. learn more.
