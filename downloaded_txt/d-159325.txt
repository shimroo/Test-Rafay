how do league participants retrieve their own password?how do league participants retrieve their own password?
lost password?

enytb.com has a self-retrieve function that enables users to retrieve their own password at any time. this is true for club level log-ins as well as team level and player level log-ins.

to retrieve your own password:

open the log-in page by clicking the orange rectangular button located om the right hand side of the main menu bar located at the top of the page. a pop-up will appear (modal). click on the hyperlink that says "lost password?";enter your enytb registered email address; and,click the button to retrieve your password.the system will instantly email your password to your registered email address.

note1: if there is more than one button it means your email address is registered for more than one password. for example, you may be a coach on two different teams, possibly a fall and a summer team or two summer teams. your son may be registered under the same email address. you may have more than one son playing in the league at the same time, on the same or different teams. whatever the reason, simply click the button that is applicable to the user type and team that you are seeking.

note2: if you get a message stating that you aren't a registered user, the system is telling you that it does not recognize the email address you have entered. this would happen if you have multiple email address and are entering a different email address from what you are registered under in the system. it could also mean you have typed in your email address incorrectly or that it was originally entered incorrectly to the system. if you believe it to be the latter, please contact league admin via the helpdesk for assistance.
