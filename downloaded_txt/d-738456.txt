 beware pentheus! originally uploaded by goggledog. blessed is he who, being fortunate and knowing the rites of the gods, keeps his life pure and has his soul initiated into the bacchic revels, dancing in inspired frenzy over the mountains with holy purifications, and who, revering the mysteries of great mother cybele, brandishing the thyrsos, garlanded with ivy, serves dionysus!
