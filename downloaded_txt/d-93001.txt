magnolia pancake haus
family owned and operated since 2000  & serving san antonio’s best breakfast featuring our"world's best buttermilk pancakes"









"the haus rules"
we live by them so we can serve you the best experience possible...~we will text you when your table is ready.~we don't take reservations or call ahead requests-first come, first served.~we seat only complete parties when we can see that everyone is present.~if you are not able to arrive within five minutes of your seating notification, your name will be removed from the list, but don't worry! you will be eligible for our next available table upon your return.~last, but most important...it's not our fault that your "slacker" friends can't show up on time.
