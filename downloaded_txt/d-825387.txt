sw0rds
and knives
i
began making knives in the early seventies and in the early eighties i met
yoshindo yoshihara a japanese swordsmith.  i worked with him during some of
the times he was here in texas along with another smith named nakagawa from the
kansai area of japan.  while i still occasionally make swords they are more
a personal thing and i do not take orders for them.  the sword section is
just to show some of my work or if i happen to have one i would like to sell i
will put it there.  
 
my
main goal is to create and sell a line of fine woodworking tools.
at
present i have a wide assortment of knives patterned after those used by violin
bowmakers and japanese sword scabbard makers.  prices and configurations
can be seen under woodworking
tools. see at right.

woodworking
tools
i
 have owned and played fiddles for many years now.  the fact that i don't
do it very well does not diminish my enjoyment of it.  i have great respect
for the men and women who craft these instruments.  i even attended the
bowmakers school at the university of new hampshire one year.  haven't made
a bow yet but came away with some good ideas for knives.  i have also been
fortunate enough to work with shirasaya makers.  these artisans craft the
wooden scabbards for nihonto or japanese swords.  they had some great tools
also.
 
these
tools are suitable for all types of woodworking.
 
this
will be my main product offering for the foreseeable future. 
 

 
i
have been known to make planes as well.  they too will become part of my
product offering.




bladesmithing
this
section is devoted to exploring the art of bladesmithing.  there are things like
making charcoal, building a traditional japanese forge and box bellows and the
like.
 




violins
(fiddles)
as
i said i like fiddles.  from time to time i may have one or more for sale
here.
 
 
 






 





so,
welcome to twin oaks forge.  wander
through here and if you have any questions or just want to say hello give me a
holler.







over the years that this site has been up i have made it free for the taking. however, now i would like to spend more time on it and add more information. and as we all know time is money. so if you find some value here please make a donation. thank you for your support.
