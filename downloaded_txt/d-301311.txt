brendan was very helpful when we were moving out. he quickly set up an inspection (over the weekend, which was a big help), and he didn't ding us for small issues after 7 years in our apartment. laurel was also helpful in taking care of a couple of maintenance issues that popped up over the course of the past year.— jordan b.

i lived in a small rental apartment in mission/sf where laurel realty took over as the apartment managers a few months after i moved in. during my 1.5 years living there when laurel realty managed the small complex, i found jeff and the team to be responsive to my maintenance needs: replacing my kitchen sink drain, unclogging my bathroom drains when needed, and sending a pest control person. when i moved out, laurel realty quickly scheduled a move-out inspection and refunded my security deposit right away. i know that each tenant can have a different experience with their apartment management company. for my part, i had a pretty decent experience with laurel realty.— alan h.

i would like to thank jeff & jim appenrodt for their outstanding expertise in handling the sale of my home. i bid on a house out of town & had a 30 day close which means i had to sell my house with a 21 day close to make the deal work. no problem was jeff & jim's response! a open house was set up in 4 days later & the house was sold the following day. call laurel realty did everything possible such as advertising in local papers, internet & personal references without any out of pocket cost. they worked with both mortgage companies to insure that the deal would go through without a glitch. they constantly kept me updated with all of the issues at hand to keep me calm & secured. it's very stressful buying a house especially with these circumstances. i will never again put my business in the hands of amateurs, i will go with the pros at laurel realty. thanks again jeff & jim appenrodt. — robert d.

i recently started renting from laurel realty in november. i recently had an emergency at my apartment involving a huge mess that was out of my control. i called jeff and he sent someone over within 20 minutes. i couldn't have been more relieved. i've never had a landlord that responded that quickly. thanks guys! — ellen h.

in the spring of 2014, we needed assistance in renting our flat in sf. our last property manager had become very undependable. to our relief, jeff appenrodt of laurel reality came highly recommended. my mom and i met with jeff in his office and very pleased with his professionalism and high level of knowledge regarding landlord and tenants rights in sf. also, jeff found several good applicants to rent the flat. he assisted us with the rental agreement for the new tenants and handled the on boarding process efficiently. jeff also mentioned there is someone available 24 hours to answer the phone in case of an urgent issue. overall, we were very pleased working with jeff and look forward to working with him and the agency in the future. — roselle b.

i've been renting a wonderful flat through laurel realty over a year now. for those that have been living in sf or looking for apartments, it has definitely been a rough renter's market. jeff appenrodt, however, has been someone that i've grown to trust as someone who did not treat me as a tenant in this market, but as a person. the apartment is immaculate and has been well-kept. he is professional, although the lease is definitely in the owner's favor. he returns calls within 15 minutes, and has never failed to act on a repair within 1-2 business days. he does have a laid-back attitude, but he has come through for me every time i've called him. he is always to the point. the reason i'm writing this review is that i had moved out of the apartment two months earlier from when the lease expired (to help accommodate a life a change). after two months, unexpectedly, my living situation had to transition, and i needed to find a new place. rather than markup the price of the rent (similar units had gone up $600-800/mo) during the time i lived in my old place, he had actually held the unit for me (working with the owner) so that i could move back into my old apartment, at my old rent. during a difficult moment, in a city with many potential clients, for holding a highly desirable unit, jeff's looking out was the rare act of someone who cared, and i am grateful because in this market - or this business, he by no means had to do what he did. i read some of the other reviews about jeff/lr, and while mine is but one story, his looking out for me was real, unnecessary, and quite frankly selfless. life in the city can be rough, actually life can be rough, but from time-to-time you meet people that look out when they don't have to, and jeff was one of them for me. — beslm u.
