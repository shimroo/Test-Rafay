hi! i’m kay! i teach the art of the bead life, one bead at a time! i look to inspire people to design wearable art to grow the confidence to building a more creative and colorful lifestyle. what started out as a family business blossomed into a passion for color, texture, culture, and design!

everything can use a little space. it often leads up to something bigger and better. being an extrovert, it is difficult getting use to the new norm and all this social distancing. although this is a drastic change in how we live, it is also giving us a chance to slow down and…it isn’t all that bad. it allows us an opportunity to find ourselves again. who are you outside of work? what are your interests? what lights you up from the inside? motivate to move toward the better you. you have the space, the time and the power. take that and invest in yourself! ~your bead therapist
