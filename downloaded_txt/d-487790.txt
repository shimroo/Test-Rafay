welcome to darian border collies - i hope you'll find your visit informative and enjoyable.

i'm no longer breeding, but i've always striven to produce sound, healthy border collies of good temperament, who retain the breed's amazing aptitude for work in all its guises.

we've had hip scoring, eye tests & hearing tests for a long time, but now dna testing for cea/ch, ncl, tns, igs, mdr1, sn, dh & glaucoma pre-dispostion are great advances in border collie health matters. anything which helps eradicate disease is to be warmly embraced.

please take the time to read my articles 'health & the border collie' and the accompanying 'dna testing - the way forward with carriers'. these can be found via the link on the left.

please visit my dogs by clicking on their names. the 'puppies' page has a link to my article 'so you want to breed a litter?'.

on the rare occasions i may have (or know of) an older puppy or adult darian in need of a new home, details will be posted via the 'available' link on the left.

while success in competition is a wonderful thing, my dogs (& all those i've bred) are essentially much-loved companions, sharing the lives & homes of those who own them. anything more is 'icing on the cake'.

18th december 2012 was a special 'silver anniversary' for me - 25 years before, on 18th december 1987, the very first darian litter was born..

i owe a great deal to the late sue large, who was a superb mentor in those early days of establishing my line. my foundation bitch zendi came from sue & she allowed me to use her fabulous boys sh ch wizaland mcintosh and wizaland jack frost at stud to produce my first 2 litters. all of the darians come down from zendi and from mac & jack's amazing dam show & obedience champion whenway mist of wizaland, after all these years still the breed's only dual champion.
 
the first few litters were dual registered and although we've lost the isds registration these days, we quite deliberately haven't lost the border collie's innate working ability. darians have travelled all over the world and have excelled in obedience, working trials, agility and flyball. they've worked stock, been hospital visiting and ykc dogs and have even gathered a few stud book numbers from the breed ring. most of all, they combine brains, temperament, sound conformation and good health (choose your own order of priority - they're all important to me) and have made me so many terrific friends both here & overseas. 

i have so much to be thankful for & so much to be proud of - and i am!
