what our customers say 












my husband and i had a wonderful time throughout the buying process. he is not a horse person so they did a great job of explaining the features and offering suggestions to make him comfortable. they were not pushy at all--if only buying a car was this easy. the numbers never changed from our first visit to the last visit. we had great customer service the whole time. no matter the price point of trailer they will treat you right. thanks chris!
