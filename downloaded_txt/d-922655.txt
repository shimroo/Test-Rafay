divorce with dignity


many families experience divorce. while divorce is never easy, it is possible to emerge from a divorce with dignity and hope for the future. the breakup of your marriage does not have to devastate your family.
having an experienced family law attorney to guide you through the divorce process can make all the difference. i am deborah zitomer, and i have almost 20 years of experience representing clients in divorce and family law matters.
if you want to end your marriage, or your spouse is seeking a divorce, i can help. call me at (610) 275-8587 or e-mail me to discuss your situation. i will work closely with you and your family members to design solutions to difficult family problems.
elements of a successful divorce
for many people, the key to a successful divorce is achieving a good outcome with the least amount of hostility possible. what is a good outcome is different in every divorce, depending on the family’s unique circumstances. i have found that by taking the time to get to know my clients and understand their desires, we are better able to resolve most family law disputes.
resolving disputes through out-of-court agreements
there are many advantages to reaching an agreement outside of court. it allows divorcing spouses to be in control of the process and the outcome. out-of-court settlements can also save time, money and prevent further damage to relationships.
i find this is almost always preferable to turning over control to the court and having “agreements” imposed upon my clients. to that end, i work hard to achieve fair agreements that take into account my clients’ interests and goals.
if you hire my norristown law firm to represent you, i will never allow you to enter into agreements that are not fair or in your best interest. you need to receive your fair share of the marital assets to ensure your future economic security. if you have children, it is essential to protect their interests when making decisions about child custody, visitation, child support and parenting plans.
resolving disputes through divorce litigation
some couples, including those with complex divorce issues, are unable to resolve their disputes outside of court. in these cases, litigation becomes necessary. although i encourage my clients to resolve their disputes without litigation, i have significant litigation experience. i regularly go to court and aggressively advocate for my clients. if you and your spouse cannot agree on disputed issues, such as parenting arrangements, the value of a business, or the division of retirement and pension accounts, i have the skills needed to fight for your interests in court.
protecting you now and in the future
because circumstances and families never stay the same, i strive to draft agreements that are flexible and will deal with future changes. however, increased or decreased income, job loss, relocation that interferes with visitation or other changes may require changes in your divorce decree.
i represent my clients in motions to change custody, increase or decrease alimony or child support, enforce visitation or payment of support and other modification of agreements and orders.
to schedule a meeting and find out how i can make a difference in your case, call me at (610) 275-8587 or send me an e-mail.






we take the time to get to know you and to understand your specific concerns, needs and goals.
