welcome
location. quality. comfort. style.
distinctive accommodations, genial but unobtrusive staff, and that elusive amenity … calm … at a walk-to-everything central location on legendary duval street.




tropical inn welcomes you to intimate, exclusively adult lodging where proudly independent bed and breakfast character meets the inspired design and understated grace of an upscale key west, florida boutique hotel. an oasis of tranquility set in a lush, secret garden enclave, its eleven rooms share spacious grounds, assuring optimal privacy. the inn’s mellow vibe plays perfect counterpart to that found just beyond the front doors of its strategic location on high-energy duval street. authenticity of place, unpretentious attitude, and bohemian spirit — the unassuming, just-right blend of “charming” and “chic” that personifies key west –- are hallmarks of tropical inn.
at a time of impersonal, corporately-owned, boutique hotel “collections”, this small and unique key west, fl historic inn holds fast to its heritage and local tradition. it is family-owned and operated by a loyal, dedicated staff that is enthusiastic about professional hospitality. in addition to superior guest experience, we are committed to business as a source of social responsibility and sustainability of our environment. we reduce, reuse, and and recycle wherever we can. and we are especially particular about thoughtfully sourcing  organic, non-gmo, and humanely produced agricultural products for use in our kitchen.
the tranquil palm garden embracing the historic main house and three charming cottages features a sparkling waterfall pool, inviting hot tub, and plenty of casual seating for easy relaxation. as eclectic as key west itself, accommodations are uniquely designed, beautifully appointed, and carefully attended by a friendly, attentive staff that prides itself on taking exceptional care of each guest … all tucked away unassumingly amidst a tantalizing array of island diversions.
guests leave tropical inn with lasting memories of “that great little place in key west” that they’ve sort of made their own… planning to return even before they have left.
