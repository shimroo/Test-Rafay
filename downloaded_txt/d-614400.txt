news 
a new millennium for ironmark 
august 31, 2022october 10, 2024 by lynne kingsley 










ironmark integrates millennium marketing solutions, elevating services, talents, and expertise of both companies
ironmark is thrilled to announce another step toward growth and expansion through the recent addition of millennium marketing solutions. 
ironmark’s growth has been built on strategic partnerships and acquisitions of companies that fit perfectly into the folds of our business as it exists. the same can be said for the recent union of ironmark and millennium marketing solutions.
why millennium?
ironmark ceo jeff ostenso explains, “there was such a natural fit between the two companies.” not only do the services offered by millennium further bolster ironmark’s offerings, but the employees strengthen the work and customer experience as well. all of millennium’s employees will be brought on board and rocking ironmark gear, giving the agency a deeper bench with more talent and more variety.
according to janice tippett, now vice president of strategic development at ironmark, “the alignment was uncanny.” since the first starbuck’s meeting with janice and jeff to discuss the partnership, to the official announcement, the energy around this acquisition has been all positive. jeff and janice both have a passion for communications and for their people. the synergy of passions from both company leaders has led to the successful partnership we’re sharing with you today.
what does this mean for clients?
when we grow, so do you! millennium’s clients now have more opportunity for growth through creative and strategic marketing, as well as expanded print services like large format, offset printing, and mailing and fulfillment. tippett says, “the future of business growth is marketing integration across all stages of the customer journey, and together with ironmark, we are exceptionally positioned to not only deliver at the highest level for clients but also lead the future of integrated marketing performance.”
the same goes for ironmark’s clients. we are excited to be able to offer more robust services in digital marketing and web development, as well as additional expertise within the branded merchandise and e-commerce divisions, particularly within corporate apparel. time to expand your wardrobe with some branded polos, t-shirts, and hats!
growing together
just a few months after the investment from post capital, ironmark is delivering on the promise of planning to invest in people, technology and strategic acquisitions to further build upon our omni-channel marketing delivery platform.
ironmark is excited to welcome all of the new faces of employees, partners, and clients that come with millennium! click here to read the official press release.
