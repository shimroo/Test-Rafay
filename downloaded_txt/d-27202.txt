do you manage a brokerage or agency, and want to provide exam prep for your employees? our other exam packages are meant for a single person. this package includes both the salesperson and broker exam prep and can be shared with as many people as you want, as long as there is only one user at a time studying for a specific type of exam. in other words, if each employee takes a month to prep, you can have 12 over the course of one year on the agency package. this is the best package when you will have 3 or more users looking for exam prep.
