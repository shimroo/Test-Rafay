our size is our strength
consider the advantages of a small school with enormous opportunities. on groton’s tight-knit campus—the circle—you will know everyone, and you will be known. you will shape this community of peers and mentors, and you will be shaped by it. you will be inspired by lifelong friends who are just as curious and motivated as you are.








scholarship
small classes and brilliant teachers will nurture your intellect and spark your imagination. 




leadership
every student learns to lead. groton will sharpen your leadership skills and help you understand your leadership style. 




family
groton was built on the model of a family, and, like family, we take care of each other. 






 
  













headmaster temba maqubela
inclusion in all respects, including socioeconomic inclusion, is an important ingredient of an outstanding education. middle-income families need to understand that we will help put a groton education within their reach.

when we are cared for like this, we learn somehow to turn our own care toward others. the people we have become are shaped almost entirely by those who cared about us and those we cared for.
