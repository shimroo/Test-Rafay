about


newfie.com was started as a personal project in 1998. the site was a great way to become adept at website and internet technology, basic graphic design, internet search optimization, and much more. the site didn’t start with much of a plan, but it became somewhat popular in spite of that. traffic slowly built up over the years to the point where web hosting became expensive due to data transfer charges, and as a result the site was mothballed around 2007. i’ve decided to resurrect things, starting from scratch on a new platform, hosting it on cloud services to keep things simple and reliable.  
content will build over time, and keeping with past strategies i plan to charge forth with very little in the way of a plan.  this will keep things eclectic and organic for sure.
