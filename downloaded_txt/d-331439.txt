beginning in 2020-21, the hockey commissioners association agreed all leagues that utilize shootouts will use the same system point system to calculate standings after the ncaa mandated 3-on-3 overtime for all games. additionally, all conferences and media outlets are recommended to use the same standings table.
all conference games are worth three points. the points are awarded as follows:
      3 for a regulation win
      2 for an overtime win or shootout "win"
      1 for an overtime or shootout "loss"
      0 for a regulation loss 
while nearly every division i college conference now uses shootouts to break ties after overtime is played, the ncaa uses w-l-t for record keeping and does not recognize shootout "wins" as wins. a game is considered a "tie" for both team and coach historical records after overtime ends without a goal scored. shootouts are used only to determine points in league standings. for this reason, records will continue to be displayed as w-l-t with ow-ol-sw following to display total point calculations. the ow-ol-sw records are accounted for in the w-l-t record.
