revolutionary cancer treatment: engineered fat cells starve tumors 
 february 17, 2025



 

in an unexpected fusion of plastic surgery and cancer treatment, researchers at uc san francisco have developed a groundbreaking technique that uses engineered fat cells to starve tumors and prevent their growth. drawing inspiration from liposuction and fat transfer procedures, this innovative approach could revolutionize cancer therapy by utilizing modified fat cells to deprive tumors of the nutrients they need to survive.
using crispr gene-editing technology, the scientists transformed ordinary white fat cells into “beige” fat cells—cells that burn calories aggressively to generate heat. in their experiments, these engineered fat cells were implanted near tumors, much like how plastic surgeons transfer fat between different body areas. the result was remarkable: the beige fat cells consumed large amounts of nutrients, starving the tumor cells and impeding their growth, even when the fat cells were placed far from the tumor site.

ai-designed computer chips: the future of innovation and efficiency 
 february 17, 2025



 

our modern world is powered by computer chips, from the ones in cars and smartphones to those that help track animals and optimize various industries. as technology continues to advance, there is a constant push to develop faster, more efficient, and innovative chips. to achieve this, some researchers are turning to artificial intelligence (ai) to assist in the chip design process, sometimes taking a step back from human control.
a team of scientists recently shared their process of allowing ai technology to design and test more efficient computer chips. led by kaushik sengupta, an electrical engineer at princeton university, the research explores the potential of using ai to enhance chip development. sengupta, who was recently awarded an ieee fellowship for his work on wireless chip technology, emphasizes that the goal is not to replace human engineers, but rather to augment their productivity. by publishing their findings in the open-access, peer-reviewed journal nature communications, sengupta’s team is making their ai-driven research available to the broader scientific community.

nasa’s mission to enhance nighttime wildfire response with advanced drone technology 
 february 17, 2025



 

nasa is collaborating with wildfire response teams to develop cutting-edge technologies that improve the effectiveness of aerial firefighting, particularly during nighttime operations. drones, both remotely piloted and fully autonomous, could play a larger role in wildfire suppression by providing critical support for 24/7 firefighting efforts, even in low-visibility conditions.
currently, aerial firefighting is limited to daylight hours or clear weather conditions, as poor visibility increases the risk of aircraft colliding with terrain or other firefighting aircraft. nasa’s new airspace management technology aims to change this by enabling drones and remotely piloted aircraft to safely operate at night, allowing responders more time to combat fires from the air.

harnessing sunlight to convert co2 into complex hydrocarbons: a breakthrough in sustainable energy production 
 february 12, 2025



 

researchers from the university of cambridge and the university of california, berkeley, have developed a groundbreaking system that uses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide (co₂) into complex hydrocarbons, marking a significant step toward cleaner energy production and more sustainable manufacturing processes.
their innovative approach combines a highly efficient solar cell made from perovskite, a promising material, with tiny copper catalysts known as “nano-flowers.” unlike traditional methods of co₂ conversion, which typically produce simple, single-carbon molecules, this new technology can generate more complex hydrocarbons like ethane and ethylene—key components for liquid fuels, plastics, and other chemicals. the findings, published in nature catalysis, offer a promising solution to the environmental challenges posed by fossil fuel dependence.

abdomenatlas: a game-changing dataset for ai in medical imaging 
 february 11, 2025



 

radiologists are increasingly relying on ai-based computer vision models to assist with the time-consuming task of interpreting medical scans. however, these ai models require vast amounts of accurately labeled data to function effectively, meaning radiologists must still invest significant time annotating medical images. to address this challenge, an international team led by johns hopkins bloomberg distinguished professor alan yuille has developed abdomenatlas, the largest abdominal ct dataset to date. with over 45,000 3d ct scans and 142 annotated anatomical structures from 145 hospitals worldwide, abdomenatlas is more than 36 times larger than its nearest competitor, totalsegmentator v2. this remarkable dataset and its findings were published in medical image analysis.
historically, abdominal organ datasets were created through the labor-intensive process of having radiologists manually label each individual organ in ct scans. this process required thousands of hours of expert labor. “annotating 45,000 ct scans with 6 million anatomical shapes would require an expert radiologist to have started working around 420 bce—the era of hippocrates—to complete the task by 2025,” explains lead author zongwei zhou, an assistant research scientist at johns hopkins university.
