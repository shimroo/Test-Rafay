facebook frustration
i frequent facebook.  i admit it.  maybe it's considered old school now to all of the young people (under 50) but i am always on facebook.  i love reading the posts - but for the last 3 or 4 months, there is this practice of putting up a partial post/thought and it says "continued in the comments."  what kind of s--t is that?
