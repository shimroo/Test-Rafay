nereida garcia-ferraz exploring identity through art, interview with erick and elliot jimenez  “her works, are a conduit of her affection and representative of the fusion of cuban spiritual heritage and identity.”…”– they’re explorations of her queer identity, her boundless curiosity, her mystical connections with the universe, and her belief in the interconnectedness of all life.“











nereida garcia-ferraz in conversation with stephanie seidel, for the de noche los sueños: 1983 to 2023 exhibition catalogue.“through an interplay of bold colors, and intricate layering of images, words, and charged symbols, garcia-ferraz explores questions of identity and interiority drawing from her personal experiences as an artist, an educator, a woman, an expatriate.”

you know who you are. november 2022 at the el espacio 23.el espacio 23 is a contemporary art space founded by collector and philanthropist jorge m. perez.recent acquisitions of cuban art from the jorge m. pérez collectionafter a significant donation of contemporary cuban art to the pérez art museum miami in 2016, this exhibition highlights works acquired since 2017 as part of an ongoing investigation and interest in cuban and cuban diaspora art. rather than a historical survey of the history of cuban art, the thematic exhibition brings together over 100 artists of different generations who share collective experiences yet take a very personal approach to their practice.who know who you are is a statement of confidence and resistance. in the context of cuban art and culture, knowing yourself, having a voice and defending your beliefs is an act of defiance. the fragmented history of cuban art has been subjected to political readings, to the dichotomy of inside and outside—the island and its diaspora. it has been marked by the intentional omission, by historical oblivion of talented artists whose forced or voluntary exile extracted them from the historical continuum of the nation; by generations of cubans who were not even born on the island. amid a journey traversed by so many collective dramas, this exhibition focuses on each artist’s personal journey in finding their place.artists throughout the exhibition revisit cuba’s past and present by questioning history, deconstructing hierarchies, reflecting on notions of representation, race, gender, diversity, and human rights, while others reclaim a connection with the island by referencing its physicality or its place in collective memory.you know who you are was co-curated by anelys alvarez and patricia hanna.

radical conventions: cuban american art from the 1980's (on view through june 12, 2022 at the lowe art museum).













a landmark exhibition, radical conventions is the first major museum presentation to focus solely on cuban american art created during the 1980s. by exploring the heterogeneous nature of cuban diasporic work from this pivotal decade, the show offers a critical counterpoint to an often binary, identity-focused narrative by framing the artists’ works more expansively within the aesthetic frameworks prevalent in the american avant-garde of the late 70s–80s and the era’s broader socio-economic, cultural, and political landscape.the exhibition features nearly 100 works by over 25 cuban american artists representative of various generations including luis cruz azaceta, fernando garcía, nereida garcía-ferraz, félix gonzález-torres, tony labat, maría martínez-cañas, luis medina, ana mendieta, and carmelita tropicana.conversation between dr. elizabeth cerejido, esperanza bravo de varona chair, cuban heritage collection and ana clara silva, director of exhibitions at faena art.

this conversation featured curator amy rosenblum-martín, scholar/curator dr. jillian hernandez, and miami artists crystal pearl molinary, nereida garcía-ferraz, susan lee chun, and jessica gispert, with an introduction by naomi fisher.“art, fundamentally, is information. it’s as much about issues as about objects, about how we live and think, ethically, politically, emotionally. this has been clear in exhibitions that have expanded our knowledge of what’s in the world, near and far. among those i revisit in my mind are “sahel: art and empires on the shores of the sahara” at the metropolitan museum of art; “marking time: art in the age of mass incarceration” at moma ps1”; and “sky hopinka: centers of somewhere” at the hessel museum of art, bard college.”
