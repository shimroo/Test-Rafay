mix different scripts in each website - asp.net, asp.net core, node.js, asp, php, python, cgi.
you've developed a website and want to run an asp script alongside an asp.net script, asp.net core, alongside a php script and maybe even use a perl cgi script. you also might want the php script connecting to a sql server and mysql database and the asp and asp.net hosting script connecting to the same mysql and sql server databases. you can do all of this and more in your m6.net reseller hosting account.
mix and use all the different scripting engines - asp, asp.net (upto 7.0),asp.net core 6 and asp.net core 7.0, php (7 and 8) with one or more mysql and/or sql server and/or access databases. as soon as your account is setup, all of this is ready to go. you can choose asp.net and php versions from your control panel with changes made instantly.
we're windows server hosting specialists.
at m6.net we've been doing nothing but windows hosting for over 25 years. we're one of the net's original windows hosting providers. every time technology changed our hosting customers got the latest windows technology as soon as it was released without frustration. we were the first windows hosts to fully support dotnetnuke hosting and make it work. you can plan your website developments knowing you'll get access to the latest hosting technology as soon as it is available.
your sites and projects are in good hands. starting out in 1997 we've experienced all the technology changes from nt 3.5 to windows 2000 to windows server 2012, windows server 2016, windows server 2019 and windows server 2022.  we've dealt with all the rollouts of asp 1 through to asp 2 and then asp 3. we also handled all the technicalities of rolling out .net and just recently .net framework 4.8 along with .net core 3.1
we've also handled all the hosting technology changes from frontpage 1 to frontpage 2000 to frontpage 2003 and microsoft sharepoint services. when sql server became affordable for shared hosting customers back in 1999 we helped hundreds of clients migrate their databases from microsoft access to ms-sql server 2000. we also helped many clients with their migration from sql server 2000 to sql server 2005 to sql server 2008 to sql server 2012 to sql server 2016 and sql server 2019.
we have an extensive history and experience with all windows technology. you'll find us the best choice for php hosting, asp.net hosting and asp hosting solutions.
true multiple iis web sites.
 when we say multiple web sites, we mean multiple iis web sites - and you can resell each and every one of the sites in your m6.net windows reseller hosting account. each web site comes with its own application settings, custom error pages, mail server, log files and log file directory and more. with our designer and prodeveloper reseller hosting accounts you can even set your own application pools. we're one of the affordable web hosts that offer advanced features like your own application pool with asp.net hosting services.
back in 1998 we were one the first hosts to offer multiple sites in the one reseller hosting account. this simple innovation instantly saved webmasters hundreds of dollars per month. we continue to save webmasters money with discount price, true multi-web site, reseller web hosting on windows servers.
