your luxury boutique hotel in the heart of downtown boston, ma







xv beacon: the art of discretion
																		some claim george washington slept here. xv beacon's lips are sealed.								

xv beacon hotel in downtown boston, ma, reigns over the historic beacon hill neighborhood in its turn-of-the-century landmark beaux arts building. the modern furnishings of the luxury boston hotel counterbalanced by a grand staircase of marble, mahogany paneling and original caged-glass elevator reflect how past lives transform into the present. the 63-room luxury boutique boston hotel, recognized for peerless personal service, sophisticated interiors and luxurious custom amenities, distinguishes itself with its sense of heritage, peacefulness of home and utmost discretion.
