our
     vision 



 







the sarasota players is community theatre, dedicated to delivering quality productions and keeping the community engaged with the arts. the sarasota players seeks to provide an artistic outlet for locals and visitors alike to experience live theatre and live theatre training.the sarasota players is a non-professional community theatre, located on the “cultural coast.” this location gives us an incredible talent pool to work with. from our artistic director to our stagehands, half of the volunteers working on a production have at one time been professionally paid performers. many professional performers retire and are drawn to the area thanks to all of sarasota’s arts offerings. these professionals bring their experience, training, families and often their extensive resumes with them to our stage.
