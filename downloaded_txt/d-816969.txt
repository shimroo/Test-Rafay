i have been a part of the "sse family" for the past 8 years since relocating to cleveland with parker hannifin.  staffing solutions had an ongoing partnership with parker prior to my arrival, so i assumed this relationship.  they go out of their way to meet my needs not only in staffing but also for networking and professional development through special programs they offer to their clients.

i would recommend staffing solutions to anyone who is looking to align with an agency that truly cares. while competitors of staffing solutions may promote the same level of care and concern for their candidates, staffing solutions has gone above and beyond to prove that they care, walking their candidates through just about every step of the hiring process from inception to actual placement.
