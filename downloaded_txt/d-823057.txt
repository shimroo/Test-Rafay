                                        ordering was so easy. i love that you receive a photo of the finished product. it's so disappointing when the flowers you sent look nothing like what they were supposed to. i think i found my new florist!

                                        i live in ny and needed a lovely bouquet for an elderly cousin who lost her husband.  i wanted a local florist, i didn’t want to order from an online florist.  i wanted to choose my flowers and price point. i could not have been happier with this florist.  madeline was friendly and very attentive of my needs.  she did not rush me and explained everything she would put into the arrangement, the delivery cost, she was professional and personal at the same time.  i would recommend them to anyone.

                                        a friend’s dog recently passed. i ordered a basket of flowers/foliage with carnations shaping out the figure of a dog centered around the colorful flowers/foliage. the ladies did a beautiful job putting the basket together. it was a beautiful art piece. i’m very grateful for them taking such great care in making a meaningful basket.

                                        the shop was so nice and called when the weather was too cold for them to deliver my mom's birthday flowers as they would have died sitting outside for 4 hours until my mom got home. they delivered them the next day and my mom loved the flowers. the flowers looked even more beautiful in person than the photo of them on the website (how often does that happen??). i was super impressed and would order from forever flowers again!
