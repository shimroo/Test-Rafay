germicidal uv light
the effectiveness of any uv application depends on delivering a sufficient uv dose to inactivate the target microorganisms. in air and surface disinfection the uv dose is calculated as follows:
uv dose* = uv intensity x exposure time
an applications engineer knows how to take under consideration all the variables which affect the uv dose.
call 843-306-0070 to speak with an expert
* the uv dose is usually expressed in microwatt-seconds per square centimeter (âµws/cmâ²) or milli-joules per square centimeter (mj/cmâ²).
