welcome to the tampa bay vettes website!




tampa bay vettes, inc. was established in 1994 as a florida non-profit corporation.  our club's mission is to promote a friendly and open atmosphere for all corvette enthusiasts.  we love our corvettes and believe that, although beautiful to gaze upon, they should be driven in order to truly get the most enjoyment out of america's true sports car.  

we are proud lifetime members of the national corvette museum.  if you love corvettes and want to know the full history of america's sports car, definitely make a trip to the national corvette museum located in bowling green, ky.
         

our club meetings are currently being held at the cracker barrel old country store, i-4 exit mango rd, 6150 lazy days blvd, seffner, fl 33584, on the 2nd wednesday of every month.  all corvette owners, family members, and enthusiasts are welcome to attend.   we hope to see you at one of our many events or monthly meetings.
