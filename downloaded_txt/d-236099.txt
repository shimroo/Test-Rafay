north american box turtles
by joe heinen dc






welcome to the world of box turtles !

box turtles (terrapene sp.) are a very popular species. i saw my 
			first over 50 years ago in central michigan. i was fascinated by the 
			box turtles ability to completely close itself into its shell. what 
			was even more intriguing was its wonderful personality and 
			intelligence.  
i am lucky enough to have observed the eastern box turtle in its 
			natural habitat in parts of michigan. indiana, illinois, north 
			carolina, georgia and south carolina. i frequently  found  
			hatchling box turtles in northern michigan. 
unfortunately i have also found many box turtles dead on the 
			road. usually in the spring and early summer when females are 
			searching for suitable nesting sites. most of my box turtles show 
			evidence of hbc (hit by car) injuries. also its common to see the 
			edges of the shell "chewed" by dogs.
urban development results in box turtle habitat destruction. this 
			brings the box turtles in close (and often fatal) contact with 
			people and their pets. as a result of this box turtles are being 
			found in life threatening situations.
this site was born out of a desire to bring a better 
			understanding of the care and needs of the wonderful box turtle.
