7/3 
              - as easy as abc
              by katrina rasbold -  gh, oltl & amc

give me those daytime drama lies! - very 
              minorly spoilerish about stuff already hinted about on the shows.










7/3 
              - confessions of a media ho
              by karen h - amc & gh




              carly, carly, carly. jason was right to be nervous when diane 
              confirmed that she said she had a plan. hands down, this is one 
              of carlys dumbest plans ever, and thats a pretty big statement. 
              the idea that she and jason had comfort sex while standing vigil 
              over michael is even more ludicrous than the actual comfort sex 
              she shared with sonny.







7/1 - 
              view from the recliner's edge
by the daytime diva, belinda ache - amc, gh & oltl 





be still my stuttering heart. while a year 
              ago i lamented that soaps might be dead and gone and all that we 
              were watching was the death throes, here comes one life to live to 
              make a liar out of me. thank you, thank you, and thank you! 









7/1 
              - the gourmez - gh 






im thinking of going into a new business. 
              its a surefire success; in fact, i could probably make millions 
              as long as i start out in port charles.  im not talking about 
              selling snake oil or even bottles of sonnys super studly 
              swimmers.   no, ladies and gents, what i want to do is peddle door 
              locks to the citizens of this lovely, yet strangely trusting 
              town.  no more obnoxious ex-wives intruding on your night in with 
              the fiancé.  no more strange mobster-types wheeling into your 
              office without so much as a knock.  peace, quiet, and safety can 
              all be yours for just $10.99 plus installation fees!

              - cc's soap saloon


by cindy devine -  amc, gh & oltl
               
okay been away for a little 
                while, just trying to sort things out. my incredulity at some of 
                the blatant mis-firings of certain storylines has had me in a 
                tizzy, to say the least. where to begin, where to begin?

        35th annual daytime emmy awards

6/2- 
              sherry's jubilee
by sherry mercurio - off topic



frustration.  frustrated. 
        





              ßme.  
              i swear i want to write more often!  there are several problems, 
              the first being that i sort of freeze on topics nowadays.  i very 
              often stay awake half the night thinking about something that i 
              know id feel better about if i just got up and wrote outbut then 
              i start thinking that it probably wont be that interesting.

beth ehlers (harley on gl 
        for 21 years) will be joining the cast of amc.  
        her most well known leading man is (above) none other than ricky paull 
        goldin, known to us as "nujake." ehlers will debut on 
        august 5th as soldier taylor mcbride.
 



general hospital







josh duhon has been 
        let go from the role of logan hayes.  logan's death brings the 
        return of kin shriner (scotty) to gh for a while.  rumors say that 
        logan was literally "the last to know" on the set.







back for 3 glorious 
        months in june is the delicious and delightful rick springfield as noah 
        drake.  yes, he sings.  *swoon*  [so where the hell is 
        he?]
