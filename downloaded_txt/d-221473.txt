frequently asked questions about sports medicine

do only athletes benefit from sports medicine?


            while sports medicine was initially designed to help athletes perform at their best while preventing and overcoming injury, pretty much anyone dealing with a chronic musculoskeletal problem can benefit from it. it uses non-invasive treatments that help a patient heal, stop pain, and continue on with their life without having to undergo invasive procedures or spend a lot of time recovering, which can help tremendously whether youâre a high-level athlete, young professional, or stay-at-home parent.

            what makes a sports medicine physician qualified to treat people?

all sports medicine physicians have to graduate from medical school in order to treat patients, but after that, they have the opportunity to complete a dedicated, multi-year sports medicine fellowship. not all sports physicians do this, but dr. tortland has. this gave them specific training on diagnosing and treating the types of injuries that sports medicine focuses on, specifically those that affect the muscles, joints, tendons, and ligaments. 

            what is the difference between sports medicine and orthopedic medicine?

sports medicine is considered a discipline that falls within orthopedic medicine. they both focus on treating injuries involving the musculoskeletal system, but they tend to go about it in different ways. while traditional orthopedic medicine might use methods such as joint replacement or tendon repair surgery, a sports physician might recommend physical therapy, activity modification, or exercises that help an athlete deal with the demands on their body that are specific to their sport. while both approaches have the same end goal (long-term pain relief and full function), sports medicine often allows a patient to continue with their lives with minimal interruption. with sports medicine, an athlete can continue playing, or someone can continue working, while being treated (which usually isnât possible after undergoing surgery). 

            what common conditions are treated by sports medicine physicians?

injuries that affect the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints can all be diagnosed and effectively treated by a sports physician. this includes strains, sprains, partial tears, impingements, nerve entrapment, and more. acute injuries like those resulting from an accident can be addressed as well as chronic, ongoing problems like persistent back and neck pain. 



sports and orthopedic medicine patient testimonials




 



âi was bounced around from specialist to specialist each time receiving a different diagnosis and inadequate treatmentâ¦ i was lucky to have found dr. tortland. dr. tortland took the time to listen to my history, formulate, and carry out a treatment plan. for three and a half years i was seeking treatment for knee pain that crippled my once active lifestyle. after several rounds of treatment from dr. tortland and staff i have been able to snowboard, ride my bike, practice martial arts and even complete a triathlon. there is zero doubt in my mind that is the direct result of treatment from this clinic.â


 david s., hartford, ct
                    


 



âdr. tortland explained the treatment with great care, and i understood exactly what the procedure entailed. best of all, i am fortunate to have even better results than he anticipated. before treatment, i needed to use two hands to help me bring one leg up a stair. now, i have no difficulty! in june i was able to walk 2100 steps in one day. the stem cell treatment has given me my life back.â

âthese doctors are excellent. i have been going to dr. tortland and his associate dr. lavallee for about 4 years now. i ruptured my acl over 30 years ago and it wasn't repaired due to complications. over the years my cartilage has worn and is mostly gone now. my orthopedic surgeon wanted to replace my knee. not wanting the surgery yet, i started going to dr. tortland. with his guided injections, i am nearly pain free and ski every weekend in the winters. i also have injections in most of my other joints and all my joints have improved. this group has done wonders in reversing my aging joints and more.â
