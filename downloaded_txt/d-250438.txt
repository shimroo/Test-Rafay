west coast camps has operated in central california on lake mcclure since 2002, taking the traditional summer camp experience to a whole new level. our years of experience will teach you more in a week than most learn in a year. if you are ready for a unique summer camp experience and are looking for some fun on the water, we are ready to give you a week you will never forget.never been wakeboarding or surfing before? there is no need to be intimidated. the bulk of our students are beginners and we have multiple boats enabling us to group riders with others of equal ability.  we specialize in teaching beginners, but have developed a superior system for teaching advanced tricks as well. no matter what your skill level, you will learn a ton while you are here (both on and off the water).our wakeboard and wakesurf camp offers the perfect combination of professional instruction, safe and extremely fun atmosphere, off water activities, and houseboat accommodations.  though we specialize in youth summer camps, we also offer other camp packages and lessons for riders of all ages.we look forward to helping you reach your goals this summer!
