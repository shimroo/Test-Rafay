i am proud to say i have been a partner and investor with the rosenbergs/sawyer realty partners for the past 20 years. 
i can unequivocally say that they are first class people, as well as exceptional operators and stewards for my capital.
our track record with them has been exceptional. 
they have great “respect for capital” they are transparent, detailed and very experienced in execution.
investing is all about trust, knowledge and experience. it is not only how you invest, but also when to invest. it also requires the discipline of protecting your downside.
the sawyer realty team is all of the above and i am proud to be associated with them.
