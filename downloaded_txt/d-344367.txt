                    it was an absolute pleasure working with ed and may. their response time (to my many inquiries) was outstanding. as promised, they delivered everything we asked for. when we had a slight hiccup of our own making, ed was "all over it" immediately. in fact, i thought he went above and beyond. if/when we plan another golf trip to orlando, we will have no hesitation about working with ed and may again.

                    excellent communication. the company was very prompt in responding to emails. much appreciated. will rent again in the future. very spacious home. our group consisted of ten family members, all had plenty of room to spread out. enjoyed the privacy of having the golf course in rear of house.
