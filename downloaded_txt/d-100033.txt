featured artist jared olseverjared olsever is a queer multidisciplinary artist born and raised in toronto, canada. after a studio arts education from george brown college, he received a digital media arts diploma from seneca college at york university in 2011. he continued exploring various mediums such as painting, sculpture, digital media, portraiture, and figurative painting. olsever explores his creativity using video, graphic design, digital illustration, and acrylics to develop narrative compositions around his identity.jared uses robotics, fantasy, cartoons, and religious themes to display the impact of programming in the world he grew up in. an amalgamation of these motifs in real life often forces people to become products of their environments, coded to act and feel a certain way. his work presents a crossover of psychedelic healing, confrontation of a problematic past and reclamation of one’s existence while calling for freedom from conformity.website: https://jaredsrobots.com/instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jaredolsever/jared was this years east h.e.a.r.t. artist facilitator for the new scarborough sign design, which was developed and painted by local 2slgbtq+ youth. check out more about the east h.e.a.r.t. program and jared’s work on the sign design by clicking here.
