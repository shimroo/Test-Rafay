what people are saying about aardvark to zebra



“i’m blown away with the details of this hand drafted pattern. lois boncer, you are quite brilliant! i am currently making the large bison for my grandson… his favorite animal. working with minky fur fabric has been a love-hate relationship, but with every step i go from “lost” to “enlightened” with the way this is constructed. i have made a number of different bear and bunny stuffed animals, but this pattern is by far the most challenging and rewarding. thank you for the pattern!”— patricia libby from etsy , five star review



“the pattern is brand new, uncut. have started the project. i am a beginner and the instructions combined with photos, is easy to follow. received the item within days of ordering.”—  robin baber from etsy, five star review
















aardvark to zebra 's vintage (1980's) stuffed animal patterns are more realistic than cutsy.  all pattern pieces  were hand-drawn and labeled, with complete instructions,  illustrated with hand-drawn  construction diagrams.  pattern pieces are full size,  printed on one side of 11"x 17" paper, ready to be cut out.  arrows, notches, dots and seam-lines are clearly printed, all referenced in the instructions,  so making these animals is easy.  there are no construction photos,  but a color photo of the finished animal(s) is on the cover,  as well as a line- drawing  showing seam lines.  many of the patterns have variations,  some with more than one animal or the same animal in different sizes.  they are a real joy to make and own.
