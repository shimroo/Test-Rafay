“the pat boone family and the legends radio family were on the eissey campus theater stage last night as the legendary singer/actor/composer received the lifetime achievement award from the society for the preservation of the great american songbook and daughter debby boone performed a concert that thrilled the palm beach audience.although an unlimited amount of listeners can access the south florida radio station world wide via the internet, the live audience was limited as ticket sales for the event, which also celebrated the radio station’s 6th anniversary were halted early on as the evening was a sell out.a heartwarming surprise for everyone was debby calling her father pat boone up toward the end of her performance for a duet.”
