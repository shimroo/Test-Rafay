7th bi-annual dinner event - thank you!


the fire family transport foundation held its bi-annual dinner event for foundation awareness on march 1st, 2024 at russoâs on the bay. the event was the largest and most successful ever. supporters turned out in record numbers of attendees and journal support. the event was totally sold out but was generously supported by many who were not able to get a seat. 
the executive board would like to thank all who helped make this event a success.
the foundation pledges to use each and every dollar donated to fulfill our mission to transport fdny families during their hardest times. providing transportation so they can seek the best medical care in the world without the extra stress that driving can bring. 

the foundation never charges a fee for rides. it pays no salaries at all to drivers or board administrators.
