hydrogen compression








compressors for supply of clean, high-pressure hydrogen gas. units available for discharge pressures of 1,000 to 20,000 psi (7 to 140 mpa). higher pressure units also available.
 

 



airbag inflator filling








compressors and compressor systems for argon, helium and gas mixtures. discharge pressures up 20,000 psi (140 mpa). systems include plc control, gas storage, valves and piping.
 

 
 


hot isostatic pressing (h.i.p.)








production and laboratory scale compressors. discharge pressures of 10,000 to 60,000 psi (70 to 420 mpa).
 

 



gas assist injection molding








reliable, low-maintenance, hydraulically driven compressors for supply of nitrogen gas. units available for discharge pressures of 1,500 to 10,000 psi (10 to 70 mpa).
 

 
 


cylinder filling








gas compressors and systems to fill stationary storage and gas cylinders. gases include argon, nitrogen, helium and hydrogen. units used to recover boil-off from cryogenic storage.
 

 



cold isostatic pressing (c.i.p.)








production and laboratory scale high-pressure pumps. discharge pressures of 10,000 to 100,000 psi (70 to 700 mpa). units available for various process fluids. units for w.i.p. also.
 

 
 


pressure testing








pumps, compressors and turnkey systems for pressure testing applications. including autofrettage, fatigue testing, hydrostatic testing, impulse testing and pnematic leak testing.
 

 



inert gas foaming








high-pressure gas compressors for co2 and nitrogen supply. 
 

 
 


high-pressure homogenizing








custom made high-pressure pumps. abrasion resistant, all stainless steel wet end components. discharge pressures of 10,000 to 45,000 psi (70 to 300 mpa).
 

 



special applications








hydro-pac designs and manufactures custom equipment for special applications. examples include light weight intensifiers, subsea intensifiers and on-board units.
