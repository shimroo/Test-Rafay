please consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. to obtain a prospectus, which contains this and other information about the fund, click here or call 888-860-8686. please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

investments in mutual funds carry risks and investors may lose principal value. click here for the principal risks of investing in the funds. please read the prospectus carefully before investing as it explains the risks associated with investing in the mutual funds.
the morningstar ratingtm for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. it is calculated based on a morningstar risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. the top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) morningstar rating metrics. the weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. while the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. ©morningstar, inc. all rights reserved. the information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. neither morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.

please consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. to obtain a prospectus, which contains this and other information about the fund, call 888-860-8686 or visit www.marsicofunds.com. please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
the focus fund is classified as a non-diversified portfolio, which means it may hold fewer securities than a diversified fund because it is permitted to invest a greater percentage of its assets in a smaller number of securities. holding fewer securities increases the risk that the value of the fund could go down because of the poor performance of a single investment. the fund and the stocks and markets in which it invests are subject to general risks that include unforeseen events such as pandemics, volatility and instability, periods of cyclical change and decline, that investors may at times avoid investments in equity securities, and that the investment adviser may select investments for the fund that do not perform as anticipated.

expense ratio: as of the fund’s 2/1/2021 prospectus; 1.49% gross, 1.45% net. marsico capital management, llc, the investment adviser to the fund (the “adviser”), has entered into a written expense limitation and fee waiver agreement under which it has agreed to limit the total expenses of the focus fund (excluding taxes, interest, acquired fund fees and expenses, litigation, extraordinary expenses, and brokerage and other transaction expenses relating to the purchase or sale of portfolio investments) to an annual rate of 1.45% of the fund’s average net assets until january 31, 2022. this expense limitation and fee waiver agreement may be terminated by the adviser at any time after january 31, 2022 upon 15 days prior notice to the fund and its administrator, provided that no such modification will be made in a manner inconsistent with the terms of the current prospectus.
short squeeze: a short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses.
