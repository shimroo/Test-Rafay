my
cap garland homepage
oscar
edmund garland became famous as the hero of laura ingalls wilder's "little
house" books.
loved
by many, there is still not a lot known about the boy known as "cap" garland,
and that is not because the information about him is not available.
if
you ask the right people, you can find out a lot about cap, but for some
reason, no one has ever published anything completely devoted to him, before
now.
many
people who have grown up reading about cap and consider themselves true
cap garland fans still don't know about his life after the age of 16, nor
do they know about his horrific death, or of his tragic childhood.
well,
i hope to change that with my webpage:
