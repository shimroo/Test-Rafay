 academic excellence through quality teaching
 the mission of the morehouse parish school system is to establish a learning environment for students of all ages that is focused on academic excellence and meeting the social and moral obligations of a quality education. to accomplish this mission, the morehouse parish school system will have teachers who recognize the broad and complex needs of students in today's world and understand the dynamics of each student's academic, social, and emotional well being. these teachers will work in an atmosphere that is comfortable and conducive to learning-where basic skills are measured, then progressively developed in such a manner as to produce productive, well­educated citizens. these citizens will be able to function in and contribute to the well-being of the community, the state, and the nation. the ultimate success of our school system will be the result of the direct partnership which exists between the home, school, and community.
