cry me a river





from causa:

among the issues they have been touched by in their personal lives 
includes the difficulty for people to obtain citizenship through the 
current broken immigration system, having their families torn apart by 
programs like secure communities, the need for passage of the dream act 
so children of immigrants can realize their full potential and the need 
for restoration of driver's licenses so that familes can take their 
children to the doctor and drive to work so they can support their 
familes.

let's parse that paragraph. 

1. it's difficult (read: impossible) for illegal aliens to get amnesty for their illegal behavior.

2. families get "torn apart" when people are arrested for breaking the law. this isn't exclusive to the illegal alien community. if you want to stay with your wife and kids then don't break the law.

3. "children of immigrants" can already get in-state tuition if they are oregonians. even the children of illegal aliens can get this. you just can't get in-state tuition if you are yourself an illegal alien.

4. illegal aliens want drivers licenses. not so they can drive to the liquor store but so they can "drive their children to the doctor." with what health insurance? does the job that american's won't do provide health insurance? either it does, which sounds like a job that most people would take, or they are expecting us to pay for their health care.

also they want to drive to their work that they aren't legally able to have so they can support their families. i wonder if they used your social security number to get that job...

news flash: amazon already did this





report: multnomah county should privatize library system

a report, “checking out the options,” by cascade 
research associate christopher robinson, comes as county commissioners 
are contemplating placement of a library district authorization measure 
on the may 2012 primary ballot. if approved, the district would provide 
permanent tax-raising authority for the library system in place of a 
series of temporary five-year tax levies and support from the county 
general fund.



county property taxes would rise as a result of the measure, which also would free some funds for the county to spend elsewhere.



cascade, a pro-corporate, libertarian research and 
advocacy group in portland, argues in the report that multnomah county 
library operations are more expensive than those in seattle and denver. 
it pins the blame largely on high pension and health insurance benefits 
for county employees.



if you aren't reading this because you are currently downloading $1 books on your kindle i will understand. as i've stated many times here in the past i am in favor of closing down the taxpayer funded dvd rental stores. and unless you are really into looking at porn on public computers you should agree with me.



and for those of you who don't agree with me just know that my current plan is to become head of my local library and stock the shelves with nothing but ann coulter books. it's not like i need to respond to market demands or anything, you pay for the books whether you want them or not.

does fritz think that the constitution trumps in this case?





officers arrest armed man at occupy portland encampment
police arrested a man they said flashed a handgun during an argument at the occupy portland encampment wednesday afternoon.


parker was taking video at the camp when several demonstrators 
"verbally challenged" him, police said. during the argument, one of the 
demonstrators used a racial slur at parker, who then showed a gun he had
 tucked in his waistband.

parker is a concealed handgun license owner, police said.

the irony of a non-participant being arrested for disorderly conduct during an occupy event is just too much for me. 

there is no law (or city ordinance) against video taping people. there is no law (or city ordinance) against openly displaying a firearm if you have a concealed handgun license. there are however laws (or city ordinances) against camping in the parks, blocking traffic, etc.

but people who carry firearms aren't politically popular with the portland commissars so this guy gets arrested. and it doesn't fit the media template to tell us that this guy was black and what racial slur was used.
there are laws against pointing a firearm at another person (ors 166.190) but the same cops who for days ignored alcohol and drug use downtown arrest the guy on disorderly conduct.  

disorderly conduct is everything that these protestors have done:

 166.025
disorderly conduct in the second degree. (1) a person commits the crime of
disorderly conduct in the second degree if, with intent to cause public
inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, the
person:


      (a)
engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior;

      (b)
makes unreasonable noise;

      (c)
disturbs any lawful assembly of persons without lawful authority;

      (d)
obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic on a public way;

      (e)
congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a
lawful order of the police to disperse;

      (f)
initiates or circulates a report, knowing it to be false, concerning an alleged
or impending fire, explosion, crime, catastrophe or other emergency; or

      (g)
creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which the
person is not licensed or privileged to do.

      (2)
disorderly conduct in the second degree is a class b misdemeanor. 



how does displaying a firearm to these hippies fall into this statute?

they will check your skin color at the door





public invited to beaverton high school latino college night, oct. 19
students and families are invited to the beaverton high school latino 
college night, wednesday, october 19, 2011 from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. 
in the auditorium, 13000 sw 2nd st., beaverton.  the event will be 
conducted entirely in spanish and will include information on topics 
such as the benefits of higher education, how to prepare and plan for 
college and paying for college. the evening will begin with a 
resource fair featuring representatives from the northwest education 
loan association (nela), the national hispanic scholarship commission, 
oregon trio, healthy kids and western oregon latino student ambassadors.
 light refreshments and child care will be provided.  for more information, please contact polly ramirez at 503-259-4915. 

is there a high school in america that will give you a diploma if you don't speak english? is there a college that will accept you if you don't speak english? is there a job that requires a college degree but doesn't require that you speak english?

i can understand a spanish only seminar on "please don't drive drunk" (that video will be uploaded later, seriously) or "please don't sell drugs" (also in the same video) but do we really need a class for high school graduates in a language other than english?

equality assembly part tres





third in a series of posts. 

your "representative" mary nolan is "fighting against workplace raids." one can only assume then that she opposes labor laws. i could probably go a bit further and assume that she supports id theft, perjury and tax fraud.






this is an oregon lawmaker standing in front of a bunch of admitted lawbreakers and she is claiming to represent them. if lawmakers don't respect the law then clearly they should pick a different profession.
