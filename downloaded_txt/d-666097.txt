improving the lives of children through service and discovery
the department of pediatrics trains superior physicians, fosters innovation through discovery and application, and provides high-quality health care, including more than 30 pediatric subspecialties, to patients throughout missouri and beyond.
as part of a comprehensive academic health center, the department prides itself on educating physicians in an environment rich in innovative care and research. this atmosphere of compassion and discovery has benefited hundreds of pediatricians who have graduated from mu. some serve rural u.s. communities, while others pursue careers that improve health globally.
mu physician-scientists and other researchers are committed to helping young patients lead healthier, happier lives by finding the best means to diagnose, treat and potentially cure pediatric disease. these scientists also are dedicated to preventing health problems through the promotion of child wellness.
diversity
the department of pediatrics believes that having diverse faculty, staff, residents and students enhances the quality of our clinical, research, teaching and advocacy programs. we have a wide array of people with various ethnic backgrounds including african, african-american, pacific islander and asian, among others.
the department mission statement for diversity is the same as that of the school of medicine, which can be found here: school of medicine diversity.
