welcome to ragdale hall spa
we are all a bit obsessed with time. seconds, minutes, hours, days, gone before we can even count them. the present can never really be measured, but it can be valued. a moment doesnât always need to be fleeting. we know the best moments become memories, and these last forever. for more than 30 years weâve been dedicated to turning your time into you time. because we believe that time is the most precious gift that we can give you.













spa breaks
whether youâre joining us for a few days or for a longer break, youâll feel the weight lift from your shoulders from the moment you arrive. weâll take care of everything – mouth-watering meals, indulgent treatments and peaceful pools – so you can make the most of your time here.
