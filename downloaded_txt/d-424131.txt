welcome to our site! we pray that as you read through the pages you will be blessed through the content which includes additional features to  enhance the wealth of prophetic messages and exhortations given by ben israel’s founder and my father, art katz.  his sole passion for nearly four decades was to glorify his messiah jesus, across the world. indeed, many of the themes he sounded have more relevance today than when he was alive.
each family living on the property including keith and i, meets our own income needs so that support and  resources are used solely to uphold the ministry and god’s word, seeking to honor the vision for this ministry and property that dad and many others had.
we are blessed and encouraged by those who uphold us and pray for us as we continue to seek the father’s will and his purposes for the work my dad started. 

in his grace,
sissie
