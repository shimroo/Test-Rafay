how does one get on track...or develop healthy habits? what really works in the weight loss arena? i just can't seem to figure it out. i just can't get on track. i don't know if it is my inability to commit or a fear of failing again...but why can't i do this? why won't i do this? i always have lots of ideas and lots and lots of strategies. i make plans, but then allow myself to stray from them. not sure what to do at this point, but after looking down at the scale this morning and seeing an all-time high, i know it is time to do something. i'm tired all the time. i get winded from walking up just one flight of stairs. i dread travelling for fear of being uncomfortable. i'm extremely ashamed...to the point that i don't even want to look people in the eyes when i talk. the only time i have successfully lost weight is when i became completely obsessed with food and exercise. maybe obsessed isn't the right word, but it was a huge priority. why can't i make myself a priority again? it's time for me to figure out the right balance. i hope i can do it. i'm scared to communicate my ideas or to reveal my plan. i'm scared to fail again.today, i promise myself to do five things to improve my health.i promise to take my multi-vitamini promise to drink at least 1 liter of wateri promise to take a walk or walk on my treadmilli promise to eat one piece of fruit todayi promise to have a vegetable with dinner.let's see if i can keep my promises to myself.be blessed,cathy

	 wow...day 2!
	 
    


i walked again today during my lunch break. i was tempted to run an errand, but reminded myself that i have reserved my lunch time for me and everything else can wait until later. i tracked all my food yesterday and everything i've eaten today so far. i know it has only been a day and a half, but i am pleased with the progress i have made. now i just have to keep moving in the right direction. i'm trying not to think about the finish line yet...just got to push myself to get to the starting line first.be blessed!cathy

i just got back from a 35 minute walk. it has been a long time since i've taken a walk during my lunch break, especially one where i tried to walk fast enough to get my heart rate up a little. lately, most of my walks have been a fairly leisure pace or with the dog. i'm proud of myself for taking the initiative today. during my walk, i reminded myself that i never truly liked using my lunch break for exercise, but i always felt good afterwards. there is something about coming back to the office after exercise and being able to track my activitiy in my ww log.i know it has been a long time since i've been here. no excuses other than i was failing miserably at weight loss. i'm hoping to turn that around today...to stop dwelling in the past...but my pessimistic side doesn't know if i can do it or not. for today...so far...so good. i've tracked my food, drank 4 glasses of water, and exercised...baby steps for sure, but at least progress in the right direction. goals for the rest of today: track what i eat, drink more water, take my vitamin, walk the dog, and do a little stretching.hopefully i will be back tomorrow with a positive progress report. if not, then its probably because i'm not doing so great with this weight loss thing.be blessed,cathy :)
