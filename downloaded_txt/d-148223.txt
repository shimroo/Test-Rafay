                  seal of approval - narooma team’s sky-high effort  
            montague island burunguba is a small island located nine kilometres off the south coast of nsw near narooma. popular with tourists for the array of wildlife including the largest colony of little penguins in nsw, thousands of birds and a colony of fur seals.   when the nsw parks and wildlife team needed to update the 400-metre-long access track on the island, they called in the team from our narooma plant. the narooma team was asked to supply 90 cubic metres of concrete in three cubic metre loads across four days. the only way of supplying a project like this is with a helicopter and kibble. arrow_forward

            as part of our requirements under ged, we recently reviewed noise controls at wollert quarry to identify any plant and equipment that might emit unreasonable noise – either in volume, intensity, duration or character.  taking positive and proactive steps to meet the regulator’s noise protocols and limits makes us a good neighbour, and is also vital to the prospect of obtaining an approval to expand wollert quarry, which has the potential to release an additional six million tonnes.  arrow_forward
