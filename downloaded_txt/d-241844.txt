order processing scheduletraveling again:  tapeworks will be closed feb 11-27 as we travel to ecuador and the galapagos.you can always place online orders during that time but, nothing will be produced or shipped until after we return.normal turnaround time to process, produce, and ship most orders is typically less than 1 week.some digitally printed products may take 2 weeks.thanks for your patience!



rimstripes being produced from here forward will now only be available in 80” big rim sizes, to simplify things on our end. our remaining stock of 60” std rim rimstripes will be available until they’re gone.some vinyls have not been very popular (like dark greens and peach) and we will not be ordering any more of those vinyls.we are trying to stay on top of things, but with the wide range of colors and products offered, plus scaling back the manpower, surely some things will slip through the cracks.we recommend everybody take a deep breath, cross your fingers, watch the tracking, and have a few happy hours while waiting!  we apologize for the inconvenience. thanks- rob and ryantapeworks got its start in the late 1980s, with rob carting around a then state-of-the-art macintosh computer and a vinyl cutter to motorcycle races in new england. when the family moved to north carolina in 1992, the equipment came along, and tapeworks moved to a location on highway 401 in garner, then to a unit in monk's rental, to a unit in the superdroid building, to rob's basement in holly springs, and now their basement in weaverville.if we have made something in the past that you really liked, or if you were eyeing one of our kits, now is the time to order it!hi, ryan here, by the way; i'm rob's son, you've probably spoken to me on the phone, and ultimately i don't have the forty-plus years of knowledge about vintage motorcycles that rob has, and as such i have chosen not to take over the business. i appreciate my dad giving me a job these last eight years, but we both agree that it is time to move on to bigger and better  things. for me, that means music-related activities, and for rob, semi-retirement, traveling the world with barb, and riding his bicycles and motorcycles in the mountains.we are in talks about selling or licensing our patent for the stripe-it-all tool in order to keep it available, but we are not entirely sure what to do with thirty-plus years of logos and designs for all the bikes we have worked on in that time. we will also have lots of vinyl material to go through, and will probably end up selling all equipment. if you are interested, please reach out to rob at info@tapeworks.comwe still have every single design we have ever created in our computer system somewhere. generic kits, logos, flames, reproductions, custom work, it's all still here. let us make you some decals!for all of you reading this, thank you for your patronage. it has given us something to be proud of, and has kept us busy for the last forever!

“received the decal kit. and the new way your printing them is awesome. not see through at all. going to save me a bunch of time. many many thank you’s.”

— marc whitney - motorcycle restorer and painter




“i recently learned about your products. ordered right away, and applied your 6008 striping to my ‘67 chevelle ss (gray centers), and my ‘69 camaro restomod. wow! and the installation was a breeze. i’m waiting for more material from you so that i can do a few more cars!”

— don clark




“i mentioned several months ago that i was in the process of restoring a 1947 ford 9n tractor. after 2 years it’s finally finished. i used tapeworks striping tape on the rims as well as around the head light housings and an accent stripe down both sides of the hood. hope it meets with your approval. i’ve had a lot of positive comments on the finished product.  i loaded it up and took it to a local car, truck and tractor show and was awarded 3rd place in the tractor division and presented with an award as best participant.  i was quite pleased since there were tractors there that dated back to the early 1900s.  no doubt but what the stripes helped make the award possible.  as always, thank you rob and tapeworks for a great product and your continued support.  wishing you continued success.”

— dave sonnenberg




““when i got my 2015 torch red z51, with black wheels something just seemed to be missing even though i had red rotors.   it needed something to create a definition between the black tires and wheels.  i started looking for a way to get red stripes on the wheel without having to have them painted on.  then i ran across the stripe-it-all from tapeworks.  i ordered it with 1/4” 6032 fire red vinyl stripe.  i followed the instructions, watched the online videos and had no problem installing the red stripes on my black wheels.  it was just what i was looking for.  the stripe really pops and accents a separation of the wheels and tires.  they have stripes to match any vette colors.  i have had my stripes on for about 2 years with absolutely no problems coming off or fading.  i would highly recommend this product and i have on numerous occasions.  it looks great and it really lasts.  i can’t tell you the number of vette owners that have admired them and asked how to get them.  i just give them the tapeworks website.  very easy to install.  it takes a buddy to turn the wheel while you apply the tape.  also, to ensure good adhesion, be sure and clean the wheel thoroughly of all dirt, grime and wax prior to application.””
