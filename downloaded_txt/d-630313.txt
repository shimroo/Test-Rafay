to content: developing editorial products that advertisers believe people will read. why? because newspapers need advertisers to pay the freight.because advertisers are also readers, and if they believe people will read a newspaper's products, then they'll be willing to advertise in them.because this strategy works.*“church and state” separation is so pre-craigslist. newsrooms need to take their new ideas to their ad departments and ask, “can you sell this?”if the answer is no, then it's back to the drawing board. this is not reinvention. this is change we can believe in.**this is not selling out. while the advertising department has no right to control or dictate editorial content, they have every right to let the newsroom know whether a new idea will sell – because they're the folks responsible for selling it.it's the newspeople that make the newspaper. there's hope for them and the readers they want to serve. i know, because the newsrooms i've visited recently are making the changes necessary to reconnect with readers.editors and designers are taking a hard look at everything they do, beginning with their front page choices. they're realizing that many lead stories are barely worth the front page at all, while stories at the bottom of the page or elsewhere in the paper are more relevant to more people. they're revisiting the decision-making process behind their published pages and realizing they could have made better choices.from cheyenne, wyoming, to gainesville, florida, to duluth, minnesota, they're abandoning design conventions like "skyboxes" and "centerpieces" and "lead art," because these devices are often driven by images and content of little value to readers. now they're pursuing content that illuminates, educates, informs and entertains – and ultimately, sells.newspapers need to rewrite their playbooks. dominant images: who says we need them? editorials on the front page – why not, if they deliver the most compelling content? can user-generated content drive a new editorial initiative? you bet'cha!when it comes to change, most newspapers have barely scratched the surface. it's time to dig deeper – beginning with an approach that works for readers and advertisers.*in waterbury, connecticut, a zoned section that was losing money was redesigned to create a more appealing environment for advertising. as a result, ad revenue increased more than 600 percent.**in cheyenne, wyoming, a weekly entertainment tab that was losing money was converted to a daily broadsheet section to better serve readers and advertisers, earning a positive response from both groups. at the same time, cheyenne recast its front page as a marketing vehicle, and single-copy sales went up 15 percent.             do 6-column
