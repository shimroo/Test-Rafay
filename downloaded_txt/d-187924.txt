the eleventh district court of appeals is one of twelve  appellate districts in the state of ohio. our jurisdiction consists of  ashtabula, geauga, lake, portage and trumbull counties. article iv, section 3  of the ohio constitution provides the authority for this court to review  appeals from municipal and common pleas courts as well as original actions in  habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, procedendo and quo warranto.
the court consists of five judges who are all elected by  popular vote, serving terms of six years.â   each case on appeal is reviewed by a panel of three judges, one of whom  is randomly assigned to write a decision after reviewing the record and the  briefs filed in the case.â  the decision,  once released, can be appealed further to the ohio supreme court.
