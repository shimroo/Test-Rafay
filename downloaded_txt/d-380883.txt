security 
        monitor is a simple utility running in the background that sounds an 
        alert after a preset period of time  that a person (such as a night 
        watchman) needs to respond to (by a mouse/keyboard click or by entering 
        a password). 
        when the action is not executed within a preset time, the utility dials out to a 
        specified phone number (or list of numbers, if first one busy/no answer) 
        and plays a message or sends an email (optional), alerting authorities..
note:
    to use security monitor one of the following dialers must be 
        installed:
    - phone dialer pro
    - excel dialer pro
    - auto dialer pro
