how to become a real property appraiser (appraisal foundation materials) 





under the provisions of title xi of 
the financial institutions reform, recovery and enforcement act of 1989 (firrea),

congress gave the appraiser qualification 
board (aqb) the authority to establish the qualifications criteria (minimum 
education,

experience, and examination requirements) for 
real property appraisers. state appraiser regulatory agencies are required to

implement real property appraiser licensing 
and certification requirements that are no less stringent than those issued by 
the

aqb in the real property appraiser 
qualifications criteria. to review detailed steps on how to become a real

property appraiser nationally (by state)
