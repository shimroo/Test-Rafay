        updates & happenings

to 
        expedite the "grand unraveling" of the backlog, i'm not emailing 
        people when their bicycles are listed. i'll still be listing them right 
        here on the main page, and i've been highlighting new entries and old 
        favorites on the cyclofiend blog - cyclofiend.blogspot.com 
        - as i point out on the site, this is an adjunct to the more essay-oriented 
        blog i've been keeping at ramblings.cyclofiend.com.
if 
        you aren't getting the update notices via twitter, 
        you can use the rss feed 
        from the cyclofiend "announce" 
        blog to keep up to date on latest gallery additions. and now, i'm 
        also updating the new postings using pinterest.

        - singlespeed gallery update
with 
        one quick update session, i've already equaled the amount of singlespeed 
        bicycles which were added to the singlespeed gallery in 2011. yes, it 
        is equally humiliating and invigorating! 
shawn's schwinn continential, 
        bill's hardrock, kenny's 
        urban soul, laurent's 
        cambio rino and brad's 
        schwinn world sport.

2/24/12 
        - current classics gallery update
five 
        "new" entries, from the rather impressive backlog. david's 
        mario vicini restoration, john's 
        schwinn mixte restoration, ted's 
        gardin, robert's raleigh 
        and cyclotourist's rivendell 
        road - enjoy!
2/15/12 
        - restart/kickstart
as 
        i mentioned over on the cyclofiend.com 
        blog, this past year was going to be a crusher. i pedaled my way through 
        it and seem to have popped out the other side.
        now it's time to attend to all of the odds and ends which have accumulated 
        around here. 

order of business #1 - t-shirts:
        i've got a few left in all three styles. i think for this year, it's time 
        to redo the most popular design (hands-down the original "one cog 
        - zero excuses") in a new color. and while we did sell through most 
        of the other two designs, they were a bit more sedate in their sell-through, 
        and thus will be retired. 
so 
        - if you've been hankering for a new t-shirt and aren't looking for 2xl 
        or small, there's something for you here. 
        (if paypal insists on adding shipping, i'll refund it as soon as i process 
        the order.)
order 
        of business #2 - galleries:
        backlog, backlog...who's gotta backlog? yep - that'd be me. i have a chunk 
        of images from 2011, and even though the galleries have been dormant for 
        way too long, folks have continued sending photos and descriptions of 
        cool rides my way. my plan is to take small, regular bites beginning soon. 
        so "thank you" for your patience, and an even bigger thanks 
        to those who had sent in images.
order 
        of business #3 - ride more
        yeah, that one's kind of for me. last year was a little underwhelming, 
        mileage-wise, and as the final bits of mywork project played out, i had 
        to quit cold-turkey in mid-december, not clambering back aboard until 
        the beginning fo this month. yikes! 
suffice 
        to say, it was good to pedal again.
here's 
        to more, soon!

don't 
        know if i mentioned the rivendell bicycle 
        works pdf archive page which i'd cobbled together a while back, but 
        there are a couple new things there. 
if 
        you sent in photos and a description, make sure you check here or over 
        at the cyclofiend blog for 
        the most current updates.

 
share, 
        tweet or digg!
 


 
        i've started tagging on this little helpful widget to each gallery page. 
        it lets you email other bike junkies directly from the page - no more 
        copying of the url necessary! you can also share it via facebook, your 
        blog or any number of other interwebby locales. 
twitt, 
        twitter, twitterest - 
i've 
        added a twitter feed down a bit in the center 
        of (it should show up right below my t-shirt photos.) my plan is to use 
        this announcements of site updates. you can follow along here 
        if you are a-twittering, or there's an rss 
        feed as well. 
year 
        5: cyclofiend.com 2009 
        year-end wrap-up:
submissions 
        for 2009:
current 
        classics: 154 bicycles
cross bikes: 9 bicycles
single speed garage: 58 bicycles
working bicycles: 17 bicycles
this 
        year ended a little out of whack - a few bicycles submitted in 2009 did 
        not get posted that year, so those will be included in the 2010 totals. 
        
total 
        gallery submssions in 2009 (not including "revisions"): 238 
        bicycles -thank you one and all! 
there 
        are a total of 1213 bicycles presented in the four main galleries at the 
        end of 2009.

t-shirts 
        designs now available.
        "i've got downtube shifters...and i know how to use them!" cyclocross 
        "more cowbell" long-sleeved t-shirts have arrived - now 
        available to order - check 'em out here!

rbw 
        section updates:
        they will continue to expand, as i've got more things to get scanned and 
        added, but there are now model-specific pages for the atlantis 
        and romulus/redwood models. 
also, 
        i've redone the file architecture to make links a bit simpler - each one 
        can be found by adding the model name to "cyclofiend.com/rbw/". 
        for example, you could use cyclofiend.com/rbw/quickbeam rather 
        than using the ".html" ending as before. (they are now 
        separate directories rather than specific pages). this may matter more 
        to me than you, but it should simplify things a bit. (the old links will 
        just redirect, so you don't need to edit any links you may have. 
enjoy!
other 
        notes - 
a 
        few people have indicated that they'd rather not have a link to the their 
        email address in their gallery page. that can certainly be arranged, and 
        i'd updated the faq section earlier 
        this year to reflect that. 
the 
        default is that i include it, but other options are available more here.
 

thanks 
        to everyone who has taken the time to send in all the photos and descriptions 
        - it wouldn't be possible without your efforts!

thanks 
        for your support!
        i want to thank those of you who have taken the time to support the site 
        through your donations. as the word has gotten out about the galleries, 
        my bandwidth usage has grown noticeably, and i've had to upgrade the server 
        package to stay ahead of it. even a few bucks through the donation button 
        below helps out. thanks too for your emails - i appreciate all your kind 
        words about the site.
random 
        photos hint:
        if there is a bicycle you see in the random photos at the top of this 
        page, you can either <control>+click (mac) or right-click (windows) 
        and "view image". the name of the image should appear in the 
        address window of your browser. the number which appears before the ".jpg" 
        extension is the number of the bicycle in that gallery. for example, if 
        you see 22.jpg, then that is the image for #22. you should be able to 
        find that bicycle reasonably quickly. yes - i know it's a work-around, 
        but it's the best i've got right now... 

current classics and single 
        speed galleries now have thumbnail preview pages, where i've aggregated 
        the images.
'm 
        always looking for ibis catalogs or scans to fill in the missing years 
        in the ibis section - that means the complete 
        stuff from 1996, and the years from 1990 to 1993. as well . early items 
        appreciated, and if you own a time machine, please go back and tell me 
        not to toss out the fat tire flyers when i was moving...

          should feel lucky to have enjoyed his precense. his family have now 
          posted information 
          for memorial gifts. there have been a few reports of sheldon 
          brown memorial rides which took place on april 1st, which was sheldon's 
          day of product 
          prankery. harris cyclery has managed to act as a kof for this

workshops 
          of the ibobs
          a post on the ibob list prompted this little gallery. want to show off 
          your tool board? check out how other ibobs deal with a 6 foot ceiling? 
          this is the place!
current 
          classics gallery 
          a gallery of classic bicycles, built reasonably recently or still lovingly 
          ridden. also viewable as current classics 
          by maker, or via the thumbnail image 
          that appears randomly above
cyclocross 
          gallery 
          here's where you can find racing bicycle - with a twist: just bikes 
          for racing cyclocross. not all of them actually get raced, but they 
          could if they wanted to. either way, they definitely get dirt under 
          their nails.
single 
          speed gallery 
          one gear at a time. it's interesting how many of the bicycles so are 
          are actually single speed roadsters - i thought that most would be mtb's, 
          but one-geared coastables seem reasonably popular on the roadways! also 
          viewable by thumbnail image.
working 
          bikes & practical hardware 

          to say there is a wide variety of bikes in this section just doesn't 
          come close. some are adapted, some are purpose-built, some just ended 
          up mutating into a working bike. some would argue that all bicycles 
          are working bicycles, but hold your judgement until you view the working 
          bikes gallery.
gallery 
          faq page 
          the gallery needs your photos - yes, they are good enough and doggone 
          it, people like them! if you don't understand the whole "current 
          classics", "cross bike", 
          "single speed" or "working 
          bike" gallery thing, start 
          here. it also has a few suggestions regarding photographing your 
          bicycle
cyclofiend 
          blog
          most of my bike-centric natterings tend to show up on the ibob list 
          or the rbw onwer's bunch group, so the blog tends to some ride reports, 
          gear reapir details, other thoughts and musings, more nattering about 
          projects and gear, some stuff that is decidedly non-cycling like dogs, 
          orchids and the ongoing record of music which pops into my head while 
          riding. 
rivendell 
          bicycle works section
there's 
          a fair amount of rbw stuff here, and i've still got a good deal to add 
          to it. this section of the site began because it was hard to find photos 
          of rivendell stuff on their site, but since the redo a while back, it's 
          started to focus more on the different models, current and past, and 
          mines through the rivendell readers, catalogs, flyers, mailers and other 
          ephemera which i've collected ever since gw smacked me upside the head 
          with a reader and said, "hey, you like more interesting bikes, 
          check this out.!". 
ibis 
          bicycles
          after some discussions on the ibob list regarding model years, i started 
          working on  a reference page for ibis bicycles - 
          which contains scans of catalogs and other stuff which came from the 
          world according to chuck ibis. last addition: cousin 
          it & touche tandem catalog scans from 94/95.
i've 
          also added a couple of pages to the riding 
          notes section. it's not much to speak of yet.
thanks 
          to everyone for their kinds words of encouragement - this is great fun!
keep 
          those photos coming!
