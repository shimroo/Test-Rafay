panasonic pt-rz770



wide spectrum color with up to 7.200 lm (center) brightness
with the next generation of the dlp™ technology the rz770 series is delivering high resolution in detail and the dual laser modules outputting a brightness of up to 7,200 lm (center). due to the quartet color harmonizer the energy loss of the light source is reduced and the robust and heat resistant phosphor wheel of the pt-rz770 solid shine laser series produces scintillating images with unfailing reliability.
outstanding white balance and color reproduction
the quartet color harmonizer wheel mechanism captures a wider color space than comparable laser projectors, which allows white to be reproduced realistically on the screen. with conventional projectors it’s difficult to achieve an accurate white balance causing images to appear with a distracting greenish tint. panasonic’s quartet color harmonizer eliminates this negative impact by adding an additional yellow segment to the color wheel to produce whites with unparalleled accuracy for natural and realistic picture quality.
maintain image quality for longer use
thanks to the long lasting dual solid state laser modules, there are no lamps which needs to be replaced. the image colors and brightness degrades very gradually in consistent, linear fashion. as well as reducing maintenance hassle, out-of-the-box picture quality preserves longer
dynamic light control delivers better contrast
the pt-rz770 series directly modulates laser power output to achieve a high contrast with low power consumption. a digitally controlled frame-by-frame scene-linking modulation ensures highly precise output adjustment, while the accurate 10.000:1 contrast ratio is delivered even when bright and dark scenes are frequently interchanging.
vivid images in bright environments
panasonics premium system daylight view 3 prevents images from washing cut in well-lit environments and enhances brightness perception in multi-projector mapping applications by adjusting sharpness and gamma curves and correcting colors. the result is a greater visual impact even in challenging conditions.
detail clarity processor 3 – sharpness in the finest details
this unique panasonic circuit optimizes the sharpness of each image based on the super high, high, medium and low frequency components of the extracted image information. the resulting images are expressed with natural and convincing realism.
