step into our wonderful world of kindergarten: kidsfirst’s te ao kindy with around 70 not-for-profit centres across canterbury, central otago and the west coast.
for over 110 years our big backyards and cosy, welcoming indoor spaces have been filled with fun, laughter and learning. they’re special places where fully qualified, registered teachers help preschool aged children learn and grow at their own pace, through their own interests.
te ao kindy is all about the experiences, fun and connections that kindergarten fosters between tamariki, whānau and communities. it’s the colours, shapes, textures and sounds of the environment indoors and out, the thousands of exciting things to do and ways to learn, the opportunities and challenges of every new day, and the support and encouragement along the way.
and, it’s as much about whānau meeting others and being part of the kidsfirst family as it is about children making friends that could last a lifetime.
it’s a better start for the preschool years – one that is not just about preparation for school, but nurturing connections, supporting early childhood development and having fun along the way.
nau mai, haere mai, tauti mai – join us today.
