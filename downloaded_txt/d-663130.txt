high speed cnc mills





cim technologies has more than 30 years’ experience in complex surface milling beginning with electronic tracers. we have sold and serviced high speed fog milling machines since their invention by droop & rein 25 years ago.
we are cnc machining specialists supporting the aerospace and automotive mold & die industry. we offer a broad range of high speed and large capacity milling machines from starrag including droop + rein 5 axis fog machines and scharmann multi axis floor and table type horizontal boring and machining centers. we sell monforts – starvision bridge type, multi axis vmc.
we broker carefully selected used cnc milling machinery including high speed fog(s) mills, bridge type vertical machining centers, portal and gantry mills as well as horizontal boring, milling and gundrilling machines.
high speed cnc mills are defined by spindle speeds in excess of 18,000 rpm, feed rates in excess of 10m/min and acceleration rate above 2.5m/sec². a 5axis computer numerical control will produce complicated and precision cutter paths t produce a finished mold or stamping die with little or no hand finishing. this means faster production time and more precise surface geometry with lower cost and faster product delivery in any ferrous or alloy material.
