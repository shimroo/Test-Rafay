the hamden daily news has not been active since august 2008.
we have left the archives intact, which include everything ever written since the hdn's inception in august 2005. feel free to scan our three years' worth of coverage on town government, the schools, arts, crime, etc., as well as the musings from our dedicated columnists.
click here to enter the archives.

during our tenure, we broke many stories, dug into issues, exposed wrongdoing on both the town and school sides and gave kudos to those who did good works.
here is a small sampling of our more notable stories:
