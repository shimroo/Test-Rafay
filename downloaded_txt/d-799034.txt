before you apply, we encourage you to carefully consider whether consolidating your existing debt is the right choice for you. consolidating multiple debts means you will have a single payment monthly, but it may not reduce or pay your debt off sooner. the payment reduction may come from a lower interest rate, a longer loan term, or a combination of both. by extending the loan term, you may pay more in interest over the life of the loan. by understanding how consolidating your debt benefits you, you will be in a better position to decide if it is the right option for you. new credit accounts are subject to application, credit qualification, and income verification.


to qualify for a customer relationship discount, you must have a qualifying wells fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a wells fargo deposit account. to learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult with a wells fargo banker or consult our faqs. if automatic payments are canceled, for any reason at any time, after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. only one relationship discount may be applied per application.


if you extend your loan term, you may pay more interest over the life of your loan.


if you are a service member on active duty, an eligible spouse, partner, or dependent, or currently receiving scra benefits, please consult with your legal advisor prior to seeking a refinance of your existing mortgage loan. in some cases, a refinance may impact your eligibility for benefits under the servicemembers civil relief act or applicable state law.
