sublette 

          county located in western wyoming has a total of 5,920 residents. most 

          of these citizens like to boast that there is not one single stop light 

          in the whole entire county. sublette county is bordered by three mountain 

          ranges, the wind rivers, the wyoming range and the gros ventre, making 

          it a great destination for hunting, fishing, hiking, snowmobiling and 

          many other outdoor recreational activities. originally cattle ranching 

          was the main industry, now oil and gas drilling and tourism are very 

          important factors in the livelihood of this area. historically this 

          area is noted for its important role in the fur trade era of the early 

          1800's. the confluence of the green river and horse creek located in 

          the heart of the county is where six rendezvous were held. rendezvous 

          was a time of trading and socializing for the mountain men, trappers 

          and indians of that time. in pinedale, the museum of the mountain man 

          has been dedicated to preserving and teaching about how important these 

          historical events were to our area and also how they influenced the 

          rest of the world at that time. sublette county is a place that time 

          hasn't changed all that much and its people are still strongly connected 

          to their pioneer roots.
