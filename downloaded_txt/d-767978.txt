august 8 2004


a class action lawsuit has been filed against american express on behalf of cardholders.  the suit alleges unfair business practices, claiming that the company has been denying cardholders the 20-day grace period to make payments as stipulated in their agreements, resulting in late payments and subsequent finance charges for many consumers.  the suit further charges that the company delays mailing monthly billing statements to account holders so that statements are not received until at least approximately one week after the billing period closes.
