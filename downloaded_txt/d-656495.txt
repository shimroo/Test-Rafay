how much does it cost to ship a boat on average?





the cost to transport a boat depends on what type of boat it is, the popularity of the route aswell as the locations.  the rate also depends on the size of the trailer.  the length, width, height and weight.  is the boat over 8ft 6in wide.. if so, in every state in america it will require an overwide permit.  if the boat on the  trailer is over 13ft 6in high it will also require overwide permits and possibly escorts.our rates per mile to transfer a boat from one location to another varies.  in general the more miles it goes the less per mile the fee for transporting is.the easiest way to find out how much it is going to cost is to call us at 800-462-0038 to receive a trailer delivery price estimate.or  fill out a quote by clicking here

boat hauling safety guide. (inspecting your load before and during travel)                                    






                                       when moving a boat on a  trailer our safety guide will work.   our drivers are trained to do a walk around inspection on the trailer before hooking up to it, during travel and after the delivery has been made.   we start out by looking at the overall appearence of the trailer.  inspecting the trailer1.  look at the appearance of the trailer:  look for the obvious: loose siding or panels, broken or missing lights, or anything out of the ordinary.2.  tires: check the tire pressure of the trailer tires.  kicking the tires is not the best way to check for proper air pressure.  use an air gauge!  look foor dry rot, cracks, rips or buldges on the tires.  when a tire blows it can cause damage to your trailer,or boat,  slow your trip down and also pieces of your tires could hit another vehicles on the road.  when in doubt, change your tires. it will save you money in the long run.3.  lights: trailers are required to have lights on all sides.  the back lights, the side marker lights and the lights at the top front of the trailer called the center lights.  every state, city, county lights on trailers are mandatory.  clean the the light caps, replace bulbs if needed. check wiring.  you want all lights working.4. brakes: electric brake trailers must have a break away switch on them. before driver pulls away the driver should make sure the break away switch works. the driver should also make sure the trailer brakes are working properly too.  to do so the driver should place the vehicle shifter in drive and move the lever on the electric brake controller inside vehicle without stepping on brakes.  the trailer should immediately stop or slow down progress.  for air brake trailers, there is a hand valve that can be applied with the same respect.  yet for semi trailers, driver should know how to check for brake adjustment.inspecting the boat 1.  make sure all loose items are secure.  seat cushions can fly out during transport from wind.2. if boat has outboard motors make sure they are in safe or locked position for transport.3. for inboard boats make sure the props are either taken off or in a position they will not get damaged from loading and unloading the boat onto the trailer4. remove any boat cover from boat as there is a huge chance it will rip and come apart durning travel especially in high cross wind states.  even boat covers designed for transport will come apart.  we advise shrink wrap or nothing at all on boat.securing the boat to the trailer - make sure the saftey cable is attached, the winch line and for most boats motorcycle straps to the eye sockets in the back of the boat to the frame of the trailer.  also a tie on the stern to the tounge of the trailer.  if you straps across the whole boat make sure you put soft cloth so the strap does not rub against the boat itself.  also, do not tighten to the extreme as it could crack the boat. pull over in a safe place during travel multiple times to make sure the ties are not losing up and the boat is secure.the above information is only a few major things to look for before and during travel.for more information of the safety of moving boats please call us at 800-462-0038.to get a quotes for us to transport your trailer click here
