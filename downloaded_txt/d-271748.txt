hydrographic & structural surveys






“i was impressed by the thought process substructure went through in designing orion. they considered a lot of different design features — from the transducer mount, flow dynamics around the head, and propulsion system to vibration and noise dampening. they did the engineering and development and it shows.”

— alan nichols, chief of survey and mapping section, us army corps of engineers
