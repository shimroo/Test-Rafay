villa gamberaia






toskanische gärten
auf deutsch



i giardini di toscana in italiano




for centuries the landscape of tuscany,
        italy,  has exerted a powerful hold on the imaginations of
        italian city dwellers and foreign visitors with its human scale, and the
        merging of vineyards and olive groves into gardens and then into the
        villas themselves. with the revival of classical culture from the fourteenth century, 
        this landscape has been incorporated architecturally into the villas and gardens that grew in the environs of the cities of florence and
        siena, and later the villas created from castles, fortified abbeys and
        towers throughout the province.

        more than anywhere else, the topography here allowed use of hillsides and distant vistas. the
        early   renaissance villas and gardens
        were designed as retreats from public life in the busy city. they were
        the ideal place for humanist debate.

        gardens of the late renaissance and baroque periods became more
        elaborate symbols of power, adorned with rare plants, sculpture and
        water works. uniting natural and artificial beauty, they were designed
        to recreate paradise on earth, an achievable utopia, an accessible arcadia.

        after a period of landscape design in the english style in the
        nineteenth century, the tuscan formal garden returned in its most
        glorious form in the early twentieth century, this time designed mostly
        for wealthy foreigners, often by garden designers who were themselves
        foreigners, foremost among them being
   cecil pinsent, an english architect resident in
        florence.

        here we feature some of the lesser known gardens in the
   chianti classico wine region
        between   florence
        and sienna
        and throughout tuscany.
  		 














 villa gamberaia at settignano near florence







villa gamberaia is
                one of the classic florentine villas, with a "hanging"
                garden laid out to draw the eye to the splendid views out over
                the farms towards florence. astonishingly, it is possible to
                rent vacation apartments in converted
                farm buildings on the grounds, as well as to rent the entire
                villa. there is no better way to
                experience and understand what a villa meant in renaissance
                times.

                the villa is located on the
                outskirts of florence and  is worth a visit for the gardens alone
                - the gardens are open to the public by appointment. villa
                gamberaia can be reached from florence in 20 minutes by car and
                also by ataf bus number 10 (30 mins. from piazza san marco to
                the village of settignano plus a 15 minute walk to the villa).

 villa poggio torselli - visit this splendid tuscan villa








villa 
				poggio torselli is 
				already mentioned in the land registry of 1427 under its current 
				name and was then owned by the machiavelli family. in later 
				centuries, the property passed to the angiolini, the corsini, 
				the macalli and the capponi. in the 18 c, it belonged to the 
				orlandini del beccuto and finally to the antinori.

                the famous garden of villa poggio torselli probably dates from 
				the late 17 c, and consists of an italianate garden divided into 
				two terraces to the south and an english park area in to the 
				north. in the upper terrace on the south side, the original 
				arrangement with flower beds has been preserved along with a 
				very ingenious irrigation system, one of the best preserved of 
				tuscany.
