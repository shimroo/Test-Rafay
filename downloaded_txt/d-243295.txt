this uproarious comedy by larry shue is one of the funniest shows to ever hit the american stage. froggy, a british demolition expert who occasionally runs training sessions at a nearby army base in the deep hills of georgia, brings his friend charlie, a pathologically shy englishman who has just learned of his wife's newest infidelity, to a friendly lodge for a period of rest and relaxation. in order to protect him from having to speak with anyone, froggy tells the residents of the lodge that charlie is from an exotic foreign country and speaks no english. but some folks in these parts of georgia don't take too kindly to foreigners.

why would i subscribe?

  purchasing a season subscription can save you 10-20% depending on your seats, and you get to pick the seats you get and the nights you come. doing anything other than that would literally be fool-ish. ;)
