port of tampa
the seaport street terminal
651 channelside drive, pier #2
tampa, florida 33602
phone: (813) 905-7678



after a meal or a movie on tampa’s revitalized downtown waterfront at channelside, little wonder that locals and visitors get wanderlust for caribbean adventure aboard an expanding roster of gleaming cruise ships. the port of tampa, handling nearly half of all seaborne commerce passing through the state (and almost as much cargo as all florida’s other deepwater ports combined), also has caught on big as a passenger cruise terminal, aided in no small measure by award-winning convenience and amenities of nearby tampa international airport.


on florida’s central west coast, tampa’s nickname, the big guava, stems from when early pioneer gavino gutierrez unsuccessfully tried cultivating guavas commercially, failing because of climate and rising land prices. an area newspaper columnist was far more successful in planting notions that if new york could be the big apple, tampa could certainly be the big guava. consequently a latin-style halloween celebration called guavaween, based on the nickname, takes place in nearby ybor city each october.


any time of year, cruise passengers love the big guava’s semi-tropical climate and immediate access to the gulf of mexico, to a point where passenger counts have zoomed from 200,000 in 1998 to more than a million in 2004. projected growth is also of stellar note with more and bigger ships. it doesn’t hurt that tampa’s strategic location provides the most direct route to mexico, latin america and the caribbean, or that the port of tampa is the closest full service port to the panama canal. (home to a diverse traffic base besides people, terminal facilities encompass container, bulk, break bulk, ro-ro, and project cargoes, plus north america's largest dockside cold storage terminal.)


cruise industry leaders like carnival, celebrity, holland america and royal caribbean regularly sail from here as do other top lines such as radisson seven seas on occasion. historically, trail-blazer carnival launched tampa service in 1994, quickly adding a second ship in response to demand. in 1998, carnival introduced the 2,600-passenger sensation  specially designed to fit under tampa’s sunshine skyway bridge -- as the tallest ship ever to sail from the port of tampa. by 2002, carnival had posted a whopping 977 percent increase in passenger sailings from 1995, its first full year of tampa operation.  pushing numbers ever upward is november, 2004’s introduction of the 2,124-passenger carnival miracle for itineraries to grand cayman, cozumel and belize. holland america, also celebrating 20 years of sailing from tampa, in 2003 replaced the aging noordam with the 1,600-passenger veendam, sailing seasonally to key west, jamaica and mexico. in 2001, celebrity cruises became the third line to sail from tampa 
with zenith, since replaced by horizon. royal caribbean then joined the out-of-tampa fleet in 2002.


more ships equated to a growing port, spurring hillsborough county’s tampa port authority to expand garrison seaport center terminal #2 in 1998. then 2002 brought opening of terminal #3  a 110,000 sq ft state of the art facility with easy access to downtown tampa. that in turn spawned channelside improvements and added attractions such the florida aquarium and the ss american victory, being restored into a mariners memorial & museum ship. (among other watery developments, 2004 also brought debut of a marina at the doorstep of the tampa convention center, accommodating 24 to 28 boats of varying sizes. in all, the port of tampa now hosts adventure itineraries ranging from 4 to 14 days.
