the junckers carbon calculator tool
a quick and easy way to calculate the carbon footprint of different floor types
using the carbon calculator is straight-forward and requires no previous knowledge of gwp and co2e (carbon dioxide equivalent). by entering the total floor area into the tool, the results show how some flooring products cause an increase in the amount of co2 in the atmosphere, whereas others reduce it. products that reduce co2 are referred to as carbon negative. the figures clearly show how influential the choice of flooring is.

using the carbon calculator is straight-forward and requires no previous knowledge of gwp and co2e (carbon dioxide equivalent). by entering the total floor area into the tool, the results show how some flooring products cause an increase in the amount of co2 in the atmosphere, whereas others reduce it. products that reduce co2 are referred to as carbon negative. the figures clearly show how influential the choice of flooring is.
the results of the carbon calculator show how wood provides the greatest reduction in co2 levels. this is because wood acts as a carbon sink, absorbing co2 from the atmosphere as trees grow, and continuing to store it when it is made into a product e.g., flooring. as a solid hardwood floor can last for many, many decades, there is a substantial benefit to the environment.
