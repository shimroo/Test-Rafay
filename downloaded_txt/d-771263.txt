building robust practices for sustained wellness, connection, and powerjoin the action alliance in partnership with national, state, and local leaders in the sexual and domestic violence field for this exciting training and technical assistance initiativeread more virginia restoryation reportour final report from the virginia restoryation project reflects a workforce that is rich with an abundance of passion and commitment, but that is also experiencing depletion and burnout due to multiple colliding factors.read more sparking conversations about accountability and healingwhat if accountability wasn't scary? over the past few years, the action alliance and others in the movement have been contemplating how and to what extent our actions match our vision, particularly around responses to the spectrum of harm, including physical violence: will our current responses get us closer to equity and liberation?read more  


the action alliance is virginia’s leading voice on sexual and domestic violence. we seek a radically hopeful future and work to promote healthy relationships, create thriving communities, and build a more peaceful future.

 join us  










building consent communities
in our efforts to prevent sexual and intimate partner violence, it’s so important we not only take a stand against violence, but also envision healthy and joyful alternatives. this is why building consent communities is a key part of our work. we most often define consent as a clear and enthusiastic “yes,” which is an active, voluntary, and verbal agreement that happens as a process and a conversation. yet consent is not just about individual actions or behaviors, but rather exists within all relationship dynamics, cultural beliefs, and larger societal systems. building a consent culture requires we normalize and encourage the everyday use of consent in all interactions.  



 


 

forging peaceful families
the building healthy futures fund was created to establish a statewide revenue source for local sexual & domestic violence agencies to implement evidence-informed prevention programming to disrupt the interpersonal and social conditions (root causes) that give rise to sexual and intimate partner violence. 






 

promoting healthy campuses
the red flag campaign is the first statewide public awareness campaign to address dating violence and promote the prevention of dating violence on virginia’s college campuses.









advance policy


 
the action alliance is committed to ensuring that public policies address the needs of victims and promote a comprehensive approach to responding to and preventing sexual and intimate partner violence.
