a treasure trove of unseen early gd video is about to be unleashed





			yes, sorry the thread hasnâ€™t been updated but if you follow shaneâ€™s channel youâ€™ll get notifications when he posts new gd content. itâ€™s just been pretty spaced out with other things.

			firstly, thanks to @kerplunk!!! for bumping this thread up. i'd totally missed this before. but mainly thank you @pacejunkie punk for posting this. just watched full show. holy shit. this has blown me away, i'm gob-smacked. gd were awesome. and with the after show footage with guys in crowd, felt the atmosphere almost like being there with them.
 


	thanks again. you're a star.

			sorry to bump an old thread but is there any news on this? for me this is just as big as the album re releases we've been getting the past few years. would love some new stuff from this era!

			so are they playing dookie/ai or not 
	also i have a gut feeling that this time around if we do get a random deep cut it'll be from 39/smooth, uno or father of all (pollyanna included)
