theatres
                      throughout britain were closed for most of 2020 and 2021,
                      and some filled the gap by putting new and older
                      productions online. online theatre, both new and classic,
                      continues to be a significant supplement to live
                      performances, and we review them alongside our coverage of
                      current london theatre.

                what we do . . .
we
              offer authoritative, independent london theatre reviews. we cover
              london's west end, off-west end and fringe, and some theatre
              outside london, notably the annual edinburgh festival. we have a
              reputation for reliable evaluations, and if a show is bad, we'll say so. and
              therefore if we say it's good, you can believe us.





 


our
              dedicated off-west end, family and out of london pages offer links
              to leading theatres in each category. we list upcoming shows and
              offer insiders' hints on saving money on tickets.


whether
              you go to the theatre every evening or are planning a single night
              out, whether you already know what you like or want help choosing
              a show, theatreguide.london's reviews of past and current
              london shows will help you decide what to see and what to

                  stay up to date . . . 
unlike other theatre
                cities, london doesn't have a defined 'season'. new plays open
                and old ones close every week throughout the year, so
                bookmark theatreguide.london and check back frequently.
