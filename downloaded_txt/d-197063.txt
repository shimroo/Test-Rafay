law 12 - fouls and misconduct 2/16/2025petr of prague, czech republic czech republic asks...hellolaw 13:'however, an opponent who deliberately prevents a free kick being taken quickly must be cautioned for delaying the restart of play.'s1: the player stands in front of the ball (or at a slightly greater distance). the player does not interfere in any other way. the ball is not in play (the opponent has not yet played). can the referee show a yellow card just for standing there?s2: the player interferes. the opponent plays the ball anyway and the action continues normally. is it then necessary to give the offender a yellow card?thank you very much!...read the full q & a law 11 - offside 2/14/2025re:  adultken hughes of liverpool, merseyside united kingdom asks...player 1 is standing in an offside position â but this is not an offenceplayer 2 is onside heads the ballplater 1 comes to an onside position and head the ball to player 3player 3 is onside and scoresis any player deemed to be offside?...read the full q & a law 18 - common sense 2/12/2025zluvka of liberec, liberec region czech republic asks...hi, can the referee allow a player to leave the field while the ball is in play?then i don't understand this rule.'free kicks for offences involving a player entering, re-entering or leaving  the field of play without permission are taken from the position of the ball when play was stopped.'i believe that free kicks are taken from the place of the infringement, not from the position of the ball. is there an exception to this? thank you, zluvka...read the full q & a law 12 - fouls and misconduct 2/10/2025zluvka of liberec, liberec region czech republic asks...hi, the attacker runs with the ball at his feet to the last defender. it is about 35 meters from the goal. no one else can intervene.1a. the attacker moves the ball behind the defender. he is then fouled. (for me, it's clear dogso.)2a. the defender fouls the attacker with the ball at his feet. the attacker does not move the ball anywhere. at the time of the foul, the defender is closer to the goal than the ball. (i don't know here. i suspect spa, because it is not certain whether the attacker would go at the goalkeeper alone without a foul.)3a. the defender kicks the ball to safety with his foot. a split second later, he hits the attacker with his other foot.
