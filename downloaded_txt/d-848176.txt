history 



150 years of fraternity 











"fun, fellowship, and masonic principles" 



founded in 1872, shriners international is a fraternity based on fun, fellowship and the masonic principles of brotherly love, relief and truth.  with nearly 200 shriners temples in several countries and thousands of clubs around the world, the members of shriners international are known for their fellowship, brotherhood, compassion and generosity.  the fraternity established shriners hospitals for children as its official philanthropy in 1922, and continues to support it today, while striving to make the world a happier, better place. 



100 years of philanthropy 



shriners hospitals for children is one of the largest pediatric sub-specialty health care systems in the world, with locations in the u.s., canada and mexico.  our staff is dedicated to improving the lives of children by providing pediatric specialty care, conducting innovative research, and offering outstanding educational programs for medical professionals.
