farm. food. family. funwelcome to our family farm.
to your family farm.
to our favourite place.
to your favourite place.











opening april 17, 2025








welcome to our family farm.
we live here. we farm here. we believe in growing and in making and baking with the freshest farm flavours. we believe in recipes that have stood the test of time and in finding delicious ways to preserve and serve each season in our bakery and farm shop.
we also believe in family and in making memories on this farm. we raised our children here – feeding farm animals, playing outside. old fashioned farm fun is what we’re known for.
step inside our nineteeth-century barn and see what we’ve made and found. our incredible shop is brimming with fun finds, and our farm pantry shelves are positively packed with all of your farm favourites.
