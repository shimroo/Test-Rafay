          in 2025, most search engines are now focusing on providing definitive answers. they will display the answer in a snippet along with the correct source. this means you need to optimize your website so your content appears in this format. for example, if i search 'what is diamond podcast in wayne county?', the search engine will provide the answer and highlight the specific information you're asking about. see the screenshot below: https://lnkd.in/gerhihzu

          remodelers are adding this one thing to their website to get 40% more inquiries every week on autopilot:

educational lead magnets 

lead magnets are essentially valuable resources you create to answer a specific question, solve a problem, or address any objections potential clients might have, in exchange for their contact info. 

but why give stuff away for free?

when clients see the value you provide upfront, they're more likely to choose your services because you’re building trust. plus, you lower sales resistance because they’re already informed about your expertise/solutions before you even talk to them. 

examples of lead magnets for remodeling contractors: 
-a renovation planner 
-10 of the best kitchen floor plans
-standard measurements cheat sheet
-top 10 best plants to have for improved air quality

          choosing the right pos system for your dry-clean business

maximizing marketing with a tightly integrated pos system
for dry-cleaning business owners, a point of sale (pos) system can be much more than just a way to process sales. a good pos system can be tightly integrated with marketing tools, allowing you to understand your customers and target them with personalized campaigns. this integration can bring significant benefits, helping you grow your business and keep customers coming back.
getting to know your customers
one of the key benefits of a tightly integrated pos system is its ability to collect and store detailed customer information. every time someone makes a purchase, you can gather data like their name, contact information, and buying habits. this data can be used to create customer profiles, allowing you to understand who your customers are and what they like. with this information, you can send them targeted marketing messages that are more likely to catch their interest.
personalized marketing campaigns
with a pos system that integrates with marketing software, you can send personalized marketing campaigns to your customers. for example, if you know that a customer always brings in their suits on fridays, you can send them a special offer for a frida...

          who needs a crystal ball when you've got reverse sourcing?

ditch the traditional product search tools and go straight to the source. 

literally. 

contact manufacturers and ask for every sample they've ever produced. 

it's like having a product treasure map in your hands!

once you've got the samples, you can make informed decisions and place bulk orders—all from a single point. 

efficiency meets savvy spending.

want to save on time and improve your margins? here's your game plan:

→ reach out to manufacturers directly for a wider product perspective.
→ evaluate samples in your niche to spot top sellers.
→ negotiate bulk orders with favorable net terms.

remember, the best products aren't found, they're sourced smartly.

get into reverse sourcing and set your sales graph on an uphill climb!

          extra domain names? multiple domain names can be a challenge for a business. what do you do with them?

business acquisitions, old domain ideas, spelling variations, you name it. you have a domain name for it.

how do you point them to your main website? you’ve got a couple options:
🔀 change the htaccess file on the web server
🔀 redirect from your domain registrar
🔀 use a cname entry in dns (but not the best idea)

how many domain names do you have? what are you doing with them?

          local seo is not just for local “store” pages. it can also be a very powerful content play. growth skills first fractional chief marketing officer (cmo) client is an incredible thc seltzer and ecommerce brand. it’s hemp based and federally legal under the 2018 u.s farmbill.

as their fractional cmo i use seo to drive the most revenue and we have grown revenue monthly by 49% if you compare when we started in march to now. we are working on cracking paid media as well, but for now seo is the work horse.

all metrics including website visitor, email signups, sales, revenue and keyword rankings have grown tremendously. 

one of the seo strategies we are using is to use articles to dominate local searches with high intent.

-thc drinks in nashville 
-thc drinks in la 

to get people to visit and buy from the local store
or to take a chill pill, stay home, and let us ship you a wunderful experience.

all the local articles that rank have generated revenue with over 3x return on the cost of each single article.

plus, additional lifetime value since customers repeat purchase. 

how we do it: 🥋 
-ga4 location: pulled the top states that website visitors come from
-keyword research: analyzed the local terms with conversion intent
-distribution: looked at the states that we are in stores or bars like nashville, tn

-article briefs: used a.i tools to reverse engineer what it would take to rank and created a tight article brief.
-human writer: used a category expert writer to write the content.
-article publishing: generate 12+ articles a month.

this process let's us out rank major sites like weedmaps and claim the top three positions usually number one. it also works well because google ai overviews are not as prominent on these types of local searches so you can get a proper position one.

you can use this strategy for many different industries. we are about to do it for a new credit union client. i’m going to do a video on how we are using content for competitive conquesting in seo for this brand. it is scarily effective because if someone is searching for "drink like competitor name" and we show up. the intent is thirst quencingly good. 🍹 

i hope you take my advice to the bank. i’m rooting for you! 👏

          i really have them (the 160 new product ideas).

i need an investor. 

1-612-250-6869 
(8am cst - 8pm cst)

the longer investors wait, and choose to not invest into my new product ideas, is only going to prevent money from being earned, gained, received, and profitable. 

successful people (successful investors) care about others, and allow other people (me) to defend themselves with proof that the other person wants to prove, share, and show.

you will never know, learn, or find out things, if you don't try, ask, or listen.

i suggest you take a look at the bottom of the front page of...

i say...

if you're not always trying, then you're always failing!

          in the fast-evolving landscape of southeast manufacturing, adopting modern marketing strategies is crucial to stand out in the competitive market. here are three proven strategies to enhance visibility and attract b2b buyers:

1️⃣ **leverage local seo**: ensure your business ranks at the top of search results for local businesses seeking your products/services. this is vital for manufacturers targeting nearby partners or suppliers.

2️⃣ **showcase expertise through content**: create blog posts, videos, or case studies that demonstrate your unique capabilities and industry knowledge. providing evidence of expertise is key for potential buyers.

3️⃣ **utilize linkedin for lead generation**: engage with decision-makers on linkedin by optimizing your profile and running targeted ads. this platform offers a direct connection with clients seeking your solutions.

if your manufacturing business is not achieving the desired online results, exploring new strategies could be beneficial. i specialize in assisting manufacturers like you in achieving growth through customized digital marketing approaches.

          3 questions that will skyrocket your website conversions (... cro expert martin greif  swears by these):


a few weeks back i had a great conversation 
with marty greif, president of sitetuners on 
the brands and brews marketing podcast.

he dropped some conversion rate 
optimization (cro) gold.

here are the 3 questions every visitor 
subconsciously asks when landing on your site.

and why you need to answer them for them.

1. 𝗔𝗺 𝗜 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲?

consistency is key. your ad messaging 
should match your landing page language.


2. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼 𝗜 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗹 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗲?

first impressions matter. 

use a prominent banner with
 a strong value proposition.

display your phone number prominently, 
especially on desktop. it signals 
professionalism and boosts trust.


3. 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗺 𝗜 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲?

make your ctas crystal 
clear and benefit-oriented.


surround ctas with trust signals 
like testimonials or trust badges.


by addressing these 3 questions, 
you're crafting a user-centric 
website that drives real results.

          just received word that dealeron has completed their acquisition of sincro, a dealeron company.

the biggest question in any acquisition is why.

it's generally 1 of 2 things

more rooftops to insert current systems and expand market share, or new technologies to incorporate into the current book of business and grow revenue.

as an active dealeron affiliate, i'm curious to see what happens over the next 6 months. could be good. could be bad.

does anyone have experience with sincro sites or services? i haven't worked with them enough to draw any conclusions.
