welcome to fincher's white front
fincher's white front western 
  wear is located in the heart of the historic fort worth stockyards. the huge, 
  white, two-story building with the rust horse mannequin was originally the home 
  of white front western store, established in 1902.
the fincher family purchased 
  the store in 1967, and with only two different families owning the store, it 
  has been in continuous operation for almost a century. fincher's stocks a full 
  line of western wear from infant to adults. included are hats, boots, jeans, 
  shirts, 
  blouses, dresses, and suits. we also have cowboy souvenirs, western gifts and 
  rough stock riding equipment. fincher's may be located in a popular tourist 
  area, but real western families still continue to shop with us. third and fourth 
  generation customers enter our doors on a daily basis. the true reason for this 
  loyalty is that there is no place else with the kind of personal attention and 
  the knowledge of western products offered at fincher's.   there are 
  many other western stores, but how many of them have been serving customers 
  the same way for a century, where things are done the old-fashioned way. from 
  hand-creased hats to properly fitted boots, fincher's is the place for your 
western wear needs!
