exploring and camping the waterways of southern georgia.





overnight canoe trips on the beautiful flatwater rivers and waterways of south georgia is our specialty. trips range from overnight camping trips to custom designed trips lasting a week or more. we have many years of experience running and outfitting trips with individuals, girl and boy scouts, school groups, corporate team building trips, private, and family groups. we know the rivers, the camps, and where the fish bite.the rivers we use for our trips range from small intimate creeks to the largest river system in georgia. ducks, deer, beaver and otter are some of the wildlife you may see while floating and enjoying the scenery.the fishing is great, so be sure to bring your fishing gear. our rivers support a large, varied population of fish such as redbreast bream, largemouth bass, catfish and chain pickerel. we can’t guarantee a catch, but we can help you choose the lures and equipment that typically catch more fish.we run a little bit different guided trips in the okefenokee national wildlife refuge. we follow a well marked trail and camping is on raised platforms in the swamp. there are 120 miles of trails in the okefenokee, which have been designated as a national water trail. a canoe trip in the okefenokee is an experience that will last a lifetime.mild southern winter weather makes canoeing pleasant even in january, and slow moving waters give you plenty of time to soak up each ray of sunshine.take a look at our river trips and okefenokee trips, then give us a call to start your next adventure.






























river trips






altamaha river
the oconee and ocmulgee rivers come together just west of uvalda, ga, to form the mighty altamaha river. named for a yamasee indian chief, alatamaha, the altamaha is the largest river of the ga coast and the second largest river basin in the eastern united states. the river winds for 137 miles from the forks to the atlantic ocean and is relatively undisturbed except for a few fishing villages and vacation houses. wide, big, and slow, the altamaha’s flow is quite different from that of the area’s smaller rivers and streams. with the rains of spring and early summer the altamaha can flood with its waters sometimes reaching as far as a mile or more into the hardwood swamps and bottomlands that line both sides of the altamaha river. this is a great time to paddle to these swamps, which at other times of the year is only accessible with difficult hiking. lewis island natural area, located five up river from darien, is a mass of canoe trails and waterways. the island contains the largest known groves of virgin tidewater cypress and tupelo gum trees in georgia. late summer and early winter is the best time to paddle the main channel of the river. the water is low and clear and sandbars around almost every corner makes an overnight camping trip very relaxing and enjoyable. this is also a great time for fishing. many different species of fish swim the waters of the altamaha. the world record largemouth bass was caught in a lake on the ocmulgee river, a tributary of the altamaha. so make sure to bring alone fishing gear on this trip. the altamaha is a great river for overnight trips. for the adventurous spirit take a week and do the entire river. if that is not enough add one of it’s tributaries and do 2 weeks or more.
                            


oconee riverwith its headwaters in north ga the oconee travels over 170 miles before joining with the ocmulgee to form the altamaha river. it passes through the oconee national forest outside of athens into lake sinclair in milledgeville. after the last small dam south of milledgeville the river flows unobstructed to its mouth. sandbars and oxbow lakes become more frequent the further south the river flows. below dublin, rock cliffs, sometimes hidden from view, makes interesting side trips. flint and broken pottery can be found on the numerous sandbars. at places the forest bottomland swamp surrounding the oconee will extend for miles, which makes for a very remote setting.
                                you can spend a day, a night, or a week paddling this tributary of the altamaha




ocmulgee riverthe ocmulgee is born in the backwaters of jackson lake. below the dam it flows through the piedmont on its way to macon. the river is rather peaceful except for a few shoals. after macon the river slows as it makes its way through the coastal plain of georgia. as the river winds its way toward the altamaha; horseshoe bends, sandbars, and oxbow lakes, with a wide river corridor sometimes stretching for miles, makes for a wild and remote setting. during the week you may paddle for days and only encounter a few fishermen and occasional cabin.from macon to the mouth of the ocmulgee is approximately 200 miles. here it joins with the oconee to form the altamaha. 
                                this is a great river to spent a week exploring, fishing, or just relaxing.
                                




ohoopee riverthe ohoopee river, with soft white sandbars and clean black water, is truly one of the most beautiful rivers in south georgia. ancient and mysterious, the name originates with the creek indians. in the rivers upper reaches, a canopy of trees and vines almost always covers the water, with dazzling rays of sunlight dancing around you. farther down, the ohoopee opens up to reveal rare views of hardwood swamps and ecologically unique sand hill dunes. the riverâs dune system, in particular, differs significantly from others in the coastal plain and supports several endangered animals and diverse, but unusually stunted vegetation. canoeing down the ohoopee is an unforgettably spectacular and inspiring experience. one you do not want to miss. the ohoopee is dependent upon rainfall to be navigable by canoe. late summer droughts sometimes make it too low to paddle. fall, winter, and spring will usually have sufficient water for enjoyable canoeing.
                                the ohoopee is a great river to do a 2 or 3 day overnight trip..
                                







suwannee riverthe suwannee river’s headwaters rise from the depths of okefenokee swamp. flowing pass beautiful white sandbars and limestone bluffs, under a canopy of tupelo and oaks, the river travels for over 250 miles to the gulf of mexico. 
                                our trips are on the upper section of the river near fargo, usually 3 days long, paddling about 25 miles total for the trip.this is a beautiful, scenic section with only a few houses alone the way. small and narrow at the beginning, with higher bluffs and limestone outcroppings near the lower half. we will make camp on sandbars or bluffs alone the river and enjoy the serene sounds and sights of the suwannee..
                            


st marys riverthe st. mary’s river is an excellent paddling destination. originating in the famed okefenokee swamp, the scenic st. mary’s river serves as the border between southeast georgia and northeast florida. the river is known for its gentle curves framed by picturesque hardwood forests. plentiful white sandbars make for inviting rest stops and overnight camping opportunities. they are found at almost every bend, contrasting with the dark, tea-colored water. fishermen enjoy healthy populations of small- and largemouth bass, catfish and bream.

okefenokee national wildlife refuge






okefenokee national wildlife refuge
 the okefenokee, with its vast prairies and thick, almost impregnable cypress swamps, is one of the largest and most pristine wilderness areas in the eastern united states. it is in extreme south georgia, on the border of georgia and florida. there are two rivers that flow out of the swamp; the st. maryâs, which flows into the atlantic near cumberland island, and the suwannee river that flows into the gulf of mexico near cedar key, florida. at the headwaters of these rivers, deep inside the swamp, the tea colored water reflects beautiful moss covered cypress trees that line the lakes and canoe trails.the okefenokee swamp is more than 438,000 acres, of which 396,000 acres make up the okefenokee national wildlife refuge. inside the refuge almost 354,000 acres is designated a wilderness area, which means special protection for the plants and animals that grow and live in the swamp. vegetation is dense in the swamp and includes giant tupelo and bald cypress trees festooned with spanish moss, brush, and vines; where sandy soil is above the water, pine trees predominate. wildlife is abundant. over 200 species of birds and at least 40 species of mammals, which include raccoons, black bear, white-tailed deer, bobcats, fox, and otter. alligators and 50 other species of reptiles are found, as well as over 30 species of fish. on national wildlife refuges wildlife are the first priority. 
wilderness canoeing
there are over 120 miles of canoe trails in the swamp. depending on the trail, you will paddle through cypress forests and scrub-shrub areas, across lakes and wet prairies. visit some islands where indians and early settlers lived. nights will be spent on raised covered platforms. there you can relax, explore the surrounding area, or fish for the elusive chain pickerel while a meal is being prepared for you. witness nature in its natural environment. canoeing in the swamp is a true wilderness experience.
