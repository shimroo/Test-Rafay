explore our history








when you’re ready to get away without going far, you’re ready to visit norman.
with a rich history and a sustainable local flavor, norman provides ample opportunity to be who you are, where you are. this community goes against the grain, valuing quality over quantity and providing the best of both. norman offers ample opportunity to explore—with your body and your mind. big city amenities offer attractions and activities for those on the go, while the relaxed atmosphere and pace are reflective of a small-town community. located near the center of the country, you can get here from there! just down the road but worlds apart, norman is a town for all seasons (both weather and sports), proving a destination doesn’t have to settle to satisfy.
