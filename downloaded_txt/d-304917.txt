welcome
jesus commands us to “love our neighbors as ourselves.” (mark 12:31). accordingly, grace is a place for every body - all ages and stages; races and ethnicities; all sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions; those living with neurodiversity, disabilities and those who currently are not. as a community guided by the call of jesus, we are committed to growing in anti-racism and compassion for all marginalized people. through worship, education, service, and social activities we are always learning to love one another as jesus intends, with every body in mind. we  strive to be a community where you can share your talents and find a spiritual home.join with us as we experience god's presence together.
