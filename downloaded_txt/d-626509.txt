i love my altus flute. it has a vast variety of tonal colors ranging from warm and silky to rich and powerful. with its superb mechanism, in addition to the best intonation of any flute maker on the market today, i couldn’t wish for a better instrument.
denis bouriakov







it is an instrument that inspires me and allows me complete freedom of expression.
lorna mcghee







it has a veritable encyclopedia of available tone colours which are fascinating to explore but at the same time the flute plays incredibly easily, well and reliably.
michael cox







altus flutes capture the essence of human voice. and with william bennett’s scale being at the essence of making these instruments, an intonation of the flutes is excellent. great built and sound qualities go hand in hand in these superb flutes, which leaves no boundaries for musician’s artistry.
alena walentin







the right flute is not about what it can do, but what it can accompany you to do. it’s about finding the partner who will allow you to express your soul, realise your ideal sound, and support you in telling your story.
anna kondrashina







i love my altus flute. it has a rich and vibrant sound, which not only gives a singing, well projected sound in a hall but also records very well. i recommend the altus because i prefer the tone and intonation of this instrument to any other modern instrument.

today is sakura's day（さくらの日） in japan.🌸 people enjoy sakura-watching not only in the morning but also at night. while the sky gets dark, there would be lights illuminating the sakuras at night. in japan, people call it 夜桜 （yozakura）🌙🌸
what would you want to do with the yozakura? cuisine, drinks, or some flute music?

feb 22 is cat's day in japan!🐱🐱
in japanese, the pronunciation of "2" is "ni", and it sounds like a cat's meow in japanese ("nya"). that's why today is cat's day nya-nya-nya!!!
these two adorable pictures were drawn by wibb.❤️
we hope you enjoy the pictures, too.
