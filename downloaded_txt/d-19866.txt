we are the antique outboard motor club
 



collecting antique outbards since 1965in 1866, the first outboard device was patented. since that time, over 160 manufacturers have entered the industry – few remain. names like caille, waterman, walnut, lockwood, motorgo, columbian, gray and ferro are all forgotten except at aomci.your membership in aomci will provide you with a rich mixture of personal associations and accomplishments. you’ll meet interesting new people while following leads provided by the club to add motors to your collection; make new friends by joining a chapter of the club in your area or by corresponding with other members and realize a great deal of satisfaction and pride from participating in displays, shows and club meets. 











don’t miss out on all the fun!
 



									with a membership, you’ll have exclusive access to to these features and more
