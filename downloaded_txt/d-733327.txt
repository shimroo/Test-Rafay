amps judging training is online
the armor modeling and preservation society (amps) is a fantastic and unique organization for armor modelers. it is based on the idea to make every armor modeler better at their skills and reward well-executed modeling work. amps provides recognition and constructive comments for every model judged at a show.  each model is judged against a set of amps criteria, and no other modelers. to do that, all amps members are encouraged to become involved in the judging system in some capacity. our judging system is peer based, so we need many trained judges to ensure consistency and fairness at our many shows. 
training seminars are held at all international conventions, and at a many local and regional shows. we have now put the training presentations online so that you can train yourself. any amps member can access this training, and it is encouraged!  whether you are just starting to build armor models, or you have been building armor for a while, reviewing these lessons are bound to help you be a better modeler and increase your understanding of the amps judging system.
