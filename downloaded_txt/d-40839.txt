 brake pad dust

as if exhaust and tire dust and asphalt particles and collision trauma weren't enough: science alert: cars make one thing even more toxic than diesel fumes, study reveals
particle and fibre toxicology: copper-enriched automotive brake wear particles perturb human alveolar cellular homeostasis
we demonstrate here that brake-wear pm may perturb cellular homeostasis more than diesel exhaust pm. our findings demonstrate the potential differences in effects, not only for non-exhaust vs exhaust pm, but also amongst different sources of non-exhaust pm. this has implications for our understanding of the potential health effects of road vehicle-associated pm. more broadly, our findings illustrate the importance of pm composition on potential health effects, highlighting the need for targeted legislation to protect public health.

argentinian president javier milei backtracks on $4.4b memecoin after 'insiders' pocket $87m. they say "$4.4b memecoin", but they also say that after the rug pull it fell 95%, so i assume it's a $220m memecoin, at best.
abu dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund discloses $463m bitcoin etf holdings

bolts magazine: who runs our elections?
this page compiles, state-by-state, the local offices that administer elections at the state, county, and municipal level.
it lays out who oversees the preparation and conduct of the election, from the voter registration process to the casting and processing of ballots. the tabulation, canvassing, and certification of results is often conducted in a separate process, covered in our accompanying page, “who counts our elections?”

karol herbst's email removing himself from the linux kernel maintainers:
the moment i made up my mind about this was reading the following words
written by a maintainer within the kernel community:

"we are the thin blue line"
this isn't okay. this isn't creating an inclusive environment. this isn't
okay with the current political situation especially in the us. a
maintainer speaking those words can't be kept. no matter how important
or critical or relevant they are. they need to be removed until they
learn. learn what those words mean for a lot of marginalized people. learn
about what horrors it evokes in their minds.

yesterday, an office mate who uses more llm stuff than i do reported that xcode, apple's development environment, was suggesting using an nsimagerenderer object (which doesn't exist in the mac, though there is a counterpart, uiimagerenderer, on the iphone). other office mate was experimenting with the $200/month openai product, and the results were initially interesting, but fell apart on deeper inspection.
today comes the news that a weird conjunction of a couple of words across columns is making its way into scientific papers through the use of these automated bullshit generators.
(and if you missed it a few days ago, the bbc had a great takedown of using bullshit generators for summarizing.)

the hardest working font in manhattan:
some searches quickly led me to george gorton machine co., a wisconsin-based company which produced various engraving machines. the original model 1 led to model 1a and then 3u and then, half a decade later, p1-2. they were all pantograph engravers: they allowed you to install one or more letter templates and then trace their shape by hand. a matching rotating cutter would mimic your movements, and the specially configured arms would enlarge or reduce the output to the size you wanted.

 doge news otd

in san francisco, men claiming to be doge enter city hall and demand records on wasteful spending, fraud
“city hall building management has received multiple reports of individuals entering public and private specs in city hall through unlocked doors, while [filming] their interactions,” the manager wrote. “the individuals told occupants they are from the department of government accountability and that they want to insert flash drives to download evidence of corruption. they did not present a judicial warrant, and therefore, had no authority to access computers or non public spaces.”

elon musk’s doge posts classified data on its new website (same content on huffington post)
but an easy search shows that doge’s database provides details on the national reconnaissance office, the federal agency that designs, builds and maintains u.s. intelligence satellites. not only are nro’s budgets and head counts classified, but the prospect of musk’s tech team meddling in sensitive personnel information is setting off alarms for some in the intelligence community.

it's here, currently claiming 1,097 headcount and a $165.9m total wages.
interestingly, the about nro page at intelligence careers dot gov says:
we're a hybrid organization of 3,000 personnel from the intelligence community, members of the armed services and department of defense civilian personnel.

 unicode hidden data
 dan lyke
comments (0)

smuggling arbitrary data through an emoji. abusing unicode to stash arbitrary data in characters, that persist across copy and paste. in particular, this raised an eyebrow:
there are techniques for using subtle variations in text to “watermark” a message, so that if it is sent to a number of people and then
leaked, it’s possible to trace it to the original recipient. variation selector sequences are a way to do this that survives most copy/pastes
and allows arbitrary data density. you could go so far as to watermark every single character if you wanted to.

yale institute for social and policy studies: new research unveils why nimbyism alone can’t explain anti-development sentiment
the researchers have received a grant to build on the work prior to submitting it to a journal. in a working paper, they suggest that groups trying to spur more development can win popular support by emphasizing in their messaging or in the language of the policy itself how the effort will benefit groups with wide popularity, such as nurses, firefighters, and teachers. they write that government officials should consider that many voters do not have internally consistent or firm views on many housing policies, despite state and local laws that encourage gathering detailed community input prior to making policy changes or approving projects.

i thought i'd linked to something about how google's super bowl commercial had to be edited because the llm generated content was bogus, something like ars technica: not gouda-nough: google removes ai-generated cheese error from super bowl ad, but i'm not seeing it. so, anyway...
brilliant crank: ai wants to rule the world, but it can’t handle dairy, which begins:
    one of my first projects at ibm design was to find a way to make
    business process outsourcing “lovable again.”

and talks a bit about how snake oil gets sold to people who don't actually understand the business processes, and then gets crammed back in by the people reacting to edicts from above.
edit: pc mag: google edits 'gouda' gemini super bowl ad after cheese fan notices inaccuracies
a screenshot of the ai chatbot in the ad claimed gouda accounted for 50-60% of global cheese consumption. was it funded by big gouda, or was it just an ai hallucination?

moreover, while genai can improve worker efficiency, it can inhibit critical engagement with work and can potentially lead to long-term overreliance on the tool and diminished skill for independent problem-solving. higher confidence in genai’s
