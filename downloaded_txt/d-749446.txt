alta vibe











a new high

your experience begins on a little road at the base of the wasatch mountains.
the peruvian is a traditional european-style all-inclusive ski lodge in alta that offers nostalgic charm, top-notch dining and enough powder to delight even the most discriminating skiing enthusiast.


















our story

adored for decades, our building was once used as nurse’s barracks during world war ii, the structure was broken down, relocated & melded back together. in 1948, the peruvian was born and our story began.
now, over 75 years later, we’ve been accommodating camp-like traditions while encouraging the cultivation of new friendships year after year.









it's all real

this is alta. the people are real, the snow is plentiful and the views will take your breath away.
sure, we’re a little different. and that’s okay because our guests leave feeling taken care of, well fed and exhilarated from the best powder they’ve ever experienced.
