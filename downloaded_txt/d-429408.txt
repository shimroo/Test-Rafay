i. how the 
          watchtower society feels about examination of beliefs.


the 
                    truth that leads to eternal life 1968, pg 13we need to examine, not only what we personally believe, 
                    but also what is taught by any religious organization... 
wt, 
                    3/15/1969, pg 166 we need to examine, not only what we personally believe, but also what is 
                    taught by any religious organization...... 
is 
                    this life all there is?, 1974, pg 46, ...really, 
                    would you want to be associated with a religion that has not been honest 
                    with you?
aw, 
                    10/22/1973, pg 6, reasonable persons agree that the only fair method is to examine the evidence 
                    on both sides, both for and against a disputed theory. that is how one arrives 
                    at the truth. 
wt, 
                    8/1/1978, pg 12, ...different churches have published books and brochures for the purpose 
                    of âexposingâ   jehovahâs witnesses as heretics....calling another 
                    a âhereticâ or âfalse prophetâ...naturally, we are not afraid of this kind 
                    of publicity, because we know that it serves to awaken the curiosity of 
                    many honest persons. 
wt, 6/15/1985, pg 12,...for 
                    the purpose of getting the full depth of the thoughts explained...it requires 
                    digging deeper, putting forth effort to locate that older publication and 
                    then studying the pages...














ii. 
          the watchtower bible & tract society made these claims & predictions.

a. 
                  they claim to be a prophet. 

wt, 
                    1/15/1959, pg 40, 41whom has god actually used as his prophet?...jehovahâs witnesses are deeply 
                    grateful today that the plain facts show that god has been pleased to use 
                    them.
wt, 
                    4/1/1972, pg 197who

                    could not start before this composite âprophetâ ends his work.
aw, 
                    6/8/1986, pg 9, ...all of whom are prophets, or witnesses for god. in fact, they are known 
                    throughout the world as jehovahâs witnesses.

b. 
                  they claim to speak in jehovahâs name.

                    of the jeremiah class have been sent by jehovah to speak in his name......back 
                    up their  message by quoting the words, âthis is what jehovah has said.â 

c. 
                  they claim to be the official mouthpiece and channel of jehovah.

                    because it is his provision.
wt, 
                    1/15/1959, pg 40, 41...jehovah 
                    thrust out his hand of power and touched their lips and  put his word

                    uses the discreet slave as the visible channel, the viable theocratic organization... 

d. 
                  they claim to have a chosen and secret organization with special knowledge 
                  and angelic transmission. 


 vindication 1, 1931, pg 76 godâs 
                    organization is his chosen nation. 
preparation, 
                    1933 ,pg 36, 37, 64 ...transmission of information to godâs anointed people...the angels transmit 
                    this information, we know that they do it; the scriptures and the facts 
                    show that it is done...convey the thoughts to  their minds...to 
                      all on the outside of the organization of jehovah his is a 
                      secret organization.

 e. they claim jehovah instructed or used them 
                  on certain events.  

creation 
                    1927, pg 121because it was the lordâs due time to restore these truths he used  
                    charles t. russell to write and publish books known as studies in the scriptures 
                    by which the great fundamental  truths of  the divine plan are 
                    clarified. 

f. 
                    they claim they are the beloved wife of jehovah and  are our mother.

g. 
                    they predicted the following dates as the battle of armageddon. 


zionâs 
                    wt, 1/15/1892, pg 1355, reprint...âbattleâ is definitely marked in  scripture as october, 1914. 
the 
                    time is at hand, 1908, pg 101...the âbattle of the great day of god almightyâ (rev.16:14) which will 
                    end in a.d. 1914, with the complete overthrow of earthâs present rulership, 
                    is already commenced. 
the 
                    finished mystery, 1917, pg 398, 399, 485...the people who are the strength of christendom shall be cut off 
                    in the brief but terribly eventful period beginning in 1918 a.d. a third 
                    part are âburned with fire in the mist of the city.â .....after 1918 the 
                    people supporting churchianity will cease to be its, supporters, be destroyed 
                    as adherents,...also in the year 1918, when god destroys the churches wholesale 
                    and the church members by the millions.... 
millions now living   will never die, 1920, pg. 89, 90therefore we may confidently expect that 1925 will mark the return of abraham,   isaac, jacob and the faithful prophets of old...."

                    dates for the future and predicting what would come to pass on certain dates.... 
informant, 
                    may 1940the year 1940 
                    is certain to be the most important year yet because armageddon is very 
                    near.

aw, 
                    1/22/1969, pg 16other bible prophecies clearly foretell godâs purpose to bring this wicked 
                    system to an end in a few years.
aw, 
                    5/22/1969, pg 15if you are a young person, you also need to face the fact that you will 
                    never grow old in this present system of things.   .....all evidence 
                    in fulfillment of bible prophecy indicates that this corrupt system is due 
                    to end in a few years.  ....as a young person you will never fulfill 
                    any career that this system offers.  if you are in high school and 
                    thinking about a college education,  it means at least four, perhaps 
                    even six or eight more years to graduate into a specialized career. but 
                    where will this system of things be by that time? it will be well on the 
                    way toward its finish, if not actually gone! 
wt, 
                    10/15/1969, pg 622, 623...seventh millennium from manâs creation by jehovah god  would begin

wt, 
                    1/1/1989, pg 12  the apostle paul was spearheading the christian missionary activity. he 
                    was also laying a foundation for a work that would be completed in our 20th 
                    century. (this quote was later changed in the  wt bound volume to: 
                    he was also laying a foundation for a work that would be completed in our 
                    day.) 
in 2010 the generation of 1914 that would not pass away has changed  to  overlapping generations. see item ii k 


h. 
                    they blamed other religions for setting dates and called them false prophets. 

light 
                    1930, pg 47,they have been prophesying particularly since 1918, and everyone knows that 
                    their prophecies to date have not come to pass; and  that alone is 
                    strong evidence that they are false prophets. 
wt, 
                      10/15/1958, pg 613, âsometime between april 15 and 23, 1957, armageddon will sweep the world!...â 
                      so prophesied a certain california pastor mihran ask, in january 1957.....such 
                      false prophets tend to...... 
aw, 
                      10/8/1968, pg23...those in times past who predicted an âend of the worldâ, even announcing 
                      a specific date...they were guilty of false prophesying. 
paradise 
                      restored 1972, pg 353,354, jehovah, the god of the true prophets, will put all false prophets to shame 
                      either by not fulfilling the false prediction of such self-assuming prophets 
                      or by having his own prophecies fulfilled in a way opposite to that predicted 
                      by the false prophets.  false prophets will try to hide who they really 
                      are. 
wt, 
                      6/15/1974, pg 381similarly the âfalse  prophetâ is not a person, but is a system or 
                      an organization.  a âprophetâ claims to have inspired information for 
                      the direction of others. 
aw, 
                      12/8/1981, pg 14, since the bible speaks about only âone faith,â all of todayâs religious 
                      groups outside the one true faith must, according to this standard, be counterfeits, 
                      composite, âfalse prophets.

i.  they predicted other events. 

the 
                    truth shall make you free, 1943 ,pg 285,....man 
                    on earth can no more get rid of these demonic âheavensâ than man can by 
                    airplane or  rockets or other means get up above the air envelope... 
wt,7/15/1960, 
                      pg 444in 1942 the âfaithful and discreet slaveâ guided by jehovahâs unerring spirit 
                      made known that the democracies would win world war ii ....  âfaithful 
                      and discreet slaveâ has been tipped off ahead of time..... 

j. they say they are not a false prophet. 

aw, 
                    3/22/1993, pg 3, 4,  
                    they do not claim that their predictions are direct revelations  from 
                    jehovah and that in this sense they are prophesying in jehovahâs name.  
                    ......when their words do not come true, they should not be viewed as false 
                    prophets.... 

k.the 
                    generation of 1914 that would not pass away has changed to overlapping 
                    generations. (another failed prediction)

all 
                    the literature before 1995spoke of the generation that was 10-15 years old or born during 1914 would 
                    not pass away before armageddon. 
wt, 
                      11/1/1995, pg 14,... 
                      jesus was not departing from his established use of the term  âthis 
                      generationâ which he consistently applied to the contemporary masses..... 
wt, 
                      11/1/1995, pg 17rather than provide a rule for measuring time, the term âgenerationâ as 
                      used by jesus refers to a contemporary people of a certain historical period..... 
wt, 
                      11/1/1995, pg 19, therefore, 
                      in the fulfillment of jesusâ prophecy today, âthis generationâ apparently 
                      refers to the peoples of the earth who see the sign of christâs presence 
                      but fail to mend their ways.
wt, 4/15/2010 pg 10, he evidently meant that the lives of the anointed who were on hand when the sign began to become evident in 1914 would overlap with the lives of other anointed ones who would see the start of the great tribulation.

          the 1914 date is based on the fall of jerusalem  in 607 b.c. during king 
          nebuchadnezzarâs time. 

 a. it was taught for years that jerusalem fell in 606 b.c. then quietly 
                  changed to 607 b.c. so the numbers would add up.

c. 
                  ten of thousand of clay cuneiform tablets were found in mesopotamian area 
                  to back up the 587/586 b.c. as  the all of jerusalem. 


let 
                    your kingdom come, 1981 pg 186, 187, vat 4956: this is a cuneiform tablet that provides astronomical information datable 
                    to 586 b.c.e. it says that the observations were from nebucahadnezzarâs  
                    37th year. this would correspond to the chronology that places the 18th 
                    regional year in 587/ 6  b.c.e. however, this tablet is admittedly 
                    a copy made in the third century b.c.e so it is possible that its historical 
                    information is simply that which was accepted in the seleucid period.   
                    business tablets: 
                    thousands of contemporary neo-babylonian cuneiform tablets have been found 
                    that record simple business  transaction, stating the year of the babylonian 
                    king when the transaction occurred. tablets of this sort have been found 
                    for all the years of reign for known neo-babylonian kings in the accepted 
                    chronology of the period. 

d. 
                    society ignores validity of tablets. 

let 
                    your kingdom come, 1981, pg 186, 187, from a secular viewpoint, such lines of evidence might seem to establish 
                    the neo-babylonia chronology with nebuchadnezzarâs 18th year ( and the destruction 
                    of jerusalem) in 587/ 6 b.c.e. however, no historian can deny the possibility 
                    that the present picture of babylonian history might be misleading or in 
                    error. .....the inspired word of god it can be used as a measuring rod in 
                    evaluating secular history and views.

vii  
          the above described teachings around the 1919 date are 180 degrees opposite 
          to what is taught now. 

a. 
                    if the teachings were correct in 1919, when jesus chose the watch tower bible 
                    & tract society, jesus would have to abandon the wtbts  now because 
                    their belief system is totally reversed. 
b. 
                    if the teachings are correct now,  they  were  therefore wrong 
                    then, so on what basis would the  wtbts  have been chosen? 













viii 
          jehovahâs witnesses didnât recognize the 1914  date for jesusâ second presence, 
          they  thought the presence was 1874 up until the year 1943.

                    but in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. this shows, 
                    among other things, that christianity is not a denominational affair, that 
                    sects have nothing to do with it.

                      we are more likely to be right than the discreet slave. we should meekly

                      jehovahâs organization it is not necessary to spend a lot of time and energy 
                      in research, for  there are brothers in the organization who are assigned 
                      to that very thing.... 
wt, 
                      8/1/1967, pg469, 470 it is true that some points are difficult to grasp at first, but instead 
                      of complaining or arguing about them...... it may be better to leave it 
                      alone for a while, waiting further clarification....we must avoid complaining 
                      even about small things.... 
wt, 
                      1/15/1983, 
                      pg 27,....some who point out that the organization has had to make 
                      some adjustments before, and so they argue: âthis shows that we have to 
                      make up our own mind on what to believe.â this is independent thinking.  
                      why is it so dangerous? 
wt, 
                      3/1/1991, pg15, if we are jehovahâs witnesses, we should remember that our lives and others 
                      depend upon our obedience. each witness needs to keep pace with jehovahâs 
                      organization. 
wt, 
                      7/1/1994, pg12, 13, as loyal servants of jehovah, why would we even want to peek at the propaganda 
                      put out by rejecters of jehovahâs table...














xi it is not wrong for a person to expose a false religion.
                  



wt, 
                      11/15/63, pg 688, 689, it is not a form of religious persecution for anyone to say and show that 
                      another religion is false.  why should anyone practice a religion unless 
                      he is convinced that it is true and right?
scriptures:
                      
*** 
                          rbi8 matthew 12:36-37 *** 
                          36 i tell you that every unprofitable saying that men 
                          speak, they will render an account concerning it on judgment day; 37 for by 
                          your words you will be declared righteous, and by your words you will be condemned.â
*** 
                          rbi8  deuteronomy 18:20-22 *** 
                          20 ââhowever, the prophet who presumes to speak in my 
                          name a word that i have not commanded him to speak or who speaks in the name 
                          of other gods, that prophet must die. 21 and in case you should say in your 
                          heart: âhow shall we know the word that jehovah has not spoken?â 22 when the 
                          prophet speaks in the name of jehovah and the word does not occur or come true, 
                          that is the word that jehovah did not speak. with presumptuousness the prophet 
                          spoke it. you must not get frightened at him.â
*** 
                          rbi8  1 john 4:1 *** 
                          4 beloved ones, do not believe every inspired expression, 
                          but test the inspired expressions to see whether 
                          they originate with god, because many false prophets have gone forth into the 
                          world.
*** 
                          rbi8  ezekiel 13:8-9 *** 
                          8 ââtherefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah 
                          has said: ââfor the reason that you men have spoken untruth and you have visioned 
                          a lie, therefore here i am against you,â is the utterance of the sovereign lord 
                          jehovah.â 9 and my hand has come to be against the prophets that are visioning 
                          untruth and that are divining a lie. in the intimate group of 
                          my people they will not continue on, and in the register of the house of israel 
                          they will not be written, and to the soil of israel 
                          they will not come; and you people will have to know that i am the sovereign 
                          lord jehovah,
*** 
                          rbi8  matthew 7:15-16 *** 
                          15 âbe on the watch for the false prophets that come to 
                          you in sheepâs covering, but inside they are ravenous wolves. 16 by their fruits 
                          you will recognize them. never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from 
                          thistles, do they?
*** 
                          rbi8  2 peter 2:1 *** 
                          2 however, there also came to be false prophets among 
                          the people, as there will also be false teachers among you. these very ones 
                          will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that 
                          bought them, bringing speedy destruction upon themselves.
*** 
                          rbi8 ephesians 5:6-10 *** 
                          6 let no man deceive you with empty words, for because 
                          of the aforesaid things the wrath of god is coming upon the sons of disobedience. 
                          7 therefore do not become partakers with them; 8 for you were once darkness, 
                          but you are now light in connection with [the] lord. go on walking as children 
                          of light, 9 for the fruitage of the light consists of every sort of goodness 
                          and righteousness and truth. 10 keep on making sure of what is acceptable to 
                          the lord;




as 
              individuals, people make assumptions, state their beliefs, and even make predictions, 
              which may prove to be true or false. when stressing the claims the society has 
              made,  they elevate themselves to a special status,  such as  
              "godâs only channel", "god's beloved wife", "godâs woman", "jehovahâs theocratic 
              organization called  zion",  "our mother", "our parents along with 
              jehovah", and so on. in elevating themselves up on this pedestal and prophesying  
              these untruths such as the 1914, 1915, 1925, 1943 & 1975 predictions for 
              armageddon, they are guilty of the most serious of sins, false prophesying. 
              when an organization encourages others to accept their dictates as god-given 
              truth and behave according to certain expectations, then promises rewards for 
              doing so, and negative consequences for failure to do so, then that organization 
              assumes at least some responsibility for what happens to the people who actually 
              follow them.  accepting the role of leader implies some responsibility 
              to the followers. the society claims at times to be acting as god's special 
              representative on earth, but when faced with their failed predictions, then 
              they are just imperfect men, carried away by eager expectation. they claim that 
              jehovah has "touched their lips and put his word into their mouths". but, the 
              god of the bible is not a god of confusion;  he does not lie; he does not 
              light our paths with blinking, flashing, or partial light. (see scriptures below 
              for jehovah's perfect attributes.) jehovah has commanded us from the bible to 
              stay away from such ones making such false predictions.













jehovah's 
                perfect attributes. 


*** 
                      rbi8  numbers 23:19 *** 
                      19 god is not a man that he should tell lies, neither 
                      a son of mankind that he should feel regret. has he himself said it and will 
                        he not do it,and has he spoken and will he not carry it out? 
*** 
                      rbi8  psalm 19:6-9 *** 
                      7 the law of jehovah is perfect, bringing 
                      back the soul. the reminder of jehovah is 
                        trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.8 the orders from jehovah 
                          are upright, causing the heart to rejoice;the commandment of jehovah 
                            is clean, making the eyes shine.9 the fear of jehovah is pure, standing 
                      forever. the judicial decisions of jehovah are true; they have proved altogether 
                        righteous.

                      4 the rock, perfect is his activity, for all 
                        his ways are justice. a god of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice;righteous 
                          and upright is he.
