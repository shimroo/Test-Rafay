                                      discounts on kiloware
thanks to all
                                      the customers who made purchases
                                      large and small, we are now sold
                                      out of our standard range of
                                      kiloware. it's possible that we
                                      may have some odd bags in the shop
                                      now and again (as we continue to
                                      tidy up and clear boxes) but our
                                      price list is now obsolete. some
                                      boxes of kiloware were earmarked
                                      for sale through our auction, so
                                      these will appear in due course.

"retirement sale" big
                        mixes. 
we've got big stocks of this stuff
                      so we've decided to make up some special clearance
                      batches. our stock of these is of millions of
                      stamps so we'd be happy for you to buy a few
                      thousand !
                      each lot will be 500g of world off-paper, plus
                      200g of uk off-paper, and we'll also chuck in a
                      few odd "freebies" with each batch. (if you buy a
                      repeat lot we'll try not to repeat the same free
                      items. therefore if you are making a repeat order
                      please tell us when you bought your previous one.)
                      there will definitely be duplication among the
                      thousands of stamps you get, and please allow for
                      there being some damaged here and there. (there
                      might even be an odd stamp on-paper, etc. there is
                      so much stuff we can't possibly check each one.)
                      give one a go !
                      â£40 per lot
 
the big news
                is that robert murray is working towards
                semi-retirement. the selling-off of stock is underway,
                as a mix between retail sales, wholesale sales, and
                auction sales.

                we have stopped doing our "quick informative
                valuations", and we are not buying any material for
                stock. neither are we currently accepting material for
                sale by auction.
                we do however still carry out formal valuations (e.g.
                for insurance or estate valuation), and we can still
                handle gold coins etc. 
                if you are wanting to sell stamps, coins, postcards,
                banknotes, etc. we do have list of other dealers
                available - please email us asking for a copy.

                  we continue to run online auctions, now solely
                selling off our own stocks. see details and links
                elsewhere on this page.

                the retail shop is not open at any regular hours, though
                customers can visit by appointment, or can get in touch
                to arrange to pick up items they would like to purchase.
                  the retail shop will be open again on
                  friday 7th, saturday 15th, and monday 24th february
                  2025 from 10am to 4pm (not for valuations).
                          no appointment
                    required.
                    we continue to put out some new stock.
                      support from customers has been very
                    encouraging, and stock is dwindling !
                    keep watching here, and on our facebook
                  page, for notes about new stock etc. ***

                in the meantime, we are visiting areas of our very large
                stock, and we'll list below different categories as and
                when we can "go live" with them.


future plans
                in due course the shop will be closed, we will have
                disposed of our stocks, and we'll not be running
                auctions. however, bob murray will still be active in
                the stamps and collectables world - carrying out
                valuations, giving advice to clients with collections
                for sale, and connecting collectors/dealers/auctioneers
                where appropriate. with his lengthy experience he's well
                placed to point people in the right direction.
