manfred mohr is considered a pioneer of digital art based on algorithms.
after discovering prof. max bense's information aesthetics in the early 1960's, mohr's artistic thinking was radically changed. 
within a few years, his art transformed from abstract expressionism to computer generated algorithmic geometry.  further encouraged by discussions with the computer music composer pierre barbaud whom he met in 1967, mohr programmed his first computer drawings in 1969.
since then all his artwork is produced exclusively 
with the computer. mohr develops and writes algorithms for his visual ideas. since 1973, he generates 2-d semiotic 
graphic constructs using multidimensional hypercubes.
