recent additions


three sinfonias for brass trio
the inventions and sinfonias (bwv 772â801, also known as two- and three-part inventions), are a collection of thirty pieces for keyboard by j.s. bach, who had this to say about them: "those desirous of learning, are shown in a clear way not only 1) to learn to play two voices clearly, but also after further progress 2) to deal correctly and well with three obbligato parts, moreover at the same time to obtain not only good ideas, but also to carry them out well, but most of all to achieve a cantabile style of playing, and thereby to acquire a strong foretaste of composition." the sinfonias make beautiful arrangements for brass, and are great for instructional purposes, or in many performance situations (youtube).

here is the flower ("flower song" from carmen) for trombone quartet with optional tuba
every trombonist who has ever sat in the pit for carmen has thought about playing this solo! also known as "fleur que tu m'avais jetée," the flower song is a wonderful tenor aria from the opera by georges bizet. this arrangement features first trombone as the soloist. the bass trombone part is a little tricky, but a tuba part is provided in case you want to double it (youtube).
(feb. 12, 2025)



first movement from symphony in c for low brass ensemble
symphony in c is an early work by french composer georges bizet, composed when he was just 17 years old. the piece was never played in his lifetime, but it was eventually hailed as a youthful masterpiece on a par with mendelssohn's overture to a midsummer night's dream, quickly becoming part of the standard symphonic repertoire. the arrangement is for advanced players, with score and parts formatted for printing in booklet form. the parts have appropriate page turns for booklets, although each player has one place where they must reach and turn while playing. for the trombones, that place is during an extended passage in first position (youtube).
(dec. 20, 2024)



beethoven second movement from symphony no. 1 for trombone quartet
beethoven loved the trombone, making great use of it in three of his symphonies, but perhaps he didn't expect the instrument to one day perform an entire movement on its own! published in 1801, this early work of beethoven is strongly influenced by his predecessors haydn and mozart, but the frequent use of sforzandi and sudden key shifts mark it as something new. the arrangement is best tackled by professional-level players, who will enjoy employing their nuanced phrasing in the music (youtube).
(dec. 4, 2024)



tchaikovsky andante cantabile for brass quintet

hymn to jupiter (thaxted) for brass quintet

overture to the marriage of figaro for brass quintet
this arrangement of the overture to mozart's well-known and highly popular opera the marriage of figaro transposes the original key from d major to f major. it isn't too demanding endurance-wise, but all players will need good fingering chops! even the trombone part includes some fun licks to play (youtube).
(nov. 15, 2024)



madrigal suite for brass quintet

is your quintet is looking to play one of the greatest hits of the renaissance? look no further! here's an arrangement of josquin des prez's "most famous motet and one of the most famous pieces of the 15th century. the piece rose to extreme popularity in the 16th century, even appearing at the head of the first volume of motets ever printed. its revolutionary open style featuring early imitative counterpoint and two-voice parts has added to its acclaim as one of the most influential compositions of its time." (wikipedia) the arrangement takes care to follow the vocal phrasings as much as possible, making for a beautifully lyric addition to the brass quintet repertoire. range is moderate throughout, with many places for each instrument to have a little break (youtube).
(nov. 8, 2024)



hungarian rhapsody no. 2 for brass quintet
no. 2 is the most famous of franz liszt's 19 hungarian rhapsodies, and has been put to myriad uses in cartoons and popular songs. this arrangement covers the main highlights. it could perhaps be used to create some great "shtick" à la the mnozil brass, or victor borge! (youtube)
(nov. 7, 2024)



regent square for brass quintet and organ
organist henry smart was a well-regarded composer during the 19th century, but history has largely forgotten him, other than his popular hymn tune regent square. it is commonly performed with text from the christmas carol angels from the realms of glory. this arrangement has the trumpets contributing lyrical and fanfare elements throughout, and leads to an epic finale with a surprising harmonic twist (youtube).
(nov. 6, 2024)

(nov. 4, 2024)



morceau symphonique for two euphoniums or trombones
yes – you read that right. one of the most popular solos for trombone/euphonium and piano can now be practised and performed...without the piano! morceau symphonique has always been great for working on intonation in eb minor/gb major, with some eb major virtuosity thrown in at the end. of course this arrangement omits some of the rich harmony in the original piano part, but it's still surprisingly effective. it will be handy for practising your competition or recital solo with a friend, or playing it through with your teacher (youtube).
(oct. 31, 2024)



how lovely is thy dwelling place for brass quintet
a german requiem (the "brahms requiem") is an incredibly beautiful work for choir, orchestra, and soprano/baritone soloists, written by johannes brahms between 1865 and 1868. this abridged arrangement of the fourth movement (wie lieblich sind deine wohnungen) dials up the loveliness to level 10. it should work well for strong college or university musicians and above (youtube).

bach concerto italien for five trombones

(oct. 29, 2024)



coventry carol for brass quintet and organ

just in time for halloween! your low brass players can let their hair down with this wild arrangement of grieg's "in the hall of the mountain king" from peer gynt suite. we give this one a 4 out of 5 difficulty level because the bass trombone part is likely too hard for younger players. if needed, the part can be played on tuba. a bass guitar part is also included and may be useful (youtube).

(nov. 29, 2023)



sonata a 6 for two violins, four trombones and tuba
are you interested in early music? this piece is for you! giovanni battista buonamente was an italian composer during the early baroque period. his sonata a 6 was originally written for two violins, four trombones and basso continuo (probably played on organ). our arrangement adds a tuba part, allowing you to perform without a keyboard. the trombone parts were meant to be performed on sackbuts, but if you don't have those available your trombonists can simply play with a light touch. you might also place the violins in front for balance. there is a substitute horn (f) part provided for trombone 1 (alto). the tuba part could possibly be performed on serpent, ophicleide, or cimbasso – adding to the fun! (youtube)
(nov. 27, 2023)



six duos faciles for two tubas
the revised version of jacques françois gallay's opus 41, originally written for two horns, is a fun choice to perform in a concert as a soloist. these six duets are
particularly splendid and virtuosic, and as such represent an excellent choice for tuba players (youtube).
(nov. 23, 2023)



experiment #1 for brass quintet
the composer combines lyrical heroism with jazzy rhythms to create a beautiful and approachable work for brass. an effective technique used is to punctuate the music with periodic silences or unison moments. there are a few quasi-penny lane measures for first trumpet midway through, followed by some nice tuba solos, then the piece ends with an appropriately "what if...?" feeling! (youtube)
(nov. 21, 2023)

(nov. 2, 2023)



in the bleak midwinter for trombone choir
a simple motive is introduced and developed until the melody proper appears at a key change. the first verse of the carol is followed by a transition to another key change and the second verse. the piece builds to an epic climax, then dies away into a quite coda with some juicy harmony at the end. the arrangement is suitable for college-level ensembles or above, with range up to high c for trombone 1, and down to pedal ab for bass trombone 2 (youtube).
(nov. 1, 2023)



lascia ch'io pianga for trumpet quartet
this beautiful arrangement of the popular aria from handel's opera uses bass trumpet on the bottom. you can substitute euphonium or baritone (treble clef) if you don't have a bass trumpet handy. this piece is great training for student musicians to learn about playing with good line and intonation. it's also suitable music for many types of gigs. you can extend the d.c. al fine if desired, making a longer version of about 4 minutes (youtube).

(oct. 16, 2023)

joseph virgilio passed away earlier this year, leaving us with some beautiful music yet to be published. the five "expressions" in this collection show off both the lyrical and dramatic sides of the instrument's character. expressions for trumpet would make a good contemporary music addition to a recital, one that isn't too taxing in terms of technique or range (youtube).
(aug. 22, 2023)

(july 31, 2023)



march fantasy for low brass quartet or choir
written for a standard band or orchestra low brass section, this piece also sounds excellent with all parts doubled. an opening fanfare leads into a toe-tapping march, followed by a fugue reminiscent of bach, a tuba recitative and solo, a recap of the march, and a majestic finale. the bass trombone part could be played on a tenor trombone, but both 2nd and 3rd trombone will need f attachments (youtube).

cantiones duum vocum for two trumpets
cantiones duum vocum for two horns
cantiones duum vocum for two trombones
cantiones duum vocum for two euphoniums
cantiones duum vocum for two tubas
the cantiones duum vocum (or twelve motets for two voices) by renaissance composer orlande de lassus are excellent training tools for brass teachers due to the independent motion of each instrument. the parts also tend to land periodically on intervals of octaves, fifths, and major or minor thirds, making for great intonation practice! the trombone/euphonium versions are available in bass or bb treble clef, and additional transpositions are available upon request (youtube).

fantasia on christ arose for brass quintet, timpani and organ
do you need easter music for brass quintet? this is a great option if you have professional-level players. after a mournful opening statement by second trumpet, the piece goes into a fugue for brass quintet alone. the fugue can be cut if needed, making the whole piece about a minute shorter. it's followed by hints of a fanfare, then some beautiful espressivo music traded between brass and organ, and a dramatic grave measure. a timpani roll leads off a lively allegro that represents the resurrection. and of course, an epic finale!

we are proud to present this contemporary work by canadian composer leila lustig. according to the composer, the idea for the piece came from a couple of lines read in an online article about the devastation of russia's invasion of ukraine: "a resident of yablunska street told me that, when he stepped out of his yard on march 8th, he saw a road strewn with bodies and heard music. it was coming from cell phones ringing in the pockets of the dead."

recitativo & arietta for horn and piano
the work begins with a plaintive, unaccompanied melody for the horn in the style of a recitative, then continues as the piano joins in for a simple arietta. according to the composer, recitativo & arietta is a reflection on the all too few hours recently spent meeting a colleague in the flesh for the first time, after a good number of years of digital friendship! it means to merge the somewhat divergent musical styles we each pursue (youtube).
