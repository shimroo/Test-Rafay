 blown away! i had no experience in buying or selling a home. so, when i was looking for a real estate agent to help sell a house in fairfax  – i researched who was the top agent in marin county during these unusual economic times. and i found madeline schaider’s firm. my ex brought his own choice, but even he was blown away by her thoughtful observations about the property and immediate follow-up. madeline and her partner guided us through the whole complex process of preparing the home for sale. she helped prioritize what needed to be done to reinforce the value of the property. her best guidance was to have our own inspection. so we were able to remedy potential problems in advance. and even when a more serious issue surfaced, she already had the solution sourced and scheduled so we did not miss our target date to go to market. she listens, and communicated on a regular basis – so i was never concerned for a minute about the sale.read moreread less

 madeline did a fantastic job. if you are looking for a great real estate agent to buy or sell a home,   i would highly recommend madeline and her team. many years ago my husband worked with madeline to buy his first home in marin. he has always spoken fondly of working with her so we kept in touch over the years. so when it came time to sell the home, we reached out to her again. she did a fantastic job. the home had been a rental for well over a decade and was in need of a major facelift before listing. the process seemed absolutely daunting, but madeline made it easy. she has a team of people she works with and trusts and they made the whole renovation process painless and quick. madeline was great about getting the right information to determine the right price and we had offers immediately. sadly, the first offer fell through, but madeline was quick to get the house back on the market and within days we had another offer. communication was always great and she answered any and all questions we had. highly recommend madeline for your real estate needs!read moreread less

 madeline and alan were excellent in 3 main respects: knowledge, client-focus, and details. we recently completed the sale of our home of 38 years in larkspur. throughout the months-long process, both madeline and alan were excellent in 3 main respects: knowledge, client-focus, and details. 1. they provided savvy guidance from the start, their experience in the marin market and appreciation of our neighborhood were always evident. 2. both madeline and alan exemplify the combining of personal  with professional for their client during a most emotional experience. they were 'there' for us throughout. 3. the details. you both really came through with so many solutions, the right people to partner with to show our home at its best, and keeping tabs of it all...astonishing!  thanks to you both, our live's next chapter has begun. toni and i would highly recommend this trusted partnership of madeline schaider real estate to any one who values integrity and know-how.  sincerely,  tim king & toni gattoneread moreread less

 you couldn't put yourself in better hands. when we decided to sell our property in marin county california, we settled on living in marin, and madeline schaider as an agent and here is why i would do it again:  seamless assistance with upgraded, manicured presentation; “priceless” networking within the local real estate community to list at a fair price; white glove service with staging, landscaping, and code-required fixes; daily – sometimes hourly – communication of any and every issue along the way; ultimately, sale to a good buyer, whom my former neighbors will be glad to welcome. you couldn't put yourself in better hands.read moreread less

 madeline and her team are honest, knowledgeable, patient. we worked with madeline to purchase our first home and could not have imagined a better experience.  it was clear early on how much she cares and loves her job.  we had quite a long wish list that we were sure would not fit within our budget, but she managed to make it happen….and fast.  we are lucky to have had the team’s knowledge throughout the whole process.   we were purchasing from out of state which added a level of difficulty and they made everything so easy.  madeline, alan, and robert were amazing and helped us understand the entire process from reviewing the disclosures (so we didn’t miss anything), to the work that needed to be done and finding the right people to do it for the right price.  madeline would even meet them at the house and would weed the garden while waiting!  overall, madeline and her team are honest, knowledgeable, patient, and do whatever it takes to get you into the right house.  the best part is that they continue the relationship after the sale closes.  robert has made visits to the house when we have had questions and anytime, we need a recommendation, they respond to us immediately.  brian & sarahread moreread less

 madeline's knowledge of the market, suppliers, other agents and her persistence made the sale happen. we listed our condo with madeline because she and her husband, alan, had managed it as a rental for three years after we moved into a retirement community. during that time they were on top of every issue that arose and kept us well informed. so, when we decided to sell we went directly to them. the condo went on the market in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic and we immediately had a buyer who, a few days later, wisely put the transaction on hold. for 3 months, with madeline's help, we held on and she worked with the buyer's agent to make it happen. in early june escrow closed and both buyer and seller are happy. without madeline's knowledge of the market, suppliers, other agents and her persistence that would not have happened. she and alan  also performed a lot of "extra" tasks for us that, as seniors, we were not able to do ourselves we highly recommend madeline and her team. we are totally satisfied.read moreread less

 madeline and her team are efficient, honest, knowledgeable, patient, and willing to continue to open doors. madeline, alan, and robert are simply the best. we worked with them to find our dream home in marin that fit our budget, and to this day -- no buyer's remorse!  the moment you meet madeline and her team, you feel that they own the game of real estate. we were immediately impressed when we saw the team in action at open houses as they saved us countless hours. - madeline assessed the properties based on our taste and wasn't afraid to ask the hard questions upon arrival, which saved us hours of back-and-forth with the sellers' agents. - alan's extensive local knowledge of all the regulations and permits and is willing to walk to city hall to clarify any gray areas for the property and understand what permits might be necessary. - robert's expertise in evaluating the structural components allowed him to quickly assess what immediate, long-term, and nice-to-have renovations  would cost and how much time would be needed to make them.  overall, madeline and her team are efficient, honest, knowledgeable, patient, and willing to continue to open doors until you've found your dream home.read moreread less

 madeline and her team went above and beyond. madeline schaider was our agent when we bought our first home. she gave us an edge in a tight market by staying on top of properties that were coming on the market and getting us in to see them as early as possible. she patiently explained the details of the home-buying process and helped us find a fantastic home in a neighborhood that was ideal for us. when it was time to sell our home, the property needed some improvements. madeline and her team went above and beyond in recommending contractors, sourcing materials, and promoting our home to appropriate buyers. thanks to the help of madeline and her team, our home sold after the first weekend on the market, at a price well above our asking price. whether you're buying or selling, madeline schaider is a powerhouse of a real estate agent whose expertise will help you get what you want. i highly recommend her as an agent.read moreread less

 when we were deeply overwhelmed, madeline made this possible for us. i can't recommend madeline high enough. we were recommended to her by our mortgage agent and met with her a week after being pre approved. she invited us to her office to meet herself and her husband and explain their roles in the buying process. they asked what we were looking for and what our budget was. we thought that might be the end of the meeting, but immediately madeline thought of a property that hit nearly all of our wants. she took us to see it that very day.long story short, after viewing a couple more properties we decided to make an offer on the first one madeline recommended. we just moved into our new property and love it. madeline helped us fill out all the documents and close on time. her husbands expertise in navigating hoas helped so much. we were new to buying in general and between planning a wedding and buying a house we were deeply overwhelmed. madeline made this possible for us.read moreread less

 they are the best we've ever worked with. they should let you put more stars on these things.  we recently relocated to marin and lucked out finding madeline, alan and her team.  they are the best we've ever worked with.  they have an extensive network, and know every street, the nuances of the market, building code, reconstruction considerations, and more.  they didn't just help us find a house- they helped us find the right house.  they were there both when we needed them and when we didn't realize that we did.  we counted on them for their no-nonsense opinions, which we asked for a lot.  above all, we felt like we were in the caring arms of family.read moreread less

 they were intimately involved in every step and truly exceeded our expectations. madeline, alan, and their staff are top-notch agents!  this past year, we decided to sell our townhouse, so that we can eventually purchase a larger single-family home for our family of 4.  the proactive, thorough, and cooperative approach of madeline and alan, helped us to quickly formulate and execute a comprehensive plan to prepare our house for the sell.  they were intimately involved in every step and truly exceeded our expectations in regards to their attentiveness, support, knowledge, expertise, and resources.  they did not leave one stone unturned to ensure a smooth process to the very end.  what resulted was a home primed for the market, and a buyer within a week of listing the townhouse at a price above our anticipation!  what really impressed me about them were their welcoming availability, close communication, organized management and tireless work ethic!  they are passionate about what they do and very excellent at it.  soon after we sold our townhome in corte madera, madeline found the perfect, larger replacement home for us near my work and made the purchase happen effortlessly. . my wife and i couldn't be happier with them!  they are a rare gem!read moreread less

 madeline will prevent you from overpaying for a home or making a risky purchase. my husband and i have purchased two homes through madeline and plan to use her again soon.  marin county is a land mind of homes with unpermitted work and construction that does not conform to current building code.  the term "buyer beware" is something to take very seriously when looking for a home here.  madeline and her team know the codes inside and out, and will prevent you from overpaying for a home or making a risky purchase.  robert is a contractor on her team that helps answer questions on what additions/remodeling can be done and at what cost, and whether its even possible given the local restrictions.  he is a really helpful resource, and it's surprising that more brokers don't work directly with contractors.  robert went to the city of mill valley with us and talked with the building department about adding a bathroom to a home we were considering purchasing, but did not.  her husband alan is also on her team.  he read through a 100-page hoa agreement before we bought our last home, to make sure there was nothing out of the ordinary in it.  we've noticed how well-liked and respected she and her team are amongst the brokerage community, it definitely makes things go smoothly when buying a home.  and finally, her customer service is great!  she replies promptly to emails/phone calls, and always makes us feel like we are her only client, despite how many other deals she's working on at the same time.  if you're buying a house in marin, you need a team as educated as hers, or else you're doing yourself a huge disservice.read moreread less
