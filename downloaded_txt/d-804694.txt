what people are saying about indian river rv resort

¬†

‚Äúthis campground is impeccably maintained and has recently been completely updated. beautiful pool, new washing machines in the laundry, and the bathrooms are new and shiny clean. the campground is set in a nicely wooded setting with some elbow room between sites. to top all that,the owners are the nicest family that really care about you having a wonderful camping experience. this is the best campground experience i have ever had and this is my second time here. on the down side ... i can't think of a thing.‚Äù‚Äî barry



‚Äúi have went camping my entire life and this is the cleanest i have ever seen a campground/rv park. if you start your fires with random sticks, you may want to bring your own because it is that clean‚Ä¶ this is literally my only complaint‚Ä¶lol‚Ä¶ not a single bug in the bath houses like other parks. 100% will be going back!!!‚Äî elizabeth



‚Äúa wonderful family friendly campground! beautifully kept grounds and facilities. they escort you to your spot, bring firewood ordered to your site! the shop is charming, people are friendly and very helpful. the new laundry was clean and convenient to use. we are already planning a return visit!‚Äù‚Äî nicola



‚Äúabsolutely wonderful campground and experience. grounds are very clean, staff is wonderful, overall is it obvious they care about what they have. nice mix of older and younger campers, some children, although everyone was well behaved, none of the wild partying. we enjoyed it so much we booked two sites for next year before we left. can‚Äôt wait to show it off to family. it is within two hours of so many lovely west coast michigan cities and towns, and under 30 minutes to mackinaw city!‚Äù‚Äî mark



‚Äúmy husband and i have visited this campground before and have always enjoyed it. of all the campgrounds we‚Äôve been to, this is the one we‚Äôve come back to repeatedly. this year we decided to use this campground for our first ever family reunion. my siblings and i are all in our 60s and have never been able to take a family vacation. indian river rv resort was a wonderfully comfortable place for us to enjoy our time away from our busy lives! the campground is always clean and quiet time is enforced. the pool was beautiful, i don‚Äôt know what else i can say to convince you that this is a great place to camp!‚Äù‚Äî denise



‚Äúthank you! we enjoyed our stay. it was everything my brother said it was. great place, great people, very friendly and helpful üëçüëçüëç‚Äù ‚Äî rick
