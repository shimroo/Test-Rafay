european tour 1997












































    on feb.28,
 1997 robert griffin and i, both teachers at grand
 manan high school, left canada on a canadian air
 boeing767 for europe with 23 students in tow.
       as everyone had
 predicted, it was the trip of a lifetime. we had
planned the trip for nearly two years and spent many
months deciding what company we would book with and 
where exactly we would travel in europe. we finally
 decided to go with ef and to take a 15 day tour called 
"europe at leisure".
     we began to raise
moneyfor the trip in october 1995and over the course
 of the next 17 months, several students raised nearly
 $1000 each. most of them raised their spending money with
 pizza sales at school every friday,yard and food 
sales, lobster and scallop raffles,a variety show,
 booths at the rotary festival and the christmas 
market. when it finally came time to leave on the trip 
we had twenty-nine people-- 23 students, two parents,
 an adult student and her husband and two supervisors.
 the students ranged in age from fifteen to eighteen,
 the majority being in grade 12.
