	my uneditted life
	
  
when i dare to blow the whistle, i find out that even you don't dare to hear it.
this is my daily log for this year in which i will try to flash back to my past and create a book as my biography. being iranian in this century means there is a lot of stories behind you . it looks these days there will be a lot ahead also.

	 happy new persian year.....
	 



    img_0003   originally uploaded by roya parsay. it is our new year. first day of spring is our new year. march 21st. i made this haft seen as a custom we make. it is a table full of stuff starting with s which salam and health start with s in farsi. the items usually are sabze=green plants , sib=apple, senjed=a fruit of passion, sir=garlic, sekeh = coin , sumac= an herb and quran and fish and mirror on the side. vinegar and red fish too….so i wish my son could see my haft seen. we gather around it and i give him some new money from the middle of quran as we used to do when we were kids…. this is 29th year of being away from iran and not being able to celebrate new year in iran.   wish you all happy new persian year and it starts at 5:30 pm california time on tuesday march 20st… eide shoma mobarak….boos boos

	 how much is shah responsible for all this killed people?
	 
    


    7_8506310135_l600   originally uploaded by roya parsay. here is behesht zahra the cemetry for tehran people. most are the war's casualties. who should be blamed for it? a shah who left iran cause he was sick and could not take it anymore? a king's son who for years kept quiet and did not move seriously? i have to see yet my grand ma's grave, and then my mother's grave(in this same cemetry) and also my uncle's grave...does anybody out there understands the fact that too many iranians have not seen therir relatives and their graves for 26 years?? to whom shoukd we say about this tragedy?? shakespear??

	 jallad...nangat baad
	 



takhti was always loved by all iranians as mossadegh was....but he was not liked by the king same as mossadegh was not....takhti was pro mossadegh and for that matter his budget was cut by savak and also banned from going to any gym....thou he won gold medals  in wrestling...how sad.... students were shouting jallad nangat bad meaning executor..shame on you after they found his body in a hotel away from his wife and son (called babak) ... i remember my father went to the funeral that millions attende..people love a person and nobody cares about what people like...pity . to see his other picture click on header. well maybe now some are saying jalad nangat bad to saddam's executor..moqtada sadr? why not. here is his biography takhti, golamrezaborn in 1930.08.27, in tehran and raised in poor circumstances. he trained in a makeshift sports 2.jpg (11857 bytes) hall until he left tehran to work as an oil worker. after being drafted into the army he was introduced to freestyle wrestling, he won his first iranian championship in 1950, and became the first iranian wrestler to win an international medal when he gained a silver medal in the world championships at helsinki in 1951, followed by silver at the helsinki olympics. later he won gold in the 1956 olympics and the 1959 world championships.tahkti competed unsuccessfully at the 1964 olympics and 1966 world championships due to his being chosen for adverse political reasons. although he had retired from competition, the government of the time attempted to discredit him in the eyes of the people with whom he was extremely popular, particularly from an anti-government stance.  though he lost in the last two competitions his popularity was not diminished.his mysterious death in 1968.01.07 was "officially" listed as suicidalbut the popular opinion was one of political assassination by government forces./

why were they so much in a hurry? who are they?hya masked? well the judge said it is illegal to hang anybody in iraq during the eide period nad it was the eid of muslims period. 2 u dont capture and kill,3 u accept an appeal if u are a real court 4 muslims never shout moghtada sadr at that moment and the killers did. these killers and moghtada sadr and regime of iran are not muslims,they are 100 percent anti muslims and agang killing for 26 years..america open yuor eyes and  see why stuff happens under your nose and who does it.start from the masked men.....

	 reaction of the world to saddam's death,ashhado an la elaha ela allah
	 



    r2783643937   originally uploaded by roya parsay. he was dead politically anyway so why hang him?the world is reacting to that bad move. in india,pakistan,russia, korea and iraq and palestine pictures of news agencies shows anger of the world to this unwise political move just out of hatred and revenge. 3 people hung with some lawyers kiled in the process. human koind is faaar away from justice yet nad full of hatre. his last words were there is no god but alah and mohammad is his messanger. bravely standing there.no hanging death is accepted by europe and asia, but isnt it khamnei's turn before anyone else's?  o.k click here for another picture of hanging saddam being hung by masked men. why masked? what are you ashamed of?   ooo makes me wonder.....
