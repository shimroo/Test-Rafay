testimonials from resort guests




















 


we stayed here and had a wonderful time. the owners are helpful and welcoming. there are many things available for guests to do--swimming, fishing, canoes, kayaks, paddleboats, ping pong, pool. our cabin was wonderful. it was fully stocked with everything we needed. 

sheryl h 
									“a wonderful place for our family reunion.”								











 


wonderful place to visit! this was our first and defiantly not our last visit to kohls resort. the family that owns it is so very nice and inviting.. the cabin was very nice, clean and roomy... the pool and hot tub was very nice and a beautiful veiw from the outside hot tub.. 

jennifer t. 
									great family getaway!								











 


kohl’s resort has become our favorite place to get away. from the first moment we arrive, we are relaxed. the beautiful views and sunsets alone are good for the soul. the resort layout allows you to join in on the many fun activities that are available, or spend some quiet time by your fire or on the deck. the cabins are clean, spacious and comfortable. ashley and brian are so welcoming and friendly and take care of any questions. we recommend kohl’s resort to everyone!
