age grading & combined event scoring




age grading is an adjustment for a performance (time, height or distance) based on age – the older you are, the bigger the adjustment. the adjustment, known as an age grade factor, is multiplied by the performance to get an age graded performance so all times, heights or distances for each event by athletes from 20 to over 100 years old can be compared to each other! the age graded performance is the equivalent to what the athlete would have done when they were in their 20s.
