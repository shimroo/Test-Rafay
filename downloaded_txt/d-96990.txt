gi360 | joel e. mortensen, phd from doctor's data, inc. on vimeo.


the revolutionary gi360™ stool profile is a powerful, evidence-based tool to profile the microbiome using pcr analysis. the novel, focused dysbiosis index included in the gi360™ was developed and validated in a clinical setting, utilizing research-based methodology to discern dysbiosis vs. normobiosis. this expanded view of clinically significant bacteria offers actionable data to the practitioner, particularly in combination with the complementary methodologies employed by doctor's data in the gi360™ profile.
