click here for fancy new wordpress site



subway guitars has an extensive inventory of more than 3000
new, used, vintage, retro and custom-designed acoustic and electric
guitars,
basses, amplifiers, and parts awaiting you. for 45 years, subway
guitars has been the choice of professional musicians and beginning
guitar pickers.  ! the website is somewhat like the store itself: old, weird, full of awesome guitars  
but not necessarily the height of modernity. some of what you will see as you 
meander aimlessly through these dusty corridors may have been sold back in 1997 or turned into
post-post-modern planter boxes. however, we have a ton of great stuff, and are always making more. 
this site is something of a museum honouring our pre-digital past and giving you some idea of what we're all about.
if you see a 1957 harmony something or other, we may or may not still have it, but we certainly have others of its ilk.
as a used, repair and custom shop, our inventory is changing constantly, so, if you have any 
interest or questions just call
510-841-4106 
between noon and 6 any day but sundays and our expert staff of curmudgeons and crackpots will
be glad to help you out.   

bargains for musicians.
custom built, factory-direct, weird and crazy string instruments.
