polar, wind and geotailâs project overview. in the 1990s, collaborations between nasa, the european space agency (esa), and the institute of space and astronautical science (isas) of japan resulted in the international solar-terrestrial physics (istp) science initiative. polar, wind and geotail are a part of this initiative, combining resources and scientific communities to obtain coordinated, simultaneous investigations of the sun-earth space environment over an extended period of time.
