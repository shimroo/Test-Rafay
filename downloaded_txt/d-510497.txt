evangelion live action movie - movie chronicles



				this is a site about the live action movie of neon genesis evangelion. dedicated to everything new on this upcoming project. we support the project, providing it doesn't turn into one long cgi hollywood action-fest, which would quite obviously ruin the beauty of the nge series - "taint" is the word. however ignoring that fact, if this movie can build on the genius that is evangelion, the movie shall be a supreme one, most certainly worth watching.

evangelion movie discussions still moving forward
february 6th, 2009



ohayâ­ocon attendee chris adkins has been in touch to inform us that the stuâ­dio disâ­cusâ­sions and fight for final rights of the evanâ­geâ­lion adapâ­taâ­tion propâ­erâ­ties are in the midst of takâ­ing place, with everyâ­thing still going ahead given the sucâ­cess of that other big robot movie, transâ­formâ­ers. joseph cho is in charge of the the gainax/studio relaâ­tions and matt greenâ­field is hopâ­ing for some offiâ­cial announceâ­ments someâ­time in the next 9â months.
it cerâ­tainly is good to see some news, but we really want that announceâ­ment asap, weâre all still waitâ­ing with bated breath.
the news: in an evanâ­geâ­lion panel at the ohayâ­ocon animã© conâ­venâ­tion in columâ­bus ohio on janâ­uâ­ary 30th, adv direcâ­tor matt greenâ­field announced that sevâ­eral u.s. stuâ­dios are comâ­petâ­ing for final rights to the project, meanâ­ing that actual proâ­ducâ­tion should begin soon.  the delay on the project is due largely to the transâ­formâ­ers movie: the stuâ­dios wanted to make sure that a âgiant robotâ movie would appeal to an amerâ­iâ­can audiâ­ence.  the negoâ­tiâ­aâ­tions between the u.s. stuâ­dios and gainax are being hanâ­dled by joseph cho, who assisted in the proâ­ducâ­tion of âappleâ­seed: ex machinaâ, an aniâ­mated film based on the appleâ­seed series, so mr. cho has preâ­viâ­ous expeâ­riâ­ence in dealâ­ing with stuâ­dioâ types.
matt greenâ­field estiâ­mates that an offiâ­cial announceâ­ment, includâ­ing namâ­ing the stuâ­dio, the direcâ­tor, and perâ­haps castâ­ing inforâ­maâ­tion, would be made within the next 9â months.
thanks chris!

eva live action director and financing inâ place?
september 28th, 2007



accordâ­ing to one of our forum memâ­bers, zandor117, who was present at the adv panel at animã© weekâ­end atlanta, advâs david williams said that the evanâ­geâ­lion live action movie is now movâ­ing into proâ­ducâ­tion. we have seen no other report, even though the same panel was used to announce sevâ­eral animã© licenses that have been reported by repâ­utable animã© news sources.
accordâ­ing to zandor117, this is what wasâ said:
quesâ­tioner: âis there anyâ­thing new about the evaâ movie?â
david williams: âthe eva movie is now in productionâ
quesâ­tioner: âcan you tell us the director?â
david williams: âi am not allowed to say thatâ yet.â
adv has not yet comâ­mented further.
while this does not seem like full proâ­ducâ­tion (i.e. filmâ­ing actors) or even fully fledged pre-production like set buildâ­ing, the main conâ­crete news seems to be that aâ direcâ­tor has signed on, movâ­ing the project beyond the proâ­posal and develâ­opâ­ment phase. preâ­viâ­ously, negoâ­tiâ­aâ­tions were under way with aâ shortâ­list of direcâ­tors who had expressed an interâ­est, but the deciâ­sion had not been madeâ yet.

matt greenfield at animã© central 2007
may 16th, 2007



trivâ­ial being minâ­ion darthikari attended aâ panel at animã© cenâ­tral (acen) this weekâ­end. when the evanâ­geâ­lion live action project came up, matt greenâ­field said that the movie is still hapâ­penâ­ing, and that weta and undisâ­closed âbig namesâ are still on board, but that he could still not announce any details.
the only news here is that the staâ­tus of the evanâ­geâ­lion live action movie(s) seems unchanged by the announeâ­ment of the four-movie aniâ­mated re-make by gainax.
