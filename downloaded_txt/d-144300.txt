about jim






jim harrison's journey as an artist began when he first climbed onto a sign painter's scaffold on the side of mccartha's hardware in denmark, south carolina. the coca-cola sign that he worked on that day with his mentor, j. j. cornforth, was the first of more than 100 similar signs he painted over the next few years and shaped the future work of this south carolinian in many ways.
