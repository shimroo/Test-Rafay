-lucy e.





best diving experience ever!



-lucy e.




sams tours is one of the best diving experiences we ever had. the knowledgeable instructors were able to take us to sites and explain about underwater world. it's so cool that they all had pads and shared with us what we were looking at. the blue hole and blue corner were amazing. the current was not as bad as we thought it would be, but using he hook was so much fun. just like hanging out in the movie with a huge screen in front of you. the shop is friendly and helpful. strongly recommend.

-adriano l.





perfect diving logistic



-adriano l.




me and my wife dive a lot and we have never seen such a perfect diving logistic: the boats are great, awesome food, excellent diving gear for rental and perfect staff. neil is the best dive master we have ever seen!

very smooth running operation



-imis i.




we had excellent diving under guidance of this shop. it runs like well oiled mechanism and its pleasure to be part of the process. it’s obvious that all details have been thought of and been taken care of. its’ well worth it as these guys certainly deliver and earn their keep every day, every dive. jeremy and dustin is certainly "dynamic duo" fully aware of their surroundings and consequently deliver excellent dives tailored to interests and skill levels of divers on board. hats off!

fantastic snorkeling experience



-skip & nancy




sam's tours caters primarily to scuba divers but we are in our 70's and our scuba days are behind us. bell, the captain and jordy our guide were just terrific. there were only 5 of us on the boat which allowed us to move quickly to a variety of sights including german channel (which we drifted twice), jellyfish lake, big drop off, and the milky way. they also took us to a variety of other sights and then pointed out a series of unique islands on our trip back. we were the first boat out and the last one in and they made it special.

-dana b.





exceeded every expectation



-dana b.




our dive trip with sam’s tours was incredible. from the moment we arrived at the dive shop until we packed up our gear to leave, the service was outstanding. our guides on our 5 day trip, sharon and marc were exceptional. they kept us comfortable both on the boat and in the water. they were very knowledgeable about the dive sites and spent a lot of time briefing us on what to expect concerning water conditions and what types of marine life we would see. they were both friendly and very professional the entire 5 days. i would recommend this company to anyone looking for a great diving experience in palau.

9 days of great diving



-margie




we loved our diving with sam's. our guides were matt (an expert in fish identity, fish behavior and wrecks!), eve (can find about any kind of fish you're interested in including dolphins!), neil, rikki & mark. all were a delight to dive with and very determined to give you the best experience possible. the operation is efficient, always on time to pick us up at our hotel, and quick to haul our gear to and from the dive boats. highly recommend sam's for a trip you won't forget. (fyi - we have logged over 800 dives so we know a good operator when we see one).



-margie















sixth trip to sam’s!






i’ve been diving with sam’s since 2012, and i can’t recommend it enough. the dive shop is so well organised, everything runs like clockwork. the guides are great, nothing is too much trouble. just had another amazing trip, mantas, jellyfish and too many sharks to count. thank you, daniel, sean, sharon, jeremy, matt, rikke, joon, and the ever smiling jahan, you make me feel at home.













-oscar h
