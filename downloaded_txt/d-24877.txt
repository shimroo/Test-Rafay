 ford thunderbird 1958 - 1966 
touted as america's very first "personal luxury car", the 
              thunderbird line first appeared on the scene in 1955. 
              americans fell in love with the tbird from the very beginning, 
              when it outsold its competition - the corvette - by over 2000% 
              in its first year!  from 1958 to 1966, the ford thunderbird line 
              went through three major redesigns and continued to find praise 
              and acclaim at every turn.  it was the pace car for the 1961 
              indianapolis 500, the first individual model to ever with motor 
              trend's "car of the year" award, and was even given the honor of 
              serving the incoming united states president during the 1961 
              inaugural parade.

ford falcon 1960 - 1965 
while strongly promoted as the "compact" line of ford models, 
              the falcon was expressed in a wide range of designs - from 
              two-door
              to four door sedan to two and four-door station wagons and even a 
              full line of pickups, called the "ranchero".   in later years, the 
              falcon branding was even used on the passenger version of ford's 
              "econoline" vans!
throughout the 60's, the falcon ran over its competition, 
              such as the chevy corvair and chrysler valiant, and became an icon 
              of its generation.  the brainchild of robert macnamara (who became 
              famous as the president's defense secretary during the cuban missle 
              crisis), the falcon was touted by many big-name celebrities of the 
              day - including charlie brown and lucy from charles shultz' 
              "peanuts" cartoons.

 ford fairlane 1962-1967 
named after henry ford's luxury estate in (fair lanes) in dearborn 
            michigan, the fairlane model began as a full size luxury line and 
            evolved into a mid size automobile by mid 60's.  including lines 
            such as the fairlane 500 skyliner (with retractable hard top), the 
            fairlane included the famous thunderbird grille style and big block 
            v8 engines.
the line ran quiet in the early 60's and was re-introduced as a 
            mid-sized line that fell between the compact, racy falcon and the 
            full sized "galaxy" line.  as the decade progressed, fairlanes were 
            released in models ranging from the two-door sports coupe, sedan 
            models and even muscle car models with the thunderbolt line.
fairlane gained notoriety when it was featured in the james bond 
            film "thunderball"

 mercury comet 1963-1965 
the comet was the one line of car models to survive the whole 
            "edsel" fiasco.  originally intended for release as an edsel 
            car, the comet was quickly re-branded as a ford mercury product. 
            based on the falcon and maverick model lines, the comet was given 
            higher grade interior trim and a longer wheel base.  early models 
            closely parallelled falcon design, but continued with the unique 
            split-grille design of the edsel.
over the years, the comet line included many different car designs, 
            including two-door coupes, 2 and 4-door sedans as well as a station 
            wagon line and even a high-performance "cyclone" model.
in 2010, a woman in wisconsin was in the news for running her 
            original 1964 mercury comet over a half-million documented miles.  
            at 91 years of age, she told the news she had to have cruise control
            put in because she kept getting speeding tickets!
