applausi osteria



osteria applausi (applause in italian) is one of three italian restaurants owned and operated by the marchetti family in fairfield county. this successful family of restaurants grew from a very humble beginning when maria marchetti opened her restaurant, maria's trattoria in norwalk in 1983. since then, columbus park trattoria opened in stamford in 1985, osteria applausi opened in greenwich in 1994, and tarantino restaurant opened in westport the same year.restaurantbeppe cornacchia, co-owner and manager of osteria applausi, has been a vital part of the restaurant since 2002. prior to managing applausi, beppe lived in tuscany since 1985 and worked in many successful italian restaurants. he brought his vision of "la cucina italiana" to fairfield county so that our customers could experience the simple, wholesome and delicious dishes that are a tradition in italy.beppe also orchestrated the beautiful renovation of osteria applausi in 2010 to make the interior more metropolitan, giving it a sleek new york city feel in old greenwich. the menu was similarly updated to make it more contemporary and healthy.
