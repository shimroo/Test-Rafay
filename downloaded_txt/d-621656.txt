how do we help?















build the teamwe mobilize a large group of construction professionals and volunteers who want to serve god and your church. our ministry to the team members is always a priority. 



build the church & communitywe desire to minister to the church as well as the community through personal interactions. we invite the church members and community to join us as we work and worship together. our goal is that god would be glorified and your community would be encouraged.



























build the buildingwe consult with the church and contractors months before the construction week begins. we plan together with your construction team in preparation for a five day construction project. usually between100-150 volunteers show up to  frame the building, rough-in electrical, install the trusses and the roof all in a weeks time.














we show up with open hearts and willing hands, ready to come together to help grow god's kingdom. we aren't just a construction crew, we're a kingdom building crew and our mission is to reach your church body and the community while we're there. our goal is to get the church body and the community involved so they can get a new experience of just how good god is.
