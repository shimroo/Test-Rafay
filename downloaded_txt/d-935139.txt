camerata new york is privileged and proud to provide music on the highest level for the new york community for almost 25 years. concerts have been presented in the foremost venues of new york including: lincoln center, saint patrick’s cathedral, merkin hall, hamptons festival, joyce theater, and saint john the divine, among many others. we have enjoyed residencies at saint jean baptiste church (lexington at 76th) as well as the manhattan school of music, and collaborations with members of the metropolitan opera & new york philharmonic, while promoting talented students and graduates of juilliard, manhattan school, and the new school, among others. 
we are excited to have begun our collaboration with highbridge voices (bronx) in which we recently performed with the glorious young voices of the ensemble alongside ron blake, saxophonist of saturday night live, on june 19th at theatre at st. jean’s.

who we are…
camerata new york is committed to both showcasing a new generation of classical musicians and cultivating a new generation of classical music enthusiasts.
declining arts funding and the shutting down of numerous orchestras over the past few years have significantly reduced opportunities for worthy young instrumentalists.
camerata new york seeks to provide these talented emerging artists with regular professional performance opportunities on the highest level. the orchestra includes recent graduates of such top american conservatories as eastman, the manhattan school of music and juilliard.
discount tickets available by inputting promo code – “member”.
