warning:  this
  stallion ( "go boy's champagne pride", also known as "gunsmoke")
  may not be exciting enough for your taste.  (click on his picture to go to
  his page.)  this is the first time (on
  9/1/05) that he has been ridden in two years, and jennifer chose to ride him
  bareback.  she thought (actually hoped) that he would challenge her riding
  skills, and after a 20-minute workout with no misbehavior for her to practice
  her horse whispering on, she couldn't decide whether to challenge him herself or
  hug him, so she did both!!

these pleasure tennessee walking horses are ridden daily 
  through neighborhoods around traffic, dogs, 4-wheelers, 18-wheelers, school 
  buses, cattle, emus and we take them through the national forest, to the gulf of 
  mexico to play in the ocean, the river, organized trail rides, parades and even 
  an occasional show or two. we have relied on honesty, quality and integrity for 
  the last 15 years to maintain a solid reputation and these horses will be 
  exactly what we tell you. all vices/personality traits are disclosed up front 
  before you meet the horse. weanlings and yearlings tennessee walkers have been imprinted at birth, 
  taught to lead, stand tied, handle their feet, be clipped and load in a 
  trailer.  if you desire, we can arrange for a vet check on the horse you 
  are interested in, and for out-of-state buyers, you can check to see what your
  state requires for shipping a horse (from anywhere) into your state, as well as
  a list of equine transport companies, by clicking on the animated "hobo
  horse", above left.  (most of the time, all that is required is a
  negative eia (neg. coggins) within 12 months and a health certificate within 30
  days.)  all sales transactions are the jurisdiction of our barn in hardin,
  liberty county, texas.

i have found, through this website, that there are so 
  many wonderful, sympathetic people in the world and many of you have been 
  through situations like mine (nursing a loved one with a terminal illness). 
  cancer is a terrible thing, and the only thing i can think of worse is war. 
  thank you all for sharing your stories with me and for your support and 
  encouragement. you probably have no idea how much you've all helped with the 
  time you took to email, even those of you not inquiring about a horse. life is 
  short, even for healthy people, so live it up!  bless all 
  of you!  click  here for info,
