fingerstyle defined: 
					

fingerpicking, 
					or playing fingerstyle, 
					is a technique for playing the guitar, or some other stringed 
					instrument using the fingertips and/or fingernails, rather than 
					with a plectrum (or "pick"). it is used for classical guitar, 
					and some other acoustic styles, but it has found its way into 
					other genres as well. 


wikipedia
hybrid
					
picking 
is a guitar-playing 
					technique that involves picking with a pick (plectrum) and 
					one or more fingers alternately or simultaneously. hybrid 
					picking allows guitar players who use a pick to perform 
					music which would normally require fingerstyle playing.

american 
					fingerstyle defined:  

american 
					fingerstyle guitar is 
					a style of fingerpicking. it includes elements of blues, ragtime, 
					country, gospel, jazz, and many regional music traditions.
american fingerstyle guitar is 
					commonly played on steel string acoustic guitars with 6 or 12 
					strings. while it is played on just about every type of guitar, 
					these are most common and characteristic. music arranged for 
					american fingerstyle playing can include chords, arpeggios and 
					other elements such as artificial harmonics, hammering on and 
					pulling off with the fretting hand, using the body of the guitar 
					percussively, and many other techniques.
though not commonly used today, 
					the term "travis picking" was once widely understood to describe 
					the common style of alternating-bass fingerpicking used by american 
					fingerpickers from the 1950s into the 1970s, after the great 
					country guitarist and songwriter merle travis.
american primitive 
					guitar defined:
					american primitive guitar 
					is a subset of american fingerstyle guitar. it originated with 
					john fahey, whose first record album blind joe death 
					(1959) inspired many guitarists such as leo kottke, who made 
					his debut recording of 6 and 12 string guitar on fahey's 
					takoma label in 1969. american primitive guitar can be characterized 
					by the use of folk music or folk-like material, driving alternating-bass 
					fingerpicking with a good deal of repetitious ostinato 
					patterns, and the use of alternative tunings (scordatura) 
					such as open d and drop d
