‚≠êÔ∏è can i teach myself how to dance?
learning how to dance can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it can also be challenging to do on your own. while there are plenty of online tutorials and instructional videos available, these resources may not be tailored to your individual needs and skill level. without proper guidance and feedback, you may develop bad habits or struggle to progress in your dance journey.
that's why we recommend taking private dance lessons with a professional instructor. with one-on-one guidance from a skilled and experienced teacher, you'll be able to learn the fundamentals of dance in a safe and supportive environment. your instructor can help you master basic steps, improve your posture and form, and develop your rhythm and musicality. they can also help you explore different dance styles and techniques to find the ones that best suit your interests and goals.

choosing your dance teacher
starting dance classes implies choosing a teacher who corresponds to you in order feel comfortable and progress quickly. to choose a teacher, several criteria come into play. at first, the profile of the dance teacher must correspond to the expectations of the student. it is possible to ask which diplomas or experience a teacher has obtained and their teaching experience. they can have skills as a dancer, teacher or even a choreographer. the only thing that matters is that it fits the student. some teachers are more well-known or professional than others. however the price is then higher.
choosing a dance class and the teacher must be done according to your abilities and your desires. the price of a dance lesson must be in line with what a student can spend. the most effective way is to determine a price range and then see which teachers are within that limit. before recruiting a dance teacher, students must, of course, decide on the level of the classes. there's no need to hire a very experienced teacher if the student only wants to learn some basic dance skills to have fun.
on the other hand, if your goal is to train for a career in classical dance, a professional dance teacher will be the way to go. to make sure to encourage a student to begin their first lesson, it's best to choose a location that suits the student. otherwise, the long distance to travel to a class may discourage the student to start or continue their lessons. whether it's at a dance studio or a student lounge, it's important to find a location that is comfortable and accessible.
choosing a teacher also means choosing a dance style. classical dance classes, zumba lessons, rock lessons, salsa lessons, hip hop lessons, a teacher who knows how to dance the waltz does not automatically know how to do a pli√© as well. to practice several dances and learn a little of each style, you will have to find a versatile teacher. moreover, whatever the dance being taught, the teacher must, of course, be a good teacher- i.e. patient and attentive to their students.
what age should you start dancing?
this question arises very often when it comes to starting a new activity. many people are afraid of being too old to be able to attend a dance school or dance class. yet, you should know that dance is accessible at any age. the only difference is the exercises will not be the same for children as for seniors, or for beginners as for advanced students.
it is up to the teacher to adapt his dance classes according to his audience. even young students benefit from dance classes. the goal is to teach children to discover how to move their bodies. students discover coordination of movement and use of space. it's not really about the dance style or steps but rather about the initiation to movement and music. dance classes become a¬† bit more involved when children reach six or seven years old. at this age children are ready to perform flexibility exercises (within reasonable limits) and learn a bit of choreography. latin dances, modern dance, contemporary dance, musical comedy, waltz, ballet, group lessons for little ones make
it possible to become familiar with all different styles of dance in order to make a choice afterwards. it is also quite possible to start dancing as an adult. although flexibility is not as important as at age ten, exercise can get you back into shape and help you to build a healthy physical form as quickly as possible. viennese waltz, capoeira, tango, hip hop, paso doble, everything is still possible at an older age. and for the older students, the classes are just as well adapted to the physical form of the students. there is no age restriction to becoming a star on the dance floor.
which dance class should you choose?
each dance is special and the different styles of dances are not made for everyone. some prefer couples dancing while others prefer the more solitary dances. everything depends on the character of each individual and his musical affinities.
to choose a dance class, it is quite possible to consider taking advantage of a trial class. trying a dance style is the best way to see if you like it. specialized dance evenings and dancing bars are also an opportunity to test a dance style before embarking on annual dance classes. swing lessons, flamenco lessons, bachata lessons, belly dance lessons, dancehall, ballroom dance lessons, dance is a very wide universe that allows you to flourish whatever the dance style you choose.
you will also have to choose the course formula that best suits your lifestyle and your schedule. group lessons, private lessons, intensive courses? a dance workshop is a good way to improve quickly during your holidays. annual courses on the other hand, allow you to progress little by little, taking your time. everyone can find a style and schedule to suit their needs and embark on learning dance and having fun.
where can you take dance classes in the uk?
to find a dance class, there are several options. conservatories are perhaps the most famous dance centers. the courses are very strict and demanding. to enter it is necessary to pass an entrance exam. depending on where you live, you can find regional conservatories or national conservatories.
many conservatory students are destined for professional careers as dancers. for dance classes a little less demanding, dance schools are a great option. there are accredited dance schools and non-accredited dance schools. simply inquire with the school to find out if the courses you want are taught. cultural dance centers, music and theater, as well as dance associations are also good places to begin learning dance.
events are often organized and a whole community is created around dancing. private dance lessons also allow you to practice dancing regularly and according to your schedule. it is possible to find a teacher via classified ads on the internet or ads posted in shops. finally, it is also possible to take dance classes in high school or self-taught via youtube tutorials for example.
how much do dance lessons cost?
learning to dance on your own obviously doesn't cost anything, or almost nothing if you buy a dvd for example. however, taking dance classes with a teacher, in a dance school or with private lessons, requires a financial investment. conservatory dance classes can vary from ¬£ 100 to ¬£ 1000 per year.
this difference is explained by the difference between a national or regional conservatory, but also because the rates are adapted to the social situation of the student. school dance classes cost around ¬£ 500 a year, while in an association you will have to pay around ¬£ 250. by choosing private lessons, it will cost about ¬£ 25 per hour.
different criteria are taken into account such as the discipline taught (tap lessons, ¬†stretching classes, zumba, bar classes, argentinian tango lessons, cuban salsa and puerto rican salsa classes, hip hop dance classes, cha-cha, etc.). the geographical area also plays a lot on the price. but all budgets can find a great dance option for them!
