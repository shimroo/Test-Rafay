reviews
gamespy.com - adventure game of the year - "dreamfall stands so far out of the pack, we believe it would have been a stellar candidate no matter what year it was released". if gaming is ever to be more than merely colored lights and sensation, though, it needs these types of experimental projects to move forward. gaming may not yet be "art," but with dreamfall, we're one step closer"read the full review at http://goty.gamespy.com/2006/pc/index12.html (half-way down the page)gamespy.com - #8 best pc game of the year - "an amazing trip with some of the most fascinating characters you'll ever want to meet through some of the most breathtaking and wondrous scenery you're ever going to see "
