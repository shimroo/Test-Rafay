(although sometimes people have been known to dance in socks or dance shoes, socks can be slippery and dance shoes can accidentally squash toes, so you should be careful if you wear either.) i typically wear sweat pants, a t-shirt, and a long-sleeve t-shirt over that while warming up.avoid large dangly pieces of jewelry; they can get caught on or under something, which can be awkward and/or dangerous. if you need to tie your hair back, i recommend doing so with something soft — a scrunchy or rubber band instead of a hair clip.expect to sweat a fair bit, so you may want to bring a change of clothes. there’s filtered water at dance home, so there’s no need to bring any. experienced contacters often wear chinese kneepads, which are thinner than typical kneepads and allow more range of movement. however, you should be able to get through your first jam without any (and some long-time dancers don’t wear them at all). if you want to be super-prepared, you can order kneepads through the contact quarterly.— richard kimhow to start and end a dancethere is no set etiquette for asking someone to dance. at the la jam, the majority of dances probably start as the result of someone verbally asking someone else to dance. but dances also start in many other ways. sometimes dancing next to an individual or duo will result in a dance, as will wordlessly making contact with someone who is already moving in a “dancerly” way. sometimes, a chance collision between different sets of dancers will result in a change of partners.of course, just like asking outright, sometimes these methods don’t result in a dance. however, by and large, most people are at the jam to dance and appreciate any opportunity to do so.— james ysidroa dance ends… when it ends! you and/or your partner agree on when to end the dance. there is no wrong or right time to end a dance, and no wrong or right way to end a dance. be aware of when you might want to stop, be sensitive to your partner, and end the dance when you think it should end. dances can last (and have lasted!) from ten seconds to all evening.— richard kimvideo
