thai cooking school


hosting a cooking school is our way of sharing 12 years of experience importing the finest thai ingredients & cookware for our online thai grocery.  join us as we take you to the same kitchens and sidewalk food carts where we've produced hundreds of authentic thai recipes & street vendor videos.  meet our own family & friends in kanchanaburi, where we pull up a chair for you and share generations of cooking knowledge.
we'll teach you how to cook a variety of recipes in a clean and organized kitchen at a gorgeous riverside resort surrounded by organic gardens, fragrant trees, and immaculate tropical scenery.  you'll learn the fundamentals--true local flavors, how to control a wok, when to add spice, using a mortar & pestle, etc.  we also eat together at delicious local roadside restaurants, and we'll spend several evenings walking around a pedestrian area of the city where hard-working street vendors demonstrate their unique craft of delivering delicious meals on the spot right in front of your eyes.  a week-long adventure full of memories to last a lifetime (and some extra pounds to carry home).
