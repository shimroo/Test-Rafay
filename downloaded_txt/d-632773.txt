share your story

 





our wings were inspired by a butterfly – but they started with a big bird. this year, we’re celebrating 40 years giving wings to the wishes of over 1,900 texas children who have life-threatening medical conditions.
a 501(c)3 organization founded in 1982, a wish with wings was texas’ first wish-granting agency. the very first wish we granted was a big bird backyard playset for 5-year-old johnny m., and that was only the beginning of a long line of unforgettable moments in the lives of these special children.
take a look back at some of our most memorable wishes.
