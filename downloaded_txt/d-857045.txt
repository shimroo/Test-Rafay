hyphen press publishes books on design – in the largest sense of the word. situated in london, our books are mostly produced on the european continent, in the attempt to find good standards of industrial craft. we cherish writing that is lively, precise, free of jargon; pictures that are realistic, vivid. we try to make books that are good for the reader. (june 2018: go here for an overview of hyphen press activities.)

‘lettercarving for type designers’ 


 
hyphen press / 2024.12.07


alongside designing books, françoise berserik has worked for many years as a lettercarver – making signs, memorials, gravestones to commission. she has also taught lettercarving to students on the type and media course at the koninklijke academie van beeldende kunsten in the hague. they take it seriously there: this course is not an optional extra. now, with the support of the academy, she has written and published a handbook on this practice, written specifically for type design students and illustrated with their work.
