about us
graham sykes insurance, based in exmouth, has a notable history rooted in providing personalised insurance services. established in 1982 by graham sykes himself, the firm began as a small, family-run business focusing on bespoke insurance solutions for niche markets. over the years, it has grown significantly while maintaining its commitment to customer-centric service.
initially, the company specialised in kit and classic car insurance, capitalising on graham sykes' personal passion and expertise in these areas. this focus on specialist vehicles allowed the firm to carve out a unique position in the insurance market. as the business expanded, it diversified its offerings to include a broader range of insurance products such as event, home, travel, and business insurance, catering to a wider audience.
despite its growth, graham sykes insurance has retained its core values of personalised service and expert advice. the company's dedication to understanding individual client needs has fostered strong, long-term relationships with customers, setting it apart from larger, less personal insurance providers.
throughout its history, graham sykes insurance has embraced technological advancements to improve its service delivery. however, the firm has always ensured that these innovations complement, rather than replace, the high level of personal service for which it is known.
today, graham sykes insurance remains a trusted name in the industry, known for its expertise, reliability, and dedication to customer satisfaction. its longstanding presence in exmouth and its evolution over the decades reflect its ability to adapt and thrive while staying true to its founding principles.
graham sykes insurance was founded in 1982 and in 2023 joined noble insurance group, a privately owned group of specialist insurance providers. graham sykes is a trading name of noble insurance services ltd.
