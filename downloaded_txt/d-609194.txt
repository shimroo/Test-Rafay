stay current with your state aao leadership, and speak up to have your voice heard by the state dental boards.  i look forward to serving you and our profession this year. please reach out to me or any of your glao leaders with suggestions of how we can better support you, your practice, and your aao.  i wish you all a meaningful and wonderful holiday season.  warmest regards,  scott o. schulz, dds, ms glao president          news   glao leadership positions available  learn about the aao national advocacy network (nan) volunteer opportunities  aao state advocacy toolkit featuring dtc resources  dr. anthony m. puntillo elected to the board of directors of the american board of orthodontics news and information regarding covid-19  learn about the aao donated orthodontic services program!
