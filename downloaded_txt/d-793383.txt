what it does: this cookie is used by the wordfence firewall to perform a capability check of the current user before wordpress has been loaded.
who gets this cookie: this is only set for users that are able to log into wordpress.
how this cookie helps: this cookie allows the wordfence firewall to detect logged in users and allow them increased access. it also allows wordfence to detect non-logged in users and restrict their access to secure areas. the cookie also lets the firewall know what level of access a visitor has to help the firewall make smart decisions about who to allow and who to block.
wf_loginalerted_(hash)
what it does: this cookie is used to notify the wordfence admin when an administrator logs in from a new device or location.
who gets this cookie: this is only set for administrators.
how this cookie helps: this cookie helps site owners know whether there has been an admin login from a new device or location.
wfcblbypass
what it does: wordfence offers a feature for a site visitor to bypass country blocking by accessing a hidden url. this cookie helps track who should be allowed to bypass country blocking.
who gets this cookie: when a hidden url defined by the site admin is visited, this cookie is set to verify the user can access the site from a country restricted through country blocking. this will be set for anyone who knows the url that allows bypass of standard country blocking. this cookie is not set for anyone who does not know the hidden url to bypass country blocking.
how this cookie helps: this cookie gives site owners a way to allow certain users from blocked countries, even though their country has been blocked.
