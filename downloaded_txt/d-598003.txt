what customers are saying





rv queen of the south
my car was making a “weird” noise, so i took it to first tire & automotive. turns out, the power steering rack needed to be replaced. i didn’t google the estimated cost until after i agreed. turns out, the cost was right on par with what google said it should be. what a relief! the team kept me up to date on the repairs through constant communication. they also gave me a list of recommended repairs and the cost so i can plan for the repairs. very happy with my experience.




tony levasseur
ive been using first tire & auto for over a decade. my son had some issues with a used car we just bought him. i took it in to get diagnosed and the guy christian was super cool and honest. of course when you take your car in to a shop, your on your toes, but christian and his team promptly diagnosed my sons car and gave me an honest verdict that could have been a tragedy for my wallet. they definitely have earned my trust and will use them again for future services.
