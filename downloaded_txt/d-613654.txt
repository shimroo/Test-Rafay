"love the green head and yellow grip.
love the way the ball rolls with topspin."
wendel peterson, reunion - braselton ga
 


 
 red - green - white or black putter heads  
you  select the   putter grip.

 


1. no other putter design allows a golfer to swing as slowly and 
        make the ball roll as quickly with pace and accuracy.          



        2. top spin roll and full transfer of energy from the putter to equator of the ball are the main features.          


 3. loprofile putter design expands on the wedge "belly hit" used when the ball lies on the fringe or in rough 
        near green.   


 4. go ahead! try the sand wedge "belly hit" next time you play. 
      see how quick the ball rolls with topspin off 
        the blade.
