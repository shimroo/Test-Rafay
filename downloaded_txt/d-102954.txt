press release


	the village of mantua would like to thank governor dewine and the ohio epa for the award of the h20 
	chloride reduction grant. this grant will enable us to purchase the equipment necessary to spray road 
	brine (liquid salt). by using road brine it will reduce the amount of rock salt used throughout the winter 
	months and make our roads safer during snow events, while also greatly reducing the amount of rock salt 
	runoff that pollutes our rivers and streams. the village of mantua is thankful for this opportunity and

invasive species: jekyll and hyde in our own backyards!

plant species have complex personalities, and it's important to know the good, the bad, and the ugly to make decisions about planting and eradicating.
invasive plants wreak havoc on our natural environment, deteriorate the health of our landscape, and burden the economy of a rural, agricultural community like ours. these plants can be beautiful, useful, or profitable; some of these invasive species used to be recommended, even. but they escape our backyards, they harm local treescapes, and they damage native areas, so they have since been outlawed and removed from zoning codes.  
the shade tree committee needs your help to combat these mr. hyde-like invaders. 
here's the problem, why you should care, and how you can help: click here to read more.

				a little history
mantua village (pronounced, "man-a-way") is located along the cuyahoga river (known by native inhabitants as the "crooked river") in portage county. from its humble beginnings in the early 1800s, with its railroad station, 13 saloons, house of "ill repute" and a shipping point for area farmers, mantua village was formed and quickly began to grow. a post office was established in 1860 and the village was incorporated in 1898. our town, named after a famous city in northern italy, has continued to grow and mature. it is a beautiful, peaceful village, filled with historic buildings and friendly people who care.
				mantua is located on ohio state route 44, ten miles north of ravenna (the portage county seat), twenty miles northeast of akron, and twenty-seven miles southeast of cleveland. today, with access to the ohio turnpike just two miles to the south and access to us route 422 seven miles to the north, we believe that this area will soon be the fastest-growing and most sought-after region in northeast ohio. clean air, beautiful countryside, and excellent schools, backed up by sound zoning and facilitated planned growth, make mantua village a most desireable place to live and work.
				we invite you to investigate the potentials of this exciting corridor that runs between cleveland and youngstown, and be assured that you, your family and your business will not only be welcome, but helped in every way possible. come look us over and join with us in the wonderful years to come.
