                          " i would like to thank you for your unprecedented collaboration with helping us design, build out and startup our keowee roast house coffee shoppe’. we have one remaining important equipment purchase left to make, install, and begin operation of the expresso machine and we would like to work with you and your team exclusively on this endeavor. " by : richard and dena campbell owners – keowee roast house 
                          "my family and i searched for a long time for the right table for our baseball-themed game room. i found café products online and was in correspondence with one of their representatives who was very prompt and informative. i received the custom table in a very timely manner and in wonderful condition. it was just as the representative described at fit perfectly with our décor! my two children use it for meals, homework, and board games and it has stood up to some pretty harsh wear and tear. i highly recommend café products to anyone seeking quality residential or business furniture--i would definitely order again from them!
