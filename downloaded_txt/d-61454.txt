as a professional & structural engineer (p.e., s.e.), i researched my motorized retractable awning purchase online by completing my own detailed retractable awning review. subsequent to my review, i was no longer skeptical about purchasing online from retractableawnings.com. i had 2 local companies visit my home and realized that you guys knew more than both of the local companies combined! you offered much better quality than both. i am thrilled with the installed electric retractable awning.
conrad masterson p.e. - baton rouge, louisiana, october 28, 2012




i received wonderful service from eric using retractableawnings.com live help. eric answered all my questions professionally and courteously. i was so impressed with his knowledge and excitement for our window awnings that i placed my order immediately. i know i chose the best online provider of retractable window awnings.
lee anne sanderson homeowner, los gatos, california, september 14, 2014




my architect found you guys online and recommended one of your retractable sun awning canopies. i considered you and sunsetter and noted that your products are far superior in quality, you have a much wider range of fabric colors and you have engineering certifications on the frame and fabric (which means higher quality) and motion sensors, sun sensors, and rain sensors. morris provided incredible service prior to, during, and after the sale. merci from canada.
alysia boucher montreal, canada, march 21, 2016




the retractable awning is of excellent quality & very heavy-duty, commercial-grade. there were hundreds of fabrics and several frame colors to choose from and many options for the operation of the awning. very customizable product. i didn’t see this many options from any other vendor. i am really happy with the service & selections i made and the italian mastermind design and engineering of my purchase. i expect to get a lot of years out of it
john heard, austin, texas, april 22, 2017




simply marvelous, impeccable, and flawless are a few of the words to describe my full cassette, venezia model retractable awning. my husband and i advocate retractableawnings.com without a doubt or any reservation.
bonnie tesla, new york city, january 11, 2018




retractableawnings.com provided the product and installation supervision for our unique louver roof system for the new via sophia osteria experience at the hamilton hotel in downtown washington d.c. . this product provides both interior and non-visible rainwater drainage within the posts and also snow protection. this is the only product we could find that offers the best of everything - sun, rain, hail, and snow protection. the impeccable quality of this european product is truly something we appreciate as we know it will last for many years - just like our hotel.

learn about automated controls





            can your retractable awnings and pergolas be customized?
        

+




            customization is another strength of our foldable arm awnings as you
            can choose the precise width of your awning. aside from getting a
            perfect fit, you can also choose the
            colors of the fabric
            and
            valance
            style which can form an outstanding accent for your home or business
            area. you have the ability to change the angle of the awning’s pitch
            to suit your taste and for better early morning or late afternoon
            sun protection. you can make it almost flat with a slight angle to
            shade the largest area possible, or you can angle it sharply to
            provide the best coverage from the sun or spying neighbors and for
            light rain protection. for retractable fabric pergolas and louvered
            roof pergolas both the width and projection can be customized.
        

            call us and ask about a 3d rendering of exactly how your awning,
            canopy, or pergola will look on your gazebo, patio, deck, or other
            outdoor space.
        





            is a folding arm awning aesthetically pleasing?
        

+




            a folding arm awning can transform simple and plain windows, sliding
            doors, or a set of french windows and doors into a beautiful space.
            with a variety of fabrics to choose from, you can pick a color that
            complements your home, giving it an eye-catching accent.
        

            for businesses, placing a bright window awning with their logo
            emblazoned on the fabric adds brand recognition and helps people
            remember and find your location. property owners with open patios can
            install folding arm outdoor awnings as an alternative to permanent
            concrete or metal roofing.
