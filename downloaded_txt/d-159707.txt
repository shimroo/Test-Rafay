i said goodbye to another friend today, my
	nilent went to see his sister chichi on rainbow 
	bridge today.  i miss him very much.

	we don't really know what was wrong with him, we did blood work and exams, 
	and they came back normal.  he just couldn't seem to hold his food, he 
	was eager to eat, it just didn't want to stay down.  mixing with a lot 
	of water didn't help, switching to baby food didn't help, finally putting in 
	the blender with water helped. but it wasn't enough, he couldn't eat enough 
	to make a difference.  i finally had to feed him with a syringe (no 
	needle) because he was so weak, and he just wasn't able to absorb the 
	nutrition.

	he is with his best bud now, he has missed chichi, and now they are together 
	again.  i however, still wish he was here with me.

	i miss you nilent.

i lost one of my best friends today.  my 
	chichi had to be put down due to kidney failure today.  i am 
	heartbroken and feel a little lost right now.  she was a huge part of 
	my life, and without her the world isn't as exciting.  i walk around my 
	house, and i see her all over ... her beds, her toys, water and food dishes, 
	leashes, etc.
i know this pain will lessen over time, but the hurt is still strong.  
	both nilent and i miss her.
