for more power: pa-8, 6 mosfets/channel

yes there is a pa-7.3â¦â¦â¦ in these modern times we all know this type nomenclature/titling - something.improved. okay thatâs the case here too. pa-7.3 is ready in kit and installed versions. itâs much simpler to install, sounds better and priced the same as the pa-7 v2, but the v2 is now discounted.

these are for amps with the âplasticâ to-3p style transistors. the earlier b&k amps with the full metal can mosfets will eventually be addressed too. we welcome your comments on those early amps. as information becomes available you will see details on the b&k amp page.  (11-11-23)

âabsolutely amazing. day and night difference. the sound is outstanding.â dh-500 with pa-7 elite & ps-500 v2b, david s., fl

 


new musical design amplifierâ¦. new m4 power amplifier. 























features:

beautiful engraved front panel laser etched rear panel âsilk screenârobust multi-shielded toroid power transformer-quiet12 audio-grade power supply caps reduces power supply impedance - better âpunchâdual-mono mode, 8 ultra-fast rectifiers, low noise/black background, 3d staging and true-to-life âyou are there dynamicsâ m4 features excellent sounding âdual-dieâ mosfets - doubles the driving ability vs single pair of devicem4 has our ear-tested premium resistors/capacitors m4 sports gold, clad short-proof binding posts, premium gold rca jacks iec cord inlet with external fuse holder completes the function and high quality look.


this is not a digital power amp, class d or familiar digital type. m4 is a full class ab power amp owing its creation to our musical concepts pa-8 circuitry. we use a high bias on our uk sourced dual-die power mosfets for a silky low distortion sound. it compares more than favorably to our previous beloved d-75 amplifier.
some speak to the âspecial-nessâ of a single pair of output mosfets. that quality, the distortion reduction when compared to multiple pairs of even tightly matched devices, yields a smooth, silky sound like our beloved d-75 but at the next level.

cosmetics: 

solid, thick aluminum panel constructionfront to rear effective heat sinksclear anodized front panel is cnc engraved with musical design logo textpower switch with subtle red led - they wore out âblueâblack rear panel is cnc laser etched for connectors etc. 

 
sound: 

remarkably true vocal quality, no float, no bloatlightning fast response without fatigue - no etch, eekhuge 3d sound stage with engaging focussolid image, no wander - sense of real event unfoldingsmooth silky but highly defined top, potent tautly defined bass, reveals all the timbral signatures of the original performance


you will be wowed. you have to hear it to believe such sound is coming from this compact amplifier. itâs not magic just ear-approved engineering. to convince you we are considering a loaner program. more info and photos to come soon. 
m-4 is officially launching at $2000 (09-16-24), 
good news - some m4 amplifiers are prototypes with special discounts. an m4s model with switching power supply is under consideration at same pricing. some prototypes are available at considerable price reductions. the m4s is an excellent amp too. it is light weight and ships free. (09-16-24)

 with new bypasses. listeners report a âpanoramicâ quality with better micro and macro details. also a superior octave to octave balance and clarity has been noted. a truer sense of depth and focus has been mentioned with some images closer and others deeper for a more pinpoint imaging quality, a more solid sound stage portrayal.(10-03-18)  and remember there are upgrades to the main boards and individual gain  (active) boards too in many cases. 

musical design d-140 and d-150 amp ownersâ¦. can now enjoy a striking upgrade in sound quality with our new 7 series driver boards. put those aging driver boards out to retirement. see our d-150b amp page. (08-11-18)
