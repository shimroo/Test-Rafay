garfield park conservatory
garfield park conservatory in chicago is one of the largest and most stunning conservatories in the nation with cold frames and propagation houses where thousands of plants are grown.constructed between 1906 and 1907, it was designed by jens jensen in collaboration with prairie school architects schmidt, garden and martin and hitchings and company new york.when extensive restorations needed to be made to this architecturally unique structure, prime scaffold was entrusted to carefully plan and place their scaffolding equipment in and around the rare and precious plants imported from all over the world.

















401 north michigan avenue
this skyscraper was designed by bruce graham of skidmore, owings, and merrill in the international style with large columns and spandrel beams expressed on each facade. it is covered in anodized aluminum and complimented by large windows on all four sides.graham designed the building with a 175-foot setback from michigan avenue, to avoid blocking views of the chicago river from the tribune's nearby building. a large plaza, paved in granite with trees and a large reflecting pond, was created  and named pioneer court as a monumental civic space in chicago honoring various civic founders, including du sable and kinzie.when significant restorations to the curtain wall of this landmark building were required prime scaffold assisted by supplying swing stages and monorail systems.
