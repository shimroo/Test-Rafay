people are saying...





this is without a doubt, the best product ever. it literally has changed my summer months. i don’t have to wear anything under my skirts and can exercise with less clothing on. i say how great this product is like once a day. it’s worth every penny.




this stuff works awesome. i work construction and laugh at guys pulling powder out of their lunch bag to sooth groin area chaffing during the day. put this stuff on in the morning when your getting ready for work, just like with your deodorant, and your good all day! been using this for over 5 years, no more chaffing, ingrown hairs, or boils. total quality of life change for the better!




this stuff is seriously amazing. i walk a lot at work. thanks to body glide, i have never had an issue with chafing (since i started using it, before it was absolutely horrible!)




i’m an avid hunter and all around large guy ,i do sweat and chaf alot when im in the woods of wearing jeans .
i heard about your product from a friend of mine who is an arborist and he lives by glide so i said ill try it
wow this product has made me soo much more comfortable in the woods or at work.
thank you glide




i was skeptical…but oh so tired of dreading my trip to the beach where i always end up with an under arm rash due to my wet bathing suit. i decided to give this product a try and it is worth every dime! no under arm rash! i still can’t believe it. i have both the lotion in the tube and the solid that looks like a deodorant. i will definitely purchase again as needed.




 i cannot say enough good things about this product. after an initial weekend at our local pool which resulted in painful rashes all over my 3 year old son’s legs, i thought to use glide as a means to prevent further rashes.
i bought the large size, and apply to his legs (and actually part of his back and stomach as well) prior to long pool days, and hoped it would prevent some irritation at the sandy beach for our vacation.
well, not only did the glide prevent “some” irritation at the beach, but my little guy didn’t have one issue – not one ounce of redness on his skin. after being told to cut the liners out of his swimsuits and watching him play all day in the sand and saltwater, all it took was one coat of the glide in the morning before the beach and he was totally protected!! his suits were intact, no cutting out of liners at all. i was more than pleased, i was elated. i suggested the product for my nephews who have similar issues at the beach – they just returned from their vacation as happy as i was!
honestly, not only was my son protected, his skin is the softest it has ever been and i haven’t used any other lotion or moisturizer on him all summer!
my expectations were exceeded buy body glide – such a fabulous product!

“i have thick thighs and have never been able to wear dresses or skirts without shorts underneath. i was skeptic but decided to try it wearing a skirt, i brought shorts in my handbag just in case, but i didn’t need them at all. i walked all day and didn’t need to reapply, and there was no chafing and no irritation. this is amazing when the weather is hot, i don’t have to use shorts underneath anymore.” -lena v.

















“my fiance works in construction and his inner thighs would chafe even when he wore vaseline, so i decided to look around and came across body glide outdoor balm. i ordered and he loved it. always wears it at work now and lasts him his whole shift. i am very pleased and it’s an amazing price. i recommend and so does my fiance.”

headed to disney? body glide is a must-have! thanks to our customer erin michaels for sharing, “i just wanted to write a quick note about our first and forever experience with body glide. we recently went on a week-long trip to disney in florida. i am a member of several facebook planning groups and body glide came highly recommended. i was hesitant but knew we would need something to help keep the fire at bay. myself, my husband and our 13-year-old son used body glide religiously every single day. i cannot imagine our trip without having it!! i admit i was a skeptic, but it saved our trip! no rash, no chafe, no burning!! you have created a top-notch product and we plan to always have it on hand and recommend it to everyone we know!!”
