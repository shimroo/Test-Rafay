baptism
baptism and the lord's supper christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit. it is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in christ jesus. it is a testimony to his faith in the final resurrection of the dead. being a church ordinance, it is prerequisite to the privileges of church membership and to the lord's supper. please contact the church office or fill out the comment card on the bulletin if you would like to get baptized or get more information about being baptized.





study
when you know and understand god’s word, you are more likely to obey the lord. the bible knowledge gained in sunday school and bible study groups or classes, helps you become more proficient in using the bible, god’s word. these groups also provide a place to belong. you become known, personally recognized and transparency is more likely to occur. you can share needs and concerns in your life. as you participate in class discussions, you become connected, and build meaningful relationships. you minister alongside others. we offer sunday school, and many bible study classes and group meetings throughout the year. we also have a worship and study wednesday nights.





pray
we are told in 1 thessalonians 5:16-18 to rejoice always, pray continually, and give thanks in all circumstances. prayer is so much more than simply asking god for things we want. prayer is about being in his presence. it is our desire that god's people experience his joy and peace by becoming a praying people, seeking god with all our hearts, souls and minds at all times! if you have a prayer request, you can call the church office or submit it online in the contact us section of our website. prayer opportunites - there are several ways you can be involved in the prayer ministry. we have weekly prayer meetings saturday morning at 9 am, and prayer gatherings wednesday at 10 am.





communion
the lord's supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members of the church, through partaking of the bread and the fruit of the vine, memorialize the death of the redeemer and anticipate his second coming. it reminds us of the means by which god's salvation was secured on our behalf. the unleavened bread is a symbol of the perfection of the person of our lord jesus christ in his body, soul and spirit. the fruit of the vine symbolizes the substitutionary, propitiatory and covenantal blood of an innocent sacrifice, shed for the remission of the sins of the guilty. the lord's supper (communion), demonstrates the doctrine of substitution -- christ died for me (1 corinthians 11:26).
