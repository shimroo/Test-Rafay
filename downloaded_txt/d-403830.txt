mufasa: re-animated

                as a fandom we know the ‚Äúmufasa: the lion king‚Äù movie wasn‚Äôt made for us, it was made to capitalize on nostalgia and how much cash money the 2019 remake made at the box office. but‚Ä¶what if it was made for us? what if it was made by us? someone on the creative team had to be a fan of tlk6na for ‚Äútaka‚Äù to return, but what if it was much more than that? what if mufasa: the lion king, was made by the people who in their heart feel like they know the story, the characters, and the love put into the original, the best?what would you have done with mufasa: the lion king? call backs to the external lore like six new adventures/brightest star/that one book where zazu helps mufasa get sarabi out of a pit? (friends in need) what about stylistic homages to the original movie like the unique ‚Äúi just can‚Äôt wait to be king‚Äù/‚Äúbe prepared‚Äù visuals? or most importantly, what if you had made it 2d?what would you, as an artist and a fan of the original, have done?

                            seee its the way i still didn't see the movie (i don't feel like giving the corp my money tbh, they'll get it from the masses regardless)but boyyy was youtube recommending me a bunch of clips of the movie as of lately! i clicked on one out of curiosity and well i caved, i suddenly had the itch to draw that one scene for fun's sake! (sorry for the lack of spoiler warning for anyone who cares about that, but is it really even a spoiler especially for us? lol)

                            -the royal family-i'm still having trouble with the queen's color palette.i took a couple of the original backgrounds for this one and edited them out in photoshop.i also use this image as a reference for the ladies: https://i.pinimg.com/736x/bf/a5/2a/bfa52a571a409717222c18311fe76c8b.jpgi just wanted to draw the portrait of the royal family to start drawing some portraits of other royal families that are from my ocs. whose realities are different from how they were presented to us with the original movie.i have a lot of work at the moment, so it will probably take me more time than i expected, but at least i'm finally finishing up and uploading some picks.hope you like it! until next upload!

            i think simba spots an adventure.nala and simba ¬© disney
        




                by kitten84



        an excellent, expressive piece of work by kitten84, this captures the essence of "canon" fan-art by giving us a moment in time that could easily have been a frame from a dropped scene in the movie. no extrapolation or stretching of the imagination is needed; this is just a little slice of life perfectly in line with what we saw on screen.it's also a great exercise in facial expression and character; just from the faces on these two we know exactly who they are, what their personalities are like, and how they interact with each other. simba's recklessness is what nala likes about him as much as what she knows will get him (and probably her) in trouble someday; and certainly there's nowhere he's going to go that she won't.impeccable balance and anatomy work, and the skillful blending of photorealistic clouds with stylized foreground rocks produces a very appealing color palette that suggests a long, distant, inspiring view, the kind that gets their imaginations going to places we can't see.
