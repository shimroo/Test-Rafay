other part of europe.


the first visit to europe will be roughly jan 16 to 22.  the visit to
india will start jan 22 and can continue into february.  the second
visit to europe will be after that.  those dates are flexible.


one advantage of this period for you is that the intercontinental

      this is the personal web site of richard stallman.
      the views expressed here are my personal views, not those of
      the free software foundation or
      the gnu project.
      for the sake of separation, this site has always been
      hosted elsewhere and managed separately.
      

      if you want to send me gpg-encrypted mail, do not trust key
      servers!
      some of them have phony keys under my name and email address,
      made by someone else as a trick.
      see gpg.html for my real key.
    

      richard stallman has cancer.  fortunately it is slow-growing and
      manageable follicular lymphoma.  treatment put it into
      remission, and he can expect to live many more years.  however,
      he now has to be even more careful not to catch covid-19.

stopping business as usual in the senate until trump and musk back
down.

us citizens: phone our senators and call on them to stop elon musk's
coup.  call 202-688-0628.

free press action posted his campaign but did not include a url
for it, so i a copying the text here.



members of free press action took part in protests across the nationâs
capital this week as elon musk and his squad of sycophantic tech bros
abruptly shuttered federal agencies.

the richest man on the planet â and what we can only describe as the
elon youth â invaded the treasury departmentâs social security and
medicare database and will exploit that access for the next step in
their horrific autocratic scheme.

via his unconstrained "department of government efficiency", musk is
blitzing major agencies like the u.s. agency for international
development (usaid), the treasury, and the departments of education
and labor. he's forcing out civil servants with actual expertise to
make room for his handpicked legion, literally reshaping our
government to fit his deranged and dangerous plans.

free press action has sounded the alarm on elon musk for years: from
reinstating thousands of neo-nazis and other extremists on twitter to
gutting the platformâs content moderation rules to helping repressive
regimes silence dissidents, musk has a pattern of spreading hate and
harassing critics. but now that heâs spent nearly $300 million to
elect trump â successfully buying his way into the highest echelon of
the federal government â he is more dangerous than ever.

this is a clear authoritarian power grab from a man who twice gave an
apparent nazi salute to cheers from an adoring inaugural crowd. no one
elected this man. and yet he wonât take no for an answer.

elon is conducting a coup before our eyes and members of the senate
have an obligation to do everything in their power to stop him. please
call your senators at 202-688-0628 before it's too late.

hereâs a sample script to get you started:

-------------------

hello! my name is [first name]. i'm a constituent and am calling to
ask sen. [senator] to stop elon muskâs unelected takeover of the
federal government.

i urge you to vote "no" on all nominees and halt the senateâs business
while this power grab is underway, until the separation of powers is
restored and you have answers.

stop elon muskâs coup immediately.  -------------------

elon and his loyalists are running roughshod over the constitution and
our public servants â and everyday people like you will be the ones
who pay the price. he's stealing your most sensitive data while
threatening basic social services. it's far past time for our elected
officials to protect us from this monstrous coup.

in solidarity,

all of us at free press action

     there ought to be a law




      a pitifully weak attempt to solve a real problem: asking for a federal
law that would permit victims of domestic abuse and stalking to demand
    that data brokers delete information about them.
    

data, once collected, will be abused.  the way to prevent that abuse is to
facilitate refusing to hand it over in the first place.
    

here is my proposal for protecting the specific people known to be in
particular danger, and everyone else who could be harmed if
individuals, businesses or governments use their personal data
against them without a search warrant: require services to be available
anonymously.
    


    the regulation of toxic chemicals in the us is hamstrung by laws that
    enable companies to keep their use and their presence in any place
      secret.
    
      the selfish interest of those who keep trade secrets is rational but
      antisocial.  in many cases the only harm it does is to hold back the
      general advance of technology.  but sometimes it does really nasty
      things.  for digital hardware and software, it often gives companies a
      way to subjugate their users.  regarding use of toxic chemicals, it
      endangers public health.
    
      why would legislators pass laws to "protect" companies instead of
      protecting the people they harm?  i suspect it is partly because these
      companies are influential and the legislators seek their support,
      and partly because the legislators ask them for campaign funds.
    
      but it is also partly the result of the mindset of "trickle down", which
      assumes that the only way to get more funds for the state is to
      let increase the size of the economy by letting companies have what
      they want.  unfortunately, what they want is often to be allowed to
      harm the public.
    
      most democrats in congress got corrupted this way in the 80s and 90s.
      (the exceptions are the progressive democrats.)  now in the uk
      starmer is guiding labour into that sort of corruption.
    
      clearly our laws should say that any public need to know about the
      presence of toxic substances in a business facility overrides the
      desire to keep them secret.
  

    *china-owned british steel said to have requested £600m of taxpayer
      support.*
    
      whether the owners are chinese is a question that there is no need to
      ask, because the state should never give money to a business "to
      support it."
      instead it should offer to lend money to the company for suitable
      repayment, or else buy equity at a fair price.
    
      these two ways of supporting a company avoid giving the owners an
      opporunity to rip off the state -- which the company's owners are likely
      to try to do, if they can, regardless of which country they are from.
    
      with a policy like this, it wouldn't matter which country the
      company's owners are from.
  

    california is proposing an interesting approach towards
    antisocial
      media platforms.
    
      it is exciting that sb 976 turns towards restricting recommendation algorithms.  but
      these options should not be limited to minors — every user
      should
	have this choice.  (please do not refer to teenagers as
      "children"; that feeds the us tendency to treat them like children and
      retard
	their development.)
    
      however, i suggest taking a step beyond just choosing to use or not use the
      platform's
      addiction system.  recommendation algorithms should be completely separated from platforms!
    
      if you want to use a nontrivial recommendation algorithm, you should
      be able to choose it yourself and use it anonymously.  you could send
      it the urls you want it to base its choices on.  these might be some
      of the pages you had visited, and perhaps pages you had not visited.
    
      then it should send you its recommendations.  you could pass
      all, or just some, or none of those recommendations to the platform to
      look at them.
    
      ab 1949 is admirable because it gives a small boost to privacy for
      users of all ages, not only for children.  it isn't enough, though
      — users should also be guaranteed the right and possibility to
      access through the tor network and to use aliases.  and collection of
      a user's data by the state should require a warrant against the user.

nsa blinding itself, deleting web pages14 february 2025

the nsa is now blinding itself to
concerns of
justice and/or rational thought, by ordering the deletion of web
pages that use the terms "injustice" or
"confirmation
bias" — as well as many others.

this policy threatens to wipe discussions of whether policies are just
or unjust, and discussions of whether certain arguments are valid or not.

the deletion campaign is intended to wipe anything that relates to the
diversity movement, and recognizes that some occurrences of words on
the target list may be legitimate even to the magat mind.  but judging each of the
occurrences individually is an enormous job, so there will be blanket
deletion at least at first.

imagine pages discussing the inclusion of certain words on the
deletion list.  those discussions might get deleted because of the
word "inclusion".

hostage release issues, isr14 february 2025

a few days ago, hamas accused israel of violating the cease fire
terms, and said it would delay the next release of hostages until
israel started complying.

the alleged violations are numerous and of many kinds.
the details are described in
this
article, and some are independently confirmed.

a report attributed to hamas appears as two images in the article.
if they do not appear, each image's space has a link to visit it,

the corrupter
has done nothing to pressure israel to keep its side of the agreement,
but
instead
threatens hamas, demanding it disregard israel's violations.

you can't expect a corrupt man to serve as an honest broker in making
a deal, because he will not honestly insist that both sides keep the deal.

as we look at the horrible events of the war in gaza, let's not lose
sight of where we want to
end up.

ukraine invasion used to influence the wrecker13 february 2025


historian timothy snyder argues that putin invaded ukraine as a way to
use
his influence with the wrecker, supposing the latter became
president of the us.


he also explains the importance of refusing to "obey in advance".
even if bigger and richer people are bowing down and obeying, we must
continue to refuse.


"it's particularly distressing that it's the billionaires who have the
media outlets, so who are in some sense the most powerful. like, what
do you have to be afraid of? why donât you do something interesting
that the historians will remember you for instead? but i also want to
say itâs not surprising. the reason we have lesson one of on tyranny is
because we canât count on the non-regime-proximate oligarchs to do the
right thing. like the regime-proximate oligarchs, like elon musk,
they're doing the wrong thing."

art by generative systems contentious13 february 2025

the llm-excused copyright grab is advancing with a lawsuit against

using generative systems to generate text that does not appear to be fiction

countries to stay away from



no national identity cards

i'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national
identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. if you live in or have
confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at
gnu.org.


here's my list of countries with no national id cards
and no plans for one: australia, canada, new zealand, uk.
australia's previous government tried to
institute national id cards, but the labor government dropped
the plan.
india has mostly finished imposing a national biometric id number
in a grand act of oppression.

switzerland has national id cards which are optional,
but they or some other government id card are needed for some purposes.

iceland doesn't have id cards as such, but they
have id numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
for example, the national id number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.


denmark issues non-photo id cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.


norway will impose a national
biometric
id card.


ireland
- national id card by stealth.


aclu: the
five dangers of national id cards.


wikipedia has a list of identity card policies by country.


borders

stay away from certain countries because of their
bad
immigration policies.


flight connections

avoid flight connections in these airports because
of their

treatment of passengers.


the lifelong activist

people often ask how i manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  the best way i can answer is by
recommending a book, 
the lifelong activist by hillary rettig.

i disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
being marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  however, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.
disclosure: i am friends with the author.

political notes


"those who profess to favor freedom, yet depreciate agitation, are
      men who want crops without plowing up the ground. they want rain without
      thunder and lightning. they want the ocean without the awful roar of its
      many waters. this struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical
      one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle.
      power concedes nothing without a demand. it never did and it never
      will."

frederick
        douglass, american abolitionist,
        letter
        to an associate, 1849
