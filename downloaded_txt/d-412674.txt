 a brief history of ongoing innovation

in 1990, the founders of absolute packaging & supply inc. had an idea: to provide packaging and logistical services to the dyeing and finishing industry efficiently and effectively. by being centrally located in the heart of paterson, they could be close to their suppliers and customers. as the dyeing and finishing industry waned, absolute developed new markets in the apparel industry and other areas, endearing them to many plastic extruders with relationships that have only strengthened over the decades. with the internet's growth, they began supplying mailers to the shop-at-home market, utilizing these established relationships. absolute now utilizes domestic manufacturers as well as those in china and vietnam and is pushing the market into sustainable plastics, biodegradables, recycled plastics, and sustainable paper packaging.

    industrial film wraps and seal products for any size or scale

film designation: hl-26/hlx-120a series of co-extrusions of hdpe and lldpe or ldpe. the combination of hdpe with the other resins provides the strength necessary to replace a conventional liner grade film, reducing gauge thickness by up to 30% in many applications. both materials are available as a differential slip product (high slip inside, low slip outside). the inner high slip film will not scratch or otherwise interact with plastic or painted products. the outer low slip film will enhance the ability to stack packaged products. hlx-120 is a co-extrusion incorporating newer materials that increase sealing capability, puncture resistance, and tear resistance.film designation: 2l-44a family of co-extrusions combining lldpe with ldpe is utilized in applications where hl-26 may not be effective due to its hdpe layer. in this combination, lldpe offsets the blocking and stretch of ldpe while maintaining strength and impact resistance. available in thicknesses ranging from .0004 to .008, 2l-44 can typically be down-gauged by 20% when replacing conventional liner grade film. 2l-44c is particularly well-suited as a shrink bundling film.film designation: vlv-313/lhv-313three-layer co-extrusions formulated for fresh produce packaging. vlv-313 has a higher permeation rate and is used to package products with high rates of respiration. lhv-313, on the other hand, offers increased barrier properties and consequently, a lower permeation rate. film designation: hmw-36this single-layer high molecular weight high-density film is available in thicknesses ranging from 9 to 25 microns (.00035” to .001”) and in widths from 32 to 65 inches. hmw-36 film is available exclusively as single-wound sheeting and tubing.film designation: dxd-323our three-layer hdpe film combines two layers of hdpe with a central layer of high-strength super hexene lldpe. dxd-323 exhibits the appearance and performance characteristics of hmw-hdpe and is available in a wide range of widths, thicknesses, and converted products.film designation: md-62a three-layer film combining hdpe, lldpe, and metallocene plastomer resins. md-62 finds extensive use in vertical and horizontal form, fill, and seal applications, and is suitable for use on uncoated sealing equipment.
