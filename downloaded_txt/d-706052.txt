(established 
                      february 1976)

welcome 
                          to the website of phoenix model products, the uk's largest 
                          manufacturer of high performance slope soaring kits and competitive 
                          suppliers of radio equipment and accessories etc. we hope 
                          you find what you are looking for, if not please call us, 
                          we will do our very best to help you.


 pmp 
                        is a lifestyle business. it is just as important to us that 
                        our hobby is healthy and flourishing as it is to make a 
                        profit consequently we will always make time to talk to 
                        customers, discuss modelling problems with them and offer 
                        the most appropriate advice even if it loses us a 
                        potential sale! customer loyalty and customer referrals 
                        are our greatest asset so if you have a problem with building 
                        one of our kits please ring us. the same applies to other 
                        items that we sell. the best advert we can have is a modeller 
                        flying one of our models with a big grin on their face! 
                        whilst we now have secure on-line trading facilities, we 
                        still encourage customers to ring us to discuss their requirements 
                      rather than order in error.

please 
                                note - 
                                we consider it wrong to debit 'cards' when an order 
                                is placed. cards are only debited when the goods are 
                                ready for dispatch or there is an agreed deposit on 
                                a special order. we also contact customers, preferably 
                        by telephone, should any items ordered be out of stock. all our prices are vat inclusive, now at 20%. our listed stock levels seldom fall below 99%. if an item is out of stock we will contact you either by phone (preferred) or email. goods are not put on back order without your consent, when back order goods are back in stock we will contact you and ask your permission to process the order.
