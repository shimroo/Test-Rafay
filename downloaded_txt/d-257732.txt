rafael gabaldon






cooke real estate school was a great experience!  i was new to the real estate world and had no knowledge of anything regarding the in's and out's of real estate.  this school and the course instructors provided me with the confidence and everything i needed to know to get started in the real estate industry.  not only that, but if help was needed, cooke real estate school was fast in responding to emails, as well as answering the telephone.

zack morris






excellent guidance and clear, concise learning objectives throughout the course.  kind, courteous answers to questions when they arose, and celebratory congratulations when i finished.  great experience....thank you!

barbara ruff






cooke real estate school made the process much more enjoyable than i had anticipated.  i would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the leisure of working at their own pace, while getting a top-notch education in the principles of real estate.

cody wahl






yay! thank you!  the online course is great!  i love the professor's videos! my 9-year-old enjoyed watching and learning with me!  i appreciate everyone at cooke school. every time i had to call and ask a question everyone was more than willing to help and was kind. i have referred several friends to the school.

dreama white






this course was excellent for me!  i'm a busy mom with three children and it was wonderful to be able to pace my learning myself.  i could study when it was convenient for me rather than on a set schedule. the instructors were both very well spoken and made learning enjoyable.  i highly recommend this course.
