 tour of duty first aired in the usa on september 
24th 1987. a series about the soldiers of bravo company led by captain rusty 
wallace, lieutenant myron goldman & zeke anderson.
the series showed and illustrated the complexities of war and also it portrayed 
the personal lives of the individual platoon members and their interactions with 
each other. it realistically portrayed the diverse mixture of young men and 
women from across the usa engaged in the war and its effects.
the beginning of the show takes place in 1967 when the war had escalated & shows 
the young men thrown into combat in vietnam where they face enemy troops as well 
as their own fears as they struggle in a hostile environment.
tour of duty ran from 1987 to 1990 and followed the 
members of bravo company from their first camp at firebase ladybird to the 
eventual movement to camp barnett where they became part of a special operations 
group.the first season was 
filmed entirely on location  in hawaii but was moved to los angeles for 
seasons two & three. it was filmed at valencia california, in the santa clara 
area near the newhall ranch.
