how do olympus 24/7 mobile tyre services work?our high-quality mobile tyre services, available near you, come with a no-fit, no-charge policy, ensuring you get the perfect tyres for your vehicle without any risk.all you need to do is provide us with the correct tyre size for a replacement tyre following the tyre guide. check out our terms of service page for more details.what is the best way to determine my tyre size?tyre sizes are commonly printed on the side of a tyre and consist of a combination of numbers and letters, such as 205/45/r16 or 225/40/r18.looking at the suggested tyre sizes in your vehicle handbook or referencing the sticker located on the fuel cap or door jamb is a more trustworthy way to determine the tyre size.former owners may have used alternative tyres to make the car more sporty, improve driving comfort, or just look better, so relying on previously installed tyres is not always beneficial. when repairing or buying new tyres, knowing the tyre size is crucial.here’s a quick rundown of car tyre sizes and what they mean.tyre numbers explained: width, profile, speed & more




1 - width“205” indicates the section width of a tyre in millimetres.




2 - aspect ratio or profile“45” is a tyre’s aspect ratio or profile which is its height from the base of the tread to the rim. this number represents a percentage of the tread width. for example, the height of this tyre is 40% of its width.




3 - tyre construction“r” means that the tyre has radial ply construction. most car tyres are constructed this way so you will rarely find a car tyre without an r.




4 - rim size“16” indicates the diameter of the wheel rim in inches. so if you are buying wheels for existing tyres, this is the size you will require.




5 - load index“83” is a code which indicates the maximum load capacity of the tyre.




6 - speed symbol“v” is a code which indicates the speed at which a tyre can be safely operated; subject to the tyre being in sound condition, correctly fitted and with the recommended inflation pressure. see the speed symbol table for car tyre speed symbol ratings.

choosing soft or hard compound.is it better to have soft or firm tyres on your car?here are our top recommendations for selecting the best solution for your vehicle, as well as some things to keep in mind along the road.longevityit’s crucial to think about how long your new tyres will last. your tyres may be made up of varied tread patterns and rubber mixes which might affect grip and longevity. soft tyres tend to leave more rubber on the road than their harder counterparts, and as a result, they don’t last as long.costsofter tyres might be more expensive than hard ones, owing to the fact that they wear out faster and require more frequent replacement. the soft compounds can last up to 20,000 kilometres on average, while the harder compounds can last up to 60,000 kilometres. although soft tyres have a shorter life expectancy, they frequently offer superior cornering and handling, making for a safer driving experience.gripone of the most significant distinctions between these two varieties is the amount of grip they provide. softer materials tend to provide more grip. when it comes to replacing them, most people choose all-season choices because they function well in a variety of weather conditions.depth of treadintermediate tread depth can give a smooth and steady ride while also extending the life of the tyre. this improves their capacity to mould around irregular surfaces, extending their lifespan.areas we cover: hertfordshire and londonat olympus tyres, we take pride in providing fast, reliable mobile tyre fitting services across hertfordshire and london. whether you’re at home, work, or on the road, our expert team will get you back on track without the hassle of visiting a tyre shop.areas we cover in hertfordshire:our mobile tyre-fitting service spans the following towns and surrounding areas:st albans, hatfield, and harpendenhemel hempstead, kings langley, and abbots langleypotters bar, broxbourne, and borehamwoodcheshunt, south mimms, and radlettware, london colney, and wheathampsteadservice areas in london:in london, we provide top-notch tyre fitting for customers in:barnet, ilford, and edmontonchingford, wanstead, and woodford greenwood green and hoddesdonpopular questions & answers
