the pilgrim story â the hazardous mayflower voyage, the 1620 landing, the fearful first winter, the first thanksgiving at plymouth â is one of americaâs enduring founding narratives. this dramatic saga of courage and perseverance has inspired generations as an iconic immigration experience and was the reason our organization was established in 1820. as the nationâs oldest continuously operating public museum, we embrace a commitment to telling this story with historical accuracy, inclusion, and renewed recognition for histories that traditionally have been submerged, silenced, or erased.


pilgrim hall museum houses an unmatched collection of pilgrim possessions, revealing the stories of ordinary yet determined men and women building new lives and homes for their families in a new world. on display are william bradfordâs bible,  the only portrait of a pilgrim (edward winslow) painted from life, the cradle brought by expectant mother susanna white on the mayflower, the great chair of the colonyâs spiritual leader william brewster, and the earliest sampler made in america, embroidered by myles standishâs daughter, loara.  
at pilgrim hall museum, our core focus encompasses the presence and experiences of the wampanoag, "people of the dawn," the indigenous people who inhabited this area for over 13,000 years before the arrival of the english colonists and who are still here today. exhibitions and programs trace the story of the interrelationship between the wampanoag and the early colonial settlers from first encounters through the disastrous conflict of the 1670s, known as king philip's war. 
for 200 years, our organization has fostered knowledge and new understandings of plymouth colony’s beginnings - and never more so than today, during the extraordinary challenges of our own times.  we invite you to explore this history with us, and uncover a storehouse of resources on four centuries of plymouthâs past.

pilgrim hall museum in plymouth, ma, announces a major capital project to replace a failing roof and   skylight directly over its original 1824 gallery full of iconic new england artworks and artifacts.  our museum is one of the nationâs oldest public museums, built in 1824 by the pilgrim society (established   1820). after rain was discovered falling inside the original 200-year-old gallery, a temporary rubber roof   was installed to prevent immediate damage to irreplaceable collections. in late june 2023, the pilgrim society   board of trustees endorsed a $6.4 million campaign to replace the roof and skylight, install new museum   quality lighting, upgrade hvac systems, and steward historical materials during the extensive   construction required ahead. the project includes the restoration of monumental artwork and innovative exhibit redesign for a transformative impact on the visitor experience.
right now in the summer of 2024, our urgent need is for funds to remove and conserve the massive, irreplacable artwork which has lived on the walls of the main gallery since the 19th century. please help us with this phase of the project! all donations for conservation received this year will help us meet a significant matching grant, and we thank you!
it's on! as of early august, work has begun.		follow	our progress here on facebook!







learn more about the history of pilgrim hall museum's venerable main building, the issues facing us, and what we plan to do to fix them in this pac-tv presentation, and short light the way history video:
 
 we need (more than) a little help from our friends to raise the roof and light the way for pilgrim hall's future! please become part of our future - your tax-deductible gift in any amount will help pilgrim hall museum and its irreplaceable collection enter its third century sturdy, stable, beautifully lighted and dry!

remembering dorothy bradford: how literature and film impact our understanding of 17th-century women's history from pilgrim hall museum on vimeo.
pilgrim hall museum and the plymouth antiquarian society recorded a free virtual program on thursday, march 24, 2022 at 6:30 pm.

âfact & myth: dorothy may bradford rememberedâ features presentations by two scholars who explore the impact of literature and film on our understanding of 17th-century womenâs history. dr. kari miller, professor of english at georgia state universityâs perimeter college in atlanta, discusses the influential pilgrim fiction of american author jane goodwin austin (1831-1894). dr. miller focuses on the story âwilliam bradfordâs love lifeâ to explore the ways austin used fact, fiction, and speculation in her work and how that impacted not only her legacy, but also american culture. dr. stacey dearing, teaching assistant professor of english at siena college in loudonville, ny, discusses how dorothy may bradfordâs death in december 1620 has been represented in pop culture. using national geographicâs 2015 miniseries saints & strangers as a case study, dr. dearing argues for the importance of telling bradfordâs story â and those of all the women of the mayflower â while also clearly demarcating facts from myths.
