study abroad center







 the study abroad center assists students in identifying an international experience that fits and then we help you prepare. this website contains information on study abroad programs and additional resources to help students throughout their journey. currently, we are assisting students who are interested in programs during the summer and fall 2025 semester. many of these programs have an application deadline of march 1, 2025. students are invited to stop by the office and speak with a peer advisor without an appointment. once ready to learn about a specific program in more detail, students should schedule a meeting with a study abroad advisor. click here to see who you should meet with. 










the academic and personal development i gained through my study abroad experience have completely altered the trajectory of my life. because of my study abroad, i am now planning to pursue my master’s degree back in the uk.
