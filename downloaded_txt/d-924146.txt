  visalia safes
 most safes sold today are merely enclosures. they offer little, if any, real security. that's because manufacturers focus on profit margins and not how secure their safes are. nearly all safes sold by the big box retailers leave a gap between the door and the frame. insert a crowbar, and they will give way (because there is no real frame). you won't have these problems when buying a custom safe from visalia safes.
