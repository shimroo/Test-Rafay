                        your resource for keeping in touch with your fellow purdue engineering alumni, getting the
                        college's latest news and recent developments, and tracking alumni events.
                    

                        our alumni are the ultimate expression of purdue engineering, and that's why we want to
                        create a web community that spotlights our graduates and
                        gives them a place that is interactive, informative, and useful. check back often for updates
                        and postings and ways you can get involved on campus.
                    

                        we encourage alumni to check out the purdue ties program to stay engaged with the purdue community. of
                        particular interest to the eaa board is increasing awareness of the various volunteer activities
                        that would greatly benefit from alumni engagement. please use the purdue ties platform to
                        register your interest and stay informed on latest developments.
                    

                        current members: if you've moved or changed jobs, don't forget to update your information.
