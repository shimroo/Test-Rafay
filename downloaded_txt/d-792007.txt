explore the hcupnet data tools
hcupnet is an online data tool based on data from the healthcare cost and utilization project (hcup).
the data tool provides healthcare statistics and information for hospital inpatient and emergency department settings, as well as population-based healthcare data on counties. generate tables and graphs on national and regional statistics and trends for community hospitals in the united states.











inpatient setting


statistics on stays in hospitals. statistics are from the hcup national (nationwide) inpatient sample (nis), kids’ inpatient database (kid), and state inpatient databases (sid) participating states.


go






emergency department setting


statistics on emergency department visits. statistics are from hcup nationwide emergency department sample (neds), state emergency department databases (sedd) and state inpatient databases (sid) participating states.


go






readmissions


statistics on national hospital readmissions for all patients regardless of the expected payer for the hospital stay. statistics are from the hcup nationwide readmissions database (nrd).


go






community inpatient statistics


statistics on hospital stays by patient county or substate region. data are from the hcup state inpatient databases (sid) of participating states.

community-level — all stays
community-level statistics (cls) are from the agency for healthcare research and quality (ahrq), healthcare cost and utilization project (hcup), state inpatient databases (sid), based on data collected by individual states and provided to ahrq by state partners. statistics are aggregated to the patient residence (county, substate region, and state).  weighted national estimates are from the hcup national (nationwide) inpatient sample (nis). for more information, see “calculating community-level statistics for hcupnet: methods” pdf.
querying a single year will produce smaller cell sizes and generally more cell suppression than querying a three-year period. similarly, county queries will produce smaller cell sizes and more cell suppression than region queries, because a region generally comprises multiple counties.

community-level statistics — inpatient stays by clinical classification software (ccs) procedures 
community-level statistics (cls) are from the agency for healthcare research and quality (ahrq), healthcare cost and utilization project (hcup), state inpatient databases (sid), based on data collected by individual states and provided to ahrq by state partners. statistics are aggregated to the patient residence (county, substate region, and state). clinical procedures are restricted to operating-room procedures. weighted national estimates are from the hcup national (nationwide) inpatient sample (nis). for more information, see “calculating community-level statistics for hcupnet: methods” pdf. see also clinical classifications software (ccs) for icd-9 cm.
querying a single data year will produce smaller cell sizes and generally more cell suppression than querying a three-year period. similarly, county queries will produce smaller cell sizes and more cell suppressions than region queries, because a region generally comprises multiple counties.
