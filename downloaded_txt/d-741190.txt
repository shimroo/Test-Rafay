 inspirational poetry


 you're stronger than you think
 who will be there


 little johnny
 the child in me


 the upward climb
 a tree spoke to me


 my neck of the woods
 heat of the fire


 actions speak louder than words
  angels there with you


 the quietness of strength
 just as i am

 
  support our military



 the silent soldiers
 pass the flag to me


 a soldiers prayer
 if i never make it home

feelings of the heart


 our love
 you'll always have my heart


 i'm glad there's you
 a friend like you


 mama hold my hand
 daddy's girl


 my daddy left me

 reflections of a friend


 background of my mind
 free again


 a special parent
 understanding a grandparents grief


 the cheating game
 the mouse that made a house a home


 missing mama
 the red mustang


  zack 
 look away


 the trophy
 my special computer friend


 in memory of shi
 a leftover letter to santa


 my wedding band
 true ties that bind


 among my souvenirs
 i close my eyes so i can see


 heartfelt memories
  the faded tattoo


 just as i am
  treasures of a friend

 
  humorous poetry



 the band played on
 what a mess we're in


 in my mind i'm twenty one
 that's not what i had in mind


 find out what number you are
 the measure of a macho man


 taking a break


 the hunk from holly creek



 lost our shirts in atlantic city


 disco nights

 
  animal poetry



 true blue
 the mouse that made a house a home


 my cat zack
 my pre - owned dog


 a cat name halloween
 the old man and his dog


 gentleannie2~sweetpeas~"my cat poems"
 the wisdom of a cat


 taking a break
 a letter to zack at rainbow bridge


 a dog speaks
 the trophy


 mama's sweet sorrow
 in memory of shi


 if these woods could talk
 if i never make it home


 the faded tattoo
 coming soon

 
  holiday poetry



 angels there with you
 the cat name halloween


 a leftover letter to santa
 a father's love


 valentine's day
 coming soon


 coming soon
 coming soon
