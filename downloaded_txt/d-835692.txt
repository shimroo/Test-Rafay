1 note#musical theater#summer camp#philadelphia#the wiz#free24 jul 2017top 5 places to take selfies while at the kimmel center¬†balcony barhey friends!
my name is dara and i‚Äôm interning here at the kimmel center this summer. i
recently went on a mission to scout out the very best places to take selfies at
the kimmel center while visiting the beautiful new balcony bar. choosing 5 was
incredibly difficult but here are my top choices:first stop
is of course the new balcony bar. if you are looking for a great summer
hang out, this is definitely the place to be. it‚Äôs located on tier 2 of the kimmel which makes for one
incredible view. the bar is open wednesday to friday from 5-9 pm and is a center
city sips location on wednesdays from 5-7 pm. in this pic i‚Äôm soaking up some
sun on the balcony. be sure to bring your shades!!here‚Äôs
another pic from a different angle at the kimmel center‚Äôs balcony bar. here you
can see the beautiful view of the city and the hustle and bustle of broad street.
behind me is city hall, the academy of music, the merriam theater, and more.
and if you like to people watch like i do, this is the hang out for you.
whether you are attending an event at the kimmel center or not, the balcony bar
is the perfect place to chill this summer.so once
you‚Äôve chilled at the beautiful balcony bar, make your way down to the far
right side of tier 1 of the kimmel center, directly above the commonwealth
plaza stage. there you will find the most beautiful piece of art by stuart
netsky called monet‚Äôs haystacks:
billboard flickers on plastic panels of wood (1991). this gorgeous piece
makes a very colorful background for a selfie or even an usie.¬†;)also on tier
1, there is some amazing lighting by the windows facing broad street. behind me
you can see the beautiful kimmel center facility which is another great
background for any selfie.now if you
know me, you know that i love a bathroom selfie. and i just love the mirrors in
the lower lounge restrooms at the kimmel. the illuminated mirrors make for some
great selfie lighting. well that
wraps up my top 5 selfie locations at the kimmel center during my visit to the
balcony bar! don‚Äôt forget to check out these spots during your visit this
summer. also be sure to check out some of our great programming such as¬†wicked which will be showing july 26th
