imagery for victor





when friends are not around to help one another bear burdens it is a shame; something seems out of keel. i have decided to post these shots for my friend victor; if she sees these i hope they will put a smile on her face and let her know we are thinking about her fondly.

neighbourhood shots





i hope this field won't flood during the freshet! i like to check out the cattle in this field. against the backdrop of golden ears and the salmon r., the cattle in this field have a posh existence.luke likes to do chin ups on this apple tree branch. currently he does 3 sets of 10. though i love this apple tree for the shade it provides, clearly it does have other functions.we are so thankful for our patio. it may not look like much to you, but it is a delight for ramone and i and our friends.

be ferocious: a recipe for the canucks in game 7





below is an inspiring image for the canucks tonight. scott stevens is taking a solid hit against a guy carrying the puck. vancouver needs to do more of this sort of thing against dallas tonight.it is good to see the results of being ferocious against an enemy; this is what we need to see more of in the game tonight: discheveled dallas defenders. eric lindros had his bell rung by scott stevens; note the 'get me out of here' look peering out from under the helmut? well, we want to replicate that look among the dallas stars tonight.and lastly, for still more inspiration and to show the canucks what must be done tonight, here are scott steven's top 10 hits:>
