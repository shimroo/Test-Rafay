        thursday, 13 february 2025 15:48    
















hey guys… my apologies for the lack of updates over the last couple of days. i’ve had a significant computer issue here that i’ve been dealing with which has basically knocked me offline briefly, but things are finally getting back to normal here today.
in terms of new disc reviews, we’ve got a bunch of great titles for you to read about today…
tim has posted his take on michael anderson’s orca: the killer whale (1977) in 4k uhd and monk: season seven (2008-2009) on blu-ray both from kino lorber studio classics, as well as john carpenter’s village of the damned (1995) in 4k uhd from shout! and scream factory.
dennis has reviewed sean mathias’ bent (1977) on blu-ray from vinegar syndrome and frank borzage’s the spanish main (1945) on blu-ray from the warner archive collection. (note: we’re aware there’s an issue with the display of the latter review and we’re working on it.)
stuart has offered his take on lina wertmüller’s the end of the world in our usual bed on a night full of rain (1978), robert altman’s a prairie home companion (2006), and jack arnold’s black eye (1974), all on blu-ray from the warner archive collection.
and stephen has delivered his thoughts on stephen norrington’s blade (1998) in 4k uhd from warner bros. discovery home entertainment.
in terms of new release news, a24 has just announced a shop-exclusive version of brady corbet’s the brutalist (2024) in both 4k ultra hd and blu-ray that’s due to street in march. the film has been scanned from the original 35mm negatives with the vistavision footage scanned at 6k, and it will be presented in the proper 1.66:1 aspect ratio on disc. the audio and hdr formats have yet to be announced, but we assume hdr10 high dynamic range at least.

                universal sets wolf man for 4k, plus the saturn awards, mufasa, september 5 & more announcements!            




        monday, 03 february 2025 15:36    
















afternoon, bits readers... and welcome to the first week of february!
tim is taking a much-deserved week off to spend time with his family, but we’ll have plenty of news content here and maybe a review or two as well in the meantime.
last night, my wife sarah and i attended the 52nd annual saturn awards here in los angeles, produced by the academy of science fiction, fantasy & horror films. it was a lovely evening, a chance to catch up with industry friends, brush elbows with genre celebs (think nicolas cage, william shatner, mark hamill, peter weller, christopher lloyd, laurence fishburne, tons of star trek cast members, etc), and to celebrate great work in genre entertainment. denis villeneuve’s dune: part two took home the best science fiction film award, as it well should! denis himself also won for best film director—a nice show of appreciation for the filmmaker, especially given that he wasn’t nominated for best director by the academy this year, despite dune: part two being nominated for the best picture. go figure.
in the home media categories, the key winners were:

best classic film home media release: invasion of the body snatchers (kino lorber studio classics)
best 4k home media release: saw x (lionsgate home entertainment)
best film home media collection: batman: 85th anniversary collection (warner home video)
best television home media release: star wars: andor – the complete first season (sony pictures home entertainment)

we actually had the good fortune to be seated at the same table as kino lorber’s vp of acquisitions and business development, frank trazi, who—since he lives on the east coast—i hadn’t had the chance to meet before. but trust me when i say that frank is good people, and that klsc’s fantastic slate of upcoming blu-ray and 4k titles is in great hands with him. you can watch his new podcast, shelf space with kino lorber, here on youtube.
in any case, the event was great fun and it was streamed live online here and on roku. you can read the complete list of winners here at deadline today. and all of us here at the bits would like to offer our congratulations to frank and everyone at klsc for their win for invasion of the body snatchers (you can see their actual saturn statue below the break), to our friend cliff stephenson and everyone at lionsgate for their 4k win with saw x, and to the disc teams at warner bros. discovery home entertainment and sony pictures home entertainment for their wins as well!.

        friday, 31 january 2025 18:33

second, sony pictures home entertainment has added a single-film 4k ultra hd steelbook edition of ivan reitman’s stripes (1981) for release on 4/29. note that this version of stripes will include dolby vision hdr, unlike the version included previously with the columbia classics 4k ultra hd collection: volume 2 box set back in 2021.
likewise, sony’s newly-announced gandhi 4k steelbook (which we talked about yesterday, also for release on 4/29) will include dolby vision as well, unlike the edition included with the columbia classics 4k ultra hd collection: volume 2 box set in 2020.
meanwhile, severin has set aldo lado’s night train murders (1974) for 4k ultra hd release on 4/29.
and arrow video has finally announced their complete april release slate (in addition to the previously announced leone titles—see our column yesterday). you’ll find the details and cover artwork below the break. [read on here...]
