what can i recover compensation for after an injury?

there are three categories of compensation, also called damages, that an
	 injury victim can pursue compensation for, special, general, and punitive
	 damages. special damages compensate for tangible losses an injury victim
	 suffers such as medical expenses, and missed days at work. since special
	 damages compensate for financial losses, they are also called economic
	 damages. general damages, on the other hand, compensate for more abstract
	 losses such as pain and suffering and emotional distress. since these
	 types of damages are often difficult to quantify, they are also called
	 non-economic damages.
the last category of compensation is called punitive damages, these damages
	 are meant to punish the negligent party rather than compensate for a specific
	 loss. as such they are not often awarded. the state of tennessee does
	 place a cap on some damages in some situations, an attorney can inform
	 you how these laws may affect your specific case.

civil litigation
from neighbor and landlord disputes to business torts and fraudulent inducement, civil litigation encompasses a broad spectrum of legal disputes. while it is permissible to represent yourself in a civil suit, your chances of getting a fair and agreeable settlement are more likely to increase with the help of an experienced trial attorney.






consumer protection & disputes
large companies can quickly gain power that goes unchecked. if you have been the victim of any sort of consumer abuse, you can count on snider & horner, pllc to protect your rights and fight for a favorable resolution on your behalf. we have extensive experience in this area of the law and we are ready to put it to work for you.






criminal defense
given the complexity of criminal law and how tennessee prosecutors often aggressively seek a conviction, you need a reputable attorney by your side both out of court and during hearings. our west tennesse attorneys have close ties with our community and tirelessly advocate for our client's rights.






debt collections
if you owe money as a debtor, you are probably sick of receiving phone calls from creditors and debt collectors. sometimes, collectors’ practices get out of hand and become abusive. remember that you have rights as a debtor and deserve to be treated with respect. you do not have to continue enduring abuse or harassment – instead, seek protection by retaining a germantown collections attorney at snider & horner, pllc.






divorce
the end of a relationship is difficult no matter the circumstances. whether you and your spouse are splitting up on good terms or you harbor ill will towards each other, our divorce attorneys in germantown are prepared to help you navigate this challenging and emotional experience.






estate planning
creating an estate plan takes time. a truly effective plan also requires the assistance and guidance of a skilled and knowledgeable estate planning attorney. at snider & horner, pllc, we have helped numerous tennesseans plan for the future and build estate plans that protect their families for decades to come.






family law
dealing with a change in family circumstances is never easy, but that challenge can be especially difficult if it requires legal enforcement or intervention. whether you are facing the possibility of a divorce or seeking a change in child custody, you need a knowledgeable, compassionate legal team by your side.






insurance disputes
insurance companies wield a lot of power. just like any other company, they are a business whose ultimate goal is to profit. this means that the insurance company doesn’t have your best interests at heart, even though they are supposed to serve and protect you, the customer.






landlord disputes
when renting or leasing a property, a comprehensive contract is an absolute must to properly outline each party’s rights and obligations. even with a contract in place, however, disputes can still arise – and they frequently do. landlord disputes are quite common and are best resolved with help from a tenacious and skilled attorney.






mediation & arbitration
a lot of americans have little or no courtroom experience. many people are only familiar with its portrayal in the movies. court systems tend to be extremely complicated and quite intimidating for the average person. the formality, the strictness, the rigid procedures, and the complex rules are enough to make people want to avoid court altogether.






misdemeanor defense
if you have been charged with a misdemeanor crime, you have a lot at stake. just because a misdemeanor is less severe than a felony crime doesn’t mean you should represent yourself or take the matter lightly. whether it is your first or third run-in with the law, you need a capable criminal defense attorney who can protect your rights and your freedom.






municipal government representation
a municipality’s legal representation needs to be familiar with the complexities of local and state laws and experienced enough to provide aggressive courtroom advocacy when needed. since 1996, snider & horner, pllc, has provided dedicated legal representation to all types of municipalities and their various governing bodies across the mid-south, including counties, cities, towns, and special districts.






personal injury
no matter how many preventative measures we take to protect ourselves from accidents – from wearing our seat belts in the car to following protocol when operating machinery at work – we cannot control someone else’s negligence or prevent other people’s mistakes. a negligent driver, a defective product, an unmarked slippery floor – these are all just far enough out of our control that some accidents cannot be avoided.






traffic tickets
as you’re driving down the highway, you glance into your rearview mirror and notice flashing red and blue lights – you’re being pulled over by the police. most of us are familiar with this scenario, as many of us have gotten a traffic ticket or two in our lives. minor traffic violations like speeding or running a red light are not the end of the world – but under certain circumstances, the traffic ticket you receive should be fought.






wills
if your will isn’t drafted by a legal professional, it’s entirely possible it will be invalid and unenforceable. our attorneys at snider & horner, pllc have decades of experience helping clients in more than drafting wills.














handling all your legal needs
we fight fearlessly for your rights

nothing makes us happier than helping people in need of legal support.
	 we are passionate about protecting our clients’ rights and upholding
	 the law. whether we can negotiate a favorable resolution and obtain a
	 great settlement or have to take your case to trial, we are ready and
	 eager to win.
we believe that the best way to win in trial is to be fearless and determined.
	 our attorneys are confident that they can build a strong case on your
	 behalf and use their decades of experience to your advantage.
