celebrating 50 years of comfort
la-z-boy healthcare i kn√∫ comfort, formerly, la-z-boy contract furniture group, was founded in 1971 as a contract furniture division, which would target the contract office furniture market, and would grow and expand over the years into hospitality and the healthcare markets.¬†it is widely understood that la-z-boy invented and developed the first reclining chair, or recliner, over 80 years ago.¬† la-z-boy healthcare i kn√∫ comfort has worked over the years perfecting that recliner mechanism, and currently we feel we have the best on the market. the most durable, dependable, and easy to use recliner.¬†we are proud to have grown over the past 50 years, to narrow our focus and work on our true strengths, which are recliners, patient room sleep products, public area seating, and high performance upholstered lounge products.
