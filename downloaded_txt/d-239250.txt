dependable drive in has grown from a small single screen theater to a large four screen theater serving pittsburghâs entertainment needs. we are currently the last remaining drive in theater in allegheny county. we invite you to make the drive in your next stop for a fun night out. we offer a double feature on every screen, state of the art high definition digital projection, dolby surround fm radio sound, retro in-car speakers (where available), and a huge menu of delicious food in our snack bar. check out the links to the left for more information about attending the drive in soon!â
