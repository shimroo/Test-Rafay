inside i hope you know im dying
[29 dec 2007|08:23pm]



  i think it's finally over. i'm 99.9% sure. but even if it changes, there is no turning back whatsoever. i'm hoping i made the right choice. well, what he said to me today was reassuring. i think i need to start trusting people again.  new year, new bullshit coming up. but i can take it, i roll with the punches. so i think i might be interested in someone but i'm not sure. he makes me smile though, with his awkwardness? haha awwwe.   but of course stupid  bitches who will name anonymous like to be fucking cockblocks. why dont you fucking ugly bitches go lose some weight, tone down the attitude, and fix your fucking faces? sorry i think theres more oil on your fucking faces than the shit food you serve at mcdonalds :d. dont be pissed that theyre not interested in you, sure you're the same age but i dont think anyone would want to kiss a face more red than rudolphs nose. call me a slut all you want, its not my fault theyre not interested. when you fucks know how to be mature fucking talk to me then, k cool cause i really dont give a shit.   im so excited to see paul soon yay :) annnd also ive been talking to steve alot lately, he's a good guy. so new years resolutions: drink less, get atleast an 80 average (almost there, 78!), get a better job, save $$$, no more hookups...maybe ahahha (kevin glover is an exception ;) ), lose 10 pounds! && ill probz add more later

now honestly
[06 dec 2007|11:42pm]





i'm ready to move on, but no matter how hard i try i cant. i know i still like him, i dont know why its just there. i dont know i dont know, we're friends but its still tense i guess. i definetly feel awkwardness. i think he's one of those guys that no matter how he treats me, ill still come back to him. it's not love, i know that for sure. maybe just maybe, if i had given him what he wanted, and i was willing to, it would be good. as stupid as it is, i felt really important to him for once when we were together. i haveeee no idea how i feel, i just want to be with him. i want to forget it all and maybe start over. second chances. to put it like this, what happened was perfect, i wouldnt have had it any other way. i want it back.  moving on.... im ready to put everything behind me. im happy. i dont need to prove myself to anyone, i dont care. i dont care about peoples opinions, you can judge me all you want, you're wasting your breath. it doesnt affect me and you look pathetic when you do it so do yourself a favour and just shut up.annnd in other newskg <3annnnnnnd shopping with andrew ahahahha should be fun fun :)

life ;; lately
[27 nov 2007|11:59pm]





to sum it up: losing friendships, making new ones, trust issues, getting closer & growing apart, crying, laughing, heartbreak, butterflies :), meaningful conversations, stupid conversations, slut i dont care, having fun and dancing, cute songs, waking up at 4 in the morning next to andrew and ryan in a bed made for one, guitar hero attempts, too much corona and coolers, hickies, bad kissers and dancers, hotboxing cars, hardass muffins, text messages, i'd do anything for you but i cant say i ever loved you, screwing up, taking each day as it comes, flip cup champ, i hope this happens, 3 hour phone conversations, flirting, mike = bestfriend for reaaaal, live, laugh, love. it's messed up but i'm happy.

it's better
[12 nov 2007|05:31pm]





where do i start? the last few weeks ive dealt with more drama than i would like. what came out of it? im not sure.  all i know is i definetly have my guard up. ive been screwed over by people enough times these past two weeks alone. biggest disappointment is probably one of my close friends going behind my back and doing who knows what with the guy im not over yet. and if that wasnt bad enough she also promised me she would never do that to me because her bestfriend did that to her. whatever i guess it really comes down to what matters to someone right? i dont know, i find a lot of people are selfish nowadays. i hated being selfish and i never ever want to be. but now i  think i need to be because if i dont look out for myself, no one else will.its not about other people anymore, its about yourself. so what if i become selfish? its better than always being screwed over by people you trusted. i cant really complain though cause i'm a pretty happy person. i know whose got my back and who i can trust. im starting to get to know a lot of other people and im pretty happy :)annnnnnnnnd there's andrew, he's cute <33 :)idk i guess i'll see how things go, its not going bad but it definetly needs to pick upp lmfaoschools pretty good, 70s + 80s in all classes sooo i gotta step it up a bit, but im sure i can do it. andddd more parties, im kinda excited. idc if it looks bad, if people think im a dumb slut or an alcoholic atleast i have funn ;)

[31 mar 2007|12:31am]





i hate the way a lot of things are inconsistent in my life. the last thing i need from you is to constantly walk in and out of my life. i need my security and i need a change. i know what needs to be done and i hope you help me because i really need this. i don't need anymore complications, this is already overwhelming enough. this time, it will be action not just talk. it's more than just luck, it's determination. please be patient with me, i promise i'll make it worth your while. no more excuses. everyday i'm realizing more and more who i really am but it's all so very complex. who knew there was so much to one person? it's always easier to point out the flaws because when you try to decipher your problems all you can see are your flaws. you forget to be thankful for what your strenghts are. people these days are too negative.  all i want to do is be loved and to love in return. i want to make you happy because i know you deserve it.  i've grown so vague and isolated from most people. it's almost likely the surface is completely surreal and sometimes i dont know which one i really am. it's hard when you try to impress people. you lose yourself because you convince yourself this is who you are when in fact it's not. people are so desperate to be liked they will do anything, even up to destroying themselves.back to real life.i have a job :)i'm doing fairly well at schooli need to stop spending moneyand drinking coffeeand drinking on a school night.help me please. chances are if you ever meet me in real life, you might be surprised. i'm annoying, i make dumb jokes and i think i'm funny. i wish i was constantly like that, life would be great. not that it's not right now. but it could be better.

i  dont think so.nu-uh. i hate you.what happened?you seem so lonely now. or maybe im insane who knows.point is, this sucks.you suck.everything sucks. like really.it's always why why why.maybe i should just do something. maybe you should.i find its so weird/great that you brought that up.and ive always thought about it.i dont really understand you, or this.im glad it happened. but actually not really cause now im in this position/situation.get me so far? doubt it.i need a sign. and i know i'll never get it unless i do something but i am tired of always doing something. it's always the same.no, i dont want to jump thank you anyway.you're pushing me. i dont like that.i wish you actually knew. or maybe you do. and that's why you're like this.thats cruel. dont do that.just please please please.say something. say it loud and clear. yes or no is all i need to know. its not that hard. then you or me can carry on.ive always been like this. but you dont know that.most people dont.nor do they care.but maybe this whole thing isnt real. maybe thats just the way you really are.i really like you. or atleast the part of you that i got to know. so well. i remember everything. everything you've ever said to me. every compliment, every reassurance, every word youve ever said to me.i deserve this, i want this. i want you. you're all i think of.everything.just talk to me please. thats all im asking.
