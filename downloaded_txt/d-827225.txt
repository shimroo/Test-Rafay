so, i am tickled to release my first e-book this year under my publishing hat hiltop publications.  dangerous intentions
 is available for kindle and will be available for  nook by the end of this week. so please be on the lookout.  it features a sexy, savvy  heroine michelene tyner--personal shopper for the elite of new orleans, and the dashing, thoroughly male hero chase alexander, criminal defense attorney.  when michelene's best friend is found murdered, chase is coerced by his boss to defend the accused. to make bad matters worst, the lovers are pitted against each other when michelene holds the key to the murder and it could unravel chase's legal career. and . . . . well, you'll have to read the book!!

never tell people what your book is about | sell your book like wildfire: the writer's guide to marketing and publicity | gotham writers' workshop





 i ran across this really interesting article. (see link below) for any authors reading this post, it presents us with some challenging questions. 
however, i would love to hear from the readers.  when you ask an author "what is your book about?" what do you really mean? what do you really want? what drives you to pick up a book from one other vs. another (even if they are sitting right next to each other at an event)

turn up the heat





after midnight
by donna hill




take a sexy, steamy journey to the dark side with this sizzling trio of erotic short stories by donna hill.

in mojo lover slip into the mind and body of chantel who is consumed by a lover she can't see but can only feel, when the moon is low, and steam rises from the wet grass of the savannah bayou at the height of a sweltering summer. her mojo lover works magic that chantel can't nor wants to resist . . .and neither will you.

selena's life changed forever one unforgettable night in the garden in 1804. fast forward a century and selena can only keep her unnatural desires at bay through the age-old art of massage. but when desire overwhelms reason and her lover unwittingly discovers who she is, selena must make the most difficult decision of her lifetime in the touch.

margaret is a woman anyone could easily forget. ordinary, unexciting, unattractive . . .by day. but by night, margaret is jade and jade has a thirst for danger and hot sex any and everywhere she can get it. margaret shares her erotic fantasies of jade with her devilishly handsome therapist, who is more than turned on by margaret/jades escapades. but everything is not what it seems in between the night.
