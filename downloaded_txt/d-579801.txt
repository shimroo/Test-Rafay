insights from the experts
“our big bets are data, ai, and cloud – mixed with it infrastructure, project management, networking, and devops to glue it together. in this area of rapid technological shift, organisations need data on what’s working. they need ai and machine learning automation to improve efficiency. and they need to be on the cloud to deliver the fast, online services that consumers demand. all underpinned by effective project management and devops to implement the change.”
ian clarkson
director of portfolio management















thought leadership





insights from the experts

“the data industry is experiencing significant transformation, with breakthroughs in ai and machine learning driving unprecedented levels of innovation. organisations are now harnessing the power of big data to inform strategic decisions, enhance customer interactions, and stay ahead in a competitive market.
”despite these advancements however, the data industry faces several critical challenges that necessitate robust strategies and solutions. to prepare for a transformative future, data teams must now prioritise data integration and cleaning and laying the foundations for a data-driven culture across the entire organisation.”
david pool
data & ai development director

















our end-to-end learning model













creating change through capability
upskilling and reskilling are core components of creating change, but won’t deliver alone. it’s also about getting people mastering and adapting that knowledge. collaborating across the business and applying back to create better outcomes.

continuity for the learner
connection across the business
