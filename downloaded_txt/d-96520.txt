 12/1/18 - film: the lord of the rings
	  following beren and lúthien, christopher tolkien has used the same "history in sequence" mode in the writing of the fall of gondolin. in the words of j.r.r. tolkien, it was "the first real story of this imaginary world" and, together with beren and lúthien and the children of húrin, it is one of the three "great tales" of the elder days. it is a tale of morgoth's quest to find the hidden city of gondolin, which was protected by ulmo who sent tuor to the city. tuor became a great leader, but morgoth launched an overwhelming attack on the city.

 6/5/17 - film: the lord of the rings
	  painstakingly restored from j.r.r. tolkien’s manuscripts by his son christopher tolkien and presented for the first time as a continuous and standalone story,  the epic tale of beren and lúthien  from tolkiens first age of the world informs aragorn and arwen's relationship in the lord of the rings. always key to the story is the fate that shadowed their love: beren was a mortal man, lúthien an immortal elf. her father, a great elvish lord, imposed on beren an impossible task before he might wed lúthien: to rob the greatest of all evil beings, melkor, of a silmaril.

 11/8/18 - noram road trips
					  every travel blog seems to have lists. some lists are pure fluff. some lists are made simply to stir discussion. many lists are thrown together by sampling old content to quickly produce new content. and some lists are thoughtfully put together. no matter which category a list falls under, we find that a list can quickly build a narrative about the blog (or blogger). a list can often paint a broad picture of the interests and opinions much better than a thorough article on a single topic.
