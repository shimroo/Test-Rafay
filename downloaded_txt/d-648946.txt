the search bar
			we're working on improving the search bar functionality. thanks for you patience.
			
for now, the best way to search for a facility or parking lot is to begin typing your search terms in the search bar and select an option from the suggestions that appear.
this will pan and zoom the map to your selection. from there, you can clear the search bar and click the feature to view any associated information in the pop-up.
you don't need to search for the official building name to locate a facility. we have tried to include aliases and common searches to return facilities as well.
				ex: search for parking permits to return the west entrance kiosk

tap the crosshairs icon in the upper left hand of the map to drop a pin at your current location
				ex:

				ex: 



the pop-up window

the asset number is in the upper left corner of the pop-up title, along with the facility name
