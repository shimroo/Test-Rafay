“if you spend more on 
		coffee than on it security, you will be hacked.”  ~richard clarke


happy september!!  


		let’s start with the big news: 
		in mid-august it became public 
		knowledge that national public data exposed personal data of 2.9 billion 
		(yes! billion, with a “b”) people.  the exposure was 
		actually found on the dark web four months earlier.  
		on april 8 the cybercriminal group (usdod) posted the data for sale for 
		a measly $3.5 million.  (https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/background-check-data-of-3-billion-stolen-in-breach-suit-says) 
		unfortunately, no one anted up with the $3.5 million and the 
		cybercriminals had a change of heart.  they started 
		giving the data away for free!  (https://www.komando.com/news/security/national-public-data-breach-how-to-protect-yourself-and-your-ssn/) 
		
on a side note, inquiring 
		minds would like to know:  did the criminals 
		remove their personal data and that of their loved ones from the list 
		before giving it away?  do cyber criminals have loved 
		ones?  if they did scrub the data, can we use ai to 
		reverse the list and figure out who is missing from the list (and then 
		arrest them)?  just curious!

after reading numerous trusted 
		sites, i have learned the breach was a result of accidentally posting a 
		list of usernames and passwords for administrative access to the 
		database on the internet.  (https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/national-public-data-published-its-own-passwords/) 
		note to everyone:  this is why we use password 
		managers.  keeping spreadsheets with passwords is very 
		risky!  need a password manager?  
		call me.  i’ll give you the first month for free!

what has been exposed?  full name, 
		current and past addresses, social security numbers, some email 
		addresses and information about relatives, including some who have been 
		deceased for years.  having your social security 
		number exposed is the largest of threats.
want to see if you are on 
		the list?   check out 

		https://npd.pentester.com/search 
		full disclosure:  i have not hired 
		pentester.com to scrub my data.  i’m not certain 
		anyone can remove data from the dark web.  pentester 
		can tell you if you are exposed. 
the most important step to 
		protection is freeze your credit.  this is a 
		pain in the rump, but trust me, this pain is way more enjoyable than 
		trying to reclaim your credit history after someone fraudulently 
		pretends to be you.  kim komando did a really nice job 
		of laying out how to contact the three credit bureaus here: 
		

		https://www.komando.com/tips/money/instructions-to-freeze-your-credit/

other things to watch for:
		watch your bank and credit card statements like a hawk. change your 
		passwords.  while you are at it, change the passwords 
		on your email accounts too!

medical explanation of benefits (eob): 
		watch for services you did not receive and notify health care 
		facilities and insurance companies immediately if you see false charges.

urgent emails: double check and then triple check the 
		sending address.  if you are replying, verify the 
		address before you hit send. it is easy to spoof an email address and 
		even easier to modify a signature line.    
		if there is any doubt, manually lookup the address and/or phone number 
		and call them.  do not trust the signature line!

		if you have loved ones,  please share this!

		until next month, 


stay safe,

because it made me laugh!!
