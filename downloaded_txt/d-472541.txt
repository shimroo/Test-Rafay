who we are…



 



your intergroup office services all groups in the broward county area. it is not a governing body and does not attempt to, nor can it, rule any aa group. its sole purpose is to act as a clearinghouse for the convenience of members and groups desiring assistance, and to extend the twelve step work “carrying the message” to the sick alcoholic. the intergroup office is supported entirely by contributions from groups, usually a specified amount each month or at intervals throughout the year. the office purchases and sells all conference-approved books and literature to groups throughout broward county. read more about “who we are…”…
