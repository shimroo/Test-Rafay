sunday
november 20th, 2005 - umm yeah =\
i know, everyone is at myspace and no one updates or comments, but i am just going to update to get everything out of my mind...so there's this boy and he always makes me smile & just makes me wicked, wicked happy, even when i am having a horrible day! i think about him all the time & just wish i could be with him. we know each other and consider ourselves friends, but i still need to get to know him better...he is really nice & sweet and no matter how bad or worse my day is going, he just makes everything seem okay...yeah you may think its just some little crush, but this time i really like him.  i really care about him and it gets me so mad when people say i can do better than that, but to me he is the best i can get...i just don't get people sometimes...i mean if i really like him why not try?  i honestly don't want to go another day, so i think i am going to tell  you exactly what is on my mind...only if i really could though...this may seem too soon to say this but it feels like i love him...=\ sigh...nobody will ever be able to take me higher <3comment? who cares...

hello everyone! =)my competition for cheerleading is on saturday! it's coming soo quick and i am so nervous! but if you didn't know this yet, i got a call from the doctors and now i have to be on crutches for 3 more weeks! thats right, 3 more weeks for a toe meaning i am missing my compeition! i cried alot of the night, but i went to practice to see all my girls and they made me feel better! plus one of my best girls miss jill was there! =) she made me feel soo much better! but if we make it to regionals i can compete but all i can do now, is go to the practices, give them support and be there for them saturday! titanium practice started yesterday and we met everyone! i am so excited! we sang a few songs and they sounded pretty good and in feb. we are singing for the manchester monarches, so i am pumped! not sure what i am doing for halloween yet, probably hanging out with some of the girls! =)no one ever comments anymore, so comment please! kay*hoff <3give me your input on this...so you & this friend become closer and closer throughout middle school.  you 2 always talk about everything and were the ones who were always left out of the group. you 2 were there for each other no matter and was always the other persons shoulder to cry on, but now your friend starts getting closer to the group of girls who left you out all the time last year, she doesn't talk to you as much or tells you whats on her mind...she's always on the phone with the group friends and is starting to always hang out with them without you..you do accpet that she is getting closer with them but feel that you shouldn't be completly left out...would you upset or not? tell me what you think...=\

october 14th, 2005 - happy // ehh...
yeah so lately life has been really good but yet shitty...so today i found out that i made titanium! i was sooo happy! people told me like thursday but i couldn't check the list because of my toe...now on wednesday i was babysitting and i stubbed my toe really really hard because i was running for the little kid because he was going to hit his head and i didn't feel like hearing him scream and cry at the top of his lungs so i was running and got him, but instead i got hurt and i wanted to cry it hurt so bad, but tough katie didn't cry =) are you impressed yet? haha, well i went to the doctors the next morning and they told me i have a broken toe, so they gave me this boot thingy and i have to use my crutches from 6th grade - and no i am not the same height as 6th grade, i had to raise them! so yeah, i didn't get to check the list till today, but the good things about having a broken toe is i don't have to carry my backpack for 1 week & i get to use the elevator! but the bad part is i am missing one week of cheerleading and our competition is in like 2 weeks or so? yeah, so just a little mad there...also shitty today because my brother absolutly hates me, like hates me...we had a "talk" about it and he always looks at the bad sides of me, and i just want to be the best little sister, and him to be there but he doesn't care ='[ at least i have ryan by my side...please comment to make me feel better =)-kay*hoff
