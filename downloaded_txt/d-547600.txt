your meals are amazing. i serve on board a uss ship and your meals enable
me to eat a kosher meal every day without having to worry about cooking or
preparation.

labriute saved the day! we just returned from a 2-week trip to spain. we
took an entire suitcase and blessed your meals almost every day." sheila t.
"i just wanted to let you know that i was the only person who got to eat
during a recent blackout. i had a labriute meal, added the water and
enjoyed a wonderful meal.
- renee s. 




we just returned from peru and after spending 18 hours at the airport and
having no meals most of that time, we quickly pulled our labriute meals
and...they saved the day.
