signet rings

signet rings have been worn for 1000âs of years. traditionally crafted in precious metal they are the ultimate personal item and individual statement. 

historically the signet ring face is deep engraved to allow for the making of an impression into soft material. in this way the signet ring transcends being simply an item of jewellery, becoming an ancient tool, allowing the wearer to leave a mark in more ways than appearance alone. the engraving deep into the signet face also provides the longevity required for a lifetime of wear.

each signet ring engraving is chosen to signify what is most meaningful and personal to us; family lineage, (usually heraldic crest or coat of arms), social belonging (emblem or logo) or simply an attractive fashionable and individual statement of engraved art of an ancient or modern style. 

organised into engraving categories, here you will find inspiration for that most precious and individual of items - your signet ring.

dexter has been perfecting the art of deep engraving traditional signet rings since 1969, making us the oldest and most established maker / engraver in the world today. 

so confident are we you will love your new signet ring we offer a no quibble money back guarantee.
