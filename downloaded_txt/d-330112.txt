	 google - goog
	 
    


is google at it low?  i say yes.  it has hit it bottom.  now it is really ready to run.  its going to 850 or 900 this time.  see what other are saying:"we believe goog has several years of exceptional growth ahead," wrote american technology research analyst rob sanderson in a recent research note. "controversy has shaken marginal investors and a few sell-side bulls. we think this is creating a great buying opportunity and we encourage accumulation of the stock."some are now saying this could be the right time to get back in. "we think the bottom's already happened," says jeffrey lindsay, an analyst for sanford c. bernstein, who rates google as outperform, with a price target of $750.i agree with jeffrey lindsay here.  he is right now.despite the fourth-quarter miss, the company still posted a 17% climb in profit and generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow. the company's search engine also continues to command an enviable lead over its rivals, capturing 60% of the market share.$ 1 billion in free cash flow.  wow.  again this stock is really ready to run now.jason berkeswww.jasonberkes.comlabels: goog, google, jason berkes

	 officials tally wildfire damage estimates
	 
    


san diego county dept. of ag., weights and measures reports 11,456 acres of ag. production in affected wildfire areas, including an estimated 45 acres of greenhouses, 750 acres of field-grown cut flowers, 863 acres of outdoor nursery crops and 5,880 acres of avocado trees. initial estimates for the rice canyon fire, which burned in the fallbrook and rainbow areas, show 927 acres of ag. were either damaged or destroyed at a value of $30 million. this includes an estimated 217 acres of cut flowers, 218 acres of nursery stock and 486 acres of avocados. these losses do not include irrigation systems, equipment or dwellings. one of the biggest losses from the fires occurred at kendall farms, a field cut flower grower in fallbrook, san diego union-tribune reported. dawn nielsen, the county's deputy ag. commissioner, told the newspaper that the company lost 95% of its 200-acre crop. nielsen estimated 1,630 acres (16.5%) of the county's 9,870 acres of ornamental crops are in the rice canyon and witch creek fire areas. eric larson, county farm bureau exec. dir., told the paper significant plant damage was expected from burning, dehydration, smoke and ash pollution. he said further losses could occur if plants can't be watered due to damaged irrigation lines. larson didn't expect plant losses to result in increased prices because other growers would be able to meet demand.jason berkeslabels: jason berkes

	 ethanol's tough times continue
	 
    


it doesn't look like the ethanol industry is going to get relief from its pain any time soon, according to a panel of investors at the dow jones alternative energy innovations conference in redwood city, calif., earlier this week.the industry has seen margins shrink and stock prices fall, and companies such as verasun have pulled back on plans to increase their ethanol production.when it comes to corn-based ethanol in the united sates, "government and corporate support are being largely dictated by congressmen and senators from iowa versus true scientists," he said. iowa is one of the largest produces of ethanol in the country.  ethanol doesn't make sense in many cases and fails to address numerous problems that the fuel is supposed to help solve, he said.  among the biggest hopes for u.s.-produced ethanol is its ability to curb the country's dependence on foreign oil. president george w. bush has supported such efforts, calling for 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels by 2017.jason berkeslabels: ethanol, jason berkes

	 farming faces phosphate shortfall
	 
    


a salt of phosphoric acid salt, phosphate is a chemical compound made up of a central phosphorous atom and four oxygen atoms.phosphorous is a "finite and irreplaceable" mineral, whose known reserves that are economically viable for exploitation could run out in 60 to 100 years if the current pace of global consumption continues, euripedes malavolta, veteran agronomist and researcher at the university of sao paulo, told tierramérica."without phosphorous there will be no agriculture, nor biofuels, nor life. humanity will end," he said. other minerals, like nitrogen, potassium, cobalt, magnesium and molybdenum, are also essential, but their sources are not as limited and, except for the first two, their consumption is relatively low.do you think it is really this bad?"phosphate has the risk running out before petroleum does," josé oswaldo siqueira, professor of soil microbiology at the federal university of lavras, told a bio-energy conference held last month in sao paulo.strong expansion of agriculture for bio-energy purposes would accelerate depletion of phosphate, which is a fact to consider in any "strategic vision" for that sector, he said in a tierramérica interview.jason berkeslabels: jason berkes

	 monsanto shows how high-tech farming has become
	 
    


the monsanto agricultural company brought its seed genetics know-how to the sunbelt agricultural exposition in a display on a tractor-trailer rig.the research done on the major crops also can be used to help develop and make improvements to smaller crops, burton said. its work is designed to improve the genetic buildup of crops while still keeping the look, feel and taste of them the same. burton said the company spends about $2 million each day on seed research, and introducing new products takes anywhere from eight to 10 years of research. unlike other companies who also work to develop better seeds, monsanto’s only project is agriculture, he said. “monsanto is focused only on agriculture,” burton said. “our success is dependent on farmer’s success.”hot farming stocks major developments monsanto has been able to introduce in recent years are seeds and plants that are more resistant to insects, burton said. using products such as bollgard ii cotton seeds, farmers have gone from having to spray pesticides as many as 14 times per year some 12 years ago to spraying only two or three times per year now. reduced spraying, of course, adds to the profit line. seed development is a continuing goal to improve farmers’ yields and better plant production, burton said. monsanto is about four years away from being able to bring drought-resistant corn to the market, he added.jason berkeswww.jasonberkes.com/usdalabels: hot farming stocks, jason berkes, monsanto

	 how ethanol is making the farm belt thirsty
	 
    


mike clements stood near the railing of a low bridge on a dusty country road and pointed to a clump of green amid the rippling waters of the republican river.  "there it is," he said ominously. anyone else might have seen a reed-like grass swaying in the breeze. but mr. clements, head of the lower republican natural resources district, saw phragmites, a fast-growing invasive species that is slowing the flow of the river and sucking up precious water. the stuff had to go, he said.jason berkeswww.jasonberkes.com/ethanollabels: ethanol
