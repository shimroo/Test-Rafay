tips when proofreading your essay

we’ve all been there – staring at our screens, trying to perfect that essay or assignment we’ve been working on for hours. we’ve meticulously researched and written every word, but proofreading it can feel overwhelming. however, checking your work thoroughly is essential in ensuring you submit a flawless piece. if you are new to making an essay, you should know about writing an essay introduction that is engaging. in this blog post, we’ll provide some tips when it comes to proofreading your essay so that you can be confident in your submission and impress your professors.
read it aloud
when it comes to proofreading, one of the most effective techniques is reading your work aloud. this method lets you catch any awkward phrasing or errors that may have slipped past you when reviewing silently. reading aloud also helps you identify areas where your writing may be unclear or confusing. when we read silently, our brains often fill in missing words or make assumptions about what we meant to say.
another benefit of reading aloud is that it forces us to slow down and pay closer attention to each word and sentence. it’s easy for our eyes to skim over mistakes when reading quickly, but by speaking each word out loud, we give ourselves a better chance at catching errors before they slip through. so next time you proofread your essay, don’t be afraid to read it aloud! you might feel silly at first, but this simple technique can save you from embarrassing mistakes and help improve your writing skills.
stick to the style guide
when writing an essay, sticking to the style guide is crucial. the style guide provides a set of rules and guidelines for formatting your paper, including everything from margins and font size to citation styles. a critical aspect of a style guide is consistency. following the rules outlined in the guide ensures that your paper looks polished and professional.
it’s also important to keep in mind who your audience is when deciding which style guide to follow. for example, if you’re writing for an academic audience, you may need to use a specific citation format such as apa or mla. while it can be tempting to stray from the guidelines to make your paper stand out, doing so only detracts from its overall quality. remember: clarity and readability are key to effective communication through writing.
make a list of errors
when proofreading your essay, it is essential to have a systematic approach to identify errors. one way to do this is by making a list of errors. this method allows you to organize mistakes and prevent missing any during editing. start by reading through your essay once without making any changes. while doing so, take note of common errors such as misspellings, grammar mistakes, or punctuation errors you frequently make.
then read each sentence carefully, checking for these specific types of errors. as you review each sentence, write down the mistake on a separate sheet of …

the list of therapeutic words you must learn in school

08/13/2020
  |  no comments
  |  education



improve your quality of life by knowing the therapy terms that may help others. i remember the lesson i learned in my study. the ponbee.com site shares how to find the right counseling terminology for you to communicate well. i started by looking at the perspective of health from the perspective of mental illness. suggestions for health promotion may have been helpful, although i am not saying that these theories and models are insignificant.
we must all study and learn from it! it surprises the effects that such changes have on well-being, and these theories have been applied quickly, along with general well-being. these theories can have the following advantages, whether or not it is a mental health problem. the analysis of various concepts makes it possible to think and reflect.
metacognition
the term metacognition comes to the idea that if we can observe our thoughts, we can also have the ability to do so. instead of falling into the trap of believing that our harmful, foolish, or unhealthy thoughts are a fact, we use our attention to discover them and understand our opinions, not to define them, but to see them, recognize their influence, and work on them. by connecting with the definition to improve, you will begin. if you want to take a step forward, you can investigate whether they work for you, what state they are in, and if you wish to keep them as performers or change them.
congruence
in counseling, this term is similar, but on a deeper level. to achieve consistency, what you say should be the same as what you communicate. for example, suppose you like dedication and commitment. the decision to marry your partner will give you pleasure, while the unpredictable decision to cheat on your spouse may cause dissatisfaction. think first of all about your core values to take advantage of them. consider whether your behavior and suggestions are consistent.
dissonance
dissonance is the fear that arises when there is a discrepancy between your beliefs, thoughts, or actions. if you are not aware that this may be the source of your stress with its conflict prospects, stress factors may develop. if you observe a fight, remember how you can redirect yourself to achieve consistency. after repeated exercises, your understanding can shift from reactive thinking to a perceived plan when stress factors appear as indicators.
empathy
you may know the word empathy, but what do you call it? your definition is probably like compassion if you’re like most people. if you are aware that there is a gap, you are probably working backward with a description of empathy to describe it. empathy is important with the person’s emotion in a particular situation without you having to feel anything that you can recognize.
compassion is associated with pain. without ever experiencing such a decline, you can imagine what it is like and create feelings of shame, compassion, and worry. instead of believing what this experience is like, it is an immersion in your …

studies show that when emotions combine with learning, they are more likely to retain some of the information for a long time. instead of teaching your children something they cannot associate with an emotion, teach them to understand through their passions!
make it fun
you have a vast opportunity to make tedious and typical subjects fun during homeschooling your child! as we have already said, the advantages of integrating emotions are precious. this can be done by including fun, which your children will discover in a more efficient and innovative method!
go out for an adventure
it may be inside your house or in the garden, take your children with you on an adventure! dress up in costume or set up a stand that is a campsite, so your children can have fun and feel like they are on a journey of discovery. something that can’t be taken away, if only to be imaginative, stimulates your children’s creativity and imagination! win a show with your children or an obstacle course or build a stand with costumes and figures! there are many fun and creative things you can do – this will stimulate the imagination and give them a lesson in the process!

effective ways to relax after a stressful week of work

newly created companies are demanding, but they’re different from others i know since i did for work. like many workers today, the development of my profession is the result of strategic planning what exactly do i want to achieve, i fit in as much as possible all the right things, and i’ll be frank i end up in chaos, i had to learn to relax. trying to read, because a book brings calmness, but i also had to learn to shape my life.
it is not very likely that i will tell you what i have discovered. balance? what i’ve been doing for the last two years has been allowing me to prepare myself, relax, and put my mind at ease. it’s been a series of attempts and failures.  here are the things i do a week to relieve stress.
meditation
i used to do this before applications like headspace hit the market. i like that it became a cliché; through meditation. i’ll talk about it and get it over with. there are hundreds of possibilities, and there is no right or wrong, but here’s what works for me. i meditate, shaking in an hour.
i allow myself the guilty pleasure of briefly evaluating my phone and drinking a few sips of hot coffee until i lie down in my room and get away from the outside world. it is the hustle and bustle of the city far below my window along with a bedroom, although i can use time. personally, meditations on what is presented accumulate to find a path and sweep away the material.

kickboxing workout
there’s yoga, and there’s a triathlon bur for me, it’s kickboxing workout. i used to do that. i like to kick all night, relax my shoulders, try my method, and take the class. it’s intense; it’s fun who isn’t happy to kick something along with the songs.
long walks on the seaside
i’m attracted to the sea, and since decompression, while walking is part of existence. however, i moved across the bay, and i’m lucky enough to be able to say i have a view of the water. and it’s a challenge if i don’t have to spend a minimum of time to get the benefit of an hour’s walk out of the seaside.
reading before bedtime
so people say they don’t have time. i think you have to make time. there are nights when i go straight to bed, and i’m exhausted. it takes me no less than five minutes to move, and it’s a religious habit these days. this is my suggestion to change my thinking from work style to relaxation style, and it usually works. i tend to get distracted instead of trying to sleep with thoughts projected into my head or thinking about the logistics of the event.
sweet talk with a friend or relative
i score quickly when i’m faced with a fight or a decision. i’m lucky to be connected to them now. they have …

deciding on which type of eye specialist you want to be might be difficult for future careers, and choosing the right school to study might be confusing if you’re going to be an optician or an optometrist. here we discuss the difference between an optician vs optometrist.
optician or optometrist
knowing the differences between the two career choices can help us decide on what we want to do later on which programs to take in college and which clinics we want to work for.
an optician is an eye care specialist that assists clients with eyewear fitting and selection. opticians are most commonly encountered in clinics and stores that sell contact lenses and eyeglasses. some big nationwide stores that sell eyewear prefer not to employ opticians because they cannot offer frame alterations and lens prescriptions, and people that work in these stores may or may not have any optician training. because of this, opticians are frequently found in ophthalmology clinics and optometrist offices.
on the other hand, an optometrist should not be confused with an optician. an optometrist is more focused on the eyes, vision, visual systems, and their related structures. they obtain skills that enable them to fit or prescribe lenses involving vision improvement and treat various eye diseases. they can administer injections and prescribe oral medications like antibiotics on patients. they can also do eye laser surgeries and provide pre and post care to operative patients.
which career to choose
before deciding on which career you want to focus on, you should choose the right college for your future career as an optician or optometrist. opticians are not trained to be medical doctors, but they do have enough training to fill prescriptions for eyeglasses. optometrists are doctors of optometry, but they are not medical doctors as well.
optometrists study for four years in an undergraduate course then takes up another four years of study of further education. optometrists can take up several eye care specializations like optometry, eye therapy or sports eye care, vision rehabilitation and family eye care, and a variety of different specialties. because of advancements in medical technology, some optometry schools now have state-of-the-art facilities and equipment necessary for training to hone and develop their students.
conclusion
choosing a specialization is easy, considering your target career path. you can check online for schools that offer vocational courses or undergraduate programs for future careers as an optician and optometrist. although differences are apparent, personal choices and opinions still do matter for our livelihood.…

  |  private schools



sending your kids to a private school is the best thing that you can do for them. there are significant differences between public and the best value private schools. these differences favor private schools over their public counterparts. therefore, having you kids in a private school is way better than having them in a public institution.
why private schools are better than most public schools
specialized care
if you are looking for an education system that provides specialized care for your children, then you should send them to a private school. tutors in private schools have clear instructions to provide specialized care to all children. even though public schools have the same policy, the government does not see to it that children receive specialized care. in a private school, you can be sure that the management will follow up to ensure that every child receives personalized care.
small class size
another benefit that should motivate you to send your children to a private school is because they will be in a small class size. on average, a private school will have about 20 children in a class. this is unlike public schools, which can have a higher number in a single class. there are many advantages of having your child in a small-sized class. one of the major advantages is that the child gets quality attention from the instructor.
educated according to specific beliefs
a private school can ensure that your children get an education according to specific beliefs. for example, you may choose a religious private school to instill the religious values that you want your children to have. this is unlike the public schools where education is general and there is no emphasis on certain beliefs.
extracurricular activities
if you want your children to excel in extracurricular activities, then you should send them to a private school. many private schools put much emphasis on developing children’s special talents. if your child has a talent in sports or arts, you can be sure that a private school will help develop that talent.
quality education
there is a reason why many employers prefer adults who went through private schools. the reason behind this is that private schools offer the best quality of education. a child in a private school will get a holistic education that prepares him/her to face the challenges in the world. children who go to private schools excel more than their counterparts in public schools. this calls for you to choose the best private school for your children.…

  |  loans



most college students rely on loans to fund their higher education. usually, these loans come in handy to many students who cannot afford to pay college fees. with college student loans, one can fund his/her college education and repay the loan afterwards. students have the option of choosing either the government loans or private loans. while a government loan seems a better option, many college students are turning to private lenders. this is because private lenders help in addressing some of the issues facing college students’ loans.
what are the main issues affecting college students’ loans today?
amount of loan awarded
one of the major issues facing college student loan today is the amount awarded to a college student. it is an important issue because it affects the life of college students. loan cuts have been a hot subject over the years, considering that even u.s. president reagan cut federal aid. it is an issue today because college students are not just looking for money to pay their college fees but for their upkeep.
luckily, private lenders have addressed this concern. such lenders increase the limit of loan awarded to a student. private banks may cover the total cost of attendance. this makes college life attractive for college students since they have enough funds.
assurance of getting the loan
another major issue that is facing college students’ loan today is the uncertainty of getting a loan. when applying for a government loan for students, there is no guarantee that you will get the loan. this is a major issue because it does not allow students to plan for their college life. however, there is a solution offered by private lenders. there are fewer requirements to get a private student loan from a private lender. this is a near guarantee to every needy student getting a loan.
loan repayment
loan repayment is a recurrent issue that has always been there. college students are usually worried about how they will repay their loans. the good thing is that students now have the option of repaying their loans even while studying. if a student manages to get a part-time job, private lenders compel such students to start repaying their loans. this reduces the burden of having to repay a loan for many years.
obligation of the cosigner
the cosigner is an important entity in the college student loan. he/she has an obligation of ensuring that the student repays the loan fully. it is an issue today because many cosigners do not want to hold these obligations for an extended period. this is why many students prefer to use private lenders who relieve cosigners of their obligations after a student shows commitment to repay the loan.…

wider loan limit than federal loans
another great benefit that college students enjoy when they borrow from private lenders is the ability to get a wider loan limit. the government loans for college students usually have limits that make the students not to have enough money. however, private lenders issue loans that may cover up to the total cost of attendance (coa). they do not put into account other financial aids that students have, and hence students get more money.
flexible repayment options
repayment of students’ loans is always a big issue that determines the kind of loan that a student will apply. the reason why many college students are turning to private lenders is that private lenders have flexible loan repayment options. there are fixed and variable interest rates as options for loan repayment. a student has the choice to pick a repayment option that works well for him/her. this kind flexibility helps students to plan well for their loan repayment that fits their risk tolerance.
cosigner release
many private lenders will offer an option of releasing the cosigner from the loan agreement if a student meets some requirements. the only requirement here is to adhere to the repayment schedule chosen by the student. as soon as a student shows commitment, a private lender will release the cosigner from the loan. this is a benefit since the cosigner will no longer have ties with the loan. this is unlike government loans, which do not release cosigners until total repayment of the loan.…

how far is the school?
you do not want to take your kid far away from home during the initial years at the school. your kid will not take it well if you take him to a school far away from school. traveling to and from school is not a thing you would want for a child.

the reputation of the school matters

what is the teacher pupil ratio?

how ethics education is taught

01/08/2017
  |  no comments
  |  teaching



the quality of life is dependent on the quality of the concerned individuals. quality determines what you become in the future. it dictates how ethical or good a person is. how do you become a morally upright person? the teaching or moral values can be traced back to the ancient times. these values were even taught in the biblical times.
moral values are taught the same way mathematics and science are taught. it is done by providing knowledge about what is good or bad. there are two kinds or forms of intelligence –emotional and regular. both of these are based on different rules governing the education sector. emotional intelligence education deals with altering the physical infrastructure of your brain. it starts from the time a baby is growing and developing in the womb.
emotional intelligence is then continued through kisses and hugs and the environment in which the child is nurtured. the right characteristics attained at the age of six years are likely to determine the rest of your life. this means that moral education, even though we are already living in the so-called digital world, should be instilled to an individual right from his childhood.
 
morality
every community has the set morals which everyone is expected to follow. billions of dollars are spent while containing and preventing crime, but nothing changes. however, the rate of crime can be reduced by altering the physical quality which is generated by your brain.
it is this moral quality that shapes an individual. this means that moral education is not just a matter of teaching what is right or wrong but it involves creating and developing the proper moral infrastructure generated by the brain.
the human is categorized in four distinct levels which are:
premature brain
individuals at this level are said to have the same moral values as a snake. according to them, their mind is everything, but people sees nothing in them. they consider themselves as being above the law. any given moral education can not change such individuals. in fact, their brain is considered to be
morally gone or rotten.
immature brain
individuals in this group are corrupt in nature. they feel that they deserve the best. the current ethics education can not change them. they have the highest degree of selfishness. this kind of the brain infrastructure needs to be changed.
mature brain
individuals in this group consider themselves as being the best. it is very easy to change such group of people. this kind of trophy self-image needs to be changed and replace it with the selfless self.
super mature brain
people in this level possess a selfless image. those individuals who are in this group do not require any moral education.…
