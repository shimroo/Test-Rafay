camila gross, cooper wedding







i would recommend carahills to any beautiful bride. carahills only needs you to book with them, they will do everything else after that. they took care of everything, i did not have one bad experience at all. with changing owners in the middle of me planning my wedding. they did not miss a beat at all. traci & katlin are the best!!!! these ladies and the entire team at carahills is who you need for your big day!!! this venue is beyond very professional, organized , and they truly do enjoy what they have been called to do. they did an outstanding job for me and my family. i will most definitely be back if its just to say hello and have some wedding cake and some of their signature champagne punch. it was the best day of my life at carahills, truly wish i could do it all over again. thank you again for everything.
