photos - baby, girls' moment





 who does she look like? she has daddy's eye lids, but my big pupils. daddy's nose, and sharper face
 looking pretty serious here.
zara's pretty loving towards meimei the minute they met. she wants to 'sayang' meimei every time when meimei cries or frets by stroking and singing to meimei. she likes to hug meimei for no reason. drinking milk together in the night.
 meimei's small hands compared to mine.

update on zara
when we asked zara what we should call meimei since we have already shortlisted to 2 names, and we wanted her to choose one, she just said "mei mei's name is mei mei."

zara has also started to ask the why question. e.g. "why the korkor (chinese : big brother) nose like that one" when she saw a picture of a boy with big longish nose.

zara's is getting better in reasoning.
daddy asked her to walk when all she wanted was to be carried when they go for their park trip. she told daddy, "daddy carry zara. daddy need(s) excercise."
i told her to stay away from meimei since she is not fully recovered from chicken pox and she told me, "i'm feeling better already. i eat (ate) my chicken pox medicine already."

and she started calling daddy "dad" and me "mum". i have no idea where she learn that (tv maybe?).

updates - birth, baby, zara, cl, me





birth
our 2nd daugther was born on 28th dec evening.

i opted for elective induction and admitted in the morning to be induced. dr inserted a pill into the cervix to start things off and later put me on drips. i only got a little contraction, i could still read, listen to music, talk to daddy gaily.

when the drip dosage was increased to 100%, my cervix was barely 2 cm opened, even though the contraction pain started to become unberable. i wanted to go without pain relief for as long as i can but after 1 1/2hr, i started using the (entonox) gas. then the midwife suggested that i go with pain killer since i got very tense every time the contraction started which would affect the cervix dilation. after talking to daddy, i opted for pethidine, just like i did with zara's birth.

the minute pethidine was injected, i started relaxing and the cervix started to dilate. we were disturbed by baby's heart beat though. every time when a contraction started, her heart beat went down, after the contraction, the heart beat recovered. dr was called and he told us that it may be due to 1) baby was compressed in the birth canal or 2) baby's umblical cord was around her neck. the latter could be life threatening. he told us we could either opt for emergency c-sect for safest bet, but looking from the way things are progressing, he told us to hang a little bit longer. we were worried, but trusted his judgement.

soon after that, i could feel the urge to push (that's why i didn't want to go for epidural since it will numb all such sensation). midwife checked me and found that baby's head was already crowning. every thing started to happen, within minutes, dr was back in the labour room, gave me an episiotomy, and the delivery began. this round, no help needed, baby just got pushed out with one push.

the minute i heard her cry, all pain was forgotten, although i still felt a bit high and dizzy from pethidine, the rush of joy was overwhelming.

the little girl was 2.91kg (zara was 3.39kg), and her height was 51.5cm (zara was 50.5cm).


 the room we spent 12hrs in awaiting for the birth of our 2nd daugtherbaby
i worried too much. when i was pregnant, i was constantly worried that i will not love baby as much as i do with zara. i just found new capicity to love her. how can you not love your own flesh and blood?

baby is good, she's more patient than zara and even when she's hungry, she'll cry a little and wait for me to feed her (zara used to cry and turn black every time we were a bit too 'slow').

she sleeps a lot still, but when she's awake, she likes to look around, checking us out. she was admitted back to the hospital for jaundice for 2 nights and now she's back home coping well.

we still call her baby or mei-mei (chinese : small sister) since we haven't decided on the name yet. :(

zara 
zara is doing very well as a jie-jie (chinese: big sister). we gave her a set of nice markers as a present from baby and also bought her a baloon when she came visiting, telling her she's now jie-jie to baby and mummy's assistant. she's very proud of her new titles.

the first few days, she cried when baby cried for milk. she didn't want the confinement lady (cl) to handle mei-mei when mei-mei cried but insisted that "mummy, sayang (malay : pat) mei-mei. don't want aunty (cl) sayang." she constantly wants to hug and stroke her mei-mei but unfortunately, she contracted chicken pox (probably from visiting mei-mei in the peadiatric ward) after mei-mei was discharged and we told her not to be too close to mei-mei for the time being.confinement lady 
what's wrong with these people? they think so highly of themselves that they don't wash dishes, do house work or help out with the older kids even when they are just siting around doing nothing.

i'm barely able to stand her, and daddy is very tempted to get rid of her. she's more like a cook instead of a cl. since i'm 100% breastfeeding, and i like to be a bit hands on (like cleaning baby's poo or topping and tailing baby) she doesn't have much to do. baby sleeps with me in the night, and when i naps. i wake up to feed her while the cl sleeps away. she cooks for me 3 meals a day, washes baby's clothes, bathes baby and that's about all she does. she doesn't help with zara at all, nor anything else in the house. she sleeps when i sleeps (and sometimes before), and when zara watches her vcds/dvds, she watches with zara(but not to care for zara, even small little things like giving zara snacks or taking a drink for zara from the fridge, cl will shout for tuyam to do it).

the only good thing that came out of this is she knows what i should and should not eat and make sure whatever i take help with milk production. with zara (without a cl), my milk came on day 5. with baby, my milk came on day 4 and supply is pretty good.

me
i'm doing fine but a bit tired. 2 kids vs 1 is very different. when baby is feeding and zara needs attention, i have to be tactful, or still give zara the attention by talking to her or doing things with her with my free hand. i still try to spend as much time as i can with zara so that she doesn't feel i'm neglecting her. when baby is alert, i try to talk to her and carry her around to show her the house or look at new things.i only get to rest when both of them are sleeping. luckily, i can breastfeed while lying down, so in the night when baby wakes up for her feed, i just latch her on and continue to sleep while she feeds. i'm not sure what is wrong with blogger but have been trying to post more photos but not able to after the hospital shot.. *sigh* may not be able to update or read blogs as frequently for now until things are more settled.

things she says prior to the delivery





she woke up one morning and started crying, big drops of tears flowing down (not the wailing type of crying).
me : what happened?
zara : mummy gone!
me : did you have a bad dream?
zara : *still crying* mummy gone to morib.
me : mummy is not gone, see, mummy is here.
zara : *smiled and wiped her tears* yeah, mummy is here. not gone.

on our last visit to the dr.
zara : zara ask dr jason to take out baby from mummy's stomach.
me : why?
zara : then mummy can go to the park with zara. zara can sit on mummy's lap on the swing, then zara and mummy can swing high high.
(she missed the time i used to sit her on my lap and we shared a swing together)

earlier today.
zara : mummy, daddy, zara, family.
me : yeah, later we'll have mei-mei. then it'll be mummy, daddy, zara, mei mei. we're a family. zara : i don't want mei mei. zara's family only have mummy, daddy and zara.

when i tugged her to bed, i prepped her for tomorrow.
me : tomorrow mummy will go to the hospital and stay there ok? zara sleep with daddy in the night.
zara : *started crying* i don't want mummy to go to hospital, i want mummy to stay with zara. me : zara can come and visit mummy with daddy you know.
zara : *still crying* then zara say hi to mummy. *started wailing* i don't want.
me : ok ok. we talk about happier things then. what did we do today.. let's see.......
zara : *stopped her crying*

ho-ho-holidays!





i'm going to pop soon, and here is what we'd been doing, to spend time with zara as the only child before the arrival of no. 2.

eve of christmas eve : we had dinner at eat work shop, and i had my roast turkey! it was good! the owner, marcia, even threw in the turkey wing for free! after that, we took zara to hotels (the saujana and the holiday inn glenmarie) to check out the christmas decorations, and she really had a good time, since these 2 hotels were very spacious and quiet, and she can run around freely.

christmas eve : the big family dinner was supposed to be 3 tables at a chinese restaurant. my eldest sis decided not to join us and my youngest sis got admitted for dengue fever the day before. so the dinner ended up being a small one, with only king's wife's family and ours with my dad. dinner was err.. cut throat price in overseas restaurant and not nice at all!

after dinner, we adjorned to the hospital to visit my sister and open up our presents together with my sister's family.


on christmas day : zara was kept busy playing with her christmas presents in the morning. we then went to have lunch with my dad, and later dinner with daddy's friends. whole day of eating and outing!
 she and her favourite present, the singing pink car, from chloe, our neighbour
on boxing day : daddy went back to work. i brought zara to kidzsports with tuyam and then to the pet shop, per the requests of the little girl. bought myself the allerhand bag (christmas present from daddy), and end my hunt for the perfect bag for carrying zara and baby's things.

best of all! zara and i are both very happy to receive these from domestic rat and may. thanks ladies!
 zara loves the doggie; i believe the chocolate lolly was supposed to be a raindeer, but it has melted. :( zara was however, very keen in tasting her first lolly pop.i'll be going in to the hospital on thursday to get induced. today (wednesday) will be my very last day spending with zara before the arrival of baby. some how, i feel a bit melancholy. after this, she will no longer be my only child, where all my energy and attention has been channeled to the last 2 years. wish me a safe and quick delivery, will you?

confinement sleeping arrangement





we had very bad experience with our first confinement lady (cl) when we had zara. being extremely unhygenic (picked nose then applied diaper cream on zara; dipped a spoon into her mouth to taste her own cooking and then using the same spoon to stir the broth later), totally non supportive of my breast feeding plan (when zara cried because of hunger, she started chanting, "aiyo, girl girl ah, mummy naughty ah, don't let you drink powder milk ah", as though i wasn't already stressed enough) and rough (the thumping sound she made when she burped zara was heart breaking); she got the boot the 2nd day. i took care of zara on my own (no mil to offer help, didn't trust maid with zara) with a few visits from the hospital nurse to teach me how to bath and care for zara.

we are trying our luck the 2nd time this round. since i only started looking for one after i got my amnio result (into 5th month), we were not left with many choices (better ones were already hired). i haven't met the cl, don't know what she looks like, how she is.

daddy is extremely skeptical about leaving baby at night with the cl alone in a room for that one month. since i'm going to breast feed anyway, we plan to have the cl sleep with me in our room, while daddy takes the guest's room.

the thing is where will the cl sleep? on our queen size bed with me? err.. i don't think i want that. on zara's bed? hah, here is what zara said when we tried to 'negotiate' with her.
me : "zara let aunty sleep on your bed, then zara sleep with mummy on mummy's bed ok? at night, mummy can hug hug you to sleep (to 'motivate' her)"
zara : "zara's bed is zara's. aunty sleep downstairs on the sofa."
me : "there are lots of bugs downstairs at night."
zara : *pointing to the guest's room* "aunty sleep in the other room."
me : "daddy is sleeping there already... we changed the mattress, bed sheets on your bed, then zara let aunty sleep on your bed can or not?"
zara : "nooo! this is special bed *pointing to her bed*, only zara can sleep here. nobody can sleep" (and i was worried she won't settle in her own bed, when we moved her from her cot to the bed)
me : "then where will aunty sleep?"
zara : *pointed to the floor in our room* "sleep there then."

so, here is our plan, we'll be setting up another single bed in our room near the cot, and have the cl sleep there for that month.

have a look at the room now, it'll turn into a dorm when the other bed is moved in!

weekend parties





tasha (my eldest sis' daughter) celebrated her 1st birthday on saturday in cocca restaurant.

the thing is, zara never wanted to admit it's tasha's birthday. when we told her we're going for tasha's birthday party, she said, "no, it's zara's birthday!". when we asked her to pass the present to tasha, she said, "no, it's zara's one!". she didn't want to give tasha a hug, or wish her happy birthday. she didn't even want to join in the other children for a group photo.

hmm.. at this age, she is really not showing much interest to kids her age or younger than her. maybe it's the competition (for attention) she finds unsettling. she stuck to her older cousins all the time, joining in their games.


 playing with her cousins; tasha with bil and sis; tasha and her tinkerbell cake; zara attacking the sugar flower on the cake.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

on sunday, we were invited to my neighbor's daughter, cayley's full moon party. my neighbor's older daughter chloe (the same age as zara), is zara's play mate. they seem to have this love hate relationship. they want to play with each other, and yet, they can't share toys, and sometimes even have the occasional shouting bout. e.g. "it's mine!" "i take (took) first!" etc.

before we left for chloe's house, zara herself was telling me, "go chloe's house, no fighting yeah? no snatching toys yeah? must share share, yeah?"

daddy and i were busy stuffing ourselves silly with all the lovely home cooked food, while zara made herself at home playing with chloe's toys (she's been to chloe's house a few times, and knew where chloe's toys were kept). and true enough, to my relieve, she didn't do any snatching or fighting with chloe.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ i'm trying to get all my cravings fulfilled before i give birth and start the herbs, wine and ginger confinement diet (blech). the next item on my list, turkey!i'll be starting my leave next week, back at work on april 1st. lots to clear up before the long leave!
