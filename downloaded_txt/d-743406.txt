land acknowledgementthe folwell neighborhood sits on stolen land that was originally occupied by the dakota sioux, or their tribal name, oceti sakowin, and later the ojibwa tribe. indigenous peoples still have a large presence here in the twin cities next to the sacred mississippi river and we acknowledge their stewardship, presence, and contribution to making the neighborhood a vibrant community to live in.
