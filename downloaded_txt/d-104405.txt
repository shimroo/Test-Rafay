testimonials









i realized i always wanted to be in the kitchen with my mom, but not necessarily watch her cook, but rather have her move aside and let me do the cooking. that's really when i realized that this is what i want to do, this is what i want my life to be about. 
daron nazirganian - diplôme de pâtisserie 2015







from my first day at the school, i felt i was part of le cordon bleu family. from the chefs to the washer uppers and the office staff, everyone is very welcoming. it’s not always easy to do everything we’re supposed to, but we are definitely a team working together to prepare delicious food!
paula passos, grand diplôme alumna







i grew up without having any cooking skills at all so i decided to start learning the basic skills at le cordon bleu dusit culinary school. i was always interested in baking because it makes me happy. the joy of learning how to bake goes beyond just eating what you create - it is the creative process itself that brings me joy and happiness.
baking is a new and wonderful world that encompasses a whole range of skills and joys. even if you have a career in the business world or in the entertainment industry when you step into the world of culinary arts a new passion is born.
piyathida mittiraroch, diplôme de pâtisserie







i think there are no places like le cordon bleu in the sense that it allows me to understand the spirit and essence of french cuisine and pastry. it is le cordon bleu who provided me the foundation to become who i am today.
kenta nakano - diplôme de pâtisserie, tokyo 







my main goal was to learn pastry techniques. from the beginning, i liked the discipline, order and cleanliness that le cordon bleu master chefs always required when cooked. one of the added values that gave the alliance of le cordon bleu - anahuac was the teaching method based on the delicate individual work. study in le cordon bleu mexico was the key to start my business of desserts, mexican candy's, sugar decorations and cakes.
josé ignacio gonzález quinzaños







i think the course was definitely more intensive than i ever thought it would be, it’s an incredibly comprehensive course, and it’s fantastic that we even go into statistical analysis. it gives you so much, take in everything you can.
madison huang - project manager and development at cheval blanc
