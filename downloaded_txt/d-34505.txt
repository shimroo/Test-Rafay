                    why we’re here
            









                    we believe that every breath matters
            


whoever said, “we all breathe the same air” didn’t have to worry about being one of the 43,000 early deaths attributed to air pollution every year. wasn’t the 1 in every 5 people who will have a lung condition in their lifetime. or one of the 5.4 million people in the uk living with asthma.









                    respiratory care isn’t good enough
            


even before covid-19, nhs hospital admissions for lung conditions were rising three times faster than average admissions. people living with lung conditions are often overlooked and being left behind. their condition isn’t accurately diagnosed at an early stage – and even when they are diagnosed, they’re not given the care they need.









                    transforming lung health
            


our vision is for a world where everyone has healthy lungs. we are dedicated to helping create a world where good lung health and the ability to breathe freely are a basic right enjoyed by all. from research and campaigning to advice and support, as the nation’s lung charity we are on a mission to change the way that lung health is perceived.
















                    make every breath count with a gift in your will
            




over a third of our funding comes from gifts in wills – they’re absolutely vital to our work. leaving a gift in your will is simple and can help us bring together the greatest minds in lung health research to find new ways to diagnose, treat and cure lung conditions.
take the first step towards a breathing breakthrough by requesting your free guide to leaving a gift in your will.
