give your stock motorcycle a 
                    custom chopper or pro-street    
                      look, & improve the ride, without the hassles    
                      of cutting your bikes frame.
three choices of rake, lets    
                      you stretch your motorcycles wheelbase, 4" to    
                      12" over stock, and rake it out as much as 50â°
 
not just a "raked    
                      triple tree", but a complete "rake system" 
                    that maintains the  correct trail for good handling.

                      advanced kits are cnc machined from 1    
                      1/2" thick, aircraft grade, billet aluminum,    
                      then triple chrome    
                      plated.....quality is second to none.
no modifications or guess    
                      work involved....kit bolts on in a day & the    
                      correct geometry is built in......your motorcycle will
ride better than stock all the way to it's top speed,    
                      guaranteed!!
