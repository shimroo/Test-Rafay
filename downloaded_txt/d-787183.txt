parental testimony



“we have been praying about where we should send our kids to school since our daughter was born. christian school has been on my heart since the beginning. after researching and visiting mt zion, i felt so at home and actually excited about my kids starting school as opposed to anxious. we believe our children’s hearts need to be shepherded. we want them in a place where jesus is the center. we want them in a place where the adults are helping to evangelize to and disciple them. “
