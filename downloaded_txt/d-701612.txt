ashdown mummers play
















christmas 2023.
it is with great sadness that we have to announce that this christmas the world famous ashdown mummers will not be performing their traditional sussex mummers’ play in the pubs around the ashdown forest. after fifty years, several hundred performances and thousands of pounds raised for charity, we are taking a break. however, like all the old bands there is always the possibility of a ‘comeback tour’ next year. watch this space.
we would like to say a very, very big ‘thank you’ to all the people who have followed and supported us over the last 50 years including all the wonderful pubs who have made us welcome.
