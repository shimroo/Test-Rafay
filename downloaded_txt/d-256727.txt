pigeon forge’s premier dining, shopping, & entertainment destinationthe old mill has been the heart of this region before pigeon forge even had its name. since 1830, the mill has given the community more than a place to grind their corn; it has given them a gathering place to come together with their neighbors. today, we continue to build this community by welcoming visitors from all over to enjoy a from-scratch meal, shop for artisan goods, and experience the warmth of genuine southern hospitality. we invite you to experience the abundance of this smoky mountain haven and be swept away by the simple joys found every day in pigeon forge, tennessee. see y’all soon!

“mill made” speaks to our values of craftsmanship, quality, and community in so many ways. it touches on the handcrafted nature of everything we do here at the old mill. and it’s a great starting place for explaining to visitors why we love coming to work every day and are so proud of what we do. but this commitment to quality and craftsmanship didn’t just happen overnight. it’s who we’ve always been. it’s something you can trace back through our history – long before “farm to table” was trendy.
