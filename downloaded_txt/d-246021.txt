remembering randy weems

 




uso is extremely saddened to have lost randy weems on dec. 8, 2021.  he was devoted not only to his family but to all of his uso brothers and clients.  we will  miss his enthusiasm for life and his love of hunting.  his smile greeted everyone and everything he did and we will always hold that smile in our hearts.

 


 





we offer two types of hunts:

 





ranch hunts are more expensive but have guaranteed tags, no drawings are necessary. when you book a ranch hunt you are scheduling your hunt for a specific time and location. we set aside a permit with your name on it, which guarantees you a license.
these hunts are more expensive because of the private land access fees from the landowner. the advantage is that you can plan your hunt in advance; this makes it easy to fit your schedule.

 





public land draw hunts are a great value. since there is no landowner cost involved the hunts are usually about half the cost of a private land hunt.
to increase your odds of getting a public land draw hunt, let us apply you to several states for various species. before you know it you’ll be on your hunt of a lifetime.
public land draw hunts should always be applied for even if you have a ranch hunt booked. we will apply you for a draw hunt that occurs at about the same time. if you draw, we will resell your private land permit to someone else and move your deposit to the draw hunt. why not save some money and still get a quality hunt.
if you are not applying for a public land draw hunt, then you don’t understand our services. please, don’t hesitate to ask questions.

 





 apply, apply, apply. the biggest mistake a lot of people make is not applying enough applications to really have a good chance of getting drawn. apply for as many as you can and also apply for any species that you plan on hunting in the future. does it really matter if you take a trophy deer before an elk?
remember we front most tag fees.

testimonials

 this was indeed the hunt of a lifetime. i can't imagine a better experience with another outfitter.- chad mckinney, virginia 


my hunt was amazing and the number of elk i saw exceeded my wildest fantasy.- dan everett, rochester, ny 


the camp was comfortable and well maintained. the food was great. the guides worked very hard to put us on elk. not only did they work hard for their individual clients they also worked as a team after their original client scored.- paul hofmann, new jersey 


hunted the q-creek ranch and saw 2000 plus antelope, 2-300 elk and good numbers of mule deer, game rich and well managed.- jan korsgaard, denmark
