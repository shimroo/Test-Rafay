we’re fighting for a pollution-free texas.































since 1991, texas campaign for the environment has been fighting for safe, healthy communities all across the lone star state.



every day, we push back on corporate polluters and their financial and political allies who perpetrate environmental injustice in texas communities while fueling the climate crisis that threatens us all.even though most of our staff are based in and native to the places we organize, tce never speaks over those most directly impacted by pollution. instead, we’re dedicated to amplifying their voices and supporting their fight for – and their right to – clear air, clean water and safe, healthy communities.



















our focus



tce goes where the fight is to protect our environment.



over our history we’ve advocated across a broad range of issues, from curbside recycling and composting to electronic waste, single-use plastics bans and fracking restrictions. we’ve watchdogged polluting industries and championed policy reforms at the federal, state and local level to hold polluters accountable and protect the health and safety of texans. through it all, we’ve worked to aid communities in every part of the lone star state in their fight against polluting facilities. today, with the climate crisis as the defining environmental threat of our time – and with texas’ outsized role as the nation’s largest producer of fossil fuels – tce’s issue focus has shifted to pushing back on oil, gas, petrochemical and plastics polluters, and their political and financial enablers. as always, we’re focused on doing whatever it takes to support texans fighting for clean air and water in their own communities, and pushing back on the polluters and their pals who profit from climate destruction.

lamont taylorhillcrest residents association corpus christi, texas











“for too long, big polluters have been treating our coastal texas communities like their personal dumping ground. well, we’re not going to take it any more. with help from tce and many others, we’re organizing and pushing back hard.”
diane wilsonsan antonio bay waterkeeper seadrift, texas











“all along the gulf coast, big polluters are racing to build massive new facilities to export oil and gas. to protect our communities’ quality of life, we have to fight. having tce in our corner means we can do that more effectively.”
sue pagebetter brazoriasurfside, texas











“polluting industry is the new instrument of tribal genocide. they are trying to erase us, but it’s not going to happen. the people and the land will have the final say. tce is our ally, and an ally of anyone under attack by polluters.”
juan manciascarrizo comecrudo tribe of texasfloresville, texas











“working people get the shaft from corporate polluters. our lives and livelihoods are put on the line so billionaire ceos can line their pockets. it can’t continue like this.  we’re working with tce and others to create a different future.”
james hiattbetter bayoulake charles, louisiana











"i've been working closely with impacted communities on both sides of the atlantic to help stop climate-wrecking, human-rights-violating fracked gas trading. tce has worked hard to build community trust, and has been a great collaborator.”
