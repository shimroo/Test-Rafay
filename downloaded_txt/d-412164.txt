history of the wilson company
after relocating from atlanta in 1979, as principal of the landmark group, jack wilson founded the wilson company in 1980. 
wilson distinguished himself from the myriad of developers in tampa bay as a small developer capable of large projects. the risks were high, but his intuitive timing was right. his bottom line focused first on quality and reputation, followed by profit. a strong foundation of commitment gave rise to a company with an impressive list of developments around tampa bay, such as carillon corporate office park, fountain square, chase plaza, anchor plaza, cypress center and legends field - spring training headquarters of the new york yankees. the wilson company enjoyed high visibility in the westshore business area, where wilson was co-founder of the westshore alliance and served as its first president. 
wilsonâs reputation of integrity and track record of high standards was especially evident in the development and building of bayport plaza and the grand hyatt tampa bay, situated on the natural mangrove studded shoreline and wetlands of the fish creek marsh on old tampa bay. of special significance to wilson was the recognition his company received for the environmental work related to this signature project. he proved that not only can a developer create a product with functionality, it can be done while protecting the environment. the corporate award for concern for floridaâs natural resources, presented for the first time in history to a developer by the florida audubon society is a source of great pride to the wilson company as is the recognition for outstanding contributions to the protection, wise use and management of floridaâs natural resources by the florida wildlife federation. by the late eighties, the wilson company was responsible for development of more than 2.2 million square feet of commercial office space. the company then turned its attention to affordable housing, becoming a major participant in the federal housing tax credit program. as a member of the board of directors of 1000 friends of florida, wilson was an integral part of establishing florida as a national leader in affordable housing, as the company built and manages over 9200 affordable housing units throughout the state. 
in the nineties, wilson and company focused on the revitalization of downtown tampa. they relocated the company headquarters from the westshore business area to the franklin exchange building, a historical building originally earmarked for demolition until the wilson company purchased and renovated it. a walk through the companyâs office illustrates that wilsonâs public service and charitable responsibilities were paramount to his success, evidenced by the many awards he received. wilsonâs community activities were extensive. as chairman of the tampa bay task force, he led the effort to bring the super bowl to tampa. he served, at various times, in capacity of chairman, member of the board of directors, advisory council member and trustee with numerous civic organizations and educational institutions. wilson provided strong business sense with an unassuming style to organizations such as the florida and tampa chambers of commerce, florida council of 100, the florida department of commerce, naiop & the board of directors of the tampa downtown partnership, hillsborough convention and visitors bureau and floridians for better transportation. he served on advisory councils for three governors of florida and was the recipient of the florida enterprise medal from the merchants association in 2001. the florida council on economic education recognized jack wilson for his significant contributions by inducting him into the tampa bay business hall of fame in 2001. 
in december 2005, jack wilson passed away, leaving behind a solid company of dedicated professionals who continue his legacy and vision under the guidance of carolyn wilson, president of the wilson company. the companyâs latest project is a 226-unit town home community in tampa. wexford townhomes is the wilson companyâs debut into town home development.
