					client testimonials:





there 
			are a lot of public relations people in the world these days, but 
			karen thomas, president of thomas public relations in east 
			northport, stands above the rest. -the observer.
 


"since i 
			began using karen and her pr firm to help promote my two websites, 
			traffic has grown steadily and significantly. now we are able to 
			support paid ads. i appreciate the steady and reliable manner that 
			she has provided input and assistance over the months we have worked 
			together. thanks very much karen," - frank tobe, 
			therobotreport.com.


 


"if 
			you are looking for results you need to contact karen, we were 
			constantly amazed by the publications who interviewed and published 
			articles about unibind," rusty redecker, vp-sales american 
			media & specialty, american hole n one - previously vice president, 
			photo, peleman (unibind).


 


-"i have relied on the 
			effectiveness, thoroughness, and professionalism of thomas pr for 
			over ten years. if you need to launch a pr campaign, the first 
			person and firm i would call would be karen thomas at thomas pr," 
			said jack peterson, president, kidz gear and previously vp 
			sales & marketing, lexar media. 


 
- she's aggressive. she brings results. that's 
					what it's all about," said
                      chris sluka, olympus america. 

 
-karen more than quadrupled our media 
					presence in a very short period of time - she really 
					delivers the goods, said 
					jeff mandell, vp, worldwide marketing, concord 
					camera corp.

 

-karen thomas knows. 
					she knows the industry, the insiders, the press and the 
					issues  and delivers great exposure on message," 
					said 
					eric zarakov, vp marketing communications, foveon 
					inc. 







 

-karen, well, she is amazing. i have never seen or heard 
			of another pr professional who can deliver what karen did for my 
			efforts at olympus. yes, we hired her at one of my subsequent 
			postions as well. we went from not in the market to #1 in market 
			share partly though her efforts. i would recommend her to any 
			company in her area of expertise, said
                      dave veilleux, former director, digital products, 
			olympus america
 

-karen's firm was recommended by 
			j. paul grayson (then chairman of micrografx and now chairman of 
			alibre) and gave my company, axxis software, access to editors and 
			other influential individuals at the highest levels within the 
			software industry. i believe that karen's guidance was exceptionally 
			influential in our success and our ultimate acquisition by rupert 
			murdoch's news corp," - 
steve buerkele, formerly president, axxis software.
 


-"not only does karen get 
					the big picture, she takes care of all details: on our 
					coast-to-coast press tour, every single appointment went as 
					planned and we got great results," said larry 
					shiller, president shillermath and former president of the 
					bureau of electronic publishing.
