this is a seasonal ritual at our house. i hear the mice move in with the cool weather and i get out the mousetraps. a tiny bit of peanut butter in the bait cup and they are caught. if i don't get all of them with the trap the rest seem to move on to safer pastures somewhere else after enough of their buddies have been killed.”


i would like to thank your company for making the "perfect" mouse trap. i have tried at least 20 other trap brands and they have all had various degrees of success, but none work as well as yours. my daughter bought me six (6) of your mouse traps for my birthday and after setting all of these traps around two of our properties, i was amazed at the response. best traps i have found on the market.”- duane schenck


within thirty minutes or less of placing the snap-e® mousetrap, i had a dead mouse. i used some candy a mouse had eaten into as bait. i am ordering six more. these traps work! i have had about twenty of the old wooden ones sitting out around the house for three week and caught nothing!”- anne smith


i'm catching mice every night in my greenhouse with these snap-e® mousetraps. they are so easy to set that i don't even flinch any more as i reset them - they never snap while they are being set. i've tried lots of different brands of mousetraps and these are far superior to the rest.”- mark parsons


i love being able to catch multiple mice with one setup. this way i can let it sit for a couple days and catch multiples. the ketch-all® multiple catch mousetrap is the best mousetrap i've found. i'll be buying several more.”- david benn


you guys are great! just a note to say 'thank you' for the 2 metal lid replacements for our mousetraps. a great benefit was when i saw 'proudly' made in america. that is what america is made of and we need to get back on track with showing the world! great products, made by great people who back up what they produce! look out mice... 2 traps back in service. thank you!”- janine hatt


i have set thousands of these traps while running thoroughspect and have never found a better trap ever. the traps are exactly what a mousetrap should be in that they are fast-reacting, easy to set and release. in addition, they have a visible yellow bar that can be seen in crawl spaces and attics to see if they have been triggered. - brian m. sweig
