talking with the early birds 



temporary operating position in the shack


well i have a ways to go before the station is back in anything that resembles a reasonable state of order.  i do have a start though and am back on the air.  really enjoying operating the hf bands again and have discovered a number of nets that i have been checking into.  this morning i checked in for the first time with the "early bird trans continental net".



seems like a nice group of guys and gals and i intend to check in as often as i can.  as the name implies though you have to be one of those early morning people to meet up with them and i have not traditionally been a "morning person".  i was experiencing some pain last night which had me up and down quite a bit and found me here in the radio room at 04:00.  i intend to dial around the bands and see who else is on at this time of the day before laying back down and seeing if i can get a little additional sleep.  if you have an hf station please join in on the fun and make some new friends across the country and around the world.  73's and i hope to meet you on the air sometime.

carrying my manuals with me 

i recently bought a kindle k3 from amazon after debating with myself for a long time about spending the money on one.  the tipping point came when i ordered my last two hard cover books from amazon and the day they arrived i found two additional ones that i wanted.  the book shelves in my living room are bulging at the seams and i was going to have to start thinking about occupying another wall.  this pleased my wife about as much as my wanting to put a 50' flag pole in the front yard to string antennas from.so i looked at the kindle which has a six inch diagonal screen, is not as thick as a number 2 pencil and will hold over 3000 books.  now i won't go into a complete review of the kindle here but i will say that so far i love it.  i wasn't sure i would like reading on the device especially since i like the feel of a new book in my hands.  again, that is another story.after i had my kindle set up and had purchased a few books from the kindle store i started exploring other aspects of this little gem.  the first thing to catch my eye was that it would display documents in pdf format.  in addition you are given an email address when you purchase your kindle to which you can email files that they will then transfer to your device via wifi or what they call "whisper net" which is just a 3g connection by way of the cellular network.  i haven't tried it yet but you can also link with usb to kindle and load pdf files that way. needless to say all of my ham gear manuals from icom and yaesu are available in pdf format.  there is a trend now days to supply manuals only in digital form leaving it to the end user to decide if he or she needs a "dead tree" version.  so now when i'm mobile if i want to look up some obscure function on my ft-7800-r dual band mobile i just need to take out my kindle and rtfm.  yet another small way that computers are wedging their way into the shack.labels: kindle manuals pdf portable use

here is a small low power consumption computer that i ran across that looks like it would make a great linux system for the shack.  for that matter it would be nice for anywhere that you want a computer on that runs 24/7 and don't want to take up a lot of space.  it is a little pricey when compared to some of the bare bones boxes that you can get from tiger direct or newegg in conventional pc form factor.  i see a trend in laptop computers where first rs-232 ports disappeared from them and now it looks like optical drives will be the next item to fall from the hardware platform in an every increasing drive to minimal size and weight.  that trend is also evident in these types of systems also.you can get a system with a faster processor and a built in optical drive for equal or slightly less money although it does come in "kit" form any you have to mount the components.  it is just a screw driver job that requires a little time.at one time i would have given a lot for a fan less system like this being overly sensitive to the noise from working in server rooms for extended periods.  the technology has improved in power supplies and have become tolerable for me though.so if you have been looking for a dedicated computer for the shack or if you would like a small form factor system to use in your office, den or living room this could be the ticket.  check out evo technologies and their products.

north hills amateur radio club to have new meeting place 

i received this email from the north hills amateur radio club and wish to make the information available to as wide an audience as possible.  the nharc has a very active membership and a long history of service to the community and the amateur radio hobby.  everyone is welcome to attend meetings and you are encouraged to bring a friend.  if you have an interest in radio and electronics you will find a friendly group of kindred spirits there.dear north hills club members,a year ago all of you came to a meeting where i announced the club would be moving.  while this christ lutheran church is better than the northland library, it was still not good for our growth. at this time, i announce to the members of north hills arc we have found a permanent home.  one where we can hold all club events including jota, elmer nights and club meetings.  most of all, the management of the new location is receptive to helping us grow in the future by providing us the possibility of a radio room.  we will also be permitted to hold the hamfest there.the reason for the change is cost, convenience and growth.  we will meet for our first meeting at parkwood church on mount royal blvd august 10th at 7pm.  at that time, we will talk about the possibilities we have for making north hills radio club better than we already have done.on behalf of the board i thank you for your continued support with north hills and look for many great club events at parkwood.parkwood united presbyterian church4289 mt. royal blvd.allison park pa 15101jim heiles kb3iyspresidentnorth hills arc

nharc's 147.09 repeater off the air 

the north hills amateur radio club's 147.090 repeater is out of service for repairs.  if you are in the pittsburgh area please use the sister repeater on 146.880.  it is hopped that the 09 machine will be back on the air within a week.  all of the north hills club repeaters have exceptional "uptime" service records so this is an unusual situation partially because of the holiday this week.  i will post when the machine is back on line.  the weekly club net normally held on 147.09 at 08:30 pm local time will be moved to the 88 machine this evening.labels: nharc repeaters 147.09 146.88 w3exw

first responders to end radio market monopolies 

the 88 cities of los angeles county have banded together to end a long-standing business model that forces them to upgrade first responder radio systems at the whim of vendors.the practice of selling closed-architecture systems has favored a small group of public safety radio manufacturers for decades, said former city of los angeles assistant police chief michael bostic, who now works for raytheon as its director of public safety solutions.a joint powers agreement signed by the cities will create the los angeles regional interoperability communications system, which is designed to bring an open architecture system — commonly used in the commercial mobile phone market — to police departments.to read the entire story follow this link.

d-star expands in pittsburgh 

it is now public knowledge that the north hills amateur radio club will be purchasing equipment at this years dayton hamvention to put a second d-star repeater on.  this one will be a vhf high band repeater on the 146.22/146.82 pair which has languished unused in pittsburgh for a very long time now.  those who have been around the pittsburgh two meter scene for a while will remember when the 82 machine was located on the westinghouse research & development center in church hill and had very wide coverage in the area.  old timers quiz, anyone remember what the call sign of the 82 repeater was when located there?  bonus points if you remember what it was changed to when the fcc stopped issuing special call signs for repeaters.as i have said in previous postings i would like d-star a lot more if did not use a proprietary codex for the digital encoding and decoding of the voice portion of the transmissions.  i would also like to see much faster data rates on the vhf and uhf frequencies.  still even at the slow data rates d-star becomes a real tool for use in emergency situations where hams are asked to provide all of the communications or supplant public safety radio systems that have become overloaded because of the circumstances.the new repeater will be co-located with the existing uhf repeater in the oakland section of the city at the wqed transmitter site.  this will go a long way toward making d-star popular among local hams.  i know i have herd more than one person on the air saying that d-star is a big investment in equipment when you consider that there are very few repeaters around and thus not many other hams to chat with.  hopefully that is going to change now.  as soon as i have more information i will post it here on the blog.  until then those that are making the journey this year have a great time at dayton. labels: repeater d-star north hills amateur radio club
