this is a puzzle game in which players navigate a series of traps, puzzles, and enemies to collect stars scattered throughout the colorful levels. players have the ability to summon different objects by writing/typing in the word (e.g., bike, spaceship, lion) and watching it come to life. if multiple words are entered in a sequence, different whimsical scenarios can be triggered: a bicycle can be used to jump over a baby; a bulldozer can clear away a shark; and cabbage can be fed to dinosaurs. players can elect to summon "cartoony" versions of bats, bombs, guns, and flamethrowers. these types of items can be used to destroy objects or even other summoned items (e.g., a club can be used to hit an animal; steak can be attached to a baby to attract lions; rockets can be lobbed at a man). these triggered animations are minimally depicted and are usually accompanied by popping, musical sound effects; bright, star-shaped flashes; or small puffs of smoke. if players wish to, they may type in the word vomit, which causes a beige-colored lump to appear on the screen.
