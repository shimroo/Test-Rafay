aic statement on president trump’s election: a new opportunity for us-iran relations



dec 2, 2024




as president donald trump is poised to take office for a second time, many are predicting a difficult and turbulent future for us-iran relations. while it is true that trump's rhetoric has been confrontational at times, we believe this moment presents a unique opportunity to improve relations between the two nations.1. trump’s deal-making approachat his core, president trump is a dealmaker. his approach to foreign policy has been driven by the desire to secure favorable agreements, often by challenging the status quo and pushing for new terms that benefit the united states. this pragmatism, which focuses on the bottom line, could open the door for a redefined relationship with iran. in the past, negotiations with iran have often been bogged down by entrenched positions. trump's business-oriented mindset could provide the flexibility needed to craft new deals that address mutual interests—whether they be in trade, security, or regional stability.

iran chat: interview with jim lobe about the likelihood of war with iran



feb 15, 2019




after a long break, iran chat is back and we felt this year’s series should begin with a deep dive into the current state of us-iran relations, focusing on the very real and growing possibility of war with iran.  to help sort through all the recent news and issues concerning us-iran relations, we spoke with journalist jim lobe.  he served as chief of the washington dc bureau of inter press service from 1980 to 1985 and again from 1989 to 2016.  currently he is an associate fellow at the institute for policy studies where he directs lobelog, an award-winning web blog focused on foreign policy, featuring posts by expert contributors on a variety of global issues, with an emphasis on us policy towards the middle east.  recently, he co-wrote an article for lobelog entitled war against iran becoming ever more likely.  we discuss his rationale for this assessment during our conversation.  listen here or on itunes:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/americaniranians-podcast/id1152417924

women’s rights movements: vanguard for social change in iran, iraq, and kurdistan



dec 3, 2024




by samuel howell, aic research associatein 2022, the death of jina (mahsa) amini in tehran created a chain reaction of social unrest that culminated in months of widespread protests in iran. these protests championed a number of causes, including improved economic conditions, the removal of certain government leaders, and, above all, equality and justice for women. results of these demands have been mixed: while they have inspired many women to act in solidarity and refuse to obey the laws that control their personal lives, no official government policies have changed.  with this in mind, it is a good time now to reflect, not just on the most recent protests that made news in the west, but on a much broader history of the fight for women’s rights in iran, neighboring iraq, and the regions of kurdish territory within their borders. while these places have been at odds with each other for much of recent history, the story of their efforts regarding women’s rights share similar foundations and headwinds within the broader struggle for social change. this article will focus on recent women's rights developments within iran, iraq, and kurdistan, what their struggles mean for the progress of the region, and the international implications of these events.

myth vs. fact: censorship in iran



jan 30, 2025




updated 2025 by research associate nika mobedprevious versions published in 2017 and 2021 by research associates ariane gottlieb and connor bulgrin respectivelymyth: the iranian government exercises strict control over the press and tightly censors the internet and media, making communication with the outside world virtually nonexistent. this censorship makes it impossible for iranians to publicly criticize the government or to obtain international news and perspectives on current events.fact: in reality, this is only a partial understanding of access to information in iran. while harsh policies and tactics used against journalists in the country cannot be overstated, iranians have found many ways to circumvent state censorship, such as bypassing the internet firewall or accessing international channels via illegal satellite dishes. a full understanding of media and censorship in iran requires distinguishing government laws from the practices of average iranians.
