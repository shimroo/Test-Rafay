welcome to city of walnut grove
                        city of walnut grove… a great place to live!
						
in the city of walnut grove, we are defined less by boundaries on a map than by the sense of shared values our residents hold dear. small town values, guided growth, preservation of historical, cultural, and natural heritage are just a few of the core principles that makes the city of walnut grove a wonderful place to call home. 
walnut grove is located in the southwest corner of redwood county, minnesota. we are situated in a thriving agriculture area with plenty of recreational opportunities with many lakes, parks, golf courses, bike trails, camping, and museums.
walnut grove is known nationwide today as the childhood home of laura ingalls wilder and visitors can learn all about this famous author and her history here in walnut grove.
 







conserve water
it's our most precious natural resource.  every drop counts...





shop local
whether it is a local farmer's market or main street shops, shopping local sustains our community and supports local merchants.  a win-win for all!
