i have been working with gorman enterprises for over 25 years and they have always come through for me. in the early years i bought over 100 vehicles from gorman from school buses to commercial equipment. gorman's maintenance department has always handled my maintenance including painting motor coaches to fixing issues with my limousine buses. over the last 13 years, i have over 15 dot inspections per year and have never failed one or had any issues following gorman's maintenance schedule.

i have been using gorman enterprises for over 20 years and have always been completely satisfied. we have been purchasing parts, sending our vehicles for preventative maintenance and repairs, and also utilizing them for collision repairs. their staff is knowledgeable, easy to work with, and always do exactly what we ask of them. i highly recommend gorman enterprises.
