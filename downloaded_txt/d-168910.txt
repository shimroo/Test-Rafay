how much is a dui in colorado? call our lawyers for a free consult! 
      we understand that you're probably feeling confused, angry, or somewhat fearful about what's happened to you. the process of being arrested, taken to jail, fingerprinted, and photographed was probably very dehumanizing to you. we sincerely sympathize with that.

                                to be honest with you--you're faced with a charge which can have serious
                           outcomes. (please see what your dui may cost. under the new felony law, the stakes are now much higher if you have three prior lifetime convictions any where in the us.) we don't want to scare you, but let us give you a glimpse of what's in store for you. if your case goes the wrong way you could lose your license, your insurance could go up, you could be fined, it could hurt you when you apply for a job, and you could even go to jail. still uncertain of what to do about your denver dui? read this.
