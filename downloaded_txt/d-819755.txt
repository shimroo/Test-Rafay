department of religious studies








department of religious studies the department of religious studies offers richmond students the opportunity to study a broad range of religions from an academic perspective.
our faculty and staff reject racial bias, hate speech, religious intolerance, and all other expressions of bigotry. the academic study of religion promotes a community founded on the values of inclusivity, equity, and diversity.  religious studies courses help students understand the complex and sometimes volatile relations of difference, and we model substantive intellectual responses to it.  major & minorcourses

in and outside the whale: reading jonah as/and literature
dr. l. juliana claassens
the myriad ways in which the book of jonah has found expression in art, music, and literature indicates just how deeply ingrained jonah has become in the western consciousness. this lecture proposes that the book of jonah can be read as literature as the narrative representation of traumatic experience in the form of literary symbols served as a way for the original readers to work through their trauma. future interpretative communities connected to jonah as well in terms of a shared experience of trauma as contemporary authors, artists, and poets sought to understand their situation within the contours of the words and images found in jonah. these interpretations that highlight jonah and literature help us connect with experiences of suffering across time and space, even while recognizing that each traumatic experience is unique to a particular community.
 
this talk will take place on wednesday, november 20th at 12:00 pm in the brown alley room, weinstein hall.
