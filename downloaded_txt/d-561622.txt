back in print! daemon is proud to announce that we have created a new batch of this awesome classic record with a plastic-free package.  this project was the result of an all-star gathering of over 75 georgia musicians to recreate the rock opera jesus christ superstar.
all profits from the record still goes to organizations working to end gun violence.
