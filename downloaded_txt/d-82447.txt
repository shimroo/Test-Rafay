helping womxnmost in need
an african feminist legal centre that advances womxn’s rights and equality through strategic litigation, advocacy and education and training.



more about us





















we aim to develop feminist jurisprudence that recognises and advances womxn’s rights. 







while south africa has a sound constitution in place, the majority of black womxn have not experienced a real improvement in their everyday lives especially in the rural areas. levels of gender based violence are extremely high, womxn are left impoverished and vulnerable on the dissolution of their relationships (losing access to assets acquired during the relationship), and many womxn do not have basic access to land or shelter. discrimination in the workplace is an everyday occurrence with womxn employed (if at all) in the most vulnerable sectors of our economy. womxn are more likely to be infected by and severely affected by the hiv aids pandemic and struggle to obtain access to basic health care. gains made in the area of reproductive rights are constantly under challenge.
exercising their constitutional rights is a major obstacle for womxn. the high cost of taking cases to court puts it out of reach of the womxn who are the most in need of legal protection. the women’s legal centre is trying to change that, taking on test court cases on behalf of womxn free of charge, to challenge established principles and overturn discriminatory laws.
in 1999, in cape town, a small group of womxn lawyers founded a non-profit independently funded legal centre that would focus exclusively on womxn’s rights. since then women’s legal centre has established a solid reputation in south africa and internationally for its advancement of womxn’s rights, and several precedents have been set which will have a profound impact on many womxn’s lives.
