day 4: let's mark this day! ✨2️⃣5️⃣✨





friends,
hot off the press! now in livejournal you can get your accounts verified and receive a checkmark beside the journal or community name.



lj verification checkmark


the verification checkmark means that the account is maintained officially on behalf of a famous person or an organization — it's neither a fan page nor a hoax.
the checkmark doesn't imply any additional privileges or rewards for the author.

day 3: a pioneer or a keeper? ✨2️⃣5️⃣✨





so, our beloved lj is turning 25 – quite a serious date! they say a human personality is finally formed at this age. and what about lj? our personality is… you, dear users. we’re ready to share some more news about you and us – enjoy the reading!
we’ve found out that 95% of lj bloggers are trying the platform’s new features – functions, designs, services – while 5% stay loyal to the original functionality. we value both parties! so in honor of the platform’s 25th anniversary, we’ve prepared two new achievements — keeper of traditions and pioneer of changes.

coming soon! lj is 25





folks, 
april the 15th is coming! what makes this spring date so special? well…
on april 15th, 1999, 19-year-old student brad fitzpatrick opened a new page in history – he registered the livejournal.com domain. and the most attentive will notice that almost 25 years have passed since then!
for the lj anniversary, we’ve prepared a holiday festival – lj 25! we'll be sharing festival activities and news with you for the whole next week!
don’t miss it. see you on april the 15th!



lj is soon 25!


with love ❤️, 
lj team

april festival achievements ❤️





folks,
it's april — so, lj is about to celebrate its 25th anniversary! this time we want to organize something special — not a mere birthday party, but a real festival with raffles, gifts, and unique jubilee memorabilia.
there will be a ton of activities in april. here comes the first one we'd like to tell you about — lj birthday festival achievements!
getting some of them will be a piece of cake, and others will require imagination. go for it! 😉



achievements are your rewards for your active lj life (published entries, comments, likes, etc.)
