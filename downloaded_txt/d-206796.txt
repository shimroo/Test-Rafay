welcome to biological systems engineering!




as the world faces steadily rising temperatures and expanding populations, biological systems engineers are at the forefront of transforming the way we look at using our natural resources. we are dedicated to educating students to protect natural resources as they study new methods in such fields as agriculture, food production, and machinery engineering.
our research and extension programs are designed to engage communities across wisconsin per the wisconsin idea. the vibrant group of students and faculty at bse work to unlock infinite possibilities that will revolutionize a broad range of areas from forest management to energy production.
