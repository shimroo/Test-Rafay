maradonian church.





iglesia maradoniana (maradonian church) was created by fans of the retired argentine football player diego maradona, who they believe to be the best player of all time. they now reportedly count over 100,000 members from more than 60 countries around the world.supporters of the maradonian church count the years since maradona's birth in 1960. it is popular among the followers of this religion to use the neo-tetragrammaton d10s as one of the names of maradona: d10s is a portmanteau word which fuses 10, maradona's shirt number, and dios, the spanish word for god.(via son cosas mías!)maradonian church

the church of the latter-day dude.





the slowest-growing religion in the world is dudeism. an ancient philosophy that preaches non-preachiness, practices as little as possible, and above all, uh...lost my train of thought there. anyway, if you'd like to find peace on earth and goodwill, man, the church of the latter-day dude will help you get started. right after a little nap.(via eclecticity)the church of the latter-day dude
