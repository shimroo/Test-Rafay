                        lower manhattan occupies a unique place in our history.
                     

it's where:
washington gave his first inaugural 
address.
the u.s. congress first met. 

                           alexander hamilton founded the bank of new york, the nation's first bank.
                        
hamilton, jefferson and madison worked and 
lived.
