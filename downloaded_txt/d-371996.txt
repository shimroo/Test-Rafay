for over 15 years, honeycomb internet services has provided fully customized hosting solutions for fortune 500 companies, local small businesses, and everyone in between. and now thereâs you.
when we say "100% uptime," thatâs a guarantee. we don't believe anyone should ever have their link to the outside world cut off as a result of something that could have been prevented.
when you hire us, you really do hire "us." weâre here at all hours to support you at launch and every point afterward, including one-on-one guidance on building out your infrastructure.
security at honeycomb isn't just a "set it and forget it" solution. we know it takes a combination of software, hardware, and good old-fashioned manpower to safeguard your site.
