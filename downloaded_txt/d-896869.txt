sunnybrook trout club is truly one of nature`s flagship sites. it is a wildlife conservancy where members can apply their fly fishing skills in settings that rival the challenges of wild trout streams.

the club is situated on 70 acres of woodlands just south of sandusky, ohio. two miles of ohio`s legendary cold creek stream meander through its picturesque meadows. the stream surges directly from deep beneath the ground at a place five miles upstream from sunnybrook called the `blue hole, a large cavernous spring which, mysteriously, seems to have no bottom. trout were first stocked in the clear waters of cold creek in 1873 and have thrived ever since. today a healthy population of rainbow, brook, and brown trout populate this stream.
