listening
caap students will employ interpretive skills to answer multiple-choice questions pertaining to pre-recorded audio samples of native target-language speakers, which contain key theme vocabulary.





reading
as a measure of interpretive text media comprehension, students are asked to read excerpts from primary target-language sources and respond to the accompanying multiple-choice questions.





writing
students are asked to prepare and author a presentational composition discussing a subject central to the chosen caap theme.





speaking
to assess linguistic fluency and proficiency, students complete 3-minute presentational audio recordings of their target-language responses to prompts related to the chosen caap theme.





language
the caap program offers exams in five target language formats: chinese, french, german, spanish, and spanish version 2 for native spanish speaking students.

what is caap?

collaborative

collaborative refers to the collective effort of high school and college instructors to create a core curriculum and a
common set of instructional objectives for students at each stage of a four-level language program.



articulation

articulation ensures that students move smoothly through a course of study, from one level to the next. it addresses the problems that students encounter when they make transitions between high school courses and the college classroom.



assessment

assessment measures give students an indication of their potential university course placement. listening, speaking, reading, and writing tests provide feedback to high school students and their teachers about general performance levels.



project

the project was initiated in 1992 by the ohio state university, columbus state community college, and columbus public schools, with a grant from the fund for the improvement of post-secondary education. in 1994, caap added suburban schools in the greater columbus area.
