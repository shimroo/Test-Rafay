root crop washersback in the 1980s, farmer dick needed a way to wash large amounts of root crops faster and with less labor and designed his own root crop washer. now 30 years in production at grindstone, our washers have helped hundreds of farms across the usa, from maine to alaska, and even internationally make quick work of washing root crops for market. as a testament to the efficiency and utility of this equipment, national us farm bureau designated grindstone’s crop washer as one of 2010’s “top 10 best farm innovations in the nation”.
