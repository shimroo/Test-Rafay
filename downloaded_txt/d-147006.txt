why should you be thread rolling? see our video below! 
do you want to thread roll 12 parts in the same time that it takes to do one single point threading? see our video where 12 threads are completely rolled in the same time it takes to make one pass with a single point tool. that is a 90% reduction in cycle time! a rolled thread is more precise and consistent than a cut thread, eliminating the need to closely monitor thread making production.
see the video....
