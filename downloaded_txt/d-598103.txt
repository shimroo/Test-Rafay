and, speaking of new york...



this showed up on streetsblogsf. it originates with nycbike maps. the video shows how new york is on the forefront of cutting-edge street design with its separated bike lanes, car-free pedestrian walk ways and plazas. if we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!

san francisco bike culture matures as bike plan is adopted



after nearly three years of stalemate due to a court injunction, the san francisco bicycle plan has its environmental impact report unanimously certified by the planning department and is adopted by the municipal transportation agency.the san francisco bicycle coalition turned out over two hundred supporters for the mta meeting to speak in favor of the plan. friends of bikescape, nancy botkin and mike smith joined me and my partner karen franklin to discuss how the meeting went and how bike advocacy has changed over the last decade. interspersed in this informal discussion are audio clips from the meeting.download the mp3 orsubscribe to bikescape in itunesphoto from the sfbc flickr pool by rhonda winter

san francisco bike plan almost back on track



on june 26, 2009, the sfmta board unanimously voted to adopt the long delayed bike plan and gave the green light to 45 new bike lanes.  this was the result of three years of intense sf bicycle coalition advocacy culminating with a very impressive show of grassroots support at the mta meeting where over to hundred supporters showed up to speak.the next step is to bring this to court and have the tree year long injunction lifted so that work can begin on doubling the number of bike lanes in the city.congratulations all around! now that we're back on track let's start to think about what's next!

bikescape's fifth bike to work day and a rally for transit



another year goes by and another bigger and better bike to work day beats expectations. we visit the san francisco city college campus and chat with gus from the bikery. then we bike across town to hand out goodies at the chinatown energizer station where we meet san francisco's only car-free supervisor, board president david chiu.but its not all about bikes! it seems that across the nation, just when transit use is unprecedentedly high, fares are going up and service is getting cut. we go to protest sf's  transit budget and meet with supervisor john avalos as we walk to confront mta director nat ford.also, we've got lots of news about upcoming events such as sunday streets in the mission. i dropped in som audio from the last sunday streets event where we encountered the piano bike.download the mp3 orsubscribe to bikescape in itunesphoto by greg z

bike bloggers meet-up in sacramento



recently i was in sacramento where coincidentally the amgen  tour of california was holding its opening time trial. i stopped into the r-16 bar to have a few beers with some of my favorite bloggers. it was noisy. there was beer.still, i think the conversations i had with paul dorn from the bike commute tips blog, (right) fritz from cycleicious, and david bernstein, voice of the fredcast (left) are worth a listen. (that's your host with the headphones!)download the mp3 orsubscribe to bikescape in itunesphoto on left by andrew conway. the one on the right by fritz
