the web that many connected to years ago is not what new users will find today. what was once a rich selection of blogs and websites has been compressed under the powerful weight of a few dominant platforms. this concentration of power creates a new set of gatekeepers, allowing a handful of platforms to control which ideas and opinions are seen and shared.
