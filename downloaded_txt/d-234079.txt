we’ve retired!
we thank our previous customers for your patronage. if you need your ring sized, replaced, or otherwise serviced, fill out our prior customer form. we do not resize or do other work on rings we didn’t make.
chris made his first titanium wedding ring in 1991, his first precious metal wedding ring in 1975, and his very first jewelry out of copper and brass while a junior in high school in 1966-67. we wish him well in his retirement!
in 2021 we will create instructional videos on titanium ring making and resizing, and titanium anodizing techniques, produced by our sister company, multi-etch llc. check back here for links to those videos.
