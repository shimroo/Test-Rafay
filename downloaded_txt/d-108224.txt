grandpa schober's music lives on







this webpage will serve as a tribute to a man who loved to share his gifts! he had many but one of his greatest god-given talents was the gift of music. while never taking the first music lesson, he began his musical inspiration when as a young boy he learned to play an accordion. barefoot but inspired, he endured a lifetime of responsibility and challenges but still managed to share his gifts. we are pleased to be able to bring his joy of music to you through this new web page.
we hope you will enjoy these pages of music as much as we have enjoyed bringing them to you.
please be patient as we work to transfer all the files from grandpa schober's previous web page to this one. thanks to andy bakke for his diligence in converting these files for our family.
