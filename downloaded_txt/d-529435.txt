world class golf

set in a glorious 550 acre country estate on scotland’s legendary golf coast, archerfield is both a golfer’s paradise and also a distinctly different kind of club.
while the landscape is nothing short of spectacular, with two contrasting world-class courses, you’ll find a warm and relaxed feel from the moment you arrive. a state-of-the-art performance centre offers a hi-tech approach and our clubhouse is a haven of understated style and welcoming hospitality for our members and their guests. and all just 20 miles from the capital city of edinburgh.
