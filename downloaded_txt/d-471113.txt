monadnock regionin 1948, walter r. peterson founded the petersons real estate with one guiding principle in mind…to provide the finest real estate service to individuals who were living or wanted to live in this very special region of new hampshire, comprised of the villages surrounding peterborough in the shadow of mt. monadnock.
from that time forward, it has been the aim of the three succeeding generations of the peterson family to satisfy the individual needs of our clients and customers, one at a time, with personal service. we stand behind each and every transaction, be it the thrill of helping a buyer find a first home or the satisfaction of finding a new owner for a long-cherished family homestead.
our focus has never been to be the biggest – simply the best. for seventy years, our efforts have resulted in making us the top firm in the towns we serve, representing fine area properties. we look forward to the opportunity to help you.
