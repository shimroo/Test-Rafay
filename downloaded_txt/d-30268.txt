                          starships 










spacex
                                      is developing a fully reusable, rapid
                                      turnaround, two-stage launch system
                                      that can place up to 150 tons of payload
                                      into low earth orbit. the upper stage is
                                      called starship
                                      and the first stage is the super heavy
                                      booster. at boca chica beach near brownsville,
                                      texas the company has built an extensive
                                      factory and launch facility called starbase.
                                      after test flying a series of upper-stage
                                      starship prototypes to low altitudes in
                                      2020-2021, the company started near-orbital
                                      test flights of the full stage of booster
                                      and upper-stage in 2023. 

a starship launches on nov.18, 2023 for
                                      the second orbital test 
                                      flight mission. credits: spacex
the first
                                      orbital flight test (oft-1) of a full-stack
                                      of booster and upper-stage took place on
                                      april 20, 2023. the end goal was to reach
                                      space altitude at near orbital speed but
                                      reenter near hawaii before completing a
                                      full orbit. this would test all the major
                                      subsystems of the booster and the upper-stage,
                                      including the latter's thermal protection
                                      system.
while the test demonstrated operation of
                                      many systems of the launch pad and booster,
                                      there were many problems encountered ranging
                                      from severe damage to ground beneath the
                                      launch mount, engine shutdowns and fires,
                                      and failure to properly separate the booster
                                      and upper-stage. both stages were destroyed
                                      by their flight termination system explosives.
the second
                                      orbital test flight (oft-2) on nov.
                                      18, 2023 made significant progress over
                                      oft-1. all 33 engines on the booster performed
                                      well from takeoff to stage separation. a
                                      new water deluge system and steel plates
                                      successfully potected the launch pad from
                                      damage. the booster separated successfully
                                      from the upper stage with the new "hot
                                      staging" technique in which the upper
                                      stage engines start firing while the stages
                                      are still attached to each other. the attempt
                                      to land the booster softly onto the gulf
                                      of mexico waters failed when something went
                                      amiss with the engines and the vehicle exploded.
the six upper stage engines on the upper
                                      stage appeared to perform well for 6 minutes
                                      of the planned 6.5 minute burn. however,
                                      the flight termination system at that point
                                      determined something was wrong and it destroyed
                                      the vehicle. a third test is now expected
                                      sometime in early 2024.

several groups now provide round the clock
                                      coverage of the activities at starbase.
                                      they provide webcams with 24/7 viewing and
                                      during special events such as engine tests,
                                      there are live broadcasts with expert commentary.
