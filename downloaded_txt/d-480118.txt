bread 
            accompanies every meal, so the quality and especially the taste are 
            very important.





is 
            your local bakery lacking this quality ? 
            or do you only have access to mediocre "fresh"french bread 
            ? 




the 
            best and only solution:
 




make 
            your own french bread ! 



it 
            takes a little time and patience to learn how to make good french 
            bread. don't be dismayed if the first few tries are not up to your 
            expectations, it is completely normal until you get the "right 
            touch". 
            just like anything else, it is a learning process. one thing is sure 
            however, once out of the oven, and sliced and tasted while still warm 
            with some real melting butter it's too late : you will be forever 
            addicted to fresh, homemade french bread.


we offer here three recipes :



-  
                yeast-risen 
                bakery bread
                easier to make than sourdough, it has the advantage of shorter 
                rising time, thus quicker to get from start to finish.
- 
                country 
                sourdough-yeast bread 
                very quick and easy. i wish to thank jérôme for this 
                great recipe which gives us the opportunity to learn a few technical 
                terms.

- 
                sourdough bread 
                once you will have mastered over the above recipes, it becomes 
                imperative to try this more traditional recipe. it takes longer 
                to make (waiting for the dough to rise) and requires sourdough. 
                the consistency and flavor of this bread, however will make you 
                quickly forget the bland bakery yeast bread...



            above all, it is necessary to dispel the preconceived notion that 
            bread is a time consuming process. making the bread takes little time, 
            waiting for it to rise is the only lengthy process and you don't have 
            to do anything, the dough does all the work!


and, 
          of course, a big thank-you to dany for all the good advice,
sylvie, 
          joanne, gilian, and julien for the translation from french !
