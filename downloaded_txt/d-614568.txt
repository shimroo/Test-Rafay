if
      you are looking for a site dedicated to talented actor and ex-ballet dancer 
      jeremy sheffield, then you've come
      to the right place!

jeremy is probably best known 
      to many for his role as hunky heart surgeon dr. alex adams in the bbc1 hospital drama holby 
      city, but jeremy has many credits to his name, from dancing with the royal 
      ballet, to being the love interest in nathalie imbruglia's music video 
      "torn". his latest work moves into movies such as creep, merlin and the 
      wedding date to name a few and tv drama such as murder in suburbia, 
      hearts of gold,
      
bombshell & hollyoaks.  
      he was also seen in the renault clio commericals, safari school & dancing 
      on ice.


this site was created by
      in november 2000 after reading an interview about jeremy being a 
      dancer with the royal ballet.  i was unable to find any information 
      about jeremy on the internet, so i decided to create a website myself! 
      with jeremy's approval (after being first blown away by finding a whole 
      site dedicated to him!) this site was made official in 2002.
