jackson family genealogy











our jackson clan


this site focuses on finding 
 connections via dna to the various branches of what is called 
 the hempstead jackson line.   the actual data base for robert jackson of hempstead has been  moved to cousin
jerry gross' quilted family trees 
where you can continue find the most recent data.   viewers 
  may appreciate the additional features on jerry's site such as an individual 
  timeline and the ability to 
  print pedigree, descendancy and individual pages in pdf format.  
  also there is the ability to leave a comment directly on 
  that site either for questions, corrections or additional 
  comments.  as always, both jerry and janie welcome your 
  emails.   both jerry's site and this separate page remains a work-in-progress and 
  all additions, edits and corrections are appreciated!   
 my email link is at the bottom of the page; jerry can be 
 contacted on the quilted family site.

 this  google spreadsheet was prepared to help you visualize the 
 relationships and connections of the hempstead descendants who have 
 participated in dna testing.
 needs updating; will be done asap.

ftdna blog site: 
 https://blog.familytreedna.com/category/updates/ 
 brand new, updated and i already dislike the color of the 
 headings and the fact that the print is in light gray. makes it 
 very difficult for me to read.  but should be interesting. 

        for those folks whose dna proves they are 
related to the hempstead line, but whose connection has not yet 
been found - charts for these folk are listed with links below:

 bit of history: "tradition has it that robert jackson 
     came from watertown, mass., to wethersfield, connecticut, 
     from thence to hartford, connecticut and from thence to 
     hempstead, in 1643; which perhaps was the first english 
     settlement in the western part of long island."  but that 
     tradition is not backed up with any documentation.  for 
     a very complete examination of this, see marty grundy's 
     history:
     
     http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~paxson/jackson/jackson.index.html   
     despite not knowing how robert arrived on these shores, we 
     do know his descendants have spread to all corners of the 
     united states!  






"the more we share, the more we know!" 
 
      'we' is smarter than 'me'!




a collaborative effort

i started a jackson name study at wikitree.  but it 
 is a larger job than i can handle.  i need lots of folks to 
 help me!    my primary focus right now is to have 
 a wt profile for every man tested to be a descendant of robert 
 of hempstead.  then my 
 goal is to have a link to every eka on the various lineages at 
 ftdna.   so this is much more than hempstead research!   
 so now if you publish your eka to wikitee, please let me know!


  

 come see this page about our jackson dna connections!!

 https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/space:jackson_clan_dna_i-y8950_association
this section will function similar to a blog to 
 keep folks updated on the collaborative effort to both preserve 
 our combined research and to work toward finding the earliest 
 known ancestor for the quartet of patriarchs 
 associated within the snps i-y8950,
 i-y9389 and i-by19809. these 
 patriarchs are 

 thomas jackson b abt 1800 dublin ireland d bef 1845 
 ireland, 
robert 
 jackson b abt 1620 england, d 1683 hempstead, long 
 island, 

 samuel jackson b 1757 uk d 1834 greene co., pennsylvania, and 

 samuel jackson b abt 1661 d 1722 stafford co., colony of 
 virginia. 


           
 trees for the five patriarchs and their descendants have been created 
     at both  werelate.org and 
      wikitree.com. 
     these free, collaborative trees are always in-progress and can use your additions.  come add what 
     you know (and how you know it) to build our collective knowledge.  
     (ah yes, you need to read or view the tutorials and explore 
 the site.  also there is a forum for asking questions!)  
 both sites have their pros and cons but wikitree has become the 
 preferred site for gathering all our combined research together.
  

           
 from ftdna blog: "genealogy is detective work. if all of the 
 answers were just given to you, there wouldn't be any interest 
 or excitement left over."
 because our hempstead line started using dna testing at family 
 tree dna before ancestry.com even began offering it, ftdna 
 remains the lab with the most jackson participants for 
 comparison purposes.  but ancestry.com is catching up and 
 has a larger advertising budget.   if you have tested 
 at other labs and want to compare your results with results from 
 jacksons who have tested at ftdna, know that you can transfer 
 your data to ftdna for a small fee.  see transfer page: https://www.familytreedna.com/landing/ydna-transfer.aspx. 
scroll down to read the whole page before selecting the proper 
transfer.  also, if considering upgrading, it may be helpful 
to read john mcanally's page for tips on selecting just 
certain snps to test.
for those willing to help further the dna research especially for the bigy expensive tests, the donation page 
is at the bottom, left, of this page: https://www.familytreedna.com/groups/jackson/about.  
one can donate anonymously or not, but be sure to designate to which line or person you wish your donation to apply to.


 
  




 âremember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will show thee; ask thy elders, and they will tell thee.â  
deuteronomy 32:7    



"people do not learn from the history they do not know." 
charles simpson, pastoral letter april 2012









did you know?  have you heard?  your 
family is still growing!  with every day's research new 
cousins are found and with every dna test new understandings come 
about.  did you ever wonder about these new cousins and wish 
you knew something of their background or history?  do you 
have favorite stories about your 'grampa' that you wish 
others could know?  i saw on a website the other day someone 
rejoicing; she wrote "i found my grandpa!!"  if you've 
always known your family, you may not have realized the joy it 
brings to those who don't know about their family to finally make 
that connection and know they've got cousins and relatives out 
there.    


i am so appreciative of all the contributions that have been 
made by researchers and family members. but several stand out as deserving of 
special mention and thanks:â  
thanks to mike jackson for his unfailing volunteer 
work with the jackson groups at ftdna;
jack mcanally for his knowledge of dna & research as it pertains to genealogy and handholding us 
all when we falter;  
bob mitchell [rip] for his exacting 
research into jacksons in tn, al and the carolinas;
and jerry gross for his early encouragement and 
continuing interest! 

the results you see on this site are truly the results of 
researchers willing to share and collaborate.â  it is the good spirit of sharing 
and working together that has made this site such a pleasure! to all who have 
contributed and continue to contribute thank you so much!

https://www.werelate.org/wiki/main_page  
 where you can connect your own family data to what has been already posted 
there.  for folks unfamiliar with wiki, there is both 
video and text tutorial for how to use the sites.  info 
can be added either via gedcom or manually but for wikitree, 
  manually is easier. not all our known research has been posted 
  yet to these sites so the records could use your help in making 
  them more current!   so if you have a bit of spare 
  time, what a wonderful way to preserve your research for future 
  generations.
