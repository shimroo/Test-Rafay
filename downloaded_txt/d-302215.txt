dog toys, puzzles and costumes




betsy always says, a dog can never have too many dog toys. betsy and norman are in charge of dog toy selection, dog toy playability ratings and comments. it would be hard to find two dogs who love their dog toys as much as betsy and norman. we search for unusual, fun, unique, tough, little, big, shaking, tugging, noisy, squeaky squeaking, and challenging puzzle dog toys that keep dogs busy and entertained. in addition to our hundreds of dog toys and dog gifts we also have dog costumes, and human dog breed related gifts, dog collars, and clicker dog training items.
