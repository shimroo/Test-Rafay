bamboo rods
graphite rods
fiberglass rods
fishing reels






for many years we have offered quality repair and restoration of fine classic split bamboo fly rods. at this time we have decided to discontinue this service and concentrate on new split bamboo and fiberglass fly rods. these rods will be offered on our website and at select locations. we will also be offering new, used and restored bamboo and fiberglass fly rods, fly reels, rod components, and various items related to fly fishing. 

all phases of the building of the bamboo rods are done in our shop. these rods are not made from someone else's blanks. i do all the work myself, from the basic elements to the finished product. 

we do not offer auctions or uncertain pricing. all costs are clearly communicated and guaranteed in advance of any committment.

deke meyer estate
items d01 thru d16 are from the estate of deke meyer famed author and avid fly fisherman. deke passed away december 2nd 2021. he wrote several books on bass and steelhead fishing. he developed a fondness for quality split bamboo fly rods and he fished all that he owned. no un-fished rods here.

download a pamphlet with photos of dek's gear.
deke and i floated the willamette river from the confluence with the mckenzie river down to harrisburg. we fished bamboo fly rods with dry flies for cutthroat trout. we would watch for the royal wulff hatch and ty on a royal wulff size 16. there were many more flies and hook ups after that. this was the altar  at which we worshipped.

a three day inspection period will apply to all purchases. buyer pays the freight if returned within that period.
