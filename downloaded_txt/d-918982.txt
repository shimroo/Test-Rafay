welcome to our family tree!










some families know a great deal about their roots; others know very little. this site is an attempt to record what i've learned about our family history. in these modern times, families tend to be scattered all over the country, if not the world. one of the goals of this web site is to help our family stay connected even though we live far apart.on this page i'll provide a little information about who i am and what inspired me to do this research. most of this information was probably obtained from talking to living relatives and from researching public records. in the course of doing this research, i've discovered that i have many more relatives than i ever thought possible!  this is a work in progress, so please contact me if you have any information that might help round out the picture.  where did it start from north carolina, tennessee, alabama, arkansas,oklahoma,texas and california no matter the main thing is we all are family.
