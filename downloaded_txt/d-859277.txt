the premiere montessori school in north texas.educating the whole child the montessori way




























our goal is to help develop each child’s ultimate potential.

 

the montessori school at starcreek is specially prepared for the comfort and stimulation of the child. the classrooms are carefully designed environments where children of mixed ages work together or independently with multi-sensory materials that invite them to touch, to think, to experience.children move freely about, choose an activity, and work on it until a sense of accomplishment is achieved. with the freedom to choose, children develop self-confidence, self-discipline, and self-mastery.



because our classrooms are child-centered, our montessori teachers are more facilitators than instructors. the teacher serves as the link between the student and the learning environment, observing each child’s progress, and introducing the next step to enable the child to master a skill.
