marty nemko's website
his little-known ideas on improving your worklife and education, and on men's issues site last updated january 11, 2025 
dear reader,
rather than read the articles on this site, which are older, you'll
probably do better to check out the articles on medium.com or if you'd rather see
me read them and occasionally ad-lib, go to my
youtube channel.
some of my 34 books:

how to do life: advice on life, work, and the
future.

careers for dummies: the best ideas from having worked with
6,000 clients.

a dose of reality: an antidote to today's groupthink.

unreal: 2-minute stories of fantasy, sci-fi, and horror
getting
to career success, step-by-step. that's my two-hour course on
udemy.
and if you're interested in consulting with me privately, click
on the career coaching tab above.
