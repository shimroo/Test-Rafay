we love making people smile


‚Äúafter working with butler's pantry, we would immediately recommend them to anyone looking to hire a caterer for their wedding. from the outset, they were professional, courteous, accommodating, and helpful. they guided us through every step of the planning process and did an amazing job on the day of our wedding. the services they provide are extremely comprehensive and that truly helps to alleviate a lot of the stress that comes along with planning a wedding. we received a ton of compliments on the food and many of our guests said it was the best wedding food they'd ever had.‚Äù
sam l., the knot"we cannot say enough amazing things about butler's pantry, and coleen, whom we worked with from day one. as a bride, i was on top of every little detail, and was in constant contact with coleen. she was very responsive to every question, concern, change, and requests i had."
mindy k., the knot"butler‚Äôs pantry catered our wedding last fall, and it was absolutely delicious. we went buffet-style, and got tons of compliments on how tasty everything was, including "best wedding food i've ever had" from a couple of guests."
shannon, google"as you might be aware, we began using butler's pantry as our catering partner several years ago. since then, your team members have come to feel like an extension of my own team. they design the best possible events for us and our guests, then flawlessly execute them, anticipating our every want and need along the way. they make me look like a miracle worker, but i can only smile and respond that it was really butler's pantry. your butler's team members have become an invaluable resource to me and to my team. congratulations on having such an outstanding team, and thank you for your partnership."
cheryl b. "i just want you to know how great our event was. the pictures, the food, the drink, the spirit all just wonderful. it was well done from top to bottom. the word will spread as to how much fun it is. (good food really makes a difference.) you hit a home run!"
