electrician certification program - what is an electrician trainee?
espaã±ol
 what is an electrician trainee?
legislation passed in 1999 requiring all electricians 
    who work for a c-10 electrical contractor to be certified by the state of california. regulations from that 
    legislation were put in place in 2002, setting deadlines for all categories 
    of electricians. many of those deadlines have already passed. 
to continue to work as an electrician after 
    the deadline has passed, a person must be one of the following: certified 
    by having taken and passed the exam or an apprentice in a state approved 
    program or an electrician trainee.
if a person wants to perform electrical work 
    for a c-10 contractor and does not yet qualify to take the certification 
    exam because of lack of work experience or related instruction, can 
    do so legally by registering as an electrician 
      trainee.
for more details:
