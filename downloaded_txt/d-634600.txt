secure e-mail with advanced threat protection

              91% of cyberattacks begin with a phishing e-mail. phishing attempts have grown 65% in the past year. with our platform we not only protect you against viruses, malware, spymail, and zero-day threats; but we block phishing attempts with the use of machine learning combined with human intelligence.
            






                  our 3-layer approach to  e-mail security
                

                  through key strategic partnerships, weâve developed a unique 3-layer approach to protect you against the most aggressive threats today.
                







                      secure e-mail gateway
                    




                        the first line of defense includes anti-spam, anti-virus, anti-malware, e-mail encryption, url protection, impersonation protection, & file disarming using cdr technology.
                      

                        content disarm & reconstruction (cdr) strips all active content from files in real-time, creating a flat sanitized file. all active content is treated as suspect and removed. cdr processes all incoming files, deconstructs them, and removes all elements that do not match firewall policies.
                      

                        we defend against inbound spear-phishing, malware, spam and zero-day attacks by combining innovative solutions with multiple detection engines and intelligence feeds.
                      






                      threat intelligence
                    




                        a single vendor or threat intelligence source is not enough to protect you from constantly evolving and sophisticated threats that pose a risk to your organization. we utilize threat feeds from multiple sources, including our own, to better protect your inbox from targeted attacks.
                      






                      anti-phishing protection
                    




                        our final layer in defense protects against e-mail spoofing & impersonation attempts; but also includes automated e-mail phishing protection, detection, and incident response. with machine learning, phishing incident analysis is streamlined and then coupled with human intelligence.

 we believe education is a key element in protection. not only do we allow the ability for end users to report possible threats, but we also train end users on how to detect them. in addition to advanced phishing protection, there is also real time email content scanning of links and attachments which also includes multiple best of breed sandboxes and mult-av engines.
