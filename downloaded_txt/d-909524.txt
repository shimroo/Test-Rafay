about the ihstf

prior to 1976, there had been theatre leaders in the state who felt there was a need for an alternative to a statewide student theatrical event of a competitive nature.  several of these theatre educators formed local theatre festivals in their general geographic areas. jerry proffit of niles east high school and cary libkin of riverside-brookfield high school were two of these leaders. they developed a regional, localized theatre festival for their high school students and, because of their success, provided the spark for the creation of the state-wide illinois high school theatre festival. read more
