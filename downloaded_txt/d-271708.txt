when my gratuitous <-- webcounter  --> webcounter from digits died sometime between 2008 and 2010, it 
	showed "17,379"  hits since 
	december 25th, 1995.  i can say from my analytics that this very old and very out-of-date website has had over 500 hits since 2012.  while that is a very small number compared to the number of hits when the web was much smaller, i can say that not all of the new hits are web bots.  that is something for an old non-updated site.  still, it is the first website i made, so i will keep it up to remind me of when this whole internet madness started for me back in the 1990s.
