land air sea on vinyl for the first time july 15th.
the special goodness’ land air sea has existed in many versions, from makeshift cd-r copies to a limited pressing on the small nos label, and, eventually, an official release by epitaph records in 2004. but the power pop gem from pat wilson of weezer and drummer atom willard (rocket from the crypt, plosivs, against me!) has never existed on vinyl. not until now. on july 15, land air sea drops on high-quality red-colored wax from hello records in partnership with epitaph, featuring all-new artwork and limited to only 1,000 copies.

the special podness by wastoids



welcome to the special pod-ness, a four-part mini-series dedicated to the history of the special goodness by the three dudes who (probably) know it best: pat wilson of weezer, drummer atom willard (rocket from the crypt, plosivs, against me!) and karl koch, weezer historian.as we celebrate the brand new red-colored vinyl edition of the band's third album, land air sea, pat, atom, and karl take us back to the ‘90s and early 2000s to share stories about the ins and outs of the music industry, run-ins with other bands and musicians, and the making of the record. in this first episode, pat explains the project's origins, and karl explores the varied cover art that has graced sg releases. all that, plus some quality nacho discussion to close things out.
