harps that let you...be yourself











scroll


















harps are magic.harps have a way, they just do, of taking joy, wrapping it all around you, and floating it out into the world. you can ask anyone who plays, though i don’t think you’ll need to because you probably already know. something deep down inside is drawing you to the whisper of those magical strings and all their secrets. rees harps inc., makers of harpsicle® harps has been building harps for fifty years. this site is filled with all kinds of inf!ormation about our harps, harp accessories, harp music, and general harp information. you can flit lightly through the menu or dive deeply but whatever brought you here, we are glad you came and please know that any question you may have about harps is our pleasure to answer.



































a new generationeverything old really is new again and rees harps is no exception. william rees began building harps in 1972. he kept his dinosaur in back of his hut and worked in the stable. (actually, he worked in a corner of his garage but that's so long ago we can barely recall it ourselves.) garen rees, william's son, has been in the business since before he graduated from high school and now, well into his thirties, he's ready to "assist" his dad into retirement so that he can just get on with it already! like william's wife, pamela, garen's wife, melissa, is in the business too so we truly are keeping the crafting of your harps in our family. we absolutely love what we do and we can't help but think that our relationships with you and with these wonderful instruments shines through in every harp we make.

angela july - indonesia








maria halcyon - russia








harp students - germany








lyrika holmes - usa








the hippy harpist - wales








carol lopez marin in prague at the lennon wall








harps that let you... be yourselfour customers continue to amaze us when they send stories of their latest harp-ventures. lyrika holmes is currently touring with cirque du soleil. angela july was just in the final round of "asia's got talent". cirian, who is glowing at the top of this page, is touring with bono. maria halcyon is rocking out with her band, gilead, in concerts all across russia. christina tourin teaches harp with her rainbow of sound program around the world, including with the young players above, in germany. and who doesn't love this great shot of the hippy harpist resting on her harp after playing for sheep along the coast of wales? mexican harpist, carol lopez marin, traveled to prague and visited the lennon wall to take what has to be one of our favorite harp shots of all time. it's a big world and we think it is a measure of audacious grace when you take your harpsicle® harp and play your harp out!

coolest thing made in indiana 



join garen rees on a tour of rees harps




























on 11 december 2024 harpsicle® harps was named the coolest thing made in indiana by the indiana chamber of commerce. companies from across the state competed in a series of brackets (similar college basketball playoffs but without the face painting.) organizations as big as rolls royce aircraft engines and as small as, well, us were pitted against one another. many thousands of votes were cast in each round but our customers from all around the world came through and, yes indeed, thanks to all of you harpsicle® harps is the coolest thing made in indiana! how incredible is that?!?








there are seven engaging harps in the harpsicle® harp familythe harpsicle® harps line consists of the one that started it all, the harpsicle® harp. the line grew from there to include the sharpsicle™ harp, the flatsicle™ harp, the fullsicle™ harp, the special edition fullsicle™ harp, the grand harpsicle® harp and the 34-string brilliant!™ harpsicle® harp.
