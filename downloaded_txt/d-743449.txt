                                bob and prizm worked closely with me to create a regional spine center development strategy, the name of the spine center; the corporate identity; a content-rich internet presence; all referral development tactics; and patient education materials. bob and prizm continually serve loyally as a trusted advisor to our best interests, short term and long term.
