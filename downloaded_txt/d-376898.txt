poems



written from the heart...






































































































we...





we,
met without an introduction
talked without any preparation
left without a decision
separated without a discussion…


i,
am a loner in the cold
with eyes blindfold
with body still bold
with pride unsold
with hopes i still hold…


you,
helplessly hear
the careless whisper
of the ones you dear
wishing you are near
to make things clear…


they,
are those without emotions
said ‘love is not a tradition
for life is full of temptations
so forget all the commitments
and live with our judgment…


we,
no matter how they appear
our faces they smear
our hearts the tear
we have no fear
as we wonder
of the future
that is still unclear…


and now,
rules are implement
no continuation
no devotion
leaving us with no option
and self opinion
and without a relation…

my love






you're such a question mark, but still on my mind
love does find it's way around although it's so blind
when will you come back and smile at my face
you left a hole in my heart, an empty place

you have the darkest eyes
where everyday the sun dies
they shine just like the stars
they seem like they're close but they're so far
but when i look at the sky
i make a wish upon my wishing star
that you'd know that i just adore you the way you are

all the things i’ve seen with you
it all seems like yesterday
you are my love this is all i can say
all these memories seem so vivid and so clear
all of them wrapped inside my heart
safe and sound right here

my love will forever stay in my heart, and will live in my eyes
no matter how far we are, no matter how far we stay
ask me why
cause you're my true love
and true love never die…

trying





trying to imprison the tear in my eye
trying to imprison the sadness in my heart
trying to catch stars in the sky
trying not to be so much hard
trying to face this true big lie
trying to remember how good was the start
trying to forget all the hard times
trying to be free and break the cage
trying to see the sun once more shines
trying to end this up and start a new page
trying to write very true words on these lines
"trying" is a play can be only seen on stage...

the end





by anonymous

it's been a lifetime, since we've been apart
almost 5 months now, since i broke my own heart
in this journey, i've grown all by myself
i've passed through a heartbreak, without your help

at first i was sad, and cried through the nights
hoping you'd come back, through the door to my life
i swore that i'd never smile again
not wanting to realize, that this was the end

i was afraid to dry out, all of my tears
afraid to live out, my one greatest fear
to be without you, i would rather die
and thats what i did, all i did was cry

to see her with you, was hardest of all
i thought you had lied, i thought you would fall
i thought you forgot me, and all that we shared
thats when i realized, my thoughts were impaired

my story was wrong, it couldn't be right
you had loved me so much, night after night
our love had grown wings, and then flew away
into our dreams, and in there to stay

now i accept it, i know that it's real
i love myself now, i hear what i feel
our love didn't fail, it only was lost
our love was there, but it came with a cost

i paid with my heart, and then with my tears
i've learned to listen with my soul, not with my ears
i won't be angry, i'll thank you instead
i'll give you a smile, not the tears that i've shed

thank you for being there when nobody was
thank you for calling me "just because"
thank you for loving me, despite all our fights
thank you for understanding all of those nights

the point of this poem, is for me to prove
not only to you, but also me too
that i'll be okay, i'm finally fine
someday i'll find one, who's happily mine

you made me stronger, helped me i find
to let me love you, one i thought was all mine
after all we've been through, as ends come to ends
i'll always love you, i hope we'll be friends

alone in the night





by b.eagle

i sit awake all through the night
wondering how much longer until the time is right.
when i am yours, and you are mine.
when everything in life will be just fine.

i love you more than words can say
as i sit here and wait for the day.
the day when you become mine forever
and nothing can make us stay apart, never!

i've never loved anyone like i love you
so this is all something very new.
so, as i sit here all alone tonight
i wonder how long till i hold you tight...

forever, i will wait





by yasser


i sometimes feel my heart will burst
from wanting you so much
i can't explain in words of how
i long to feel your touch


there is no way i can convey
this emptiness inside
that seems to tear my soul to shreds
as time goes swiftly by


if i could merely hold you near
for just a little while
if i could simply talk with you
or only see you smile


to have you look into my eyes
and wait to hear you say
something that would help me
to take this pain away


if i have to wait forever
i guess that's what i'll do
for me, it will be worth it
to finally be with you...

forget...





forget his name, forget his face
forget his walk, his warm embrace
forget the love you once knew...
remember he has someone new
forget him when it starts to hurt
forget how close you two once were
remember he has chosen her
forget you memorized his walk
forget the things he used to say
remember now he's gone away
forget his laugh, forget his hair
forget him and never stare
forget the way he held you tight
remember he's with her tonight
forget the time that went so fast
forget that you love him because he's in the past...

when i die...





by anonymous

when i die
i hope you'll be the first to know 
and that you were the only reason 
i didn't want to go 

when i die
i want you to pray for me 
and ask god to forgive me
then go and live the rest of your life happily

when i die 
i want you to look at rivers, oceans and seas
i want you to remember my tear drops
and that no one cared and cried for you more that me

when i die 
go to the beach and walk on the sand
remember the days 
when we walked hand in hand

when i die
remember that every blow of the wind means i love you
that i care for you, that i miss you 
and that i'll be there no matter what do you do 

my eyes are so red now, yet so blue
i'm so scared, i won't lie
remember that once i was beside you 
and do please remember me once in a while 
when i die...

i was reminded





by mona

as we lay there  quiet
i was reminded of all the reasons why i lust you
your smile,
and  the way it teased at me seductively
your laugh,
and the way it tempted  me
your eyes,
and the way they seem to hypnotize me

as we sat there  silent
i was reminded of all the reasons why i love you
your smile,
and  the way it brings such life into me
your laugh,
and the way it makes  everything okay
your eyes,
and the way them seems to read my  thoughts

as we stand here now
i am reminded of all the reasons why i  hate you
your smile,
and the way it confuses me
your laugh,
and the  way it seems to mock me
your eyes,
and the way they can look into mine and not feel a thing...

hiding the truth





       by jafar al-aidrus...


i wake up each morning
with another tear stained face
and no matter how hard i try
these tears i can't erase


i go to school and smile
just wishing this would end
my smile is slowly fading
its getting harder to pretend


i then go off to practice
where again i'm forced to lie
i just can let them see
the pain behind my eyes


then finally i get home
and rush up to my room
and once again i start to cry
and my life is now resumed


and when the nighttime comes
i'm not sure what i'll do
i try my best to keep myself
from feeling down and blue


but in the end i cry
knowing that its wrong
i guess my plan has failed
showing i'm not strong


i then reach for the knife
to dull the pain inside
and this i do deserve
for all the times i've lied
i cry myself to sleep
like i do each night
and as i sleep i wonder
will i ever win this fight...

a special birthday poem - for a special friend





on this card
there's nothing much for me to write
just simple words which i tried
to express when my tongue is tied
to you, my friend by my side...

what is a world this wide
without enemies to fight
and friends for you to hold tight
and when your life is in a plight
when reality starts to bite
there's nothing you can hide
when emotions collide
when friends are out of sight
when everything is just not right
to who should you confide
when you cry alone at night
maybe to who you don't think
you might...

there will be a day
when someone tries to interfere
making friendship a failure
with words you don't want to hear
making everything seems unclear
when good moments turn sour
when tears take over laughter
and friends you think you know better
become writings on paper
fade away, when sprinkled with water
gone, when burnt with fire...

but remember...
someone is out there
giving you love and care
with time to spare
when others just stare
friends just glare
and you are left in despair
but you are unaware
of the good times you share
so you just don't care...

this is not a birthday sermon
nor to change you in person
but take it as a token
of a friendship in return
for a friend can be lost
without a reason
and some words are better
left unspoken...

one day i'll lose my part
as someone near and close
to your heart
still i promise you
without a but
that i'll treasure every moment
without a doubt
from happiness to sadness
no matter what
from the day this friendship starts
till the last beat of my heart...

so on this special day
give me a chance to say
that i'll treasure you in everyway
come what may
till the moment i lay
and to god i pray
to give you happiness day by day
smiles, that never fade away
and love, that will come and stay...

happy birthday...

you are the one






you are the one
who entered my life
the one who made it complete
giving me a brand new life
giving me another reason to survive.


you are the one who shows everything with actions
never played with my emotions
till the day i realize
you made me laugh
made me cry
made me awake all night
made me shiver
made me trmeble with fear
made it all very clear.


who am i?
you might ask.
i'm the one who dream of you
whenever i can't touch you
whenever i can't hold you
and whenever you are far
i feel you near
when fears come over
when no one is there
to wake me from this nightmare.


i'm the one
who will walk with you
side by side
when there's darkness
i'll be your light
when you are lost
i'll be your guide
when there's no one to turn to
i'll be there for you
every minute every second
whenever you're in need
to show you i'm the one indeed.


where am i?
am i only in my dreams
or struggling to be in yours
to be the thought of yours
to be the memory of yours
to be in the heart of yours
will i ever reach there?
or will i be left in despair.


i myself can't tell
but i know very well
that these won't leave you
with a why
if only you knew who am i...

the reason






knowing you
is the best thing i ever knew
for all the moments we've shared
for all the beliefs we compared
doesn't stopped us to be closer
doesn't stopped us to be lovers


things went out well without amendment
but the worst are yet to happen
for things started to be different
just because of that question
which my answer
didn't gave you pleasure


you kept asking me for it
even though i never agreed
i know you can't help it
but baby, i can't do it
not because i'm afraid
but i just didn't want to make a mistake


why didn't you want to understand
why didn't you want to keep that in mind
that even though i'm yours
even though you're mine
doing it won't be fine
for traces will be left behind


you told me not to think of fear
cause one day, we'll be together
but baby, how can we be sure
that we're gonna be forever
for you know, our ties will severe


you still want to reassure
saying that those won't occur
cause our love and trust conquer
it won't gives us even a blister
so why should we bother
on what's going to happen in the future


but darling you should know
the reasons for me to say no
not because i don't love you
not because i don't trust you
it's just that i don't want this matter
to be the reason for us to be together


days passed by
and you decided to wave good-bye
to all the matters that have been cleared
to all the memories that we jeered
to the ties, that have been severed


i just can't believe you said so
i just can't believe you're letting me go
but darling there's one thing you should know
before i become your foe
that is to love a girl for her heart
that is to love a girl for her soul
for you will regret it till you're old
if you only love her for her mole
if you only need her to warm you in the cold.
