welcome




what is the gcna?
the guild of carillonneurs in north america is a volunteer-based organization all about the carillon. founded in ottawa, ontario, in 1936, we have spent nearly a century helping people discover and love the art of the carillon. we support the development of our members and we encourage the building of new carillons, the improvement of existing ones, and the writing and distribution of carillon music.

what is a carillon?
a carillon is a musical instrument! imagine a bell tower full of bells (at least 23 to be exact) which are each connected via wires to a large wooden console. the console has a keyboard, a pedal board, and a bench. by playing at this console, a "carillonneur" or "carillonist" can play all kinds of music. carillons are found across north america and the world, often at common gathering spaces, like parks, schools, and churches.
