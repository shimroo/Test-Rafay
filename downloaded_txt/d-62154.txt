i'm glad to see my students making lifestyle modifications and efforts to improve their lives. together with the support from my colleagues and supervisors in hpb, i feel more motivated to perform my role as a student health advisor in schools.

we get to work across project teams in hpb and this really gives me the opportunity to experience the work in different departments and teams. besides my main portfolio in the healthy lifestyle centre, i also worked with the obesity prevention management
team. one of the projects that i was involved in was a video shoot on some of the simple exercises which hpb is promoting to the residents.

i enjoy promoting oral health to the public. i find that this job gives me a sense of satisfaction, especially to see the joy and happiness in children. i am glad to see them becoming more cooperative towards dental treatment. and it is great to see them smiling with healthy teeth and coming to look for me during their recess time

we focus on “what we can do” rather than “what we cannot do”. this spirit has brought about effective team collaboration and communication.
