welcome to mmta

the spokesperson for the maine trucking industry since 1946.
trucks deliver good stuff and our members drive the maine economy. not only are we one of the largest trade associations in the state due to the services we offer, but we are also made up of a wide and diverse membership who actively seek ways to positively impact highway safety and provide leadership on other issues that impact maine’s future.
