how does the makita 18v lxt cordless drill stack up to the competition? 
january 6, 2023july 3, 2022 by frankie 


whether you’re a professional handyman or simply a homeowner trying to get things done around the house, you need the best 18v cordless drill that you can get. the makita 18v lxt cordless drill offers everything you need from a drill with relatively few drawbacks, making it a strong contender for your next hardware purchase.
a quick overview of the makita 18v lxt model
this drill kit includes the power drill itself, a charger, a tool case, and two batteries for you to alternate between. the set is optimized to work with a 110-volt power supply, which differs sightly from some comparable models.
the machine weighs a little over 10 pounds, making it light enough to use without concern for arm fatigue. it measures 5.2″ x 16.6″ x 12.4″, so it’s compact enough to conveniently transport to a job site.
makita’s lxt series is categorized by lithium ion batteries that do not lose their charge when not in use, allowing you to use your drill even if it has been sitting around for months. lithium ion technology also gives this drill an impressive battery life, maximizing how often you can use the drill before stopping to recharge.
(see our top recommended cordless drills compared)
how versatile is this bad boy?
this makita 18v lxt cordless drill offers an adjustable bit, variable led lighting, and speed controls. the adjustable bit allows you to easily change the size of your drill bit to suit the task at hand. this feature has largely become standard, but it’s always nice to confirm before making a purchase.
an led light is also included to illuminate your project, allowing this drill to be used day or night. this probably isn’t necessary if you plan to work exclusively in your shop, but becomes extremely handy if you plan to use it outdoors or at multiple job sites.
finally, you may alternative between two speed ranges: 0-600 rpm and 0-1900 rpm. this allows you to select a speed appropriate for most drilling applications, adding to the unit’s versatility.
how easy is this drill to use?
the lightweight design of this drill allows both professionals and diy enthusiasts to use it successfully. you can expect superior results with this drill as long as you remember to charge it beforehand and have at least a vague idea of how to operate a power drill.
one standout feature is a rubberized contoured handle, allowing for a secure grip that mitigates undesirable slipping and sliding. it also reduces hand fatigue, allowing for comfortable periods of extended use. previous makita models have lacked this feature, and it’s definitely something you miss once you’ve grown accustomed to it.
this drill also has relatively few maintenance requirements thanks to makita’s extreme protection technology (ept). the system is not adversely affected by moisture or dust, allowing you to use it in hostile work environments with full peace of mind that it will continue to work. all you need to do is wipe it off after use and store it in the included tool case while not in use to optimize your drill’s effective lifespan.
what kind of power can this cordless drill produce?
this drill can generate up to 480 inches/pound of torque, giving it enough oomph to successfully complete the vast majority of drilling projects.
any drawbacks?
the drill chuck started to come loose after about three years of use and abuse, a durability concern that is not common among comparable drills. its price point of $150 is also a bit expensive considering what it is, as far cheaper alternatives are available. that said, this drill has the power output, versatility, and usability to command a premium price point.
the drill is also optimized for use with makita’s batteries and chargers, improving its performance at the cost of locking you into a specific manufacturer for most of your accessories. whether this is a drawback or not will depend on the individual user.
my final thoughts
overall, this drill is an excellent choice for both homeowners interested in tackling a couple of projects around the house and professional contractors who plan to use it for a living. the community has provided a seal of approval to this machine, as most makita 18v lxt cordless drill reviews are positive in nature. there are many quality models on the market today, but this may be the best 18v cordless drill available for $150 or less.

historical renovation of a home in andover, ma. 
february 17, 2023january 6, 2023 by frankie 





located in the picturesque town of andover, massachusetts is a home from the 18th century that has been lovingly restored and renovated. this two-story monument to history has been carefully preserved while modernizing key parts so that it can be enjoyed for generations to come.

with its four bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen remodel, updated electrical wiring, and other updates, this home still maintains its original charm. the renovation process was lengthy and detailed to ensure accuracy and respect for the historical nature of the home while making it practical as well as safe for today’s standards.
during the renovation, all efforts were taken to preserve such features as hardwood floors, high ceilings, fireplaces, built-in cabinetry, period hardware, and other unique features. the home’s exterior was also kept in mind, and the siding and roofing were replaced with materials that would better resist the new england weather.
the final result is a beautifully updated home that still contains all the original character and charm of an 18th-century house. this home is now a comfortable and stylish space that can be enjoyed by family and friends for years to come.
what restorations we did

updated electrical wiring
replaced damaged siding
re-finished hardwood floors
installed new kitchen appliances
installed a whole house water filtration system.
refinished period hardware
repaired fireplaces
repaired built-in cabinetry for storage
installed new windows and doors



updated electrical wiring
the home’s wiring used outdated knob & tube wiring, which posed a safety hazard. we upgraded the electrical system to today’s standards using all new conduits and wires, then tested it for safety.
replaced damaged siding
the siding on the home was cracked and faded from years of exposure to the elements. we replaced it with hardy cedar clapboards to better help protect the home from the elements and provide an updated look.
refinished hardwood floors
the hardwood floors had been stained, scratched, and damaged over time. we sanded them down to restore their original beauty and applied a protective finish for durability.
installed new kitchen appliances
to bring the kitchen up to modern standards, we replaced the old appliances with stainless steel models for a more contemporary look all the while, keeping the historic accents in place for the old-world charm.
installed a whole-house water filtration system
while we were upgrading the plumbing we decided it was the perfect time to install a water filtration system to improve the quality of the household’s drinking and bathing water.
in these old historical districts, many of the homes in our neighborhood still have lead pipes, so to prevent any harmful lead from entering the home, we installed a whole-house water filtration system with the help of ava martin of qwl – visit their webpage.
refinished period hardware
the home had several pieces of ornate hardware from its original construction. we stripped and refinished these pieces so that they would remain intact while giving them an updated shine.
doing so did have its own set of challenges as some of the hardware had so much detail in the nooks and crannies we found it took a lot of time to fully restore these beauties.
repaired fireplaces
the home’s fireplaces were badly damaged due to neglect over time. we restored them to their original condition by rebuilding the masonry and replacing any broken components.
repaired built-in cabinetry for storage
the home had several pieces of built-in cabinetry that needed some attention. we repaired and refinished these areas to restore their beauty and usefulness.
installed new windows and doors
to keep the home energy efficient, we installed new windows and doors with energy-efficient features such as double-paned glass and insulated frames. this also helped improve the look of the outside of the home.
by carefully preserving, restoring, and modernizing this 18th-century home in andover ma., we were able to give it a new lease on life while respecting its historical roots. the end result is a beautiful historic space that can now be enjoyed by family and friends for years to come.


some of our biggest challenges
some of the biggest challenges we had to face while restoring this beautiful home were getting all of the modern elements to blend in with its traditional architecture. we wanted to preserve and restore as much of the 18th-century charm as possible, but also make sure that the new components fit in for a seamless look.
we also had to be mindful of our materials and methods so that we did not damage any historic elements that could still be seen or used today. additionally, we had to stay within budget so that we could get the most value out of their project while still achieving their desired results.
our team was able to find creative solutions that allowed us to respect the building’s original character while making it livable and comfortable for modern times. we are proud of the work that we have done and the final outcome of this beautiful restoration project.
thanks to our hard work and dedication, this 18th-century home will stand the test of time for many more years to come!

carpet installation costs – what you should know 
february 8, 2019 by frankie 



there are several factors that contribute to overall carpet installation cost. included among the factors are the price of padding, labor and the carpet itself. additional details are below:
how to choose the best carpet for your home
when choosing carpet, a few different options should be considered. you will have to know the measurement of the floors you need covered as the square footage will largely determine the project’s overall cost.
here are a few examples of prices pulled from leading online remodeling cost websites:
it is important to know the size room you are carpeting as this could make a significant difference in your budget. the average room size is 144 square feet. depending on the carpet chosen, remodelingexpense mentions that the subfloor types and padding thickness, the average carpet installation cost ranges from $4.50 – $6.80 per square ft.
fixr states: while carpeting has a wide range of prices, the average homeowner pays between $7 and $12 per square foot ($63-$108/square yard), with the average installation size roughly 10-feet by 14-feet for an average cost of $980 to $1,680
homeadvisor mentions: many factors go into the final carpet prices and installation job, including room size and shape, carpet style, furniture removal, hauling out old flooring, labor, and more. that’s why there is so much variety in our user reports, which show that the average cost of an entire carpet installation project is $1,603, with most homeowners paying between $763 and $2,521 but with some paying as little as $200 or as much as $4,000.
carpet installation also addresses subflooring and padding; therefore, these costs should be budgeted as well. the same is true for smaller costs like baseboards, tack strips, old material removal and moving furniture. the guide below will help you to know the costs and range of services involved in the overall installation cost:
type of carpet
carpets are available in a broad range of styles, colors, fibers and patterns. it is crucial to choose the right one for a particular space as high traffic areas and low traffic areas have different carpeting needs. knowing the different varieties of materials will help you in determining the best carpet for you.
﻿
getting bids
always get three or more different bids, which should cover all aspects of the installation. you can reduce costs by moving furniture and removing old materials yourself, which could save you hundreds of dollars.
moving furniture
the carpet cannot be removed or laid with furniture on top of it. a clear room will be needed by the installer to remove the old carpet and pad and install the new one. the majority of carpet installation companies will provide you with this service for an additional fee. typically, this fee averages roughly just over $1 for each square foot.
subflooring
this is basically the mounting surface beneath the carpet and padding and above the foundation of the concrete. typically, this is done by a carpenter who uses sheets of plywood. replacing the subfloor is not always required when installing new carpet; however, it should be considered an option.
over time, the subfloor will deteriorate. the plywood could crumble, splinter or become broken. after the removal of the old carpet and padding, the subfloor should be inspected for wear and tear. if its durability is in doubt, it is a good idea to call a professional for an inspection. for subfloor installation, an average of $1000 to $3000 will be charged by most carpenters.
padding and tack strips
without padding, carpets will not be bouncy or plush and will be eventually worn down by the subfloor. the majority of contractors include padding in the overall cost. new padding is not required for new carpets; however, it is highly recommended. there are options for padding thickness and material. thicker padding will feel softer but will cost more for each square foot.
typically, tack strips are included in the cost but sometimes they are not. as such, the bids should be inspected to see if they include new tack strips. these small pieces of wood are attached with nails to the subfloor; they should be inspected and only replaced, if necessary.
removing old materials
following the removal of the old carpet and padding and the installation of the new padding and carpet, the contractor’s job is done. if you have no plan in place for removing the old materials, they may be left in your yard.
installers commonly remove and take the bundled up carpet and padding with them, for a fee. the disposal fees should be accounted for and could cost as much as $1 for each square foot. however, this is typically a flat fee outlined in the bid.
stairs and special cuts
when carpet companies bid on projects, non-square areas are taken into consideration. for example, stairs attract an additional cost as carpeting these areas take more particular cutting and installation techniques to properly cover them.
in the carpet industry, stairs are viewed as a specialty installation and the cost for labor will be more than a standard floor install. this cost will depend largely on the number of stairs and if you are doing a top coverage or full coverage. for budgeting purposes, you can anticipate paying an additional $1 to $3 for each yard for labor.
besides the stairs, other non-square areas are considered special cuts and extra attention and skills will be required to perfectly install the carpet. these special cuts cost more. generally, that cost ranged from $0.50 to $3 depending on the number and complexity of cuts required.
these are just some of the factors that influence your carpet installation cost.

the best cordless drills for your toolbox 
january 6, 2023september 9, 2018 by frankie 


image credit: justcordlessdrillreviews.com
it’s the epitome of practicality: a tool that can bore holes, drive and retract screws, or even stir mortar without being tethered to a power outlet. of course not forgetting the level of freedom this creates — not only can take the device anywhere, it also takes less effort to maneuver compared to its corded cousin. it’s amazing how far cordless drills have come to allow this kind of convenience.
in fact, today’s models are so far ahead of their predecessors that they’re more or less equal matches for corded drills. with that being the case, how do you find the best cordless drill for you? that will of course come down to your needs. even so, it can’t hurt to look at what some of the best cordless drills on the market today have to offer.
dewalt 20v max cordless drill
what comes to mind first at the mention of ‘cordless drill?’ power? ergonomic design? reliability? whether it’s one or all of these aspects, the dewalt 20-volt max has what it takes to be worth your consideration.
coming from a brand famous for its well-rounded power tools, this drill comes in a compact, rugged design for enhanced versatility. there’s also something to be said about the familiar placement of controls in that regard. on a separate note, this drill comes with a pair of 20v lithium-ion battery packs, and which combine to equate to a 300w power output from the motor. in spite of that, the dewalt 20v is still priced in a range suitable for most budgets.
speaking of ranges, this drill can generate speeds of up to 1500 rpm. combine that with a 2 speed transmission and 16 clutch settings, and what you have is the ability to create just the right amount of force for your tasks. other noteworthy highlights include:
pros:

a light, compact battery design for less fatigue
a relatively-quick recharge to minimize downtime
durable steel construction
led light

cons:

short battery life
no onboard slots to store bits

makita 18v lxt cordless drill
the makita 18v lxt is one of those drills you can trust to get the job done every time. why? because it packs a beast of a motor in its design, specifically one whose torque output peaks at 480 in-lbs. this means it will power down through pretty much any kind of material you may come across during your projects. its compact profile, on the other hand, will let you work in the most confined of places.
cordlessdrillzone mentions that what makes makita so popular is due to the fact it can get into tight areas with ease and the battery power is unmatched in reliability.
see our in-depth makita 18v lxt review here:
but that’s not all. see, the lxt is uniquely designed with dust- and water-protection mechanisms. this of course translates to less risk of falling prey to the most common jobsite hazards. for tactical versatility, the device is equipped with a variable 2-speed transmission and 19 clutch settings. also forming part of the standard kit are an easy-to-use metal clamping feature, an 18v lithium-ion battery, and a proprietary fast-charging mechanism.
pros:

the ergonomic design allows for extended use without the risk of fatigue
normal drilling aside, the lxt can also be used as a hammer driver-drill/impact driver
has features to protect against overheating and overloading
the brushless motor technology allows the drill to extract maximum performance from the battery

cons:

battery life leaves a lot to be desired. to elaborate, it seems to have traded capacity for fast-charging capabilities.
the chuck tends to cause bits to wobble.
not suitable for large-scale commercial projects.

milwaukee m18 fuel cordless drill
with a maximum length of 7.5 inches and a comparable weight footprint, you could be forgiven for thinking that the milwaukee m18 fuel was designed primarily for use in tight spaces. but don’t let the small form fool you — this is actually among the most powerful models in its class. courtesy of the proprietary brushless motor design, the m18 packs a punch powerful enough to justify its presence in a contractor’s toolbox.
specifically, the device will comfortably yield a jaw-dropping 850 in-lbs of torque, with speed topping off at 2000 rpm. such figures make the m18 ideal for hobbyists in need of heavy-duty tools. does that sound like you? well, there’s a lot to love about a drill that’s capable of handling everything you throw at it. the same can also be said of its other pros:
pros:

durable: due to the absence of carbon brushes, the motors suffer minimal wear and tear. this also makes the m18 run quieter as well.
adjustability: the drill comes with a 2-speed gearbox as well as 24 torque settings. not to forget that all settings are clearly-marked.
batteries: these don’t just provide a longer run time — they’re equipped to withstand exposure to harsh outdoor elements. a gauge is also included to help users track battery life.
a 5-year warranty

cons:

price: the m18 is by far the most expensive drill of its kind. this can of course be justified by its incredible performance but, as you’ll probably agree, it can’t make up for the lack of accessories.
the battery does take a while to charge fully.

our final thoughts
as earlier suggested, the perfect drill is one that fits your needs best. this means that both the dewalt 20v max and makita 18v lxt will be suitable for all but the most intensive of users. it goes without saying that the latter are better off choosing the milwaukee m18 fuel.
