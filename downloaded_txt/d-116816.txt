we see you're using internet explorer, which is not compatible with this site.  we strongly suggest downloading firefox.  we think you'll like it better:

      · firefox blocks pop-up windows.

      · it's more secure against viruses and spyware.

      · it keeps microsoft from controlling the future of the internet.

      · it's better for web designers and developers.

      · features like tabbed browsing make reading webpages easier.



click the button on the right to download firefox.  it's free.

continue without firefox >>

my new domain, drivebyshooter.net, is up, but not quite running.  it's still trying to get its bearings and learn how to walk.  it'll be hitting its stride in no time though.

once again, i'm inarticulate.  you'd probably be better served by clicking through to campaign for real beauty and see what mia and the other dove beauties have to say.  [edit] it turns out jayvee blogged about this too, and he actually beat me to the punch.  well, i guess we really jump at chances to promote our friends.  [/edit]

the departedmartin scorseseeastwood cinema 31705 - 15 october 2006filmography links and data courtesy of the internet movie database.stressful - this was how a friend of mine described the film, and i have to agree.  if you expect to sit back, relax, and enjoy watching the departed, i'm telling you now - it won't happen.  you don't really watch this movie as much as you get lost in the narrative.  if you've ever injured your hand, you may, at some point, wince in pain.  at the very least, partly due to the length of the movie, you will fidget in your seat.  you could find yourself cursing as much as the characters onscreen.  you will definitely gasp, and you could very well laugh out loud.  the one thing you will not do, at least not for very long, is relax.  if you want to relax, go get a massage, grab a beer, sleep, or basically do anything but watch the departed.  on the other hand, if you want to forget where you are and get lost for a few hours, if you want to get caught in a gripping narrative, and if you don't mind getting a bit stressed out in the process, grab yourself a ticket.  i did it - and i wouldn't mind doing it again.

    imaginary friend   originally uploaded by driver ng bayan. i'm flying down south early tomorrow morning - i'll be there until wednesday or thursday.  it'll be a blast, i'm sure, but i have a slight problem.  i've still got some business to take care of here in manila.  no, it's not really urgent, but i'd still like to get it done soon.  i thought i could take care of it before i left for this trip, but things just didn't fall into place.  now it'll really just have to wait.  if there were two of me, this wouldn't be a problem.  that simply isn't the case though, and it will never be - at least not in this lifetime.  besides, i'm sure that would bring about its own set of problems.  one that comes to mind immediately is my food bill.  i spend a crazy amount of money on food as it is - some say i regularly eat for two - and that's without anybody else tagging along.  i don't earn near enough to feed two of me.  for now, the image on the right is probably the closest any of you will get to seeing my clone.  since we're already letting our imaginations fly, i've thrown in a friend of mine with a brilliant head and twinkling eyes.  i think his skin is a bit too light and that he's too thin (thinner than i am), but who am i to talk?  beauty is in the eye of the beholder - and a friend of mine has already professed her undying love for, or let's not get carried away, her crush on my friend.  anybody else care to meet him?

it's half past five in the morning.  for many people, the day is just beginning.  for some others, the start of the day is still hours away.  my day just ended.  for most people, the day ends at 5:30 in the afternoon.  you could then say that i'm 12 hours late.  then again, i'm not most people.  i'm not a pencil pusher with a day job.  i'm not a regular employee.  i'm not confined by shifts.  i'm not thinking straight.  i'm not really a morning person.  i'm not normal.  i'm not writing anything significant.  i'm not functioning properly - at least my brain isn't.  i'm in need of sleep.  i think i'll write about my day some other time.  good morning, and since i'm probably sleeping all day, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

there are so many things going on in my head now - i don't know where to start.  i have a feeling i'll lose my mind sometime in the next couple of months, but i'm also pretty sure that i'll be having a blast at the same time.  i thought i would get myself a day job again, but it looks like that won't be happening anytime soon.  compared to what i'll be doing for the next few weeks, the idea of getting behind a desk is simply - i don't know.  it's boring, unattractive, and if you'll allow me to be inarticulate for a moment, it's blah!  okay, a word just came to mind - it's bland.  in any case, i'm excited about next few weeks.  what happens after then?  i don't know.
