the everlasting slip 
   bobber tm
your old slip bobber 
   doesn't work!  this one does!









over 2 decades of esb!
welcome! i created this site in 1998 with the primary 
       pupose of marketing my great slip bobber, the esb. but, there is a 
       lot of other stuff here, too, so surf around and enjoy!
btw, as should be obvious, i'm a better fisherman than 
       webmaster, lol.











here's
        brand x







the photos at right show the damage to a brand x slip 
           bobber that i actually used during the month of may, 1998, for 
           weekend fishing on my native houghton lake, michigan. note the deep 
           cut at the bottom of the center hole on the plastic stop bead, and 
           also how the terminal end is chewed up. the line i used was my 
           personal favorite, 6 lb. test trilenetm 
           xl monofilament. the float was set at a depth of 8 to 10 feet, baited 
           with a 1/16 oz. jig. remember, this damage was caused by mono;
            can you imagine what something like firelinetm 
           would do?

why should you care about this? because using a float 
           like this will prevent 
           you from catching fish. your line will become
            snagged in the cut in the stop bead, not allowing your bait to reach 
           the depth you intend, and worse, you probably won't know it's 
           happening. the damaged surfaces of the bobber will
            damage your line, causing you to lose 
           fish through break offs. i know these things happen, because they've 
           happened to me. and, if you use slip bobbers, chances are that there 
           is at least one in your tackle box right now that looks about like this.

 the
        esb difference







that's why i invented the esb,
            the slip bobber that works better, faster, longer, every time! for 
           about the same price you're paying now for something that doesn't.

the photos at right show the esb glass stop bead and 
           brass terminal end guard. i used this actual float for 4
            months, with mono and firelinetm.
            with it, i caught walleyes, bass, bluegills, sunfish, perch, pike, 
           trout, and one 12 lb. salmon. as you can see, it's not in the least 
           damaged. and if i hadn't cut it up so i could scan it for you, it 
           would work as well tomorrow as it did the day i made it.

yes, it is a simple idea, but it produces the most 
           reliable and fastest slip bobber in the world. this is not about 
           having to plunk down a few bucks every couple weeks for new slip 
           bobbers - it's about whether you can trust a simple piece of fishing 
           tackle to do what it's supposed to do.

how much is your fishing time worth?

if you ever 
           use slip floats, you owe it to yourself to click through the links 
           below.  because if you're not using an esb, 
           you might not really be fishing.
