knapp is the first winery in the finger lakes to plant and vinify the grape variety cabernet franc.


        our story
      





recognizing the importance of wine with food, knapp opened its restaurant in 1992, becoming the very first winery restaurant on cayuga lake.

winter in the flxwinter is a beautiful time to visit the finger lakes. the tasting rooms are quieter, providing a slower and more intimate tasting experience. the lakes and trees are peacefully coated in snowy dust. wineries are releasing their annual ice wines, a truly special wine that only cold-climate areas are able to produce. we invite you to discover the winter magic on cayuga lake!
