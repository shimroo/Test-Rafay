											please tell me how to eliminate the fallen center of my sour cream pound cake. i use two loaf pans, also i am at an altitude of 5,600 ft.
									 	

baking at high altitudes
when baking at high altitudes (greater than 3000 feet above sea level), you may want to decrease the amount of baking powder and sugar used, and increase the amount of liquid and egg used. baked goods will often overinflate and collapse at high altitudes, unless the recipes are modified. there are several books available, which contain recipes appropriate for cooking and baking at high altitudes.

											what is the substitution for almond extract?
									 	

almond extract substitutions
almond extract is one of the most potent extracts in the cooking world. this is why most recipes call for a very small amount. it has a great flavor and is wonderful in certain baked goods. 
if a recipe calls for almond extract and the cook has none on hand, there are substitutions that can be made. make sure to accurately follow the substitutions or the recipe may not taste as it should. 
vanilla extract can be used in place of almond extract. try using a tad more vanilla extract than what you would have used for almond extract. 
bitter almond oil can also be used as a substitute for almond extract. most conversion charts call for 1/8 of a teaspoon of the oil to one teaspoon of extract. more can always be added if the taste isn't quite strong enough. 1/8 of a teaspoon is a good starting point. 
a person can also use an almond liqueur for an almond extract replacement. it is recommended to use four to eight times as much liqueur than extract. 
whatever a recipe may be, if it calls for almond extract and there is none available, there are plenty of choices for substitutions.
