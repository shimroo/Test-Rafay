  connecting animals in need with people who care.
  







 













fosters neededwe are in need of foster homes for both dogs and cats. as a foster-based rescue, we can only save as many animals as we have foster homes available. by offering your home and time as a foster, you allow us to save more animals in need - like the puppies on the left who made their way to cshs from an overpopulated, high-kill shelter.

ways to givefrom sending us a bag of kitten food from amazon to becoming a monthly sustainer through the circle, there are many ways to support the animals at cshs!
