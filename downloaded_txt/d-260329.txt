 displaying collectibles  



 a collection can be anything from ordinary 
                      found objects from nature to flea market finds, to genuine 
                      antiques. the flair with which you display your treasures 
                      is what makes them an elegant yet personal part of your 
                      home decor. 
an expensive crystal bowl looks great in 
                      the china cabinet but takes on a life of its own when displayed 
                      on a shelf. your mother's favorite turkey platter becomes 
                      a family heirloom when displayed on your kitchen counter 
                      or on your dinning room wall. grandma's china or limited 
                      edition collectible plate becomes an awesome reminder of 
                      the importance of family when displayed proudly at family 
                      functions. 
if you place large objects in a stage-type 
                      setting they become a focal point for your room. a stand, 
                      a hanger, a frame, or a glass display case can set your 
                      precious collectible off to it's best advantage and keep 
                      it safe at the same time. 
display toys in a children's room just like 
                      collectibles. put shelves on a wall at a level the child 
                      can reach, and group toy cars, dolls or a variety of toys 
                      on them. they're easily accessible, and when you ask your 
                      kids to put their toys away, it's not a big chore. more 
                      breakable precious objects such as collectible plates or 
                      limited edition figurines can be placed on a high shelf 
                      or hung on the walls, out of the child's reach. 
clear plastic doll cases protect dolls, 
                      used for display only, from dust while still allowing them 
                      to be viewed from every angle. favorite hero figurines can 
                      be stored under glass domes on shelves, so that a light 
                      feather duster can be used to keep them clean. souvenir 
                      baseballs and other sports memorabilia can be displayed 
                      in glass cases to show their importance and protect them 
                      from being handled. 
children are natural collectors, they collect 
                      shells, that can be displayed in glass vases or jars, they 
                      collect baseball cards that can be displayed in a frame, 
                      they collect jewelry that can be displayed on small ornament 
                      trees or stands, they collect coins that can be displayed 
                      in a frame on the wall. no matter what they collect, you 
                      can find a creative way to display their collectibles as 
                      decor in their room. 
 when your collections are proudly displayed, 
                      visitors will want to know how you came to collect them 
                      and why they are important to you, so make sure they are 
                      set off prominently to show their importance. 
no matter how you display your treasures, 
                      they tell a story about you.
