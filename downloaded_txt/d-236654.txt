(it's also perfect           for those couples trying to decide whether marriage is right for them.           deciding whether to get or stay engaged?           click here.)   every couple           hopes that they'll live happily ever after. only one in four actually           will. what makes the difference? is it love? is it luck? did you know           that most affairs and divorces occur during the years just after the           wedding? that living together before the wedding does not increase marriage           success? that marriage satisfaction can plummet when children are born.           without the kind of preparation provided by mst, the transition from           the romance of the wedding to married life can be much more challenging           than most couples expect.    marriage preparation           programs that teach specific skills cut the divorce rate by more than           thirty percent. not all marriage prep is the same, though. premarital           counseling usually is not sufficiently comprehensive. it won't teach           you practical strategies to keep your romance vital over the years.           most couples wait until their relationship is stressed before addressing           these issues. proactive, intentional preparation is much less costly           and so much more effective. planning a wonderful wedding is great, but           investing just a little in the success of your marriage is at least           as important.   let mst help           you build a resilient marriage right from the start.  youll learn           to enhance your strengths, build skills, deepen your intimacy and plan           long-term strategies to address challenges.  youll experience           the benefits of the mst approach immediately during the seminar and           more importantly, youll be planting the seeds for future growth.   what           is mst?    • a small, one-day,             religion-neutral seminar, designed to help couples achieve their marriage             goals (and to help those couples trying to decide             whether marriage is right for them).
