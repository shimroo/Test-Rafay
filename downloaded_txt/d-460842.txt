exercise tips
when it comes to exercise, we've been there, done that, now serving 412 tips in 20 categories ranging from aerobic exercise to workout.











pregnant? stay fit and fabulous!
first, check with your doctor and make sure it is safe for you to exercise. all clear for pregnant exercise? let us help you make it great!
keep doing what you love
with simple speed or weight modifications, any exercise you already love can remain your exercise of choice during your pregnancy. if you were a fan of cardio classes, check your gym to see if they have classes just for pregnant women. look online for a local group of women who are pregnant and running or moms who run. if you cannot find one, ask at your local gym. you could make new friends that last beyond your pregnancy.
you can change it up
if you feel your balance is not so great with your growing baby bump, or if you just feel like a change, explore the freeweights. tone muscles will make all the lifting, walking, picking up, and bathing of your new baby easier.
consider yoga. you could get a dvd to try it at home or find a local center. yoga also has pregnancy-focused classes. yoga is great for balance. also, the deep breathing and focus on calm are things you can bring with you to the delivery room.
it’s all about you (and baby)
when you are at the gym only focus on your performance. if you are working out at home, don’t try and keep up with the people on your television. listen to your body. modify exercises as much as you need to. do not exercise with intensity that goes beyond your body’s comfort level. you are exercising for two and need to stay safe.

ya gotta move it if ya wanna lose it!
 weight. it's a topic that most women have on their minds frequently. whether it's the occasional thought or a potential obsession, we've all wanted to lose a few pounds before a big event or get into some clothing that we used to be able to wear "back in the day." some people love working out and don't have a problem losing weight, but for the rest of us who need a little motivation, here are a few quotes that should inspire you to get up and moving! 
 dear fat, this relationship isn't working out. it's time that you left. i'll be happier without you.  your stomach shouldn't be a waste basket   if you talked to your friends the way you talk to your body, you'd have no friends left   be stronger than your excuses   that's not sweat on your face, it's fat crying   you have a choice. you can throw in the towel, or use it to wipe the sweat off your face   you will never find time for anything, if you want time, you must make it   if you're tired of starting over, stop giving up   no matter how slow you go, you are still lapping everyone on the couch   there is no one giant step that does it, it's a lot of little steps that does it - peter a. cohen   motivation is what gets you started, habit is what keeps you going - jim ryun   it is a shame for a woman to grow old without ever seeing the strength and beauty her body is capable of - socrates

10 jokes about exercise
 the advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier. 
 the trouble with jogging is that, by the time you realize you’re not in shape for it, its too far to walk back.- franklin p. jones 
 i used to jog but the ice cubes kept falling out of my glass.- david lee roth 
 i don't exercise. if god had wanted me to bend over, he would have put diamonds on the floor.- joan rivers 
 i forgot to post on facebook that i was going to the gym…now this whole work-out was a waste of time. 
 does running late count as exercise? 
 i'm on a strict running program. i started yesterday. i've only missed one day so far. 
 i get a lot of mental exercise by thinking up weird ways to avoid physical exercise. 
 i have a new incentive to do sit-ups. i put m&m's between my toes. 
 i’m not into working out. my philosophy is no pain, no pain.- carol leifer

get the most from attending health expos
many of the top health expos happen in the us. don't attend without a plan, but instead be intentional about the way you experience the expo as that will enable you to get the most out of it. determine ahead of time how you want your experience to go and what you want to get out of it.
come to learn from amazing speakers
come to hear from the leading experts in psychology, nutrition and fitness that come from all over to give presentations at these events. while there are many activies going on at these expos, the key speakers are by far enough to justify going, even if listening to them was all that you did. there will be many eye-opening talks and presentations given from leading health experts.
come to network
maybe you can hear these speakers online through podcasts or videos. maybe the value for you in a health expo is from the rich source of connections it provides for you to network with similar and like-minded individuals who value health and are seeking the best practices like you are. build alliances with others in the field with whom you can share valuable input and glean insider knowledge. by wideinging your reach and your base, you are extending your network and increasing your presence in the industry.
attend online
aren't able to get out of the house or leave the neighborhood? don't worry. maybe of those who can't manage to free themselves from their current location can still find the option to participate through online videos. most expos encouage and promote that workers use virtual cofrence $ expos. this way you can avoid the costs of traveling and will be able to devote your time to your calling.

											what should i consider when hiring a personal trainer?
									 	

finding a personal trainer
hiring a personal trainer is sometimes unpredictable. just as you would do research and ask questions about your doctor, the same precautions should be done before hiring a personal trainer. when you ask for a personal trainer at your local gym or health club, be sure to investigate which will be most compatible with your goals and personality. instead of training with whichever trainer the front desk assigns you, ask about each trainer's specialties and read his or her bio before you commit to any one trainer. perhaps the most paramount step to take before hiring a trainer is to make sure they are qualified. some gyms give their trainers an in-house certification but do not require a nationally recognized accreditation. regardless of the trainer you choose, ensure they are certified by a national organization and are cpr/aed certified.
