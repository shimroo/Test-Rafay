  the 2025 catholic ministries annual appeal has begun!
 as the diocese of joliet launches the 2025 catholic ministries annual appeal (cmaa), we are humbly asking all parishioners to pledge their support for this important effort, as together we can make a profound difference.  this year’s cmaa theme is
open your heart to god’s goodness. through our support, we ensure that the mission and ministries of christ’s church are available to everyone. together, we can help provide safe shelter for the homeless, feed the physical and social needs of those who are hungry, inspire those discerning a life of vocation, and aid in the education of our next generation of catholics. our parish could not accomplish all of this on its own.  as a diocese working together, we can do so much more. our parish goal for the 2025 cmaa is $73,500, and 70% of any amount we raise over our goal will be returned to us and used fruitfully within our own parish. please review the materials you receive in the mail from the diocese of joliet this month and prayerfully reflect on your gift to this year’s annual appeal. if you do not receive a cmaa mailing, please contact the parish office. thank you!

  cathedral windows ~ the sacred story
 for as many times as you have proclaimed the apostles creed, have you ever wondered which scripture stories connect to each article? when you last looked closely at our cathedral windows, what details stood out for you? what bible stories did you recognize in the medallions?  there is life in our cathedral windows; life that is calling to us. how do we begin to discover the treasures? we patiently practice lectio divina (divine reading) and visio divina (divine seeing). these prayer forms can help us recognize god's indwelling presence; god's desire for us to know him intimately;    

pray with the cathedral windows

 st. raymond school offers a rigorous learning experience that develops the whole child – academically, socially, emotionally, physically and spiritually – through high expectations for academics and character, a supportive and loving community, and a focus on faith that prepares our students to make the world a better place.at st. raymond school, we are very proud of our teachers and staff, not only for how they work every day to ensure our students are learning and growing into their best selves, but also for how they model this learning by pushing themselves to grow as well. when you choose st. raymond for your family, you are choosing to be part of a community – a community that includes engaged and dedicated parents who partner with the school in the education of their children. st. raymond parents believe in our mission and want the best for their children, so volunteering at school comes naturally. st. raymond does not keep parents at a distance; rather, parents are invited and encouraged to share their time, their talent and their treasure to make st. ray’s the amazing place that it is. and we really couldn’t do it without them!
