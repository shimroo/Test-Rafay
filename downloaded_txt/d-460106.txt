it was the greatest war in american history.
over 3 million americans fought each other- 630,000 became casualties.          
it was the only war fought on american soil by americans, and 
          for that reason we have always been fascinated with the civil war. 
          hundreds of books, movies and documentaries have (and are) being created 
          about this tragic event in our history. with the internet, we now have 
          yet another tool to (carefully) study every single event in this great 
          period of american history.
