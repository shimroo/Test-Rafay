                these 
                guidelines. communicating on a message board is different 
                from face-to-face communication. only the words are seen, not 
                your facial expressions or tone of voice. please pay careful attention 
                to how you use your words. don't attack individuals. personal 
                attacks, flames on individuals, or vulgar language may result 
                in warning, suspension or loss of membership. we urge each individual 
                to respect common rules of decency.

                fftoday.com reserves the right to remove a post which does not 
                relate to the topic being discussed in the folder or on a specific 
                message board. in addition, fftoday.com reserves the right to 
                organize topical boards in order to best serve the majority of 
                visitors.
