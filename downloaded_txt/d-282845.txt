"portlandia brass ensemble was thrilled to collaborate with oregon chorale twice in one season! first by coincidence on a movie set, and then by intention at christmas with the chorale. your superb music-making, professionalism, creativity and repertoire made these events a joy for all. cheers on 40 years!" 
— andy taylor & the portlandia brass ensemble






"dynamics, blending, and expression of the compositions were truly a gift to us!"
— concert attendee






"the portland nordic chorus had a wonderful time collaborating with the oregon chorale. they were curious but exacting in their work with pieces in the nordic languages. the concert was filled with exuberant music sung by enthusiastic choristers led by their dynamic director.  exceptional music performed by a joyful ensemble."
— the portland nordic chorus
