the math is simple your mortgage payment minus the rents you collect and the cost of ownership equals the amount you must pay to live in your home. in some cases this number may be greater than your monthly mortgage payment and expenses, leaving you with a modest to possibly more than modest profit.every opportunity is different, depending on your financial situation and the area of the country, state, county, or town city where you would like to live. our team will work to help pre-qualify you for a va mortgage and then work with you to find the property and mortgage that will help you towards your financial goals. above are just a few examples of the types of properties that would work.
