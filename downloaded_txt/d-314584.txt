isea is...
two sister non-profit organizations - the illinois solar energy & storage association and the illinois solar education association - that promote the widespread application of solar and other forms of renewable energy through our mission of advocacy and education.
founded in 1975, incorporated in 1979 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit under the name northern illinois solar association, and finally reorganized in 1980 as the illinois solar energy association, the organization was focused on public education for the majority of its history. in the last decade, isea expanded its efforts to include working to ensure stable policies and regulations for solar development in illinois. in order to do this work, isea founded its sister 501(c)(6) nonprofit trade organization. together, the two organizations represent 500+ business and individual members.isea is the state resource for renewable energy-related policy developments, educational classes, events, and access to local renewable energy businesses.the education association is a chapter of ases, a 501(c)(3) non-profit that advocates for sustainable living and 100% renewable energy by sharing information, events, and resources to cultivate community and power progress.
