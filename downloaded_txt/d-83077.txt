who we are






adopt a golden atlanta is a non-profit, volunteer organization dedicated to finding warm, loving homes for golden retrievers to keep them from becoming strays or adding to the shelter population. to date we have rescued over 4,500 dogs at a cost of over $2,200 per dog. we do not reject any golden, no matter their medical or behavioral needs and work tirelessly to find that perfect fit with a "furever family".
