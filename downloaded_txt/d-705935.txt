our passion

              improving the quality of life for people and their pets at home,
              across the nation, and around the world
            

              improving the quality of life for people and their pets -
              it's what we do. it's who we are. we make supplements
              that promote joint health, digestive health, and overall wellness.
              but we are more than our products, we are servant leaders,
              community enrichers, youth supporters, and pet lovers.

our standard

              exceeding the standards
            

              our quality process includes rigorous testing at every stage of
              the manufacturing process. we test incoming raw materials before
              production, take samples during production, and the finished
              product undergoes chemistry and microbiology analysis before it is
              released for sale.
