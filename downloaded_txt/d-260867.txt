choosing 

              the right music for your wedding - by eugene portman



i 

              suppose a typical wedding can be divided into 4 main sections and 

              these are: the ceremony pre-meal drinks wedding breakfast evening 

              reception i suppose about half of the weddings i come across have 

              the ceremony in a church so this means that if they do require me 

              to provide live music; it will be during the drinks before the meal 

              and the wedding breakfast. everyone's requirements are different 

              so don't be afraid to discuss any special requirements with whoever 

              your hiring. as far as the choice of specific pieces of music is 

              concerned - the only part of the wedding that you really have to 

              think about is the wedding ceremony. read
