it's the midpoint between the winter solstice and spring equinox and marked by the christian festival of candlemas. german settlers in the 1800s believed that a sunny candlemas predicted 40 more days of cold and snow. old european folklore, believed that ‚Äú...a badger or sacred bear...‚Äù prognosticates the weather. those german settlers chose a groundhog instead. 

this year, punxsutawney phil, the famous groundhog of pennsylvania, did see his shadow this year, so predicted 6 more weeks of winter, but our more local chuckles the groundhog in manchester disagrees and said we will have an early spring. which woodchuck do you believe? what do the groundhogs at @n@northwestparkct say?11view on facebook
