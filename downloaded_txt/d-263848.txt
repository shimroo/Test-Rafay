       our students' reviews




       
  ★★★★★
i took the real estate broker license classes online. online classes are not purely online, each class is mixed with online students and present students. the instructor is dave. if you attend all classes and pay attention, it will be easier to pass the state broker exam, because the instructor goes in detail with clases and personal working experience, which i feel, it helps more when instructor has long time experience in this bussines. state exams questions can be a bit tricky rather than difficult. in multiple answers to a question, you may have 8 answers and 3 or 4 can be right, but we have to pick the one which makes most sense, and that's the hardest part. i took the state exam from home, because i had to travel abroad and couldn't find a sooner on site appt. to take the test. i passed on my first try. this school /instructor worked for me. hope it works for you as well. good luck!miriam r.

i don’t know who christine donahue but god bless you for being a great professor and trying your best! i wanted to leave a review to show how grateful i am for a teacher like elizabeth ulrich. she is by far the most amazing instructor i’ve had in my entire life. she taught her class very well and expressed how it is important for us to pay attention to be successful over and over again when we wouldn’t pay attention. she showed she not only wanted to teach us but wanted us to pass for our own good. i felt like her respectable child she is amazing. god bless the american school of business. the staff are amazing as well, the front desk is always cheerful and attentive , and the facility is very clean and peacefulkimberly m.

i've had the pleasure to take a property and casualty insurance class at asb with instructor steve that ends this thursday (6/25/2020)... he is the best! he is succinct with his definitions and gives us what to expect for the exam and truly wants us to do well. it's an awesome program and you get a good amount of content, study materials and time to take the school exam. i highly recommend this program to anyone looking to get into insurance or just plain old business. a++!mark f.
