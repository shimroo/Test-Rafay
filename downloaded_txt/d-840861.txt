swimming with wild dolphins
experience your dream holiday in the red sea, egypt – dolphins, sea turtles and stunning coral reefs teeming with marine life!
 
all inclusive eco village resort holiday
all accommodation, meals, transfers, dolphin activity and services of our guide are included.
prices start from £875 per person 
swimming with dolphins in their natural environment is a truly unforgettable experience. with dolphin swims, you will interact with these playful and curious mammals in a safe, responsible and ecologically sensitive way.  to participate you need to be able to swim and have an average level of fitness to get on and off boats into the water. life jackets are provided.

we offer our all inclusive dolphin swimming holidays from our beautiful eco-village resort on egypt’s stunning red sea 2.5 hours south of hurghada (near marsa alam).
our holiday includes 7 nights accommodation, all meals, 3 day boat trips to the marine park reserve to swim with the wild dolphins and unlimited snorkelling around the pristine coral reef at the resort beach.
 from the resort, you can take day trips out to a marine park reserve. this offshore reef is situated one hour away from the eco-village resort holiday with day trips to swim with these wild dolphins and snorkel in the magnificent coral reefs where the boat moors up for the day. there are strict guidelines in place as this is a popular area for divers and snorkelers from the resorts along this bit of coastline.

 
 
 
 
we visit protected calm reefs where the dolphins spend the daytime after hunting at night in the open sea.

we are passionate about responsible tourism and preserving this beautiful area of the red sea. we follow strict guidelines so as not to negatively impact the dolphins’ natural behaviour and habitat, and only work with experienced local guides. our all inclusive eco-resort is far away from the mass tourist sites in egypt and we are committed to developing sustainable tourism in the area. 

for more information about our trips, please see our dolphin swim holidays  page, and take a look at the different accommodation options.

if you haven’t swum with dolphins or booked a holiday with us before, you may have a whole range of questions. we have been running dolphin swimming holidays in the red sea for over 15 years and can advise you on everything you need to know. our guests come primarily as snorkelers and are looked after by our snorkelling guides.  if you wish to dive there are many opportunities at this padi dive training centre.
if you have any general questions, check out our faq section to find out more.

*****************************************
“finding ourselves dreaming of the wonderful holiday we spent at marsa shagra in february 2020. sadly it was cut a little short by the corvid 19 lock down. however it certainly did not stop us from enjoying a truly unforgettable holiday. we are still dreaming of it and will return as soon as possible to relive our time there. staying in a cozy little bungalow in walking distance of a delightful restaurant serving the most mouth watering food freshly prepared vegetables a gourmet delight. we had the added bonus of swimming with wild dolphins over a coral reef in warm inviting water. this  certainly was the highlight of our stay —-an unforgettable experience and guided by khaled an experienced warm hearted man they call the dolphin man”.
with love and joy suzette and jack
