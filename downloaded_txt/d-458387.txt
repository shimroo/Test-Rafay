video introduction to personal best spelling



features of personal best spelling®
personal best spelling® is a windows program consisting of three spelling modules, so you
              can learn new words, test your spelling and correct bad spelling
              habits. widely used by adult learners, children, homeschoolers, teachers and other professionals, it is an affordable windows software program and is also available
              as a self contained, multiple-user, re-usable, printable spelling tutor that is just as effective as the software version.



module 1. learn to spell new words

this helps you learn new words quickly so that you remember them
                better. it uses a modified form of the widely used and recommended
                method of learning spelling called look say cover write check.
                practice or drill is built into the program in a special way to
                improve your learning and memory.
you can create your own word lists, use the inbuilt lists or use
                a wide range of ready-made special purpose word lists that you can
                download from this web site. ready-made word lists include lists
                of commonly misspelled words, words that cause special difficulty
                to adult learners and other useful lists.
you can learn sentence structure using the special contextual
                learning feature that allows you to enter more than just one word
                at a time. foreign language learning is also possible using this
                feature because you can learn words in their proper context.
you can also learn specialised occupational vocabularies using optional word lists - medical, police.
hundreds of editable word lists in both u.s. english and
                u.k./oz english are available at a modest cost, plus you can
                create and edit your own lists

module 2. test your spelling

you can test your spelling of previously learned words. a special
                feature is that the program remembers any errors you make.
if the
                error is  consistent , i.e., you spell it incorrectly in
                the same way, the program recognises that you have
                developed a learned error and it automatically saves these errors
                in a separate word list for special treatment and correction.

module 3.  correct bad spelling habits

personal best spelling® uses a new learning method called old way/new wayâ®.
                with old way/new wayâ® you can correct persistent,
                learned and habitual errors. you can also, once and for all, learn
                to spell those tricky words that you are uncertain about and often
                have to look up.
old way/new wayâ® is a new user-friendly and very
                effective method for changing incorrect learning to the correct
                version and for eliminating uncertainty.
personal best spelling® is especially licensed to use old way/new
                wayâ®. the learning advantages that old way/new wayâ® gives you and its other special benefits are all described and
                explained in this web site.

user feedback
personal best spelling® transformed many poor spellers,adults as well as children, into
                proficient, confident spellers when all other methods failed. it is a genuine learning tool for spelling, not just another
      computer game dressed up as educational software.
adult learners' comments
"it's like a teacher i never had."

"i left school at 15 not knowing how to spell simple words like
            'any', 'there', 'their', 'dancing', 'colour', 'become',
            'because', 'believe', 'open', 'once', 'days of the week or
			  month.'"





since iâve been working with personal best spelling® improvement in my spelling has been unbelievable. at 47 years
                  old i thought i was just thick as two planks. not the case. i
                  have a learning brain and i am enjoying it. it's like a teacher
                  i never had."

"jonathan immediately experienced success.""

"many tutors working in adult literacy programmes are often
      faced with learners who are showing limited progress despite
      everyone's best efforts .... in many cases, despite years of
      learning and the exposure to a variety of different tutors,
      discouragement slowly begins to pervade the effort, as nothing
		appears to work.





this was the case of jonathan, a mature
            learner in galway when frank monaghan, a literacy organiser in
            galway, ireland, introduced him to the old way/new wayâ® technique. following a few brief workshops with jonathan he was
            immediately experiencing success and able to self-correct.
            jonathan is now able to remember the spelling of words months
            after being learned, which previously would have been forgotten
            in hours. more importantly it shifts the locus of control to
            himself so that with very little help from a tutor he can work
            on his own spellings allowing him to focus on writing poetry
            which he enjoys so much. it is with a degree of pleasure that
            frank, through the evidence of the learner jonathan, recommends
            the old way/new wayâ® system to other literacy
            programmes."

"i would recommend the program highly" (department of education)

in 1985 the commonwealth department of education employed the
    services of personal best academy on behalf of several aboriginal
    students. in a letter of referral dated february 5, 1986, the
    education officer reported that, 





"most of the cases were with secondary level students where the
          intervention techniques with english and mathematics problems
          proved most beneficial to all the students. further to this, the
          techniques proved remarkable in the case of a young adult who
          had previously been struggling to hold a position in the public
          service. this young person has now assumed increasingly more
          difficult and complicated tasks and aspires to permanent
          employment and promotion. i would recommend the programme highly
          on the results i have seen in only one year."

comments from children and their parents
"lincoln gets ten out of ten every week." 

"prior to lincoln starting to use personal best spelling® he was getting, on average, only two out of ten words right in his weekly spelling test at school.





within one week of using personal best spelling®, lincoln got ten out of ten in his weekly spelling test
                         and he has continued to get ten out of ten, each and every week."

"so much less stressful for teachers." 

"the greatest thing about old way/new wayâ® is the
      self-correction children do. it's such an amazing thing to say to
      a kid, 'can you see any old ways? ... now, can you do the new way
      for me?' and then they select their old way and do the new way all
      by themselves without me doing a thing except ask those two
		questions.





old way/new wayâ® is so much less stressful
            for teachers. i no longer get frustrated when some children have
            so many errors to correct. the notion of a 'dumb child' disappears
            and instead you know that they simply have more resistant old
            ways."

personal best spelling® reviews
the school teachers, parents, adult literacy teachers, learning
              support tutors, and their students in these spelling
                program case studies tried many different spelling programs,
              mnemonics, and other spelling aids, including catch-up classes or
      personal tutoring, before they tried personal best spelling®. using these conventional, and some not so conventional, methods
              of teaching spelling they found that children and adult learners
      still forgot the words they had learned from one day to the next. personal best spelling® changed all this.



learners who used personal best spelling® actually improved on spelling tests immediately after they
                    started using the program; their vocabulary increased; they
                    actually remembered the words they had learned the day , week or
                    month before; their self confidence improved; their teacher's
                    assessment of their learning ability changed and their outlook on
                    learning became a lot more optimistic. this was empowering for
                    both teachers and students.

 ".... [personal best spelling®] takes a no nonsense approach to the
                    teaching of spelling... this is not a game dressed up as

                    this article describes how old way/new wayâ® is used to
                    improve spelling.
zdnet software library review, 17 december 1998 (version 1; old
                    name for the program)
personal best speller received a four star rating and was
                    the editor's pick. 

"learn new words and correct problem spelling with personal best spelling®. using an innovative and progressive method, this
                      program encourages you to say the word, asks you to type it
                      several times and tracks your problem areas. three modules
                      include learning new words, testing and correcting problems or
                      habitual errors. the error correction uses a psychological
                      approach by having you analyze what it is that you do wrong and
                      repeatedly spell it the wrong way and then the correct way.
                      you're asked to state what you've been doing wrong, typing in
                      this statement and then correcting the spelling several times.
                      two word lists are available to work with in the demo version
                      and registered users will be able to input their own lists.
                      personal best spelling® requires dedication and time, but its
                      effective methods are sure to improve your spelling."

please note the following details about these lists: 

 lists are zipped text files (ascii dos text) contained in a
                              compressed (zipped) file, take up very little disk space on your
                              computer, will download quickly and are accompanied by a brief
                              description. 
lists are only available in u.s. english, at this time.
                              however, lists can easily be edited within the program to suit
                              your own spelling conventions.
these lists are provided "as is" and, apart from being updated
                              from time to time, there is no further support provided for
                              these lists.
new lists become available, from time to time. 

words follow the u.s. spelling convention but can be
                            edited to conform to other spelling conventions. intending users
                            should check that the terms are suitable for use within their own
                            medical practice. 
medical terms are sorted into approximately 600 separate word
                            lists covering the following medical fields, among others:

medical word lists are organised alphabetically within each
                            medical specialty. words are listed alphabetically within each
                            word list. 
medical terminology "demons", those terms that typically cause
                            spelling problems, are also covered in 65 lists.
you can fully edit word listsâadd new terms, delete outdated
                            terms and alter the spelling of any word in the list to suit your
                            own spelling conventions.
you can even create your own word lists and include only those
                            words that you habitually misspell or always have to look up. this is the best way to use the spelling
                            program. 
learning professional vocabulary terms
as useful as the available word lists are, they cannot hope to cover all
                            the words you might want or need to learn. 
therefore, the spelling program lets you create your own word
                            lists. this can be done either within the program itself or by
                            using a text editor or word processor and then importing the list.
                            instructions are contained within the program and here.
you can fully edit word listsâadd new terms, delete outdated
                            terms and alter the spelling of any word in the list to suit your
                            own spelling conventions. in fact, you are encouraged to edit the
                            lists in order to make them more suitable for your own use. 
you can create your own word lists that include only those words
                            that you habitually misspell or always have to look up in a
                            dictionary. 
back to top
word lists can contain different kinds of entries all mixed
                            together. a word list can contain entries that consist of one
                            word, e.g., enucleated, or an entry can be a medical term that
                            consists of multiple words, e.g., arcus senilis. an entry can also
                            consist of an abbreviation along with its expanded form, e.g., cis
                            (carcinoma in situ).
this flexibility in creating your own word lists is also useful
                            when learning a foreign language that may require word list
                            entries to contain multiple words, e.g., billet-doux. 
basically, you can enter whatever you like into a word list. the
                            important thing to note, though, is that when the program asks you
                            to spell (type) the word you must type it from memory exactly as it was first entered, including any spaces, brackets, hyphens,
                            punctuation marks, and so on.
if what you type does not mirror exactly what was
                            originally entered then it will register an error and you will be
                            asked to re-enter the item. for this reason, you may wish to edit
                            some of the entries in the word lists prior to use, in order to
                            make each entry more suitable for your own preferences.
back to top
here are three examples of different ways you can use the word
                            lists that you create.

 you have received a list of new words that you have to learn.
                              create a word list containing these words using the spelling
                              program and then use the learn new words section of the program
                              to learn the words in the word list. 
important - keep your word lists short, say no more
                              than 5 words in a list, especially when using the program for
                              the first time. far better to have two lists each containing 5
                              words than one list with 10 words. why? the program takes time to walk you through each word list
                              and if the list is long then the whole process imay be too
                              lengthy and demanding. as well, the program won't let you stop
                              half way through a list and then pick up from where you left off
                              when you restart the program next time; it makes you start all
                              over again from the beginning of a word list. 
you should work through all the words in a word list
                              in one sitting. that is no problem if your word list is short
                              but it can become somewhat strenuous if your word list is long. 
you may find that some of the word lists that are supplied with
                              the program are simply too long to learn in one session. this
                              problem can be overcome by splitting the word list into two or
                              more shorter lists. this can be done within the program or by
                              using a word processor or text editor such as notepad or
                              wordpad. word lists must be saved as a "text" file with a .txt
                              extension.
 you have some words that you are unsure how to spell and you
                              always have to look up the spelling. create one or more word
                              lists containing these words and then use the correct words
                              section of the program to learn how to spell and remember these
                              words, once and for all. 
 you have learnt some new words using the learn words section
                              of the program and now want to practice those words and test
                              yourself. use the test spelling section of the program to do
                              this. it will improve your memory for spelling and provide the
                              necessary practice.
of course, the best way to practice your spelling is to use the
                              new words that you have learned in your day-to-day writing.
                              remember, if you don't use it; you lose it!

professional vocabulary version
personal best spelling® is three spelling programs in one, so you
    can learn new words, test your spelling and correct bad spelling
    habits.



1. professional spellingâlearn new words
this helps you learn new words quickly so that you remember them
          better. it uses an advanced form of the widely used and recommended
          method of learning spelling called look say cover write check.
          practice or drill is built into the program in a special way to
          improve your learning and memory.
you can create your own word lists and use a wide range of
          ready-made professional word lists that you can download for a
          small price. 
you can learn sentence structure using the special contextual
          learning feature that allows you to enter more than just one word
          at a time. foreign language learning is also possible using this
          feature because you can learn words in their proper context. 
back to top
2. professional spellingâspell tester
you can test your spelling of previously learned words. a special
          feature is that the program remembers any persistent errors you
          make. if the error is  consistent , i.e., you spell it
          incorrectly in the same way, the program recognises that
          you have developed a learned error and it automatically saves
          these errors in a separate word list for special treatment and
          correction.
3. professional spellingâquickly correct bad spelling habits
the program uses a new learning method called old way/new wayâ®.
          with old way/new wayâ® you can correct persistent,
          learned and habitual errors. you can also, once and for all, learn
          to spell those tricky words that you are uncertain about and often
          have to look up. 
homonyms, words like "their" and "there", that sound the same but
          have different meanings, often create confusion but this can be
          readily resolved by placing the word in context when using old
          way/new wayâ®
old way/new wayâ® is a new user-friendly and truly
          effective method for changing incorrect learning to the correct
          version and for eliminating uncertainty.
personal best spelling® is especially licensed to use old way/new
          wayâ®. the learning advantages that old way/new wayâ® gives you and its other special benefits are all described and
          explained in this web site.

pedagogy—proof of concept
have you noticed whenever children and adults misspell a word
                      they usually spell it in the same wrong way? consistency in errors indicates
                      they have learned to spell it incorrectly. they now have a "learned
      error" or a habit error that, like all bad habits, dies hard. persistent spelling errors are habit pattern errors.
 many spelling errors are not random or careless but
                  under error analysis appear to follow a pattern - they are
                  consistent, systematic errors that through repetition, i.e.,
                  practice, have become learned, habitual and extremely resistant to
                  correction. learned habitual spelling errors, like all habit patterns, are
                  produced automatically without conscious control and are for the
                  most part no longer self-detected or self-corrected by the
                  individual. here follows a detailed explanation of how spellng errors arise; why adult leaners and students have difficulty improving their spelling; see a demonstration of the brain mechanism that slows down or prevents improvement in spelling; and how old way/new way learning empowers individuals to take control over their own learning.
read a detailed explanation of learned errors, including spelling errors.

spelling program download links for windows
program download instructions (windows pc)
downloads are unregistered, feature-limited trial versions. that
                is, you can see everything that the program can do by trying it
                out with some sample word lists that are included. 
however, until you purchase a licence key and register the
                program you will not be able to create or save your own word
                lists, nor use the many word lists that are
                available.



here are the demo program download links:

the personal best spelling program does not come with word lists
        but you can purchase word lists for a small extra fee. once
        registered, you can purchase hundreds of editable word lists (the
        unregistered trial or demo version only comes with two word
        lists). you can also create your own word lists and this is the
        recommended way to use the program to improve spelling.

about us
personal best academy has developed a fresh approach to improving learning and transfer of learning; eradicating bad or unsafe habits; accelerating transition and conversion training; and correcting technique faults, misconceptions and other persistent errors.



we maintain that the main reason why even motivated people have difficulty changing their skilled performance, behaviour, thoughts and beliefs is because they are the prisoners of habit.
emerging research in cognitive psychology indicates that learned habit patterns influence and direct most of what we think and do, every day of our lives. this includes our performance in sport or at work, our conceptual framework including any misconceptions; our ability to learn; how we interact with others; and the thoughts and beliefs that guide our daily lives. all these learned behaviours, whether right or wrong, safe or unsafe, suitable or unsuitable, effective or ineffective, well adjusted or maladjusted, are under the powerful influence of habit forces.
habit patterns automatically develop during practice, i.e, repeated conscious recall of a thought, word or deed. practicing recall quickly lays down neural networks in the brain that, when the same situation arises next time, are triggered automatically so that we can respond instinctively and appropriately, doing exactly what we learned or trained to do. the brain is built to work this efficient way; to easily and automatically develop habit patterns.
back to top
habit patterns are useful because they require less mental energy than conscious thought. the brain finds it more efficient to work this way. good habits, developed from conscious practice and effort, help us function better during our daily lives.
as long as those good habits are suitable reactions to what we encounter, they remain beneficial. but when circumstances change and a different response is required to a familiar situation, that habit previously developed can be a real handicap.
as we all know from bitter experience, habit patterns are notoriously hard to change. old habits die hard. anyone who tries to change an established routine soon comes up against a powerful mental resistance which interferes, slows down, and sometimes even disables the desired change and improvement in performance and behaviour. the better someone has practiced, learned and therefore habituated the thought, performance or behaviour; the harder it is to change.
currently available coaching, teaching, training and therapeutic methods can be very effective when dealing with a blank slate, i.e., when the person has no prior experience or training and no preconceptions that might get in the way of correct performance. however, coaching, teaching, training and therapeutic methods find it very difficult to deal with maladaptive habit patterns and learned errors.
eventually, after much time and effort, change does come and the person improves but there is a typically extended period of adaptation during which coaching, teaching, training and therapeutic efforts have to be re-applied. this problem is known as the transfer of learning/training/therapy problem.
back to top
the period of adaptation to change and the associated transfer problems make coaching, teaching, training and therapy less time- and cost-effective. there has to be a better way.
personal best academy uses and teaches old way/new wayâ® to help free people from the chains of habit and empower them to achieve their personal best. sports coaching protocolsâ¢ use old way/new wayâ® learning.
from the description below, we can see that old way/new wayâ® is a powerful, cost- and time-effective yet very user friendly learning method that can change habit patterns quickly and permanently. old way/new wayâ® greatly reduces the typically extended and often risky adaptation period during which people try to adjust to change.
since its inception in 1986, personal best academy has provided computer programs and training courses in old way/new wayâ® learning to individuals, groups, organisations and corporations striving to achieve their personal best.
recipients of old way/new wayâ® training include olympic athletes and coaches; players and coaches of elite and recreational sports; pilots and flight instructors; drivers and driving instructors; firearms trainees and instructors; police departments; mining machinery operators and instructors; workplace operators and supervisors; employees and managers; musicians and music teachers; dancers and teachers of dance; school, college and university students and teachers; and children and parents.

why is it more effective?





have you noticed whenever children and adults misspell a word
                      they spell it in the same wrong way? consistency in errors indicates
                      they have learned to spell it incorrectly. they now have a "learned
                      error" or a habit error that, like all bad habits, dies hard. 
many poor spellers don't have a learning disability; they have a learned disability, i.e., they have many learned errors
                      that defy correction by conventional teaching and learning
                      methods. these resistant learned errors are like unnecessary
                      baggage, and hold back their progress in learning. 
personal best spelling uses old way/new wayâ®, an
                      australian government endorsed learning method, backed by
                      australian national training authority funded research and school
                      and workplace trials. old way/new wayâ® quickly
                      overcomes learned errors and bad habits and accelerates learning. 
this computer spelling coach is not just another computer game
                      dressed up as educational software. if you are looking for
                      entertainment and multimedia then this program is not for you. but
                      if you have tried different spelling programs, mnemonics and other
                      memory aids, spelling tutors and other spelling aids including
                      catch-up classes or personal tutoring and found that you still
                      forget words you have learned from one day to the next, then this
                      program is just right for you. 
personal best spelling is a genuine teaching and learning tool
                      using learning methods that are verified by government funded and
                      university research and successful workplace trials, all of which
                      you can read and evaluate yourself on this site. the old way/new
                      wayâ® approach to spelling draws on newly emerging
                      research into the psychology of learning and explains why people
                      keep falling back to old ways under conventional, i.e., currently
                      available, methods of coaching, teaching, home tutoring, home
                      education and self teaching.





how does it work?





personal best spelling uses two proven learning methods, namely
                      look-say-cover-write-check, and old way/new wayâ®. the
                      program uses an improved version of look-say-cover-write-check.,
                      that makes this time-honoured method for learning to spell even
                      more effective. only personal best spelling is licensed to use old
                      way/new wayâ®, an australian designed learning method
                      proven in government funded research, workplace trials, and
                      university experiments. .
it is much more than just a repetitive "skill and drill" approach
                      to spelling. the program uses a special kind of practice that
                      quickly develops understanding, as well as memory for correct
                      spelling. 





does it sound out the word and then ask you to spell it?





no, there is no need for this feature. the learning methods built
                      into the program are fully adequate by themselves. the word simply
                      appears on screen for a short moment and when it disappears from
                      view. you are asked to say it and then type it from memory. then
                      you practice this sequence five more times. this works extremely
                      well without the extra complication of having the word spoken to
                      you as well. our results show that the effectiveness of the
                      learning process is not improved by hearing the word and then
                      being asked to write it, so there really is no need for this
                      feature.





which version should i buy?





both adult and children's versions use old way/new wayâ® and this is the key to the effectiveness of both versions. both
                      versions can also use all the word lists, whether for adult or
                      child learners. however, there are some minor differences between
                      the two versions that could incline a learner, whether adult or
                      child, to prefer one version over the other. 
the children's version has some small animated characters that
                      appear on some of the program's screens. most young children find
                      these entertaining without being a distraction to learning. older
                      students also find them quite attractive. however, some older
                      students may find these animations "childish", as might some
                      adults. 
this is all a matter of personal preference so it is difficult to
                      suggest what age group should use a particular version. the best
                      advice is to try the adult version for secondary or high school
                      students and use the children's version for primary or elementary
                      school students. adult learners will probably go for the adult
                      version, although there have been some notable exceptions..





what's the difference - demo vs full version?





the unregistered version is a feature-limited demo version. for
                      example, in the demo version you cannot save your own word lists,
                      nor use the extensive word lists that come with the program. you
                      have to register the program if you want to access all its
                      features. go to the about registration screen in the program, for
                      instructions on how to register. we strongly recommend that intending purchasers first
                      download and evaluate the demonstration version of the program. 
our web site also contains a detailed description of how the
                      program works, and if you still want more information then you can
                      try the paper and pencil version or the free trial download.





downloading, registering and word lists





just click on the download link on the web site, for the adult or children's version. 
the file download box appears. check the file name is correct,
                      either pbs16adu.exe (adult version) or pbs16kid.exe (child
                      version). 
in answer to the question, "would you like to open the file or
                      save it, select save - note which folder it is saved in because
                      you will have to find the file later. "download complete" should
                      show up when the download process if finished.
using windows explorer, locate the downloaded file and double
                      click on it. the winzip box appears. follow the on-screen
                      instructions.
when all the program files have been extracted, the spelling
                      program setup box should appear.
click "setup personal best spelling". accept the installation
                      folder (don't change it because when you later download and
                      install the word lists they will go into the default folder -
                      see item 9 below). click ok. 
the next message should be "you have successfully installed
                      personal best spelling."
start the program and go to the about registration screen.
                      note the installation code and email that to us using the contact
                        form. we will email you your registration code, normally
                      within 24 hours.
once registered, you can purchase and download
                      and install hundreds of word lists (the unregistered trial or
                      demo version only comes with two word lists). download the
                      compressed word list file, selecting your preferred version
                      (adult or child) and your preferred spelling rules (usa or
                      uk/oz). wordlists will unzip into the same default
                      folder as the program itself, namely c:\windows\pbs16adu (adult)
                      or c:\windows\pbs16kid (child). if you have changed the default
                      program installation folder to something else you will have to
                      transfer the word lists into the new folder.
you can also create and edit your own word lists (keep lists
                      short, say no more than 10 words). instructions are contained
                      within the program.





i've installed the demo, what now?





if you simply want to try it before purchasing it, feel free to
                      browse the program's menus and experiment with it. the
                      unregistered demo version contains three short word lists you can
                      use, to see how the program works. try all three learning
                      activities - learning new words, spell tester, and problem words.
                      then, if you decide to purchase, go to the about registration
                      screen and follow the instructions for registering the program.
                      you register by purchasing a registration code.





the screen looks funny





i've installed personal best spelling but the program
                      looks funny on the screen, and has lines running across it?
re-run setup.exe (the original setup file you downloaded and
                      unzipped). at the "welcome to personal best speller install
                      program" screen, select "change graphic driver", then select
                      "standard windows driver"





can i install on more computers?





can i install personal best spelling on more than one
                      computer, e.g., on my desktop and also on my laptop, or on my
                      children's computer as well as my own computer?
what you are purchasing is a "single user licence". this means
                      that the software can be installed on only one computer at a time.





how does the order process work?





when you complete the order form you are actually registering the
                      program, i.e., purchasing a licence key. 
you will need the installation code that the program generates
                      when you install it, in order to complete the order form. after
                      you have downloaded and installed the program, you will find the
                      installation code number on the program's registration screen. 
 when your payment is processed by paypal and we are notified, we
                      will then email you the licence key so you can enter it on the
                      registration screen and start using the full features of the
                      program. 
you should normally receive your licence key within 24 hours,
                      usually before..





how do i register the softsware?





after you have installed the program, start it up, go to the
                      about registration screen, and follow the instructions for
                      registering the program. you need to email us the installation code, so we can send you a licence key.
my program says "unregistered version", so what do i do now? 
the unregistered version is a feature-limited demo version. for
                      example, in the demo version you cannot save your own word lists,
                      nor use the extensive word lists that come with the program. you
                      have to register the program if you want to access all its
                      features. go to the about registration screen in the program, for
                      instructions on how to register





what word lists are available?





there are many word lists for both the children's and the adult
                      versions. adult word lists contain many words that cause adult
                      learners special difficulty. similarly, children's word lists
                      contain words that pose problems for children. words are
                      graded/grouped for age level and by first letter of the word, for
                      convenience. the word lists cover commonly misspelled words
                      (demons);.the most common words in children's reading; the most
                      common nouns; a core of words that people should be able to spell
                      on sight, without sounding; the most common words that cover about
                      three-quarters of children's reading. 
i've downloaded and installed personal best spelling but all
                      i've got when the programs starts are three short word lists to
                      work with. where are all those other word lists? 
your version may be unregistered. the unregistered version is a
                      feature-limited demo version. for example, in the demo version you
                      cannot save your own word lists, nor use the extensive word lists
                      that come with the program. you have to register the program if
                      you want to access all its features.
once you have purchased and downloaded your word list, unzip the file into the
                      same folder as the program is installed, namely
                      c:\windows\pbs16adu (adult version). or c:\windows\pbs16kid (child
                      version). all the lists will then become available next time you
                      start the program.





how do i use word lists and create my own lists?





the program comes with hundreds of prepared word lists. there are
                      word lists for adults and for children. these same word lists can
                      also be downloaded from the web site word lists cover a range of
                      school grade levels and adult learning levels and for convenience
                      some lists are organised into categories, e.g., nouns, or words
                      that typically cause spelling problems.
although these word lists can be useful, the best way to use the
                      spelling program is by creating your own word lists. this can be
                      done either within the program itself or by using a word
                      processor. instructions are contained within the program.
here are three examples of different ways you can use the word
                      lists that you create.

 you have received a list of new words that you have to learn.
                        create a word list containing these words using the spelling
                        program and then use the learn new words section of the program
						  to learn the words in the word list.
important - keep your word lists short, say no more than 5 words
                        in a list, especially when using the program for the first time.
                        far better to have two lists each containing 5 words than one
                        list with 10 words. 
lists should be short because the program takes time to walk you through each word list
                        and if the list is long then the whole process is too lengthy
                        and too demanding. as well, the program won't let you stop part
                        way through a list, close the program and then let you pick up
                        from where you left off when you restart the program - it makes
							you start all over again from the beginning of the word list.
therefore, you have to work through all the words in a word list
                        in one sitting. that's no problem if your word list is short but
                        it can become a problem if your word list is long. 
you may find that some of the word lists supplied with the
                        program are too long to learn in one sitting. this problem can
                        be overcome by splitting the word list into two or more shorter
                        lists. this can be done using a word processor or a text editor
                        such as notepad or wordpad in windows xp. word lists must be
                        saved as a "text" file with a .txt extension, and the filename
                        should be no more than 8 characters in length, e.g.,
                        bobwords.txt 
 you have some words that you are unsure how to spell and you
                        always have to look up the spelling. create one or more word
                        lists containing these words and then use the correct problem
                        words section of the program to learn how to spell these words,
                        once and for all. 
 you have learnt some new words using the learning new words
                        section of the program and now want to practice those words and
                        test yourself. use the spelling tester section of the program to
                        do this. it will improve your memory for spelling and give the
                        necessary practice.
of course, the best way to practice your spelling is to use the
                        new words that you learn in your day-to-day writing. remember,
                        if you don't use it; you lose it.






does the program support us and uk/oz spelling conventions?





yes. all the many words lists that come with the registered
                      version are available in both u.s. and u.k./oz spelling (see
                      previous question, above).





i need to reinstall the program





my computer crashed (or i have a new computer). how can i
                      re-install the software (or how can i get the software onto my
                      new computer)?
if you have a backup of the original program file you downloaded,
                      simply re-install that, then go to the about registration screen
                      and email us the installation code and we will issue you a new
                      registration code, provided your information matches our client
                      record. if you don't have a backup, you will have to download the
                      program again..





can more than one person use the program, and record their progress?





yes. many users can use the program on a single computer.
                      separate word lists and progress records are kept for each user.





i don't like the software, so how do i get a refund?





go to the "legals" page link on each page of our web site, where
                      you will find a statement of our refund policy. once a
                      registration code has been emailed to you, there can be no refund. so, please try the demo version which has a few words to practice on, and try before you buy.





i've submitted my online order form but haven't received my registration yet?





normally, we will process your online order form payment within
                      24 hours after we receive it. this is because when you buy from us
                      you are dealing with real people, and not with an automated
                      machine service. that means it takes a bit longer to get your
                      registration, but you get better before- and after-sales service
                      because it is personalised just for you.





i've emailed you my installation code, but haven't received my registration yet?





column
normally, we will process your request for a registration code
                      within 24 hours after we receive it. if there is a delay in this,
                      please email us for an explanation.





does the program work on all versions of windows?





it works on all versions from windows 95 and up.





does the program run on a mac?





no. a version for the mac is not available. however, there is a pencil-and-paper version that puts the learner through the same steps as the software version and is just as effective.





can i use the program to learn a foreign language?





yes. simply create your own words lists in the language you are
                      trying to learn. where the spelling of a word depends on its
                      context, you can enter more than one word for each item in the
                      word list.





can i use the program to learn a professional vocabulary?





yes. simply create your own word lists containing the terms you
                      want to learn.





you sent me the registration code, so now what i do i with it?





go to the about registration screen in the program, type in the
                      registration code, and then you can start using the full features
                      of the program.





what is your refund policy?





go to the "legals" page link on each page of our web
                      site, where you will find a statement of our refund policy
