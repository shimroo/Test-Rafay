lean manufacturing & lean operations

here you will find many articles explaining lean manufacturing and operations as well as the various elements. 
				there are	tools for analysis, downloads of excel templates and forms. 
				there are  simulations and many real-life 
				examples. 
facility planning & plant layout

facilities (land, buildings, equipment) provide the physical capability to add 
				value and create products. the most common manifestation of 
				facility planning (or lack thereof) is the plant layout. 
				an effective layout incorporates and enables the manufacturing strategy on which it is based. mr. lee has authored two books and many articles on 
				
plant layout and facility planning.   
manufacturing/operations strategy


manufacturing strategy flows from the premise that a factory design, as any engineering design, is a compromise between competing objectives and various constraints. we can 
				optimize the design for one or two objectives (such as cost, quality, delivery, new products) but not all. manufacturing strategy starts in marketing. it asks questions such as:



how do we intend to compete? or...
why do customers buy from us instead of the competitors?


the answers lead to  "key manufacturing task(s)." 
				manufacturing must excel at this task to win orders in the marketplace. the task may be cost, flexibility or another of several dimensions. from this key manufacturing task, 
				a set of policies flow that guide daily operations and decisions for purchasing equipment, setting priorities or designing a layout (for example).

our expertise


manufacturing strategy
forge your most potent competitive weapon
 a well-thought-out manufacturing strategy flows from and supports marketing by optimizing those factors that bring success in the 
				marketplace (e.g. quality, customization, price, delivery). we have been employing the work of wickham skinner, wheelwright, hill and others 
				in practical situations for several decades.  


lean manufacturing
streamline operations: qualityâproductivityâspeed
strategos consultants have been designing and implementing lean manufacturing for many years.  we have contributed to the literature of lean through hundreds of seminars, articles and papers as well as with this 
					website. through this experience we have developed procedures, rules of thumb and techniques to bring lean to industries where the 
					concepts seemed inapplicable. 


facility planning & layout
make the most of space & workflow
strategos consultants have written three of the most popular books on facilities planning. we have done hundreds of facility 
					plans from site-level to workstation level using our systematic and 
structured approaches.


cellular 
				manufacturing
integrate people, process, product & technology
mr. lee has been designing and implementing workcells for 
					more than 30 years. while toyota cells are ideally suited for toyota, they do not work well in many non-toyota 
					environments. our structured design approach helps design optimum workcells in a wide variety 
					of environments, including many job shops. 


value stream & process mapping
make any process smoother, better & faster
let us assist you with improving any of your processes using vsm, process mapping and other improvement techniques. mr. lee's 
					popular 
					book on the subject can be a starting point for your workshop or guided kaizen event. this is a "must" for any lean implementation or workcell 
					design.


warehousing 
				& supply chain
reduce inventory, stockouts & space 
sims consulting group, a strategos affiliate, literally "wrote the book" on warehousing with the u.s. navy's 800-page
					publication 
					ns529. ed phillips is one of the foremost authorities on warehousing, supply chain and materials handling. 


the human side
leverage your people
people are an integral part of every manufacturing system. as such, their needs and limitations must be accommodated and 
					integrated with equipment, layouts and systems for best results. we start with the socio technical 
					systems (sts) approach originated by eric trist to ensure 
					that people and culture are woven into every design. 


lean office/administration
streamline your most wasteful activities
there is nothing fundamentally different about an office; work is work. the same principles apply to factories, offices, hospitals and every other 
					purposeful activity. strategos has been applying lean methods to administrative activities and knowledge work for many years.
