seido karateseido karate, founded in new york city in 1976 by grand master kaicho tadashi nakamura, is a traditional japanese martial art that aims to strengthen the body as well as the mind. through the consistent training of basics, drills, kata (forms), self defense, kumite (sparring), as well as meditation, students develop discipline and perseverance that builds physical and mental strength, which carry over into all parts of life.a 9th degree black belt, kaicho tadashi nakamura moved to new york city from tk, japan in 1966. he founded seido, which means the “sincere way,” on the principles of respect, love, and obedience. people of all ages, gender identities, and abilities are welcome, and adaptive programs are available for visually impaired students and those with developmental and learning disabilities. while challenging, the training is conducted in a safe environment with respect for each individual’s comfort level.learn more about our classes and see our class schedule.
