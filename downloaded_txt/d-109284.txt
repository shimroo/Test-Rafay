	welcome



	la vida is a 501(c)(3) federal non-profit adoption agency licensed in 
	pennsylvania. we have 30 years of successful domestic and international 
	experience.  when the hague 
	convention went into effect in 2008, we were also among the first agencies 
	to achieve full hague accreditation from the council on accreditation  
	this accreditation enabled us to work with u.s. families to adopt children 
	residing in many countries.  we recently made the decision not to renew 
	our hague accreditation and effective march 1, 2018, we will not be acting 
	as a primary provider (child placing agency) for inter-country adoption 
	cases.  


	la vida currently provides home study and post placement services and 
	specialized services to couples and singles living in pennsylvania.  
	our agency was founded by and is directed by adoptive parents who personally 
	understand the multitude of emotions that occur during your adoption 
	process. our philosophy is to address your specific needs and do so in a 
	compassionate manner. our commitment comes from the heart.  


	we will be glad to provide private consultation in-person or via telephone 
	to share information about our services with you and to answer any questions 
	you may have.  we hope that you enjoy your visit! 


	please keep in mind when visiting this site that we will be updating content 
	to reflect the recent change noted above.
