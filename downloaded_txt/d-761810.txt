third generation, first in service.























the home fireplace experts, heritage fireplace shop, have always been a company passionate about providing quality products, customer service, and economical warmth. this passion began in 1959 when gerald & loma began winslow’s masonry from their home. when the oil prices in the late 1970’s skyrocketed, they decided to open a retail store in gorst and the name was changed to heritage fireplace shop & winslow’s masonry. in 2000, winslow masonry continued as a separate business still owned and operated by a family member.
today, heritage fireplace shop is still the same family owned business run by the third generation of the winslow family.
