							the campaign finance institute (cfi) was founded in 1999. after spending a year being hosted temporarily by the george washington university, cfi received its internal revenue service designation in 2000 as an independent 501(c)(3) organization, with headquarters in washington dc. 
							
							
							in july 2018, cfi became part of the national institute on money in politics (nimp).
							in june 2021, nimp merged with the center for responsive politics to form opensecrets.
							thanks to opensecrets for providing this material to the university at albany for archiving.
							thanks also to the university for hosting these archives of cfi’s data and research products.
