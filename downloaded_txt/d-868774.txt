empowering exceptional people

over 40 years ago, a few dedicated families sat down at a kitchen table with a deep and pressing need to find reliable, quality support for their children with developmental disabilities. today exceptional family resources still has a strong family focus – it’s in our name, it’s who we are, and it’s what we do. we partner with individuals with disabilities and their families to guide them through the difficult world of disability services. we’re here to help understand the changes that are always coming – from new rules and regulations to bigger, system-wide changes. we are in it with you.



due to the incoming weather for friday, february 14th, all efr offices will be closed and efr activities including funtastic friday will be canceled. please stay safe and warm. 
we look forward to resuming regular business hours on monday, february 17th, 2025.

we are excited to once again share some great news about our 2024 employee retention bonus. in february of 2024, exceptional family resources announced an employee retention bonus, that would be paid in two parts over the course of 2024. both bonuses were to be 3% of wages earned over a set time period. the first bonus reflected hours worked in the first half of the year and was paid to actively employed staff on 7/05/2024. the second bonus is reflective of wages earned in the second half of the year and will be paid on 12/06/2024. 
though we originally announced this bonus would be 3%, due to the hard work of efr staff, we are pleased to announce the bonus will be 5%. the bonus will be based on a payment equal to 5% of the wages you earned from 6/9/2024 to 11/9/2024. this bonus will be paid to staff that are still actively employed at efr on 12/6/2024. please see the document below for further information.
