saving albany’s stories, one brick at a time







architectural parts warehouse is open:wed and fri (12-6 pm), sat  (9-4 pm)

 



















  

what is historic albany foundation?celebrating 50 years in operation, historic albany foundation is a private not-for-profit membership based organization that works to preserve and protect buildings with architectural, historic, or civic value. we do this through educational and hands-on programming (tours, workshops, lectures), technical assistance, advocacy for endangered buildings, and our tool lending library and architectural parts warehouse. our architectural parts warehouse saves and sells historic house parts, preventing them from ending up in the landfill. this includes vintage doors, tubs, sinks, balusters, shutters, lighting, furniture, ephemera, and so much more. you can check out our instagram to get a first peek at our items. the warehouse operates by donation and salvage (email the warehouse to donate items). it is an invaluable resource for people passionate about historic buildings, items, and sustainability. you can find rare, period-appropriate parts and unique items to reuse and repurpose.  we also operate the capital region’s only tool lending library which has over 500 tools to borrow, free workshops, and runs community volunteer days ($20 for an annual membership).programming: please note that our tours and programming are typically ticketed events (even the free ones) due to limited space. we offer these first to our members (through our newsletters) and on our social media platforms. since they tend to sell out so quickly, you may not get a chance to see them here on our website. please check our social media or become a member for our most updated programming list.why do we do it?buildings are more than bricks and mortar - they are communities, memories, and create a sense of place.  we want to keep saving those buildings and stories for years to come, making sure we are sharing everyone’s stories and making preservation equitable and accessible to all.visit our officeswe are open by appointment to assist with technical services, program information, and volunteer opportunities. email info@historic-albany.org or call 518-465-0876 ext. 110 to visit us.our offices and warehouse are located at 89 lexington avenue, albany, ny 12206
