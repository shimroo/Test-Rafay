two country bumpkins transforming an overgrown field into a kitchen garden, orchard, wildlife haven ...





about us ...

in august 2007, we became the proud owners of a 1.1 acre field in the village where we live. 'little delph', as it is known, had been left to its own devices for some considerable time and gradually the brambles had taken over, leaving us with some serious cutting back and tidying up to do ...12 months later and progress has been made. we have regained control over the hedges, created our kitchen garden area, erected a tool shed and are now planning a cutting garden and hen enclosure.
