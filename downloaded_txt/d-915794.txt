upcoming changes.





in the next couple of weeks, portable church® industries’ web presence, emails, correspondence and invoices will have a different look, but don’t be alarmed – it’s still us - just a little stronger and with a little more savvy.   one of our core values is continuous improvement. in the last few years, we've continuously improved our customer follow-up, our know-how and everything from our material handling process to the way we deliver product. our solutions are faster, our consultants wiser and our project managers more efficient. we aim to get better and better so we can maintain the confidence you’ve placed in us. our old look and website just didn't communicate that the way we'd like. so, we've made some changes. it’s all part of our mission to continue to be one of the most integral parts of mobile ministry.   as you experience growth, so do we. we have been honored to be a part of your journey and even more honored that you have chosen to share information about us with your own networks. we have learned so much from our clients and partners – and every time we work with someone new, we learn something new. thank you for helping us continue in our efforts to get better and better.   we hope you like our new look, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with you. you keep dreaming. we'll keep building.

support nyc portable churches!





by brian koehnalmost every weekend, we’re helping another church or two learn a system for setting up for their weekend services in a rented school building. churches rent all kinds of buildings, but almost 75% of our churches end up in schools. as scott thomas, acts 29 president, says, “they’re designed for large groups, and they’ve got parking.”so it was quite a shock when i heard that, “the 2nd u.s. circuit court of appeals ruled in june that a public school could bar a church from renting its space after hours, while other groups could rent the space if they weren't using it for worship.” reference here)it hit close to home because we had just delivered a portable church system to a new york congregation this spring, and sure enough, they are one of the 60+ congregations affected by this ruling.when usa today picked up the story and called us for our input, i wasn’t sure what to expect, but two days ago, this story was on the front cover of their paper. they wrote, “the city’s department of education, which has been trying for a decade to oust the congregations and end the weekend worship practice, won the latest legal round in june. as the case winds its way through more appeals, an injunction allows about 60 congregations to remain in place…”then it hit me: why not use the credibility of this article to start a campaign to let these churches know how many people support them, and at the same time let the politicians in new york know how many people think that what they are doing is wrong.please sign this petition and pass it on to people who share your values. let them know why you took the time to sign it. after you sign it – help spread the word on twitter, blogs and facebook. let these churches know that they will not stand alone!
