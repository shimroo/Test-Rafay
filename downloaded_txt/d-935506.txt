about sea xploration

how we help to preserve the planet 














we rely on the world’s oceans to provide food, supply oxygen, and filter carbon dioxide. the ocean cannot perform these vital functions when unhealthy waters are clogged with microplastics and other debris.to combat this, sea xploration is taking strategic steps to find solutions that are effective and sustainable and to bolster the efforts of others working toward the same goal. 


























ocean testing and resultssea xploration conducts testing on ocean water to assess the health and condition of these aquatic environments. they also provide free and open access to this valuable information about the status of our oceans online. the research will focus on comprehensive water quality assessments, video documentation of marine ecosystems and shoreline erosion. the project aims to provide open-access data to the global scientific community, supporting collaborative studies, conservation strategies, and climate resilience efforts.garbage patch monitoringthrough a five-year program, sea xploration is tracking and recording the movements of the world’s ocean garbage patches. knowing where they are can help cleanup crews reach, locate, and remove them.organic cleanup solutionsthe magnitude of the microplastic and garbage problem means creative thinking and a willingness to try alternative options is necessary. sea xploration tests organic ocean cleanup solutions with the hopes that a groundbreaking solution will emerge.
