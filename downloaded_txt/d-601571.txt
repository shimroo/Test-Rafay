chatillon-demenil mansion






















the chatillon-demenil mansion is a magnificent example of the late greek revival style in st. louis, but its significance is more than architectural.the house embodies the stories of the families who lived here, including members of the founding families of st. louis and carondelet, a nationally known western trailblazer, the family of an oglala leader, and a literary scholar who was a director of the 1904 world’s fair. we also tell the story of the caves beneath the property, the highway system that almost destroyed the house, and the preservation efforts that saved it.
