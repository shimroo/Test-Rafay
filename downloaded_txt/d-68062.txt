look for the seal to know it’s real!

                    to be sure you’re getting genuine, top-quality idaho® potatoes, look for the "grown in idaho®" seal. idaho’s growing season of warm days and cool nights, ample mountain-fed irrigation, and rich volcanic soil give idaho® potatoes their unique texture, taste, and dependable performance.

featured question
ideal temperature for a baked potato
i run a barbecue website where i teach my readers to use thermometers to measure doneness. however, i can’t find the ideal temperature for a baked potato. at what temperature is a baked potato done?



answer
we recommend baking potatoes at 400 degrees f for about an hour. smaller spuds might take a little less time, while larger baking potatoes over 1 pound might take a little more. for a fully baked idaho russet burbank, the internal temperature should be right at 210 degrees f. in foodservice, where the baked potato will be kept warm after it comes out of the oven, we recommend the internal temp to be 185 degrees f as the potato will continue to cook.
