about us... 
the trumbull county coroner's office is a team of death investigation professionals consisting of an elected coroner, a board certified forensic pathologist, four death investigators certified nationally by the american board of medicolegal death investigators and an office manager.
the staff of the trumbull county coroner's office is dedicated to exercising its duties with care, compassion and understanding towards families during one of lifeâs most difficult times.
section 313.12 of the ohio revised code mandates that the coroner make an inquiry regarding unnatural deaths within the county and that all unnatural or unexplained deaths be reported to the coroner's office.  an investigation will be performed if a sudden death occurs when a person is in apparent good health, a death is suspicious, unusual, unexplained, the result of violence, unlawful activity or criminal neglect.
autopsies are frequently performed to determine the cause and manner of death in unnatural or unexplained deaths.  in cases where there is significant medical history, the death appears to be from natural causes or where there is no evidence of foul play, an autopsy is not always performed but a limited examination or investigation is completed.  coronerâs findings are generally completed within 8 to 10 weeks from the date of death.
death certificates are not issued by the coronerâs office but through the warren city health department at $25.00 per copy.  as a courtesy to the family, funeral homes may offer to obtain the certificates from the health department as part of final arrangements.
