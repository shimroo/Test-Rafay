the ipod 5 also known as the ipod with video

november 28, 2018 by arianna meyer·comments off on the ipod 5 also known as the ipod with video


the iphone gets an update annually.
but, the ipod touch has not had this same updating.

it has been the same for the past few years when the 5th generation was released. this was a major step for the ipod touch.
every other model has been similar to the precursor. the iphone shares similar features with it and while the 5th generation does have similarities it is distinctive. this is mostly due to the introduction of colored cases. in the past, it had only come with a black or white case. the 5th generation ipod was thinner and weight less than the iphone. in fact, the unit was .85 ounces lighter than the iphone and measured .06 inches thinner.
it expands on the ipod photo by allowing users to play videos on the color, 2.5 inch screen. it was originally available in two colors and had a click wheel with a flat shape rather than the rounded shape found on earlier ipods.
initially, the models were capable of holding 30, 60 and 80 gb of content. the 60 gb was replaced by the 80 gb model in 2005. a special edition ipod was released when it launched. this was the 30-gb u2 model. at this point in time, they were sold at itunes for use with ipod videos.

4th generation ipod

about the 4th generation ipod also known as the ipod photo
fourth generation ipod
aquastreakrugby471 / wiki commons/cc 3.0released: jul, 04discontinued: oct, 05
this ipod touch inherited many of its features from the iphone 4, while dramatically upgrading the display capabilities along with making it a lot more powerful.
major changes that were introduced in this model was an addition of an apple a4 processor which also powers the ipad and the iphone 4, two cameras which includes 1 user-facing along with support for the face-time video chats, a high-definition video-recording, along with an added high-resolution retina display screen. it is also inclusive of a 3-axis gyroscope that offers improved gaming responsiveness.
like the previous models, this 4th generation touch offers a 3.5-inch touchscreen, media-playback features and internet access using wi-fi, multiple sensors for added gaming performance, along with app store support.
the fourth generation ipod included another overall redesign and came with a few new spin-off products which were merged eventually into the fourth generation line.
this version of the ipod brought about the clickwheel, that was first introduced with the original ipod mini, onto the primary ipod line. this clickwheel was touch-sensitive to scroll and also had built-in buttons which allowed a used to click on the wheel in order to select a menu, play/pause and forward/backward. the middle button served the function for onscreen item selections.
this version also came with 2 special editions: the 30 gb edition which was inclusive of the band, u2’s “how to dismantle an atomic bomb” album, with engraved signatures of this band, along with a discount coupon to buy the entire catalog of the band from itunes (october 2004), the harry potter limited edition, inclusive of a hogwarts logo which was engraved onto the ipod and included 6 of the potter books available at that time which had been pre-loaded in the form of audiobooks (september 2005).
at the same time the new ipod photo debuted, which was one of the versions of the fourth generation ipod which includes abilities to show photos and a fresh new color-screen.
the ipod photo line merged with the clickwheel line in the fall of 2005.

the 3rd-generation ipod

november 28, 2018 by arianna meyer·comments off on the 3rd-generation ipod


the 3rd-generation model ipod was released on april 2003
łukasz ryba/wikipedia commons/cc by 3.0released april 2003discontinued july 2004
the third-generation ipod touch was received with a somewhat lukewarm response when it was first introduced because it was just a slight improvement over the previous ipod model. based on rumors, a majority of observers were expecting that the model would incorporate a camera, which appeared in the later model, the fourth-generation model. despite the disappointment in some areas, the 3rd-generation ipod touch still made some sales and was successful in every respect.
the 3rd-generation ipod was quite similar to the previous one. however, a faster processor, increased capacity and voiceover and voice control capabilities set it apart from its predecessor.
another key feature added to the 3rd-generation model was the processor used in the latest line of iphone 3gs, which gave the device more processing speed and power, making it possible for the model to display complex graphics as it had opengl. just like prior ipod touch models, the third-generation ipod lacked the gps and digital camera available on the phone.
the 3rd-generation ipod was released on april 2003 but was discontinued in july 2004.
the third-generation ipod was quite a design change from previous ipod models. the model featured a new device housing that was way thinner and featured more-rounded soft corners. it was the first model to have the new ‘touch wheel’, a new touch-sensitive wheel for perusing content stored within the device. with this unique menu maneuver, backward/forward and pause/play buttons were moved using a thumb wheel and were aligned in a straight horizontal row just below the display screen.
it was also the first ipod model to come with a dock connector. this soon became the new standard for connecting most ipod models (apart from the ipod shuffle) to compatible accessories and computers.
the introduction of the new itunes store promotions partners with the new models features. a windows os compatible desktop version of the store was launched in october 2003, just 5 months following the new market introduction of the 3rd-generation ipod was introduced. windows os users needed to do a little reformatting of their ipods to make them windows-compatible.

10gb – could hold up to 2,500

about the 2nd generation ipod

november 28, 2018 by arianna meyer·comments off on about the 2nd generation ipod


2002 was the release of their second generation, the ipod touch.
copyright image apple inc.released: in july 02discontinued: in april 03
the 2nd generation ipod touch was very different to its predecessors in association to the redesign in shape along with a variety of new sensors and features, which included integrated speakers, a built-in accelerometer, genius functionality and nike+ support.
the 2nd generation ipod touch featured the iphone 3g shape, yet it was thinner with a measurement of just 0.33-inches thick.
similar to the iphone, the second gen.touch came with the accelerometer which senses how the user is moving or holding the device, which allowed the screen content to accordingly respond. this device also came with a nike+ exercise tracking and management software system along with hardware for nike shoes that needed to be bought separately.
unlike an iphone, this touch was lacking in a camera and phone features. yet in many other ways, these 2 devices were just as similar.
the second-generation model ipod was introduced shortly under one year later, after the great success of the original model.
for the 2nd generation, this model boasted a few other new features which included window support which increased the storage capacity, the touch sensitive wheel, instead of a mechanical wheel which was featured on the first ipod.
even though the look and feel of this device is just about identical to the 1st generation model, this new model came with rounded corners. on the date of its release, the now known itunes store had not yet been released which occurred in the latter 2003.
the 2nd generation ipod came in 4 models, which featured signatures of tony hawk, beck, or madonna, or a logo from the band known as ‘no doubt’, were engraved into the back part of this device for a fee of $50.

the first ipod – first generation

november 28, 2018 by arianna meyer·comments off on the first ipod – first generation


in 2007, apple introduced the ipod touch.
image copyright apple inc.introduced: oct. 2001released: nov. 2001 discontinued: july 2002
this first-generation smart device showed a huge shift and redesign of the original ipod. this ipod touch resembled the very popular and easy to use iphone. in fact, it did not look like the ipod nano or ipod video, its predecessors at all. it is easy to see why the ipod touch became a very good choice for people who wanted the features of the iphone without the actual phone.
throughout its existence, the ipod touch has progressed from a fun and trendy way to listen to music to a useful and sometimes essential device. so much so, some decided to forgo the phone and use the ipod touch instead. keep reading to see how the ipod has changed its design, software, and features with every new generation.
the first-generation ipod was known for its sleek design. the all white design was both modern and aesthetically pleasing. the scroll wheel housed the 4 buttons that controlled the device. on top is the menu button, then the forward, then the play/pause, then the backwards button. to select items, simply push the center button. this first-generation ipod could only be used with mac 0s 9 or mac 0s x 10.1.
the ipod was by far the most user-friendly mp3 device on the market. because of this, and its design, it accumulated a quick following. the original ipod was a strong seller. since the itunes store did not yet exist, those who used this first ipod had to add music manually from their cds or personal music library.
apple was a relatively small company at the time.
a lot of its success came from the introduction of this mp3 device.
