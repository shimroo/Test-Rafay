we use these four best practices of mechanical design for buildings. every building:needs flexible and abundant fresh air that can reduce airborne virus transmission by 80%, has the ability to provide air conditioning now or have a designed-in path for doing so in the future, employs resilient system design so that mechanical equipment failures trigger switches to on-line back-up equipment or simple replacement using spare parts kept on hand, and makes progress toward sustainable building energy along a path of biomass heating, solar electricity/electric heat pumps, or a combination of the two.
