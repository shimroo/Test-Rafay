"what's done can't be undone".  -william shakespeare-

























































































monday, august 01, 2016










i saw a humming bird about an hour ago.  he or she was hovering next to my pink begonias.  i believe i saw the same little bird looking through my sliding glass windows a few weeks ago.  what remarkable birds.  i keep thinking - i'll get a little feeder for him or her - the kind filled with sugar water.  but i haven't.  i'll need to research the whole issue.  i believe it is considered a good thing.  i've read about it, yet i'm not sure if it is a good thing - sugar is supposed to be bad - for pretty much all forms of life - but if you look at ants and humming birds - they both seem to love it - a lot.  so that's what i was thinking about for a small little portion of my day today.  happiness and peace everyone.

friday, july 29, 2016











july 29th, 2016 - seems like quite awhile since i last posted - and even longer since i posted regularly.  

my life has changed a great deal since i was a regular 'blogger'.

i pretty much stick with facebook - a self contained rapidly aging portion of the internet.  

facebook is safer and certainly bland in many ways compared to public blog posting. 

so now what?

why post?

motive? 

i'll have to think of one. 

here - watch this coldplay video - adventure of a lifetime

and have a wonderful life everyone

thoughts about public posting





it has been nearly five years to the day that i stopped posting to this blog

it is amazing what changes have taken place in my life over those five years

it isn't as if i haven't been posting - just not to this blog 

in a way, i'm not sure if anyone will ever read this post.

when i run searches sometimes i'll land on someone else's blog post, so i guess someone might end up here

i used to care about such things, but no longer care

not at this very moment anyway

i wouldn't mind if i somehow stumbled into a successful blogging career 

that would be nice, but it certainly isn't something i'm even considering

no, i guess i'm going to share some thoughts and post them online

maybe it's a type of therapy - i'm not really sure

anyway, time for me to sleep - good night ai scanning software - good night all human readers too

zzzzzzz

beating hearts and raindrops






beating hearts and raindrops

by jeromeprophet   
         
have you ever kissed the one you loved on a cold rainy night in the driving rain?
    
we did.
   
umbrellas wrapping us together - ever closer.   
   
streaks of raindrops from dark to light back into darkness again.
  
the sound. 
  
beating hearts and rain drops.  
       
we were each other's solace if only for a time.

pruning the blog - and - possibly returning to occasional posting





i removed a few old posts from years ago - my life has gone on - who i am - what i believe - how i act - what i say - what i chose to share - how i write - all kinds of stuff - has changed somewhat 

i left many love poems i wrote - even though i'm not in love with anyone now

i left many political commentary posts even though i'm not entirely sure what they were about 
  
i sadly noted that many of the posts were not up to my editorial standards - and that photos i thought looked nice years ago - are of too poor quality - etc.

so here i am - i have a chance to add some content - so i just did

i'm getting somewhat closer to posting on occasion - i've been on facebook for many years - but posting to facebook is similar to living in a cul-de-sac - nice but boring.
  
this blog was public.

i'll give it some more thought as to what i want to do with this blog - and maybe in awhile i'll begin posting again
   
then again maybe not

april 22 2015 - new thoughts on old blog





it's obviously been several years since i've updated this blog.  many changes in my life since i last posted.  the blog jeromeprophet was named such not because i ever felt i was a prophet - i was close to naming the blog jerome pundit.

i was reading the harry potter series of books, and the name of the newspaper in that magical fictional world is the daily prophet, and so i thought - why not name my blog jerome prophet - and so i did.

i posted a few posts that were political, and most that were not. 

i attracted the attention of the editor of the illinois times, and even began a small feature (weekly) in that newspaper - so of the photos i posted are still accessible online there.
  
i wrapped up blogging a few years ago posting romantic poems while in love - it never worked out - but i did go on with my life since then.

i'm mostly on facebook now - and have grown bored with facebook.

not really sure if i'll ever begin any regular posting to any online service again.

in some ways i look back upon this blog as a way of saying hello to the world - what was then a fairly new online world.

i had experimented with a few short lived webpages - one or two at geocities.
  
i've read that as the years pass more and more online content will have been written, and abandoned due to the deaths of those who created that online content.

one day that will be true of me - i'll pass on, but i don't expect nor demand that any of what i have written online ever be thought of as a testament to my existence.
  
peace love and live long and prosper everyone

snow fairy love








snow fairy love

by jerome prophet



we trace upon this land of snow
white drifts of love swirl to and fro

love's infinite sparkling crystal place

white brilliance now with magic grace



precious snow angel my heart entrust
so kiss me now with your fairy dust

your flutter nymph wings they do swirl

you are my true love my magic girl

  
i'll take your hand to hold in mine

as we journey cross this place and time
and we'll leave our path upon the snow
while you guide us with your fairy glow

  

whilst true our path is one less taken
this burning love be not forsaken

our hearts will sail the blue frost air
with a love so bold as few could dare


my words just now they may confuse
or perhaps, my dear, they do amuse

yet these dreams be mine my darling dove
my precious snow white my fairy love

so take me now to your celestial place
your crystal realm of love and grace

and melt my frozen heart god's spell

for within your love my heart must dwell


   




 

you are my beautiful snow fairy
just knowing you keeps me warm
on these cold winter days
 
  


dedicated to my snow fairy

two voices in a sea of opposition













two voices in a sea of opposition




















the question which faces us at this point in our journey is whether to stay the course knowing that failure will most likely greet us at the end, or whether to venture onward in hopes of a miracle.  i believe in miracles.

scanning using quantum entanglement





one interesting subject.

using quantum entanglement in a sensor.

the same technology which will be (which could already have been) developed for use in quantum computers, and quantum communication systems would be useful toward the development of a new type of scanning technology - one using quantum entanglement.

for example with radar a beam of microwave radiation is emitted from a em source, and travels at the speed of light until it is reflected off of an object, and then returns back to a detector.  essentially there is a round trip involved.

with a quantum entanglement based 'radar' system there is no return trip.

now this brings up some interesting questions doesn't it?

while it would appear to operate at a faster than light speed this is not the case.

however information could be obtained instantly, or better to say at the point of photon emission.

all kinds of interesting considerations there.

soft kisses on golden days





soft kisses on golden days
by jeromeprophet

our love is an illusion
my fault
my pained confusion?

one heart that beats
not two
a broken heart so blue

your silence an intrusion
upon my self delusion
it speaks as loud as thunder
pushing my soul dark under

and whom is there to blame
can anyone be shamed
for what they fail to do
for not feeling 'i love you'?

for it's my thoughts and feelings
that has sent my life reeling
and not your heart so bare
of love for me or care

so what should i now do
make die this love for you?
or let it wither in silence
then buried in unsung violence

and what of memories we made
the future plans we laid
of soft kisses on golden days
of the children we would raise?

are those thoughts now unmade
or living in another way
in some distant place and time
a place we still could find

i'm hoping you hear it too
the song that led me to you
it's sung each and every day
god blessed in every way

and if you understand
we'll reach that promised land
and join our souls as one
eternal infinite love
.
.
.

greeneyes - this is the poem i told you about earlier this week.

i'm a tool











i'm a tool

by jeromeprophet

    

i'm a tool

 i'm just your fool

 i'm what happens 

 when dumb love rules

  

 i'm a toy

 i'm just your boy

 i'm not your man

  but a plan to annoy

   

 so sell me out

 then you go pout
it's not all about
how you've been wronged

  

 then cuss me up 

 and cuss me down

 cuz you're singing

 that same ole song

    

 one line for him

 then one for me

 just been betrayed 

 so easy to be

abuse you crave

a sad sad game
you could escape
that's what i see


but you must step up
and be the grown up
neither his mommy 
nor his slave

for you are the maker
and the shaper
you're in charge
of your own destiny

to my father's father's father




















to my father and father's father 

by jeromeprophet

  

blinded by your situation

you coldly crafted intimidation

you wielded anger with such ease

and lashed your hate with expertise

  

yet when you peered into your mirror

it was your father's face you feared

your voice did shake as he appeared within that 

trembling face unclear


you heard him in your own voice told 

no matter whether young or old

for his anger placed within your soul

to terrorize your heart so cold


i warn you brother don't forget his days

for those torments reside within the haze
and if you deny his uncaring ways

his anger will rise within your blaze

  

so know him now and forever more

he was your father once adored

it's only through your knowledge well

that you'll escape his given hell  

   

for i have seen him times before

i've battled him from soul to fore

i've refused him guidance of my path

and challenge him his angry wrath

  

yet i have forgiven the two

for what else could i do 
but forgotten them not

for i still wage war against their lot

  
though not with hate filled blood

of you my father or fatherhood
for instead i have understood 

guided by my mother's love

tune-age video picks for 12/05/2009






video: within temptation - the last time

where from? netherlands
genre? symphonic metal, and symphonic rock
who is the female lead singer? sharon janny den adel
within temptation wikilink

   
the last time 

for so long i've tried
could not close my eyes.  
when you became a outcast in this life.

again and again i try
to understand the demons inside your head,
but the truth is you love them to death.

now, i know it's the last time 
i have tried
 to lift you up to make you fight.
nothing is ever easy in life.  
i can't change it 
if you don't have the will deep inside.

i have been blind to
how you justify  
everything that you've wasted in this life.

got lost in the illusion,  
i'd find a solution 
for the demons in your head,  
but the truth is you love them to death.

now, i know it's the last time 
i have tried  to lift you up to make you fight.  
nothing is ever easy in life.  
i can't change it 
if you don't have the will deep inside.

you can blame and you can hide  
behind what is wrong and what is right.  
life is the choices we make  
i hope you'll awake before it's too late.

now, i know it's the last time i have tried
to lift you up to make you fight.
nothing is ever easy in life.
i can't change it
if you don't have the will deep inside.

cherished princess blue
















  cherished princess blue

      by jeromeprophet



my cherished princess blue 


our love tears our hearts into two

now my soul's sole obsession is you

and i haven't a clue what is due 



my heart shall not yield without fight 

nor could suffer a darkened love light

yet this love has taken its toll

upon my lonely and tattered soul




 we're entangled within this love play

so i'm crafting words just to say

they're my best to share what is true
as i promise my life unto you



and my soul it is spinning around 

for you my heart's come unbound  

and it's true my life's not complete
yet there's no higher devotion i'd seek 



for my faith yet remains unbroken
these feelings must always be spoken

for i can not turn, nor run away
when my heart screams out just to say




that i'm completely in love with you

that no other girl could ever do
 and that our love is real and true 
my darling, my baby princess blue

video: unsun - face the truth


***

  
what a beautiful song.

i know there are times when i feel like i have been forsaken in this life.
  
i know that many others feel the same way.
  
many of us quietly suffer years of our lives away, leading what henry david thoreau described as, 'lives of quiet desperation'.

we often believe we are alone in carrying our burdens, but we are never alone.
  

***  










lyrics to face the truth



i'm weakening.
something's wrong with me.
i thought that i was to come first.
i don't know what is true.
   
i'm living with fear from morning to night.
i'm losing my passion for life.
hoping that the end of my worries is near.
  
i have changed myself growing up every day.
face the truth about yourself.
you and i, we're all the same.
i have changed myself growing up every day.
face the truth about yourself.
you and i, we're all the same.
  
i thought that i was right.
but i made a big mistake.
i am changing myself for good.
because i have understood.
  
i feel like a grain of sand on the empty desert.
every man is special, every man.
i feel like a grain.
  
i have changed myself growing up every day.
face the truth about yourself.
you and i, we're all the same.
i have changed myself growing up every day.
face the truth about yourself.
you and i, we're all the same.
  
i'm weakening.
something's wrong with me.
i thought that i was to come first.
i don't know what is true.
  
i'm living with fear from morning to night.
i'm losing my passion for life.
hoping that the end of my worries is near.
  
i have changed myself growing up every day.
face the truth about yourself.
you and i, we're all the same.
i have changed myself growing up every day.
face the truth about yourself.
you and i, we're all the same.
  
everything i've known about, about the world.
was just a fraction of the truth, truth about him.
i feel like a grain of sand on the empty desert.
i feel like a grain of sand.
i feel like a grain.
  
i have changed myself growing up every day.
face the truth about yourself.
you and i, we're all the same.
i have changed myself growing up every day.
face the truth about yourself.
you and i, we're all the same.

sirenia - the path to decay 

group: sirenia
from: norway
genre: gothic-metal with a mix of symphonic metal and death metal
her name: ailyn (from spain, born pilar giménez garcía)
ailyn wikilink 

lyrics - the path to decay
    

(verse 1)
life brings nothing for the same 
keep searching new days on the horizon 
while time just seems to slip away 
i’m leaving no trace along the way 

(chorus)
seems like i’m falling deeper, deeper inside myself 
feels like i’m growing weaker, much weaker each day 
along the path to decay 

(verse 2)
the lights are fading day by day 
no cure for the lost, there’s no ascending 
when life could not become more pale 
a new dawn is here, another day 

(chorus)
seems like i’m falling deeper, deeper inside myself 
feels like i’m growing weaker, much weaker each day 
along the path to decay 

(verse 3)
darkness within myself (my soul?)
with people that stand to fall
the daylight is long since gone
but a new dawn has yet to come

(chorus)
seems like i’m falling deeper, deeper inside myself 
feels like i’m growing weaker, much weaker each day 
along the path to decay

lunik - everybody knows

where from? switzerland
genre: pop, rock, trip hop 
who is she?  jaël, born as rahel krebs
wikilink for lunik 
  
lyrics - everybody knows

i love fairy-tales about shoes that dance on their own
about prince and princess in glittering dresses on festivals
i love sunsets when the world seems so sweet
everything inside me is longing for a happy end
why can't they let me be
this is me
do i harm anyone
i love to live in harmony and die for trashy melodies
but this ain't life it's all about this game

everybody shows and everybody sees
everybody dares and everybody fears
in the end we're all the same
everybody knows and everybody feels
everybody hurts and everybody heals
in the end we're all the same

i love to stand still, feel the wind in my hair
taste a raindrop spy out a bookshop and observe the people reading there
why can't they let me be
this is me
do i harm anyone
i love to live in harmony and die for trashy melodies
but this ain't life it's all about this game

everybody shows everybody sees
everybody dares and everybody fears
in the end we're all the same
everybody knows and everybody feels
everybody hurts and everybody heals
in the end we're all the same

i whistle during shopping and weep when there's no way out
from time to time i even laugh out loud

everybody shows and everybody sees
everybody dares and everybody fears
in the end we're all the same
everybody knows and everybody feels
everybody hurts and everybody heals
in the end we're all the same
everybody shows and everybody sees
everybody dares and everybody fears
in the end we're all the same
everybody knows and everybody feels
everybody hurts and everybody heals
in the end we're all the same
oh i don't like this game

everybody, oh everybody knows, everybody knows

console the mind, i take it in with lips of pink i kiss
lonely sky, the more you take the more that i give in
holy eyes, i never knew, i know, i know-- 
don't go...

hold onto the memory, it's all you've got
i know you'll be there to soak up blood lost, blood lost, blood....

don't go...

hold onto the memory, it's all you've got
i know you'll be there to soak up blood lost
hold onto the memory, it's all you've got 
i know you'll be there to soak up blood lost, blood lost, blood lost.

the lyrics - die on a rope


tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die on a rope? 
tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die?

i wish that you didn't love me no more, i've been dead for years, 
i wish that you didn't own me no more, i've been here before.

tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die on a rope? 
tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die? no, i won't!
tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die on a rope? 
tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die?

i want to draw the blood from your neck, spill the lies in your bed.
i will give you a holy white rose, cut the tongue from your head.

tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die on a rope? 
tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die? no, i won't!
tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die on a rope? 
tell me something, tell me stupid, will i die, will i die?

i belong to a line of red scent, teach the heart to reflect.
the wound is wise for primal black eyes, there's a scarlet letter in my chest.

  
that's it for me!  and thank you captain dave for the hospitality, the brew, a place to hide out for a while from the superior forms of life which tolerate us - women.


   
tune-age facts 
  
what is 'tune-age'?  tune-age is a diversion from boredom which accompanies many beers, and talk about sports, and women.
where does it take place?  "dave's world" - a solace from women (in springfield, illinois).
when? usually on saturday nights, but it can be a friday night too.
how is tune-age played?  everyone must bring some music video picks, and they get played.  we then either say good things about the video, the group, the song, the music - or we completely ignore it.
who plays tune-age? just us cool guys who show up - about four in number.
where is dave's world? my buddy dave's - in his west side springfield, illinois "den". 
dave's blog: www.the11thhour.blogspot.com
     
note: by the time we descend into "dave's world" many fine beers have been consumed, and this fact seems to help make the experience much more interesting than it probably is.
   
last week i was informed that females can actually join in the festivities if one were to want to - but we're keeping that a secret.
