experience the miracle of
love at first sight!








what is a 3d ultrasound?
_____
3d scanning employs advanced ultrasound technology to generate images in three planes. these images can be reconstructed to appear as if you were seeing your baby in real life!



what is a 4d ultrasound?
_____
similar to 3d ultrasounds, 4d ultrasounds allow you to see your baby’s features. additionally, it enables us to view your baby’s activities in real-time via video. this means you’ll get to see your baby in action; you’ll be able to see all the movement you’re experiencing in your belly!



what is a 5d ultrasound?
_____
5d ultrasounds work similarly to 4d ultrasounds allowing you to see live movement of your little one but 5d gives you a more realistic look with flesh-tone skin colors. additionally, advanced technology enables us to highlight additional characteristics of your baby. 



what is a 6d ultrasound?
_____
6d ultrasounds are the newest innovation of ge’s hdlive 3d/4d imaging. this new illuminating technology provides vitreous-like clarity of the fetus and placenta which allows the sonographer to basically see the front of the fetus as well as an artificially constructed image of the back of the fetus.
