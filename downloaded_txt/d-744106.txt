marley, professional ballet-academic program


what i really like about dancing is the feeling through my body, feeling the freedom, really moving to the music, and interpreting how i feel.





















the fu arnold family, nbs dancers


meet sidney, ruben, jonah, angela, and yu rong–a family spanning three generations, with dance and nbs at its heart. they dance in different ways, but together they are discovering how dance builds connection and appreciation for each other.























gwen, dancer not dementia project participant 


i really love it. i can't say it any other way. when i'm dancing and doing things like that, i'm very happy.





















rachael karker, ydp alumni and olympian


i would definitely recommend dance. i think it’s such a fun sport to start out in and to continue in as well. dance is so much fun, and you learn so many skills. i think it’s a great way to get exercising or to just try something new.





















ben, professional ballet-academic program graduate


 dance has taught me what it means to have a passion in life. with the help of my mother and my hometown ballet teacher, i made the decision to audition. once i got to nbs, it really felt like home and i knew that this is where i needed to go to further my training. 





















juan pablo, adult ballet student


since i was a kid, i always dreamt of being a dancer…i’ve been taking classes at canada’s national ballet school for almost two years now. i’m so glad i found the program and fulfilled the dream.
