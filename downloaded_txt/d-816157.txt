about ocean garden









about ocean garden
in 1957, a small group of mexican shrimp boat owners came together to market their flavorful harvest to north america. that humble association has since evolved into one of the largest seafood importer companies in the nation.
but, far more important than our growth has been our unwavering commitment to securing and delivering the best possible shrimp and seafood products for our discerning clientele.
