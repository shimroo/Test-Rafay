                                            the failure of dei: it did not equate to black progress, so why keep fighting for it?                                        


reevaluating dei: has it truly served black communities?
for decades, black leaders have championed diversity, equity, and inclusion (dei) as a strategy to address systemic inequalities and create meaningful change. however, over 50 years later, the outcomes paint a troubling picture. dei initiatives have largely fallen short of their promise to uplift black communities, instead reinforcing existing power structures.
if dei were truly about dismantling systemic oppression, why have its greatest beneficiaries been white women, while black families face increasing barriers to building generational wealth and economic stability?
it’s time to critically examine dei’s impact and question whether it has addressed the root causes of inequality—or simply rebranded the status quo. for black communities to thrive, solutions must move beyond surface-level representation and tackle systemic injustices at their core.
what will it take for true equity to be achieved?










                                            tale of two cities: report finds stark racial wealth gap among new yorkers                                         


building wealth in new york city remains an uphill battle for latino and black residents, according to a recent robin hood foundation report. the study, based on data from the poverty tracker, a partnership with columbia university, offers a revealing look at the deep economic disparities across the city.
unlike income, which reflects earnings at a given moment, wealth encompasses accumulated assets—such as savings, property, and investments—minus debts. it serves as a critical measure of long-term financial stability and opportunity. the report highlights an alarming wealth gap among racial and ethnic groups in new york city.












why the racial wealth gap
