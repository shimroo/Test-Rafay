the creative arts span many fields and disciplines. very few online portfolios cater to the needs of creative savants that excel in the arts; those that do often satisfy little more than personal vanity. the artistic network is a site that was developed specifically for the purpose of exposing the talent of creative artists and the modern-day renaissance man.
anyone dealing with creative arts, from individuals to organizations, can add themselves to the network. sign up now to share your talents and creative vision. browse around to see some of the new and emerging talent in various artistic fields. you can also learn more about our features. membership is free!
we also have a simple arts search that allows you to do keyword searching of articles on the site.
