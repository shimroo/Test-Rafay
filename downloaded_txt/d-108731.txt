delaware military academy 



 



raising the bar 











founded in 2003, the delaware military academy is the only public charter high school in the united states based on the traditions, values, and ideals of the u.s. navy. although academics are the backbone of any educational organization, leadership is the muscle of dma. cadets enrolled are active members of the naval junior reserve officer training corps program and learn through a structured, traditional military school environment including self-discipline, motivation, and activities that enable our students to become productive citizens in a vastly changing technological society. 




















 




attention dma alumni: the delaware military academy will process all alumni transcript requests through parchment.com starting december 12, 2024. to request an official transcript, please go to parchment.com and let us know where it needs to be sent. you can request a transcript to be sent to an individual, a college, an employer or yourself. you can get more information on this process or place an order
