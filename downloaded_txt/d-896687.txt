							henry ford said, if you think you can or think you can’t – you’re right.						



garbage in – garbage out, applies to feeding your body, mind and spirit

 3 tips for eating right 











 do no harm – to your tummy! 










do no harm – to your tummy! 



just because you ate it – doesn’t mean your body absorbed it! 



if your tummy is constantly irritated and inflamed? how do you expect to nourish and strengthen your body? 



if you get bloated, gassy, inflamed, irritated, diarrhea, etcetera… that’s a sign your digestive system is not working properly.   



is it an upper gi problem? a lower gi problem? or both? 





 







 has your metabolism shifted? 










has your metabolism shifted? 



your body burns calories throughout the day to produce energy by burning carbohydrates, proteins and fats! 



burning more calories doesn’t mean – burning more calories from fats. 



people who struggle with weight gain, fatigue, cravings, mood swings, hormonal imbalance, etc….are typically burning more carbs and proteins (lean muscle), instead of fats throughout the day! 



is it your diet, your dietary habits and/or stress that have shifted your metabolism? 





 







 dietary habits are a major problem 










dietary habits are a major problem 



when you eat, your digestive system is designed to contribute various digestive juices (enzymes and acid) to breakdown your food. 



when you eat on the go, on the run, in the car… your gi system doesn’t produce the necessary digestive juices needed to breakdown your food. 



how do you expect to breakdown protein, cooked, packaged, processed food… without those digestive juices?  





 












 4 tips for training smart 











 exercise is a form of stress! 










 





exercise is a form of stress! 






 
can your body handle the additional stress?



 
not all exercise is stress reducing - most exercise is stress producing!



 
the more intense your workout – the more cortisol you produce, and the more stress you place on the body.



 
maybe your workout is over-loading your body and that’s why you're not burning off the fat and flab!










 intensity matters when it comes to adding lean muscle 










intensity matters when it comes to adding lean muscle 






 
the more intense your workout – the more testosterone (tt) and growth hormone (gh) you produce.



 
your tt and gh spike more when you push your skeletal muscles more so than your heart (cardiac) muscle.



 
tt and gh is what builds and keeps your lean muscle. after age 35 you lose a half a pound of lean muscle a year - unless you spike it with progressive resistance training. hiit, etc.



 
aerobic, endurance training is great, but it's not going to spike your tt and gh as much as you want?








 







 burning the wrong fuel 










 





burning the wrong fuel 






 
the worst thing you can do when you exercise is burn lean muscle (proteins), for energy - but it happens all the time



 
the intensity (the pace) of your workout determines if you burn sugars (carbs and proteins) or fats for energy.



 
don’t assume your aerobic workout is ‘fat-burning’ – you could be training at too fast of a pace, and be burning carbs and proteins (lean muscle) for energy….not fats!

 stress, cortisol and over-stressing your body 











 stress, cortisol and over-stressing your body 






 
aerobic exercise is low intensity, long duration and is stress reducing.



 
too often people do their aerobic activity at a faster pace than they are conditioned for - which adds more stress onto the body.



 
maybe your 'aerobic' workouts are more intense than you think?  which triggers more cortisol?



 
do your workouts and lifestyle keep your cortisol levels elevated, which could be slowing down your results?



 
have you had your cortisol levels measured?








 













 4 tips for thinking better 











 feeding your mind is like feeding your body!

feeding your mind is like feeding your body!  






 
you reap what you sow!



 
your internal dialogue can build you up, just as easily as it can tear you down!



 
saying yes i can is just as powerful as saying no i can't!



 
you control what types of conversations you have between your ears.











 your mind processes about 50,000 thoughts a day

your mind processes about 50,000 thoughts a day! 






 
80% of your thoughts are from yesterday!



 
90% of yesterday's thoughts are slanted negatively.  



 
it's going to take a little extra effort to change/improve our thinking. 



 
positive thinking is a learned skill!











 your subconscious mind never sleeps! 











3

your subconscious mind never sleeps! 






 
you shouldn't feed your body junkie foods before bedtime - so why would you feed your mind junkie thoughts before going to sleep?



 
your conscious mind can direct your subconscious mind when you go to sleep.



 
fall asleep with worry, fear, and anxiety... what kind of attitude do you wake up with?



 
fall asleep with visions of victory, joy, and success... leads to what kind of attitude in the morning?











 are you sleeping with a smile?

sleeping with a smile 






 
are you falling asleep daydreaming about your tomorrow?



 
if you can't visualize your dreams with your eyes closed - how do you expect it to happen with your eyes wide open?



 
if you think you can or think you can't - you're right!



 
positive thinking like hard work, doesn't guarantee success - but it sure does increase your odds.
