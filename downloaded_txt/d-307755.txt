welcome to the center for photographic art (cpa) – tracing our roots back to the friends of photography, founded in 1967, we remain the second oldest members’ photography gallery space in the country. a short walk from ocean avenue in carmel, california brings you to the venerable gallery originally occupied by the friends of photography, launched by iconic artists ansel adams, cole weston, and wynn bullock. today, the cpa continues to serve as a valuable asset to its members, the community, and the greater world of the photographic arts.
