about us

located in greensboro, nc, we have been providing our valued customers with the best quality and selection of designer ceiling fans available since 1979. we developed our website in 2001, palmfanstore.com, only displaying three ceiling fans, each using oversized natural palm leaf blades. eventually we added more fans to showcase our selection, but even then we only offered our vast selection of exclusive palm, bamboo and other tropical style ceiling fans online.
tropical style ceiling fans are still a very popular design choice for indoor or outdoor these days as well. however, due to the success of our website, we decided to add all other styles of ceiling fans to our website, for an even better selection to offer to our online customers. now, whether you came here for large ceiling fans, tropical ceiling fans, outdoor ceiling fans, contemporary, or even rustic ceiling fans, we have every designer style choice you would ever need -- all at the best prices and service available anywhere.
whether you purchase a hunter ceiling fan, a minka aire ceiling fan, a troposair, gulf-coast, or even a fanimation fan, you can expect premium service from the palm fan store.
our goal is to provide you with the best ceiling fans you've ever purchased, the best selection of high quality and unique ceiling fans you have ever seen, and a customer service experience that beats all of your expectations. if we can be of assistance in any way, please do not hesitate to call us about any of our ceiling fans. we can be reached by phone, toll free (888) 446-9331, anytime monday-saturday from 10am - 5pm est.
