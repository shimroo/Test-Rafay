i've been lucky enough to have been featured on television in the united states and canada, in various magazines, on major radio stations, and at my live events i've spoken to thousands of people from all over the world. now i'd like to share what i've learned with you. 
isn't it time that you make the most powerful decision of your life?
and i've made this decision very easy for you because for a limited time, there is a special, very affordable membership option.
because of the number of awesome people becoming members, i can lower the price for everyone so i can reach my personal goal of helping more people connect and find love than ever before!
join now to see the special price for this limited time offer.
because there are two things your heart can't take: 1 - another person not accepting all the love you want to give them. 2 - an ice pick through your thorax. that would pretty much kill you.
still not sure if a premium membership is what you need? then watch this to learn more.

it's time to increase your confidence. and ladies, you need confidence too! 
guys, maybe you're afraid of approaching pretty girls because you've never had anyone to coach you. but now you do. i'll help you succeed. every great athlete started out clumsy and had a great coach to inspire him and teach him every step of the way.
girls, what do you want in a boyfriend or husband? do you know how to attract the kind of guy you want? how long have you desired such a partner?

          what is the cost of doing nothing? 
what would be the consequences of not dealing with the problem right now?
would you say you deserve to get the partner you want?
if you don't think you deserve it, then get out of here! scrrrram-o! 
look, i'm here to help good people who feel like they deserve better. i want to help people who are serious about improving their love life.
with your hogwild membership you will increase your confidence. but how? to increase your confidence you must increase your skill level and your overall attitude about yourself! and those are actually the main benefits of my videos. my dating advice videos make it  fast and easy. 
with your membership you get exclusive access to the member videos that will take you from where you are now, to the best most awesome version of you. and you will see an amazing improvement in yourself. you're going to grow as person and you will see how much more confident you feel about yourself. and believe me, that will translate into you achieving your goal.

here's what fans are saying about hogwild's expert dating advice!


* tim in indiana writes, "thanks to your videos i got myself a date. so i'd like to thank you for the videos, they really helped."
* rose in the u.k. writes, "i love your videos. they're just all so amazing! the dating advice is always spot on and you're so hilarious. thanks for helping so much, 
        'tis more than appreciated."
* kristie t. in syracuse writes, "i am a fan of your dating advice! it's very funny! i like the one on how to give a girl the best kiss ever. so hot! and so true!"
* d. in canada: "i stumbled across your web site one night while i was searching for some advice on how to deal with rejection. i went from a sobby-teary-eyed mess to laughing my head off for the rest of the night. so... thank you!"
* karen in las vegas: "you need to have your own show. you need to be on oprah or jay leno or come to vegas. you are actually addicting, funny, and i think dr. phil doesn't stand a chance. i'm your biggest fan."
* aaron in usa: "i have received more guy help in your 8 minute and 35 second video than all my guy friends have given me in a lifetime. props man."
* d. in wisconsin writes, "i wish boys were born with the knowledge you possess."
* niki in virginia: "as a 33 year old divorced attorney, i felt a bit frivolous typing the words "how do i know i am in love" into a search engine. i am a woman who married young, for practical reasons, and has been very content as cruising the single scene and developing a professional name for myself since divorce. my shelf-life with a man has been like 6-8 weeks, then i get bored and move along. then i met oscar, just two months ago. 
this morning i literally woke up, and just like that song, screamed out "i think i love you." so, the analytical person that i am, i decided to do some internet research, prompting me to conduct the aforementioned search.
        and i read a bunch of articles. psycho-babble. no internal answers were coming.
        then i came across your video. seriously, this is the most real and true helpful piece of advice regarding love i have ever heard.
        i listened once. listened twice. listened three times. and said out loud, i am going to chose to love this man. i have finally met a man worthy of my love.
        so, just wanted to let you know your advice made an impact on some girl in northern va.
        i appreciate your "voice" and intend to keep watching as well. 
        thanks!"
* janice in usa: "i 
  came across your video, how do i know if i'm really in love. i watched it and i was hooked. i've watched all your videos. they're so funny! your videos are very entertaining and you give really good advice."
* k. in new york: "thanks for the great advice hog, it works. i got two numbers at a party last night. sweet!"
* lira in texas writes, "you're both hilarious and helpful! i love your videos!"
* natasha in montreal: "your advice has been the best i've found online. and i looked hard. (i said hard, ha!) you've helped me grasp how guys perceive the things i say."
* o in the usa: 
        "you are the man, seriously. you talk with real wisdom and straight from the heart and you're funny. keep up the good work and all the best."
* a in london: "i am a big fan of yours and you are an inspiration! thank you for all your jokes and positive insight. 
        your videos already helped me lots."
* dylan in iowa writes, "dude, your dating advice works so fast! 
"because of you, i got the girl i wanted. she has already told me she thinks i am finally the right guy for her because i treat her so well. she treats me just as good. 
i think we are going to be together for a long time. thanks again, hog."
