why to add luxury packaging to your product

on the luxury packaging, they choose
choosing a luxury packaging for gift or product plays an extremely important role in its complete vision. thanks to its design, color, and functionality, the packaging can become a symbol of your brand and an integral part of its essence. for example, what do you think of when you see a small light medium robin egg blue box with a white ribbon … tiffany!
imagine you go to the store, buy a great jewel and it is packed in a polyethylene bag? no, just no! each product deserves its luxury packaging.
what is the importance of the pack?
when questioning the overall satisfaction of buying a product is posed, a significant degree of danger of a high level of protection is expected. when you want to get a product, you would like to come with the package that is just as luxurious and attractive. a luxury packaging can not just protect its content but also can add extra value placed on the brand and build customer loyalty.
how to choose an appropriate pack
it is necessary to decide on such an important decision based on three factors: vision, functionality, touch.
vision
do you want your products to easily differentiate on the shelves among other products and to bring to the customers the right premium-quality association? incorporating visual elements such as muted colors, matte coatings and craftsmanship will give your package an extra dose of elegance and refinement.
functionality
users are looking for package products that are easy to open, preserve their strength and are portable. these qualities not only show functionality but also speak of quality and luxury branding.
touch
believe it or not, the sensory qualities of packaging can embody luxury. it is necessary to react to the proper touch, textures, and shapes that are perceived as fancy.
does your packaging complement the quality of your product and brand? make sure you invest in the functional and visual qualities of your packaging to improve the attractiveness of your luxury packaging. contact us for more ideas on how to make your packaging even more luxurious and enticing.

best for many wedding photos

each wedding photo book provider runs books in xl format, which are very suitable for many wedding photos. maximum 2500 photos, but you should limit yourself to the look at 2000.
finally, there are some tips from the weddix editorial team, which you should always take into consideration when choosing your photo book to get the most out of your photos:

ongoing pages: with flat pages you can also look at large portrait photos without the hassle of waves. it is best to ask the supplier directly if this is the case.
good digital camera: no matter how much money and time you invest in a wedding photo book, it is only as good as the quality of the wedding photos!
the right paper. fotopapier lets your photos shine so radically. if a provider does not have this option, you should definitely use premium paper (for example photobox). this is stronger than the normal paper and therefore also more resistant.

photos can be developed: for the sample one can let the fotobuch offerer develop some of the wedding photos. so you get a very good impression about the print quality of the pictures!
cover. most suppliers offer a selection of beautiful covers. for the wedding is best a timeless and high-quality leather binding or linen cover. but also a wedding photo on the cover makes itself particularly good!
