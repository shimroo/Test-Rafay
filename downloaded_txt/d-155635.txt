please click on this document: safearrival user guide (pdf) for information on safearrival and how to set it up. the application is live, and parents and guardians can begin using it immediately. at this time, handwritten notes and phone calls to main offices for absence reporting are also still accepted. questions about safearrival should be directed to the main offices at each school.

neshaminy schools will be closed for the first two snow days (the first of these was called on monday, january 6). any additional snow days called will be asynchronous online learning days. please read the following document for information about snow days and asynchronous online learning: snow day information / asynchronous learning
 

every student, every day
as we transition from summer to the 2024-2025 school year, we want to remind our neshaminy families that every student's attendance, every day, is crucial to their academic success. we need your support to instill the habit of regular school attendance. it's important to understand that students who miss school frequently are at risk of lower academic achievement, failure, and even dropping out. click on the links below to read letters to neshaminy families about the importance of regular attendance and specific information on neshaminy attendance policies.
