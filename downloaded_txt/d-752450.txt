	 jacob's well advent films
	 
    


i was asked to create three short films for the season of advent. the films played after the worship set, before the sermons. i've had some requests for them since they played from people i've bumped into in the hallways of jw. i know, i know - it's now lent, not advent anymore. sorry for being a slow-coach.below are the links, with the accompanying sermons from that week. the scriptures from these weeks follow the traditional church lectionary. each piece was created the week before the sunday it played. tim and i spoke briefly on the phone each week, and he communicated a few themes that were surfacing during his preparation for the sermon.some of the themes include evacuation, wilderness and war. i like to think of these films as ...maybe...avant-garde...? ooh la la!oh, and if you can - watch the videos with headphones on!sunday december 3rd 2006week 1 videomp3 sermon audio - tim keel: the lord is comingsunday december 10th 2006week 2 video (in hd)mp3 sermon audio - tim keel: prepare the waysunday december 17th 2006week 3 videomp3 sermon audio - shayne wessel: joy in the wilderness

	 andalf
	 
    


andalf was the best-known of the maiar of valinor, a servant of the valar, the powers of the world, and of eru ilúvatar, the one. in valinor he was known as andórin, and was said to be the wisest of the maiar. he dwelt in the gardens of irmo and was the pupil of nienna, the patron of mercy. when the valar decided to send the order of the welshmen to middle-earth in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed sandwon, andórin was proposed by manwë. in the order, he had a strained, competitive relationship with sandwon, its head.

	 stealth
	 
    


if there is such a thing as a born detective, i am one. i am fortunate to have been able to earn my living in a career i would have worked in for free. for over five decades, i have practiced and perfected my craft. i have traveled and lived all over the world, met colorful characters at all levels of society, contributed to the improvement of our world and, most importantly, to myself. i envy no person, neither his nor her career.my work brought me into contact with five generations of burglars, murderers, spies, kidnappers, swindlers, heroes, warriors, and cowards. i've known people from all walks of life, from the british house of lords to the person on the corner. along the way, i collected a number of wives, 3½ kids, a bullet wound, and the usual assortment of beatings and broken bones for my line of work.

	 it's time to go hunting again
	 
    


last year, me and luke goes huntin' and we gits our elk! well, at least i got my elk. luke however, suffered from undue disappointment, not having procured his own meat. maybe this year will yield better luck for him. i remember last time we hunted hearing luke muttering things like 'i fear we may not survive...' and, 'i fear we are running dangerously low on beer...' and other things of that nature. anyway - let's leave behind the fantasy of video game kills and get out into the wild and drag another elk down by our bare hands. what say ye?

	 press release - breaking news
	 
    


andrew michael's agent, monty panesar says that andrew is "resolute in his determination to avoid blog death."following a speaking tour in south korea, mr. michael gave an exclusive interview to time magazine in december. "my hiatus from blogging reminds me rather of the defect in the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes from the thorax into the abdomen. this is called an esophageal hiatus. a great deal of speculation has arisen recently in the press about whether or not i would continue writing my blog. lay your worries aside. i am back." monty panesar says andrew wishes everyone a happy new year full of mystery and delight.

	 jacob's well article
	 
    


"the songs are new, and the words are flashed up on a plasma screen by powerpoint, but the language is as old as scripture. most songs, in fact, are paraphrases of scripture. and as loud as the music is, the singing is louder. andy crouch of christianity today, who is critical of much of the emergent movement, praises jw as "the best singing white church i've ever been to." jw's effort to make music participatory rather than performance-based struck a chord with crouch, who also signaled his awareness that jw is rooted in its own particular neighborhood and could not be easily replicated elsewhere: "it made me want to move to kansas city. really."check out the complete article here. i would say that this is a fairly accurate representation of who jacob's well is. i really enjoyed reading this article, written by christian century magazine.

	 world cup fever
	 
    


i've got my hd package. i've got my hd television. i've got my england shirt. i'm supporting england first, and usa second. i would have preferred 1080i for all the games, but 720p will have to suffice. hdnet have great looking games in 1080i, but i'm sure 720p will still be a good step up from 480i. come on england!
