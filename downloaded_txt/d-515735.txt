    simplify with digital thread






    


    


            


  
  
      the ibm elm portfolio applications all harness a digital foundation 
(digital thread) to establish traceability across the development 
environment that not only provides a single view of all data, but 
also leverages an industry-standard, open exchange format of 
open services for lifecycle collaboration (oslc).

      use your digital thread relationships among requirements, designs, 
tests, etc. to understand the implications of potential changes. 
lower your costs and improve your confidence when doing change 
management. use interactive  analysis tools, visualizations of your 
engineering knowledge graph, and create reports on the web and 
in documents using common formats.
  




    


        


























        



  
    streamline compliance






    


    


            


  
  
      elm tools integrate industry standards and regulatory requirements into 
development process, streamlining change management from 
requirements to testing. this approach helps ensure compliance and 
allows thorough impact assessment of changes. this streamlines the 
entire change management process, encompassing everything from 
requirements to testing and ensures compliance is achieved and 
maintained, while also allowing for a thorough assessment of the impact 
of any changes
  




    


        


























        



  
    improve team efficiency






    


    


            


  
  
      elm supports collaborative development, connecting all functions and geographically dispersed teams. it helps ensure seamless coordination, effective communication and efficient project tracking, regardless of location or size.
