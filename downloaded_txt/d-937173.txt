classroom cash in action
i want to again thank you for awarding us a grant for geometry materials. the materials have been very beneficial to student learning.  it is always challenging to take formulas for surface area and volume of three-dimensional objects and make it meaningful to students.  however, when students take apart shapes and see their nets or when they pour water into the shapes to see, for example, that the volume of a cone is just one-third of the volume of a cylinder, it makes learning make sense!
thank you for supporting our kids!
