step back in time
history, myth and legend take you back to a magical past in these lands which the celts called ‘the blessed isles of the west’. here is a living landscape awesome in its power, beauty and symbolism. pass through the veil of time and follow in the footsteps of legendary figures such as merlin, arthur and morgan le fay.
on our soul journeys, we travel through some of the most beautiful parts of the british and irish countryside, including places known only to a few. we visit early celtic christian and pagan sites such as holy wells, enchanted forests, stone circles, dolmens of the dead and fairy mounds  – all with a story to tell. in these magical places we create the space for you to connect with your own inner wisdom, to receive messages from the ancestors, messages that have meaning for you in this lifetime. we provide you with information about the sacred sites, but the real experience is how you respond to the emotions the landscapes and sites bring forth as you pass through the veil of time.
special guests
a highlight of our tours are the local guests who have specialist knowledge and insights into the history, myths and legends of the places we visit. they include authors, poets and musicians. 
explore your inner landscape through tarot

a unique feature of our tours is the way we invoke the power of the tarot to reveal the link between your individual soul journey and the journey you’re taking with us. linda, co-host on the tours, is a tarot reader, teacher and author. her light-hearted, but insightful approach to reading the cards often leads to unexpected insights!
have fun!
our journeys offer a wonderful mixture of laughter and quiet times when we each surrender to the magic of the landscape and encounters with the ancestors. enjoying the company of like-minded people as you escape your everyday world can be a powerful healing experience.
relax in comfort

to sustain you on your soul journey, we provide comfortable, traditional-style accommodation. meals are delicious and we do everything we can to ensure that your dietary requirements are met. and last but not least, as your tour hosts, we give you our undivided attention and expertise.
pre-tour service
we love the sense of excitement and anticipation that builds from the moment people decide to embark on one of our spiritual travel experiences. they’re thinking about flights, what clothes to take, and maybe planning a few extra days in the uk or ireland. this is where our excellent pre-tour service comes in. we can help you find the best flights, plan your extra days and generally answer any questions you have about getting ready for your journey.
