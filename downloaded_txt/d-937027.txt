i continue to be so grateful for your excellent support that made cooper’s birth such a positive and healthy experience for me. from the moment i heard your voice coming into the delivery room, you helped me. your constant presence and skill encouraged me on, and helped me feel calm, focused, and strong. what an incredible difference having the right support makes, and i’m so very thankful.barack obama
