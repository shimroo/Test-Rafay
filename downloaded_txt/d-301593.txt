dedication
this site is dedicated to all those who yearn for spiritual awakening, realization and freedom,
and serves as a source for investigations into the spiritual process, both pre and post
realization. it is also dedicated to those who value spiritual practice and resultant
insight and understanding. it attempts to honor the traditions of high dharma, 
such as dzogchen and mahamudra buddhism, advaita vedanta, kashmir shaivism, sufism and taoism,
and the many great teachers from those and other traditions. may all attain great freedom
and bliss!

five immeasurables
may all beings have happiness
and the causes of happiness.

may all beings have no suffering
nor the causes of suffering.
may all beings dwell in supreme bliss
free from all sorrow and suffering.

and may all being rest in great equanimity
free from all attachment, addiction, indifference and aversion.

and may all beings wake up
to recognize their true self-nature.
