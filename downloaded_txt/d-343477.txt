an important note about this resource:
we have used many sources, including fcc files, university lecturers, historical publications and more, and have tried to be as accurate as possible, not repeating many of the myths of the industry (such as the uncle don story) nor histories "manufactured" by promotion departments. however, i am not perfect, and may well have overlooked something. if you do see an error or omission, please let me know.
the accuracy and expansion of this resource depend upon our sharing our efforts.
