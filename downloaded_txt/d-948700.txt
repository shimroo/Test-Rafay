  “these texas wildlife shooting houses are awesome! they're great for filming, hunting and more importantly they allow you to enjoy your hunt with your family and friends. i just wish they weren't so comfortable because i can't get some of my relatives to move out of them. seriously folks, i wouldn't have anything else!”
