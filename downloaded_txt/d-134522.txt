                        to record live stats and track player data. their customer service and commitment to integrating their system to fit our needs was above
                        and beyond what we could've hoped for. whether you're looking to record advanced statistics and break down player efficiency, or 
                        just need a scoring system for inexperienced operators, turbostats has an operating system to cater to your needs."
                    
- evan andariese, director hoopgroup, neptune nj



                        "gonzaga prep started using turbostats 5 years ago. during that time we had two 3rd place finishes 
                        at state and the last two years back to back state championships. the software is always improving, 
                        which gives us the tools to see where we need to improve. turbostats was an integral part of our success.
                        thank you turbostats."
                    
- rex head, head coach, boys basketball cgonzaga prep, spokane wa



                        "coaches, if you need a great stat program with ability to webcast and track all the basketball metrics stats built-in, turbostats is for you."
                    
- jerry mullen, top national college scout, 25 years



                        "i have used your product during basketball season the past two years. it is an outstanding product and definitely makes life as a coach a lot easier.... thank you for a fine product."
                    
- murray dennis, head basketball coach, trenton high school, mo



                        "turbostats was a tremendous asset to our mt. mansfield union high school varsity football team. after each game, we devoted hours transferring the play-by-play data into the hudl site to match each video clip. now with turbostats, i can upload an entire gameï¿½s series of plays with one click."
                    
- tom myers, mmu vermont



                        "just wanted to thank you for creating and marketing such a fine product. i started using turbostats for football this season for the first time, and am amazed at how easy it was to catch on to. i tried scoring a game live. everything went perfectly! i was actually bored at halftime, waiting for the second half to start. once again, thanks for a great product."
                    
- dave thomas, hedgesville, wv



                        "i have been using turbostats now for 4 or 5 years and it's by far the best software on the market. it has made keeping stats easier, and the organization of information on each player has been helpful for recruiting. i have been able to use the summary statistics as part of the portfolios for those players who are trying to play in college. each of your upgrades makes the software better and better. the program is so easy, our managers actually enjoy doing the statistics. thanks for a great tool! "
                    
- bob thomas, head varsity baseball coach, princeton day school, princeton, nj



                        "no coach should be without the turbostats program. if you think you know your players, you should think again. turbostats presents you with the unbiased raw facts a coach needs to put their best players out there. when questions arise about the decisions i make, i now have statistical summaries to validate everything i do. if you don't have it and are using something else, you're wasting your time - get turbostats."
                    
- trini guillen, edward reed hs, reno, nv



                        "i take down all the live stats from our games, and i'm able to do things such as calculate an individual player's efficiency, and track where we're shooting well and poorly from on the floor. the ability to do that during a game and make adjustments at halftime has helped me out a lot."
                    
- john leighton, head basketball coach, franklin hs, franklin, ma



                        "your turbostats software program has really impressed the league i'm in. my own team went undefeated for the season winning 15 straight!!! i have to give part of the credit to turbostats for keeping all coaches, players and their parents accurately informed of our strengths and weaknesses."
