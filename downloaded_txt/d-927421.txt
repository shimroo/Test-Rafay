				warning: beware of fraudulent toll-payment text messages			

warning! scammers are using text messages about unpaid tolls to trick motorists into providing credit card numbers and other financial information. these unsolicited texts state that an unspecified toll is owed and payment must be provided immediately to avoid fines and license revocation. don’t be duped! don’t click on text-message links and provide personal information like a driver’s license number or financial information like a credit card number. the commission urges e-zpass account holders and toll by plate customers to use approved safe methods to check accounts and toll bills administered by the commission’s toll-processor — the new jersey e-zpass customer service center. all commission toll by plate bills are sent to a respective vehicle owner by u.s. mail — not by text messages to cell phones.
