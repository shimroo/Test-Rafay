i’ve been bitten by dogs twice while appraising homes. one of them was a labrador. it looked friendly until it trotted over and chomped on my leg. it filled my boot with blood and ruined my pants. the owner covered my trip to the er, i think she was afraid i’d undervalue her house in retaliation. the other dog was so old, all he could do was hang on to my ankle while i dragged him around the property. the owner told me to kick him off, but he was so old, small and toothless i couldn’t bring myself to do it.
