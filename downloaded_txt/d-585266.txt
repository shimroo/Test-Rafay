our story
michigan united credit union was established on july 1, 2021 as a result of the merging of four small-asset sized credit unions namely birmingham bloomfield credit union, metro north federal credit union, lakes community credit union and unity credit union. the collaboration of these credit unions created an exciting opportunity for us to deliver a top-notch experience for our membership with an expanded line of products and services.  on november 23, 1931, birmingham teachers was organized and charted in the state of michigan by a group of teachers. located in a classroom at barnum elementary school, the credit union was originally created to serve the teachers and other employees of the birmingham school system… read more

testimonials 









 







excellent credit union...excellent customer service!

we just moved to holly and were looking for a new bank. we began visiting them all, one by one. our last stop was metro north. we instantly felt at home because it was so personable, but still sat down with the manager to ask all the pertinent questions. one month later, not only have we switched our checking and savings accounts, but also have refinanced our home with a fantastic rate!

we recommend metro north/birmingham bloomfield credit union to everyone.

having lived and worked in birmingham for many years, i would like to commend the birmingham/bloomfield credit union on their fine personalized service. there are few ‘local’ banking establishments remaining where the staff knows the customers and are ready to suggest services from which they would benefit.this location is a great benefit to the community.

i would like to offer my gratitude to bbcu for the help offered me after my purse was stolen. shannon was my main go-to person and in spite of not feeling well helped me many times to get me up and going once again. then 2 weeks later, my debit card was hacked. i was immediately informed by pam, and we stopped the card and a new one was issued. it’s nice to know that things are watched and we are protected before things get worse. i have been a bbcu member for for 48 years. thank you for all of the services that is provided to us.
