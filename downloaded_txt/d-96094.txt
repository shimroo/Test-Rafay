liquid  illuzion



a viz'ual journey, driven by my insatiable curiosa...
my wish for you is to have no regrets as you wander and sometimes stumble throughout your life. that you create the ability to pause and to feel, the delicacy in moments, allowing each to tickle the palate of your imagination. i pray that the ebb and the flow guide you safely, with both comfort and with grace, through each delicious drink you take.  i invite you to share with me, my journey, as i sip slowly through the gift of my heart.

remembering suzanne a.k.a. liquid



bloggers around the world have written beautiful tributes to our beloved suzanne a.k.a. liquid, who passed away on christmas eve. if you have written such a tribute, link it here so that everyone can enjoy it, especially the family.jazz has made suzanne’s guest book permanent, so if you haven’t signed it, do so here. the white family is in the process of creating a living memorial to suzanne, and they will announce it as soon as all the details are worked out. on behalf of the white family, they so appreciate your loving support.link your tribute to suzanne here. warning - some of these tributes will be very candid, as the mode of suzanne passing is no secret.  suzanne has always tried very hard to be open and honest with her readers, i am sure she would want you to do the same. no disrespect intended, but please link to your tribute pages, otherwise it will be deleted.-----for the christians who have emailed me about suzanne and heaven, bo ragon wrote this to me and i asked if i could share it with you; christian view of suicide. hope it helps. - amias

because:if i have been a bad girl..........it may well have depended on the situation at hand.if i have acted out in a bad way......i'm sure you know the conditions i was forced to act under.if i was sneaky........you'll know i had no choice in the matter. (no rules in love and war, right?)if i had bad thoughts dancing in my head.........like really bad thoughts.....you'll notice i didn't act upon those. i just allowed them to dance for awhile.if i was naughty.............i was good at it. no complaints. just requests for more.if i seemed cruel and heartless...........i just evened the score! if you see me dressed somewhat like you on christmas eve.......please take no personal offense.consider it a "treat" for someone who has been really good.oh, and if you saw me dip the cat's feet in red paint and toss her onto the trampoline.....well, you've got me there!love,liquid

 and i think i'm gonna' sleep right here under it!whew!and just for the record......bigger ain't necessarily better either!i've always wanted a huge tree but "dingle-shnork" always talked me out of it.so, since i didn't have to argue about "size" with any one this year i went out and got me a monster tree.,a very mean, monster tree.it whipped my butt!it took the children (who were more like, in and out) and ialmost 4 hours to get that bad boy up and decorated!now i'm exhausted, coverd in sap and stuck to the carpet on the floor 'neath" the tree.it's not too bad though, the children keep bringing me cookies and i have my spray bottle filled and am now on cat - duty!(it's aggie's first christmas)every time she even looks at the tree or comes near me i" pffffsssssssssst", "pfffffffffffffssssssssssst", "pfffffffffsssssssssst"her really good with water!yeah, i'm gonna' be right here for awhile!goodnight to you all and hope you have sweet dreams!i need another cookie!

here i go!



  i really do not have many words today. just a lot of feelings.winter is a time for seeking refuge, for our mind, body and spirit.but i refuse.there are lots of changes going on inside of meand i feel like i am jumping off into the deep end without my "floaties" on.yet, at the same time, i feel my power welling up inside of meand i am in search of the tallest cliff imaginable so that even in the moment where i need to be still and grow, i am taking action and standing up for my self.so, today i just feel like putting on my swimming suit,and plunging into the water from heights i've never been before.here i go!

sipping joy.....



 oh, the refreshing sip of life that has for so long, been gone.to be spoken to and treated like a lady.to have someone to compliment you, constantly and about the simplest of things.to actually take me on a surprise "getaway" to some where wonderfully romantic and extravagant.to hear the words, "what ever you want, doll."to be looked at as if he were drinking of me.it's been 3 months since we've seen each other.and i realize now.......that i missed him!ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,how delicious life feels, when you begin to start "living" it again.i think i'm gonna just linger in this moment for a bit.if ya'll don't mind.:)-have a super weekend!

marriage.....



 this 80 year old woman was arrested for shop lifting. when she went before the judge in cincinnati he asked her,"what did you steal?"she replied, "a can of peaches."the judge then asked her why she had stolen the can of peachesand she replied that she was hungry. the judge then asked her how many peaches were in the can. she replied 6.the judge then said,"i will then give you 6 days in jail."before the judge could actually pronounce the punishment, the woman's husband spoke up and asked the judge if he could say something. the judge said,"what is it?"the husband said, "she also stole a can of peas."

back in the 1929 financial crashit was said that some wall street stockbrokers and bankers jumped from their office windows and committed suicide when confronted with the news of their firms' and clients' financial ruin. many people were said to have almost felt a little sorry for them. . .in 2008 the attitude has changed  now the signs read, "jump you idiots!"somewhat. . .

raccoon bandit - hilarious!



this youtube video features a daring heist.but theft isn’t what you’re expecting!when you live near the wilderness, sometimes you get unexpected guests.this sneaky raccoon is caught on camera.it creeps into this house through a dog door.then it heads straight for the dog bowl.but it can’t compete with the household cat and dog. raccoons are wild animals.they naturally stick to wooded areas.but they are also incredibly adaptable.as man moved into their habitat, they didn’t run.raccoons have little problem living in urban environments.these kinds of encounters are not uncommon!hilarious!

mimi writes blog


in november 2008 let's continue the revolution and begin an evolution.... 
one in which the power of our words manifests intrinsic change and expands our compassion for and understanding of people everywhere, 
dictates a respect for diversity, 
and calls me - and my neighbors - 
to a place of peace. 

that is the hope i have for myself. it is my hope for you. 
if words are powerful....then this matters.  ~mimi writes
