stream the rabbbits
“the rabbbits” is a rock opera. think post-factual animal farm meets aesop’s fables on lsd. delusionville tells the story of a society that was formed as different animals fell down a rabbbit hole and created a world with their own mythologies, religion, and politics. every animal group represents an embedded archetype in the social structure that is about to come into question.  as time goes on the animals get riled up about the economic disparity and social injustice in their previously unquestioned world of delusion. heroes rise up and inflate the ambitions of the underprivileged, only to be deflated in the end by apathy.
