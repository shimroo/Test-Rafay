the pages provided here are meant to serve as a resource to provide useful
  information so it might not look that fancy. 


these pages were created and are maintained solely by jim lubin, who is a c2
quadriplegic, completely paralyzed from the neck down and dependent on a
ventilator to breathe, using an keyboard/mouse emulator with a sip and
puff switch to type morse codes. this site has been online since 1994. 
i have been busy with other projects, so this web site might not get updated as frequently as it had been in the past. information will be updated when i have
  time.


this site can now be reached using the shorter url www.makoa.org. "makoa" is a hawaiian word that means "courageous".
