welcome to the web home of ridley park united methodist church (rpumc).
worship
a service of worship is held every sunday at 10:45 am in the sanctuary (upper entrance on dupont street). all are welcome. we use relatively traditional prayers and music but the message is geared to faith application in modern daily living.
join us in the church at 501 n swarthmore ave, ridley park, pa 19078 or join us on zoom.
the sacrament of the lord’s table is always the first sunday of the month and coffee fellowship is hosted after every worship.
mission
our mission is to provide safe and welcoming spaces in which everyone and anyone may develop a meaningful relationship with god through jesus christ. through ministries of worship, service, education, and nurturing, and more, it is our goal to teach and practice the teachings of jesus and through action become a means of god’s grace to a hurting and needy world.
“trust in the lord with all your heart and do not rely on your own understanding. seek god’s will in all you do and god will direct your paths.” proverbs 3:5-6 (nlt)
giving
the generosity of members and friends allows us to pursue our mission and continue to open our doors to our neighbors. giving may be done in worship, of course, and by mail to the address above. online giving is recommended through your personal online banking platforms, saving the church fees to giving platforms, and insuring that 100% of your gift is directed to the area of your choice: general church fund, trustees/building upkeep & maintenance, and missions (food pantry).  more information can be found on our giving page.
“for god loves a cheerful giver.” 2corinthians 9:7
