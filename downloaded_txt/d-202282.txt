launch update





thank you for all your input!along with the launch of the new design, new url address... i will also have one more surprise. unfortunately i cannot announce it until later... but i can't wait!meanwhile when the new site is up there will be at least 1 new post a day which will give me flexibility to post more about everyday things, fashion on a budget, and all of the other things you all love! i will add outfit pictures to the "wearing today" as well as keep all of your other suggestions in mind.i will post the new url later today as soon as it is up! :) :)*edit: the "domain people" are taking longer than normal to get my site up and running. :( (seriously, i bought the domain on www.domainpeople.com) but they promise to get it up and running by tonight so we'll see. :(
