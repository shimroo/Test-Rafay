why no gft 140.6 ultra?
2023 marked the 33rd and final year for the full 140.6 mile great floridian triathlon. celebrating a 33 year run, the adventhealth great floridian triathlon is florida's original full distance triathlon and is the longest running independent (non-ironman or challenge licensed) full distance triathlon in the world! over the years the race has attracted participants from all 50 states and more than 30 countries and has served as the usat ultra-distance championship for eight years.  in its peak year, the gft had more than 1,000 registrants in the 140.6 distance alone. declining participation in full distance triathlons, coupled with increased costs for traffic control and all race supplies, left us no choice but to no longer offer the 140.6 distance. there is always the chance the full distance race could come back should demand for independent 140.6 races increase, or suitable new less costly venue be found. the adventhealth great floridian endurance festival will continue on in 2024 with our new gft 44 distance, along with sprint distance offerings. it will also serve as the championship event for sommer sports new clermont running and triathlon series, offering double points for all finishers. don't miss out on another opportunity to race up sugarloaf mountain and be present when the 2024 clermont running and triathlon series champions are announced!.be part of an epic race experience, register now!
