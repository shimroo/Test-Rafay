jane a 






						 “i registered for a diploma course last year at the college and i have received brilliant and consistent support at all times. the response time is exceptional, the coursework is great and straight forward. i also enjoy the method used by the college as we submit the entire work on a set date which allows us to study at our own pace and improve our time management skills without the of feeling pressure. my experience has been excellent and therefore, i am looking forward to apply for future courses once i complete the current diploma.” thank you very much for the great assistance.”

		introduction to anatomy and physiologywhat is exactly is the human anatomy? what is anatomy and physiology and how do these two branches of science relate to each other? anatomy is the science of the structure of living beings. aristotle, the philosopher and father of biological science, first used the term 2,300 years ago. he theorized that bodies of all living beings were composed of a small number of substances: water, air, earth, and fire. as we move from general to particular properties of living beings, according to aristotle, structure becomes more important than function. to understand the function of any organ or system, living or dead, it needed first to be studied in relationship to its structure. since aristotle, the science of anatomy has made significant progress. the study of large structures of the human body, those visible to the naked eye, is called gross or macroscopic anatomy. anterior, ventral, or front and posterior, dorsal, or back are used to indicate the direction of the body or body parts. structures above others are said to be superficial or external while those below are deep or interior. when one is standing, the top of the head is superior to, and the foot is inferior. when a person is lying down, the top of the head and the foot are caudal and rostral, respectively. anatomy and physiology are two separate subjects, but they are well practiced together, especially in reference to modern medicine. anatomy is the study of the physical structure of the body and how it works. for example, the body's organs are composed of many different types of cells. each cell uses proteins and oxygen to function. physiologists study the processes that govern functions in living organisms, ranging from the most basic physiological processes at the molecular and cellular levels to complex functions of whole animals, such as movement, cell processes, reproduction, and behavior. physiology is intimately linked to anatomy, as the function of an organ is directly related to its structure. to learn more, see our anatomy & physiology course here:www.opencollege.info/product/anatomy-and-physiology-course/#anatomycourse #physiologycourse #humanbody #healthscience #medicaleducation #anatomybasics #physiologyforbeginners #scienceeducation #learnanatomy
