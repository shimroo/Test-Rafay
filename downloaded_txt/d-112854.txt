24-seven locksafe rubber tiles



new 24-seven® locksafe® rubber tiles by wearwell® let you make the most of the time and money you invest in your matting program. there is a ton of effort that goes into making the right decision, getting the approvals, scheduling the install and getting those mats in place. choose 24/seven® locksafe® with a patent pending positive interlock system, so you can “lockdown” the mats securely and they stay together. positive systems lock in: both male and female connectors have a flange that lock together and provide a secure connection in all directions. why it matters: they don’t come apart until you want them to! lift up, roll up and roll away for removal or maintenance.
the gr compound is best suited for areas with water and dry debris.
the nbr compound is best suited for areas with water and dry debris, plus petroleum based products.
new! 24/7® locksafe® grade a interlocking rubber tiles for covering large areas quickly in food production and processing plants.
