weather alert


headline: extreme cold warning until thu 12:00 pm cst
bulletin: ...extreme cold warning remains in effect until 11 am mst /noon cst/
thursday...

* what...a prolonged period of dangerously cold wind chill readings
as low as 30 below zero.

* where...entire tri-state area.

* when...until 11 am mst /noon cst/ thursday.

* impacts...wind chill readings of this magnitude may quickly lead
to frostbite and hypothermia in unprotected humans, pets and
livestock. frostbite may occur on exposed skin in less than 30
minutes. extended periods of below zero temperatures may rupture
water pipes.

* additional details...wind chill readings ranging from 20 to 30
below zero will prevail today through late wednesday morning and
wednesday evening through late thursday morning. throughout the
entire warning period, wind chill readings warmer than 10 below
zero will be far and few between.

precautionary/preparedness actions...

if you absolutely must venture outdoors, make sure to wear
appropriate clothing. dress in multiple layers, including a hat and
gloves. make frequent checks on older family, friends, and
neighbors. ensure portable heaters are used correctly. do not use
generators or grills inside.

young or smaller animals are at greatest risk for frostbite and
hypothermia. having abundant and accessible feed will help animals
maintain body temperature and survive cold temperatures. keep pets
indoors as much as possible. make sure outdoor animals have a warm,
dry shelter, food, and unfrozen water.
