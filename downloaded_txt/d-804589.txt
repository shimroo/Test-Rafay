		meet sebastian, a charming four-year-old on a journey to recovery after a broken leg.with his sweet yet spirited personality, he's sure to make you giggle constantly. once he loves you, he forms an incredibly loyal bond, making every moment together special—even if he can sometimes be a little dramatic!we believe sebastian would thrive in an adult-only foster home, but homes with older kids (15 and up) are also a possibility. this lovable guy has done well with other dogs in the past, but he'd prefer to steer clear of any feline friends.sebastian loves to showcase his playful, husky nature—whether he's engaging in a game of tag or playing with his favorite squeaky toys. at the end of the day, all he really wants is to be the star of the show! if you're ready to provide a warm, loving space for this cutie, he can't wait to meet you!if you'd like to learn more about fostering sebastian, please email foster@pethavenlane.org
