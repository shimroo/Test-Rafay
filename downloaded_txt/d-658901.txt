department of environmental sciences at the university of california, riverside

















 
we are a multidisciplinary department within the college of natural and agricultural sciences at uc riverside with both undergraduate and graduate programs in environmental science. we seek to expand knowledge of the physical, chemical, biological and human components of the earth system, through cutting-edge research, rigorous student training and service to the community. our department consists of faculty, graduate students, postdocs and research staff working within and across the fields of atmospheric sciences, environmental chemistry & ecotoxicology, hydrologic sciences, and soil & water sciences.

diversity, equity, and inclusion
the department of environmental sciences is committed to creating an environment of mutual respect by welcoming participation of students, staff, and faculty from all groups regardless of race, culture, age, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, citizenship status, language, physical or mental difference, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, subculture, geographic region, and more. to serve all parts of the community equitably, this commitment is critical to sustaining the social fabric of our department, ucr, and the state of california. we, therefore, pledge to work towards equitable treatment and accessibility in our policies and procedures. we recognize that historically marginalized groups are underrepresented within the sciences, and we commit to move towards remedying underrepresentation within our teaching, training, hiring, and outreach. this is particularly relevant for environmental sciences, as our field often reveals structural inequities in environmental impacts related to human activities, such as communities experiencing a higher burden of pollution. moreover, we recognize that 1) the diversity of california’s population has been, and continues to be, the source of innovative ideas and creative accomplishments throughout the state’s history, and that 2) the university of california was built on the mandate of making higher education available to all. we promise to fulfill that mandate to the best of our abilities through our department’s words, actions, and policies.

















 
undergraduate program
 
our undergraduate program exposes students to a wide array of environmental science disciplines and prepares them for careers in state/federal resource agencies, private consulting and for graduate education.
