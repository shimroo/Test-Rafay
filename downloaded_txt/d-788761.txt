i got my tapes today! thanks for the prompt service. some other duplication service companies still haven't returned my call or email regarding their turn-around times. even though you're half way across the country, you managed to be faster and more affordable than any other duplication company i've dealt with. bravo!

i received the dvd and watched it to see that it works properly (which, of course, it does). i would like to thank you for a quality transaction. your service was to-the-point and extremely prompt, the conversion was of a higher quality than i had hoped for (given the tape was so old) ... and the price was very reasonable. the disk brought back some fond memories and hence i am indebted for your good work.

i just wanted to let you know that we had a first presentation of the material today, and showed one of the dvds. it went really well--the work you did is excellent, and it's great to have this material in usable format.
