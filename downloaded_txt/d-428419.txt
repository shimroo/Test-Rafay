my personal art and collectables sale

posted on october 24, 2024  by  mary 





as i creep up on 83, i find myself wanting to be assured that my lifetime collection of beloved art, much of it mine or made by friends and family, will find good homes should i ever need to move to smaller quarters on short notice. starred items are reserved for friends and family until everyone has made his or her choice, at which time the star will be removed. i’ll include any pertinent information i have for each piece. new items will be added as sold or claimed items removed. billing will be through paypal unless other arrangements, such as check or cash, are made. shipping and sales tax will be added to any purchase. large or heavy items will require pickup. any items can be picked up when purchased locally. so stay tuned! items will be posted soon. new items will be added every week. check back often. note:  oops! this post was mistakenly sent as an email to my subscribers. i’m not quite ready with the list yet. i will add that page soon.
