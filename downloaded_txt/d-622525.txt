current family
“valley school’s tight-knit community has played a major role in our children's education. the school culture is warm and caring. teachers and administrators are always willing to help in any way they can. the combination of nurturing the whole character of our children, as well as providing opportunities for rigor in academics have been very important to us as parents.”




current family
“valley school has a well-balanced curriculum rooted in traditions that build a learning community.  the sense of community among students, faculty, and families is invaluable.” 




alumnus
“valley school instilled in me confidence to go and do whatever i set out to achieve. it provided me with relationships to fall back on during the toughest times.”




alumna
“valley school was a family for me; my classmates were like brothers and sisters. the most valuable lessons i learned were many soft skills: to include everyone, to forgive and forget, to be honest, to share, to be open to the ideas and opinions of others, and to appreciate what i have.”




current family
“valley school provides a comprehensive educational experience while ensuring children grow into responsible community members. older students take care of the younger students; young students admire and respect the older students. everyone interacts across grade-levels. children look adults in the eye and greet them when they pass in the hallway. these behavior examples demonstrate how valley school fosters an environment of responsibility and care.”




current lower school student
“i love coming to school because my teachers are so happy to see me every day!”




alumna
“looking back, i can see how essential valley school was to my becoming the person i am today. it was a wonderful experience. i recall that even as a kid, i felt fortunate to be there.”
