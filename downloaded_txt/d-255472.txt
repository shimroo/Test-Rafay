my big brother

i am heart broken to report that my

 brother tom suddenly passed away

 tuesday, 
            jan 2, 2018  i looked up to my

 brother for 70 
            years, he was a very

 special person, he 
            made me a better

 person.  
            what i will miss most is the

 love and support he gave to everyone,

 not only me.  the 
            memory i treasure

 most is no matter how down he was

 feeling i  could always make him laugh.

top cat, love always

..your 
            brother bear
