welcome to the fitzpatrick institute for photonics






 

january 29, 2025
 | pratt school of engineering
superfast cooling explores new abilities for promising next generation optoelectronic materials
stabilizing the glassy state of materials using rare instrumentation unlocks a new line of research for perovskites

 

january 27, 2025
 | duke today
the universe is expanding more quickly than we thought
a new measurement confirms what previous — and highly debated — results had shown: the universe is expanding faster than predicted by theoretical models, and faster than can be explained by our current understanding of physics.

this discrepancy between model and data became known as the hubble tension. now, results published in the astrophysical journal letters provide even stronger support to the faster rate of expansion.

 

november 18, 2024

new frontiers in space
satellite antenna developed by ece research scientist michael boyarsky can take images faster and more often than existing technology

 

november 15, 2024
 | duke today
soundwaves that shed new light
junjie yao's imaging technology 'listens' to the sound of light to study different biological phenomena

 

october 23, 2024

seeing duke in a whole new color
new program allows color blind duke personnel to borrow enchroma color enhancing glasses from the library for up to a week at a time

 

june 13, 2024
 | duke magazine
weird science
david smith studies metamaterials and how they turn our understanding of physics inside out

an extensively interdisciplinary duke-wide effort to advance photonics and optical sciencesour mission is profoundly educational. the institute was founded in 2000 to meet an industry need for graduates with the knowledge and skills to transform industrial r&d in photonics and optical science.our faculty teach undergraduates, masters and doctoral students and foster the technical, collaboration, interdisciplinary exploration, and team-orientation skillset that enables our proteges to thrive in their chosen professions.about duke fip
