fearsome is in low power mode!
what's that mean for you, discerning pixel poker? most likely, what you see is what you get. some parts of the site may not be working 100%, and there's a possibility that if it's broken, it might stay that way for a while.
if you can't log in to your account, drop a line. we should be able to reset your user flags.
if you can't get the applet to run, make sure your java installation is up to date, and make sure you're drawing with chickenpaint; the other applets are mostly deprecated, and might not successfully post your art (if you can even load them up at all).

				looks like we've reached a sort of event horizon for oekaki! chickenpaint is still working, but it seems like everyone's moved on from this style of bbs. bummer!i'll leave the board operational for as long as it continues to function. and probably longer, just so the pictures can stay up. dunno if anyone still lurks anymore, but if you do... hello! how are you?what's ruby singing about? it probably sounds like a cat being dragged backwards across a blackboard.

				i still look every day.. dont give up... 2draw was suffering from the java death..and was brought back with cheerpj... a couple new applets were added... kleki, chicken paint, and lascaux 2...in addition the old ones still work there too.. now people have been coming back...

@ saturday, july 31st 2021, 1:14 am








				believe it or not i'm still lurking around too, and i just sent you a message to see how things are as well. glad to see some new art from you gd, lovely work! :)

				yeah... ever since social media came along, individual web sites have been drying up.  not just oekaki, but blogs and everything else.  my oekaki gets about 10 unique people a month, down from a few hundred a decade ago.  there's no way to solve that problem.  search engines just don't take you to small sites anymore.i'm still maintaining wacintaki, though.  a new version of chickenpaint is available, and it supposedly fixes a few more tablet pressure issues.  i'm testing it now.

				once in a while i visit my favorite oekaki sites. many are dead, but some are still alive. nice to see a new one here.

				i still visit, albeit with unreliable frequency.  i'm glad to see the commitment to keeping it on life support as long as possible.  i suppose i should try out chickenpaint.

				i've lurked here for 17 years, since a few artists i liked were posting here (and it was astonishing how much you could do with the crude oekaki tools), and i just want to say that i'm glad that people still use this site.even if it's something like 4 posts a year, it's fun to check back every once in a while to see something new. it feels like i'm back in 2005, feeling that same joy when you check a site over and over just to see if it updated, back before phones and social media made us lazy by bringing updates directly to us, making them feel much less special.anyway, nice pic.just keeping track of which hand goes under which one is impressive by itself.
