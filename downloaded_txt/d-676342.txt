welcome to gulf south golden retriever rescuerescuing goldens since 2003













    





                  gulf south golden retriever rescue, inc. (gsgrr) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization run by a small group of volunteers.  we are home based in the greater new orleans, la area.  we take in purebred golden retrievers from public shelters and accept owner-relinquished goldens from the gulf coastal states (la, ms, al, fl).  we provide our dogs with veterinary care including spaying or neutering as necessary, evaluate their temperament, and socialize them by having them live with foster families. then the dogs are matched with loving, carefully selected adoptive homes. we place our dogs in adoptive homes in the gulf south.               each gsgrr member, officer, and foster care provider is a totally unpaid volunteer with family and work commitments. we strive to respond quickly to every inquiry received, but more importantly, we want to place the right dog in the right home. should you not receive a timely reply, please click here for our main email address. if you would like more information on a dog available for adoption, please click on petfinder website.yes, we get youngsters!                please note that we take in dogs of all ages. because we typically have a waiting list of approved clients, many dogs are adopted before they have a chance to get onto the website. so if you don't see exactly the dog you're looking for listed here, please fill out an application and let us know what you're looking for. we will do our best to find the right dog for you!
