port jervis, ny, also known as the river city and the gateway to the upper delaware river is a small city located at the junction of three states, new york, new jersey, and pennsylvania.
it has served as a transportation center for hundreds of years, first as a stop on the old mine road, the first 100-mile road in america, then as a port on the delaware and hudson canal and finally as a division center for new york and lake erie railroad. it still serves as a regional center as the area’s major roadways pass through or near it.
port jervis is a historic town, but also looks to the future. we hope you will visit us!
