important matters
[27 oct 2025|09:21pm]



it is very important that you follow these rules!
1. comment. i'd like to know not only what you're taking, but if you're taking anything.2. credit. i spend time on each and every one of my works. credit so that others know i made them and where they can find some of their own. 3. save to your own computer. not saving to your own computer is called hotlinking, and eats at bandwidth. if you hotlink, icons and other works won't be available. 4. do not, in any way, edit any of the icons or other works. again, i work hard on these and it is not your job to edit them. if they aren't specifically labeled as bases or editable, you may not edit them!
if you don't follow these rules, i'll be forced to make some sort of punitive measure, such as making this journal friends only, taking it down completely, etc.
also, if you're interested in becoming and affiliate please let me know through commenting on this entry. you can also let me know if you'd like any tutorials, make requests (that i may or may not complete), or just in general make some sort of comment on this entry.
( affiliatescollapse )
i read every comment that comes through, and replied to a great majority of them.
have a good day!

it's been quite a while, hasn't it? well, i'm updating with sixteen icons for now, and hopefully i'll have more soonish. i'm contemplating starting an icon community instead of doing it through a journal. just because... well, i dunno. but because. yeah. i doubt anyone is reading this, though, so... moving on.remember to follow these rules: comment, credit, and save to your own computer. do not steal. none of these is a base. do not edit any of these.this batch contains the following:

8 the chronicles of narnia (lww) icons
6 harry potter icons (poa and gof)
2 emma watson icons

welcome to vacca icons, my icon journal. (obviously.) here i'll display all my purty icons and what not. older icons can be viewed at my old journal, borntoberandom.i'll update this place with icons as i make them, and other graphics, if i feel like it. i can't resist showing off all my sub-par works. hoorah!by the way, vacca is latin for 'cow.' hence the cow theme. whee. and, why cow graphics, you ask. well, um... because.that's it for now, i suppose. adieu.
