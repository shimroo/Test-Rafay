                                            hostos’ inaugural pride prom celebrates love, inclusion, and lgbtqia+ students
                                        



love was in the air early in the evening at the hostos cafeteria.

given the times we live in, when expressions of diversity are under attack, hostos community college remains steadfast in providing safe spaces for our diverse student population. this commitment was on full display yesterday during the hostos lgbtqia+ council's inaugural "celebrate love: pride + valentine's prom," a night filled with joy, community, and unapologetic self-expression.





                                            hostos holds event to raise awareness about black and brown men’s mental health
                                        



(l-r) panelists arron muller, therapist; muhammad bilal, main organizer and filmmaker; dr. yuseef salam, member of the exonerated five and nyc council member; chris v. rey, president of phi beta sigma fraternity; and dr. jeffrey gardere, celebrity therapist.

in a moment of heightened anxiety for many people of color in the country, when diversity, equity, and inclusion are under attack and civil rights gains are being threatened, hostos community college teamed up with bilal world entertainment (bwe) and phi beta sigma fraternity inc. to host the event, “confronting the stigma: a mental health event to help black and brown men heal.”





                                            hostos professor sarah hoiland’s new book takes readers on a ride into the little-known world of an all-women’s motorcycle club
                                        


hoiland’s book, “righteous sisterhood: the politics and power of an all-women's motorcycle club,” debuts on january 24
