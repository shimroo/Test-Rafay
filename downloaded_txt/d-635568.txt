about ebusiness innovations, inc.
28+ years in business
headquartered in washington, dc, ebusiness innovations (ebi) is a leading provider of professional web development services to associations, government agencies and businesses.




our history
since 1997 ebi has been building custom software systems for small businesses and nonprofits. our early successes included developing a mini-erp system based on microsoft windows 95 and client-server technologies for a manufacturer of bricks and tiles, and a specialized sales management software for a nascent food processing market. in 2001 the company shifted its strategic focus from traditional software to creating web applications and websites after delivering academic operation system 2.0 for the washington center for internships and academic seminars.
as content management systems (cms) gained popularity ebi has embraced this trend by leveraging many open source products, such as joomla, wordpress, drupal, typo3, and mediawiki to deliver many websites and portals powered by these platforms. the company also created its own cms offering, smartbee(r) sms to manage websites that fit a certain profile. one of the largest websites built on smartbee(r) sms was an intranet portal for the united states department of labor.
in 2009 and 2010 ebi has developed and successfully launched two professional social networks: bmeplanet for the university of virginia and gbsn connect for the global business school network. in addition to social networking functionality these portals were built with a rich set of idea sharing and crowdsourcing features. for bmeplanet the company has also developed a web-based mobile app optimized for iphones, ipads and google android phones.
despite many different software projects, ebi continues to focus on and refine its core expertise which include custom web software development, web design and consulting, and implementing content management solutions.

                        vp of marketing, cogent communications




have used ebi on several projects, including a major online registration system, highly specified, with multiple unusual requirement and reports and could not be happier. the developers i worked with took the time to understand the requirements and understood them correctly, thought them through and offered multiple solutions for complex problems considering the specifications and the budget. throughout the process i was really impressed how the additional changes were handled as i would always receive intelligent feedback on what can and cannot be added and what would conflict with the logic of the existing system. very efficient and to the point, everything works well and whatever fixes were needed were done in a timely and effective manner. very happy with the results and the professionalism of ebusiness innovations. would defiitely work with them again and recommend!

i want to offer my highest recommendation of alex avdeyev and his development team. our vision for bmeplanet â a global consortium of over 270 universities, corporations, governments, and non-profitsâwas a web 2.0 portal offering a unique set of tools that would accelerate education, research, and innovation in biomedical engineering. alex and his team impressed in how quickly and fully they grasped our problem and objectives, the domain of biomedical engineering, and the interests of the varied stakeholders for our website. they made excellent suggestions that greatly enhanced the eventual product, demonstrated a firm grasp of web 2.0 technologies and capabilities, and worked tirelessly to deliver core functionality on time and on budget. i view alex and his team as professionals in the best sense of the word: they are always pleasant and positive, take pride in their work, and consistently go above and beyond the call of duty. it has been an absolute pleasure to work with the team
