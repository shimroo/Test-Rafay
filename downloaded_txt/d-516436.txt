la cocina peruana modernamodern pervuvian cuisineperuvian cuisine is an unfinished story thousands of years in its unfolding.  in our food, drink, and hospitality, we hope to contribute a few compelling lines to that story. sourcing our ingredients both locally in oregon and in direct trade with a community of organic farmers in chincha, peru, we celebrate a country incredibly rich in its cultural and natural history.
