we power the community voice
pctv is a community media organization serving the city of pittsfield. we empower our community to create media and amplify diverse voices through the best technology and wide-reaching platforms. we believe that everyone in our area should have access to shared media experiences which inform, educate, engage, and entertain; foster civic and community engagement; and promote transparency in local government. we operate a dynamic media center located at 4 federico drive, along with three cable television channels loaded with local content. we make that content available here at pittsfieldtv.org, and on several internet platforms through our pctv select service.
