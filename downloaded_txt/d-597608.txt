cat diseases near me





immunodeficiency virus in cats near me
some consider feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) to be the cat equivalent of hiv in humans. fiv causes a highly contagious and potentially fatal retroviral infection that weakens a cat’s immune system, making the cat susceptible to illness and secondary infection.







leukemia virus in cats near me
like fiv, feline leukemia virus (felv) causes a highly contagious and potentially fatal retroviral infection that weakens a cat’s immune system. feline leukemia can be easily spread from cat to cat through casual contact.







heartworm disease in cats near me
heartworm is spread by mosquitoes that ingest the baby heartworms (also known as microfilaria) from an infected source and carry them to a new source. upon entering a new host through the mosquito bite, heartworm larvae will migrate. they usually find their way into the blood vessels around three or four months later.
