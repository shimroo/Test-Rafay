2nd update





the link to my new site is;

 that is; http://merle-3rdtimelucky.blogspot.com/

some clarification of how to comment both to and from betablogger and 
the old blogger;

if both sites are on beta blogger just fill in the wv and publish comment.

from non-beta to beta sites; use "other" enter your "name" (that is usually 
used when you comment) and then fill in your site url below that, this
allows me to get back to your site by clicking the link.
(btw for sites that have switched to beta you need to allow "anyone" to 
comment in your settings - comments section.)

to enable beta bloggers to comment on your site if you have not changed
yet the options of "other" and "anonymous" need to be available, if they
are not available on your comment section you need to go to your "settings" -
"comments"and tick "anyone" where it asks who can comment on this blog, 
if you choose not to do this beta bloggers will not be able to comment on 
your site, as there is an ever increasing number of beta users this will 
isolate you from an ever increasing number of commenters.

the other thing that helps us find one another when things go wrong is to
list an email address either on your profile or on the sidebar.

that's the state of play at the moment, with all the changes that are going
on who knows what it will be tomorrow.

i will post this at third try as well so hopefully all my readers will see it.

blog site update





because there are some publishing problems and an irritating little message that delays the opening of herons nest i am going to continue using third try at least for the moment, herons nest will remain as an archive of my start as a blogger.

what  is  a  dad?





              good evening or good morning to my friends. tomorrow is father’s day in australia, so i would like to wish all the aussie dads a very happy day with their families,  and a bit of spoiling from them. also the grandfathers. so of course, my topic tonight is --- “what is a dad?” <><><><>   a dad is a man who is especially honoured at certain times of the year with titles such as, head of the family,  king of the roost and  top man of the organisation, but more often his presence, his steadfastness, and his support are taken for granted, like the foundations of a house. to a dad, life is a give-and-take proposition he gives his time, energy, love and advice, and usually has to take a lot in return:--- complaints, noise, teasing, problems, criticism, and often what seems to be a sad lack of appreciation. <><><><>   besides the requirements of being a man, a dad is expected to have the endurance of a camel the shrewdness of a fox, the paiience of an elephant, the industriousness of a beaver and the cheeriness  of  a robin, name anything – a dad is supposed to fix it, mow it, paint it, train it, know all the facts about it, exterminate it. call for it or drop it off, spank it,  find it or pay for it.  dads are not perfect !! they don’t mind mentioning your faults; they keep bringing up the subject of work when you feel the least energetic. <><><><>   somehow though, whatever you do in life, and whatever success you achieve, one of the biggest, warmest and most gratifying  rewards of all is to know --- dad is proud of you !! you don’t always tell a dad how much you love him because there are no words that really express feelings so deep and sincere. still you can’t help but feel, he understands what’s in your heart --- dads do !!
     <><><>  i miss my dad.   <><><>   now for a joke called “box of chocolates.”   
for all of us who are married, were married, wish you were married, or  wish  you weren't married, this is something to smile about the next time
you open a box of chocolates:-  <><>

sally was driving home from one of her business trips in northern arizona  when she saw an elderly navajo woman walking on the side of the road.
as the trip was a long and quiet one, she stopped the car and asked the
navajo woman if she would like a ride. with a silent nod of thanks,
the woman got into the car. <><> 
resuming the journey, sally tried in vain to make a bit of small talk
with the navajo woman. the old woman just sat silently, looking intently at
everything she saw, studying every little detail, until she noticed a white
bag on the seat next to sally.
"what in bag?" asked the old woman. <><>  
sally looked down at the white bag and said, "it's a box of chocolates. i
got it for my husband".
the navajo woman was silent for another moment or two. then speaking with the quiet wisdom of an elder, she said:
"good trade".   <><><><><>   a farmer had 30 free range chooks (chickens) and three roosters. every day they would peck their way around the yards. but every night they would return to the hen house to roost. ten chooks and a rooster would take the bottom perch.
 ten chooks and a rooster took the second perch above the first lot. ten chooks and a rooster took the top perch,
above the other two perches. <><> the farmer didn’t own all these chooks. which ones were his?   only the chooks on the bottom perch,  because all the others
were on higher perches. (hire purchase.) <><><><><>   and just a few quotes to close with ----   the best exercise for the heart is to bend over backwards for someone else. –anon. <><><>   if a friend is in trouble, don’t annoy him by asking him if there is anything you can do. think of something appropriate and do it. – e. w. howe. <><><>   troubles shared are troubles halved. – proverb. <><><>   a comfortable home is a great source of happiness. it ranks immediately after health and a good conscience, -- sydney smith. <><><>   a crank is a man with a new idea – until it catches on, -- mark twain. <><><>   you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. --- anonymous. <><><>   bye for now, till next time. take care my friends, merle.

this   age.







   hello again friends ~~ well it is the first of september, the first day of spring and the weather was here to prove it. we had 23 degrees, which i think is about 70 degrees fahrenheit. just very nice, so i plan to enjoy it until it gets too hot, and then i will complain about that !!! <><><><>   i have a recipe that i have not made yet, but it sounds as  though it would be very nice.   <><><> it is called ham and pineapple bake. <><><>    small can of celery soup small can of drained crushed pineapple ½ cup milk, pepper and salt, teaspoon chopped parsley 4 medium sliced potatos – par-boiled 1 tablespn butter, 1 onion, 1 cup chopped ham     chop onion finely and cook in melted butter, add soup, milk, salt, pepper, parsley, pineapple and ham.   put a layer of sliced potatos in a greased casserole, add the other mixed ingredients and cover with a layer of sliced potatos. cook in moderate oven for ¾ hour.   <><><><><>   i hope that it turns out ok. i plan to make it myself.   i have a little poem for you called “this age.” <><><>   this is the age i had not cared to reach - - - this outer edge of youth –- when, here and there  a strange new silver thread slips in the hair and careless days grow further back with each additional birthday. these have been the years i dreaded secrety, and suddenly find it is a lovely age, and i was blind to beauty that must follow when the ears are more attuned to listening, the touch more sensitive, and the eyes have learnt at last to see detail, and not go hurrying past to newness always. and this age is much more satisfying, now the heart has lately, found love’s not taking but giving greatly.   <><><><><> and now a couple of blonde jokes -----     final exam  
 the blonde reported for her university final examination that
 consists of yes/no type questions. she takes her seat in
 the examination hall, stares at the question paper for five
 minutes and then, in a fit of inspiration, takes out her
 purse, removes a coin and starts tossing the  coin,
 marking the answer sheet: yes, for heads, and no,  for tails.    
 within half an hour she is all done, whereas the rest of the
 class is still sweating it out. during the last few minutes
 she is seen desperately throwing the coin, muttering  and sweating.
 the moderator, alarmed, approaches her and asks  what is going on.
 "i finished the exam in half an hour, but now i'm   rechecking my answers."

>>>>>><<<<<<

 the best blonde joke of the year - so far  
 a man was in his front yard mowing grass when his attractive
 blonde female neighbor came out of the house and went straight
 to the  mailbox.
 she opened it then slammed it shut & stormed back into the  house. <><> 
a little later she came out of her house again went to the
 mail box and again, opened it, slammed it shut again. angrily,
 back into the  house she went.
 as the man was getting ready to edge the lawn, here she
 came again, marched to the mail box, opened it and then
 slammed it closed harder  than ever.  <><> 
 puzzled by her actions the man asked her, "is something
 wrong?"
 to which she replied, "there certainly is!"  
 (are you ready? this is a beauty .)  
 my stupid computer keeps saying, "you've got mail."   <><><><>   and a few quotes from pocket positives, a book  of quotations - - - -   shoot for the moon. even if you miss it, you will land among the stars. – les brown.   it’s great to be great, but it’s greater to be human. --- will rogers.   the creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn. ralph waldo emerson.   the chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are to strong to be broken. – samuel johnson.   we spend so much time yearning for that special item that will finally make us happy, that we don’t take time to look around and discover that we already are. –anon.   bye for now, till next time, take care, merle.   <><><><><><>

now  she  is  gone.





    hi everyone ~~ back with you again after my trip to the funeral. it was very nice, and i plan to post a reading from it in a little while.  kath’s daughter kerry spoke very well, about her mother’s illness, her happier times and her days as a child, when she and her brother would wag school and have a day off. there were little anecdotes etc and lots of memories, and kerry did it beautifully. her husband spoke briefly, and the reading was by their son aged 15. he read it very well which must have been hard. apart from that there were 8 first cousins there and it was great to see and talk to them for a little while. i am most grateful to john for taking me. <><><><>   reading : “now she is gone.”   you can shed tears that she is gone or you can smile because she has lived. <><><>   you can close your eyes and pray that she’ll come back or you can open your eyes and see all she’s left.  <><><>   your heart can be empty because you can’t see her or you can be full of the love you shared. <><><>   you can turn your back on tomorrow and live yesterday or you can be happy for tomorrow because of yesterday. <><><>   you can remember her and only that she’s gone or you can cherish her memory and let it live on. <><><>   you can cry and close your mind, be empty and turn your back or you can do what she’d want smile, open your eyes, love and go on.   <><><><> read by kath’s young grandson, zachary.   a little poem called “bless  you” and i would like to dedicate to you, my friends for the kindness and love you have shown at this sad time. thanks, and bless you. <><><>   bless you for all your kindliness,  for all you have done for me, for little courtesies of heart with no one near to see, for moments when, without your smile, i would have lost my way --- for these, and all the other things, bless you so much !! i say. <><><><> bless you for all the nights of prayer and watch when i am ill, when faith shines like a steady flame in long, dark hours, and still, and bless you for your morning smile when dawn breaks through at last. bless you --- you are in my heart --- where i will hold you fast !!   <><><><><>   and a couple of jokes now - - - -     a man is playing piano one night in a bar, in walks an elephant who goes over to the pianist, and suddenly starts to cry. “there there,” says the pianist. “do you recognise the song?” “no, no,” says the elephant. “i recognise the white keys.”   <><><><><>   an elderly couple went to the doctor for viagra. the doctor advised against it because of the gent’s age, but gave in with warnings to take a tablet one night, then skip the next and so on. <><><> a week later the doctor bumped into te old chap’s wife  and discreetly inquired how things were going. “oh, my husband died,” she matter-of-factly replied. the doctor was distraught. “i knew i shouldn’t have given him the viagra, but you both insisted,” he said. “oh. it wasn’t the viagra that killed him doctor,” she assured him.  “it was all that skipping.”   <><><><>   and a few thoughts to finish - - - -   he who has roses in the garden also has roses in his heart. -- anonymous. <><><>   in peace and quiet pass our days, with nought to vex our craniums, our middle beds are all ablaze with red and white geraniums. <><><>   genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration. – albert  edison. <><><>   you are surrounded by gifts every living moment of every day. let yourself feel appreciation for their presence in your life and take the time to acknowledge their splendour. ---lon g. nungesser. <><><>   you give but little when you give of your possessions.   it is when you give of yourself that you truly give. --kahlil gibran, lebanese poet and writer. <><><><>   bye now, till next time, take care my friends, merle.   <><><><><>

it  shows  in  your  face.





    hello my friends ~~ and what great friends you are !! i feel overwhelmed with your kind and sympathetic words and i thank you most sincerely. i learnt today that kath enjoyed their usual sunday roast dinner and apple pie, and very soon after had a heart attack, so it was very sudden and unexpected, but better for kath. now to find something of interest to post. <><><><><>   <><><> a poem called “it shows in your face.” <><><>   you don’t have to tell how you live each day, you don’t have to say if you work or play; a tried, true barometer serves in place --- however you live, it will show in your face. <><><>   the false, the deceit, that you bear in your heart, will not stay inside where it first got the start, for sinew and blood are thin veils of lace --- what you wear in your heart, you wear in your face. <><><>   if your life is unselfish, if for others you live, for not what you get, but how much you give; if you live close to god in his infinite grace --- you don’t have to tell it – it shows in your face.   <><><><>   <><> another called “count your gardens” <><>   count your garden by the flowers, never by the leaves that fall; count your days by golden hours, don’t remember clouds at all. count your nights by stars, not shadows, count your life with smiles, not tears; and with joy, through all your lifetime, count your age by friends, not years.   <><><><>   this joke was in the melbourne herald sun today --- a woman meets a gorgeous man in a bar. they talk, they connect and they end up leaving together. they get back to his apartment and she notices that his bedroom is completely packed with sweet cuddly teddy bears. hundreds of cute little bears on a bottom shelf all the way along the floor. cuddly medium sized ones on a shelf a little higher, and huge enormous bears on the top shelf along the wall. <><><> the woman is surprised that this hunky guy would have a collection of teddy bears, but she decides not to mention how impressed she is by his sensitive side. things progress and they get down to an intense night of passion. afterwards, lying side by side, the woman rolls over and asks smiling, “well, how was it?” <><><> macho man says; “ help yourself to any prize from the bottom shelf.” <><><><><>   <><><> and now some quotes to finish with <><><>    we all have faults. it’s important to recognise your own, but try to turn a blind eye to the faults of others. –anon. <><>   love your enemies, for they will tell you your faults. --benjamin franklin. <><><>   forgive your enemies, but never forget their names. -- john f. kennedy. <><><>   sometimes the hardest person to forgive is youself. but we shouldn’t be harder on ourselves than we would be on others. --anon. <><><>   freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose.  -- kris kristofferson. <><><>   so long as we are loved by others i should say that we are almost indispensable; and no man is useless while he has a friend. – robert louis stevenson. <><><><>   bye for now and thanks for being blogging friends who are so kind and caring. take care, till next time, merle.   <><><><><>

it's   easy.





  hello my friends ~~ tonight will be shorter, and a lot different. thank you to those who commented , as i probably wont get round much tonight. i had the sad news today that my cousin, kath lost her battle with breast cancer after an awful fight, with a mastectomy, chemo, radiation, and 2 brain  operations, the first to remove brain tumours and the recent one to remove scar tissue, that they suspected was another tumour. the saddest part for me, i spoke to her friday and told her that i had arranged to visit her next saturday.kath was pleased and so was i, but i should have done it sooner. she leaves a husband, a daughter and 3 grandsons and was only 71, a year younger
than me. r.i.p. dear kath. <><><><>  i chose a short verse to post, so i hope there wont be too many typing errors. it is called  “it’s easy.”   it’s easy to smile on the bright days it’s harder to smile when they’re blue the best way to make bad days right days is to smile when it’s hardest to do. <><><>   all things must have a beginning now is the moment to choose everyone smiles when they’re winning --- let’s see you smile when you lose.   <><><><><>><>   i have a joke for you that my friend sue sent me, so a big thank you sue. i sure don’t feel
 a lot like finding jokes, so it was very timely.    
an answered prayera voyaging ship was wrecked during a storm at sea and only  two of the men on it were able to swim to a small, desert like island.
the two survivors, not knowing what else to do, agree  that they had no other recourse but to pray to god.   <><>    however, to find out whose prayer was more powerful, they  agreed to divide the territory between them and stay on  opposite sides of the island.   <><> 
the first thing they prayed for was food. the next morning, the
 first man saw a fruit-bearing tree on his side of the land, and he
was able  to eat its fruit.  the other man's parcel of land  remained barren.  <><> 
after a week, the first man was lonely and he decided to pray  for a wife. the next day, another ship was wrecked, and the only
survivor was a woman who swam to his side of the land. on the
other side of the island, there was nothing.   <><>    soon the first man prayed for a house, clothes, more food. the
next day, like magic, all of these were given to him. however,  the second man still had nothing.   <><> 
finally, the first man prayed for a ship, so that he and his wife
 could leave the island. in the morning, he found a ship docked  at his side of the island. the first man boarded the ship with his
wife and decided to leave the second man on the island.   he
considered the other man unworthy to receive god's blessings, since none of his prayers had been answered.   <><> 
as the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice from
heaven booming, "why are you leaving your companion on the island?"  <><> 
"my blessings are mine alone, since i was the one who prayed for
 them," the first man answered. "his prayers were all unanswered
and so he does not deserve anything."   <><> 
"you are mistaken!" the voice rebuked him. "he had only one prayer, which i answered. if not for that, you would not have received any
of my blessings."  <><>   "tell me," the first man asked the voice, "what did he pray for  that  i should owe him anything?"  <><> 
"he prayed that all your prayers be answered."  <><> 
for all we know, our blessings are not the fruits of our prayers
 alone, but those of another praying for us.    <><><><><>   just a couple of thoughts -- the first on faith
   without winter, there can be no spring. without mistakes there can be no learning. without doubts, there can be no faith. without fears, there can be no courage. my mistakes, my fears and my doubts are my path to wisdom, faith and courage.   <><><><><>   do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can in all the places you can at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can….. john wesley.   <><><><> say i love you to all the people you love.  bye for now, merle.   <><><><><><><>
