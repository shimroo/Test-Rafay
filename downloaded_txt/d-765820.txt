built on  



integrity &  performance 








we're more than just a contractor 











at peterson, we strive to conduct ourselves in each business interaction in a manner consistent with our business philosophy, which we have deemed the peterson way. it stems from the golden rule, emphasizing integrity, and guides us daily. when an issue arises that may have an adverse effect, we donât start with assessing âwhat is best for usâ but âwhat is the right thing to do.â

what our clients say 


















"a key component of our success was that peterson understood the complexity of each partnerâs situation; what drove us.  they managed the project with my financial obligations in mind, the tenant's schedule and operational needs as a high priority, and their consultants' numerous processes and procedures diligently.  they are a partner that gets it."					


mike d. jones hillwood investment properties 






"we have been working with peterson for over four years, and it has been nothing short of impressive. they have been a one-stop shop for our needs. each staff member has been kind, and respectful, and they deliver each and every time. we appreciate our partnership with peterson and all that they bring to the table for our office. they exude quality!"

"the entire staff at peterson company knows building maintenance and facilities services - they get it! peterson's professional response to me as a client and to those i represent is well orchestrated, from phone calls to understanding service requests to correct billings. they are a class act from bottom to top; i would not look elsewhere for these services."
