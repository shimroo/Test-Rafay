hair tips
when it comes to hair, we've been there, done that, now serving 300 tips in 22 categories ranging from curly hair styles to wedding hair styles.











homemade hair treatments
 with the exorbitantly priced hair care products on the market these days, many people opt to create homemade products to care for their hair. here are some interesting alternatives to pricey, store bought chemicals that you can make in the comfort of your own home: 
raw egg
that’s it. just raw egg. raw egg is used to condition hair. if your hair is normal, use the whole egg. if it is oily, use only the egg whites. use the yolks only for dry hair. leave it on for 20 minutes then rinse off with cool water. shampoo, rinse, and you’re done. you can condition your hair this way twice a month if you only use a portion of the egg – once a month if you are using the whole egg.
avocado
to tame frizz, avocado is a very popular at-home remedy. simply mash up half of an avocado, work it into your hair, and let it sit for 15 minutes before rinsing. you can practice this home moisturizing remedy twice a month.
honey
honey is a great ingredient to add moisture to dry hair. whether due to the sun or over processing, honey can help bring moisture back. work in a half-cup of honey into clean hair. let it sit for 20 minutes before rinsing. you can apply honey once a month.

how to get started as a hair stylist
becoming a hair stylist is a wonderful career choice for many people. professional hair stylists have the opportunity to choose between a wide variety of employment options that suit their personal needs and ambitions.
as a professional hair stylist you can choose to work for a local hair salon for salary or commission based pay; or you can rent a stall and work with your own clientele whenever you want. however, before you can become a hair stylist you must meet the minimum requirements set forth by your state’s licensing board. you need to follow a few basic steps to find out the best way to become a hair stylist in your area.
1. talk to your hair stylist. ask your hair stylist about her experience at becoming a hair stylist. ask her about the barber or cosmetology schools she recommends for you to attend. also, your hair stylist may be able to give you helpful tips about passing the hair stylist licensing test.
2. check with your state licensing board for barbering and cosmetology. most states require that you attend an approved training program before you can get a hair stylist license. make sure that you choose a school with a comprehensive training program that includes all of the technical and business education that you need to succeed when you start your career as a hair stylist.
3. contact your state licensing agency and complete all of the forms and pay all of the fees to get your hair stylist license. you will have to submit documentation to verify that you have all of the minimum education and experience to qualify for a license.

tips for attending hair shows
if you're in the hair business, hair shows and conventions can be so much fun. they can also suck up your professional development budget in one fell swoop if you're not careful! if you're planning on attending a hair show, plan your strategy ahead of time.
prior to the show
1. start early. many shows and conventions offer discounts if you purchase tickets in advance.
2. download a program. depending on the size of the convention, several events may be going on at the same time. plan your time so that attend the classes that are most relevant to you and your business.
3. book your accommodation. book a hotel early to secure the best deal – and ensure you get a room at all. even the show is relatively close, consider getting a room for one night. conventions frequently host parties, and you won't want to drive home afterward.
4. plan your look. at hair shows, people are there to see and be seen. you want your hair to be perfectly styled with fresh color and cut. choose amazing outfits, too.
5. stock up on business cards. conventions are about networking.
at the show
1. get a map. product lines and industry professionals have booths. this may be an opportunity for you to meet that pro or check out a new product line.
2. watch your timing. you want to attend several trainings but also have time to network and check out the exhibits.
3. plan your spending. unless an exhibit is offering a serious discount on product, save it until you need a new order. however, hair shows are excellent locations to view equipment the beauty supply can't stock.
4. talk to everyone. networking is the name of the game.

tips for 50s hairstyles
with retro looks trending, the hairstyles of the 1950s are back. 
for men
the iconic men's style was the ducktail. for this style, your hair is combed straight back on the sides into two wings in the back, the duck's tail. the top is left tousled, styled into a classic pompadour, or gelled into a single long curl in the forehead, the elephant's trunk.
tips for the ducktail
1. request the cut at your salon. the center portion needs to be cut shorter than the overlapping "wings."
2. use a strong gel and even pomade. this look will never stay in place without products.
3. after combing the sides back, draw your comb straight down the middle in the back of your head to define the line between the "wings"
for women
1950s hairstyles are driven by the beauty idols of the time, women like marilyn monroe and lucille ball.
tips for the marilyn
1. marilyn's style looks best on hair that's shoulder length or shorter with layers.
2. set your hair either wet or dry. arrange the curlers in the same direction you want the curls to go.
3. back-comb at the base of the curls and tousle the ends to create the finished look.
4. use a light hold hairspray.
tips for the lucille
1. lucille ball's poodle style is great for curly hair.
2. dry curly hair with products that won't create crunch, such as pomade.
3. back-comb the sides, smooth the top of each hair section and pin back. roll the hair in back into a loose bun or twist. allow hair's texture to show.
4. tousle the top curls. use light hairspray.

tips for 80s hairstyles
the 1980s were the decade of excess, and that came through in the hairstyles. small hair was not popular.
side ponytail
one of the easiest ways to channel the 80s is to pull your ponytail to the side. you can keep the tail low or secure it at the top of your head. it must swing to the side, though.
1. secure with a tight hair-tie. add hair jewelry or a scrunchie to cover the tie.
2. splay hair for volume.
3. this style looks best on curly or curled hair.
curls
men and women alike had to get perms in the 1980s if they didn't have naturally curly hair. don't get a perm – just curl your hair.
1. use a small curling iron for spiral curls.
2. use a medium curling iron, alternating the direction. tousle the curls and backcomb the sides for volume.
3. use a large curling iron all in the same direction. finger comb back into big, farah fawcett feathers.
4. bangs are a must for all these styles. curl the front in a half-circle, all curls going in the same direction. backcomb the base. let hair descend in a waterfall.
5. use strong-hold hairspray for all styles.
new wave
new wave hairstyles were still big, but asymmetrically so. one side must be noticeably shorter than the other.
note: if you're getting your hair cut this way, the sides will not blend.
1. you can mimic this look by pulling one side of your hair back tightly.
2. backcomb the long strands. they should splay out from the head like fire.
3. if you have a short, one-length bob, opt for the flock of seagulls style. backcomb the sides and top so that the hair is flowing to the top of the head and over you face.
4. use strong-hold hairspray for all styles.

tips for 90s hairstyles
hairstyles of the 1990s were inspired by television and movies. the "friends" hairstyle was popular for long hair. meg ryan set the tone for short hair. men wore their hair either like russell crowe's "the gladiator" or matt damon's flip-front version.
the rachel
the rachel was the iconic look for medium to long hair. it started above the shoulders but grew longer as the decade wore on. she never had true bangs. this haircut is casual a shag blow dried with a big round brush.
1. blow out the hair, curling under with the brush.
2. flip the ends up while the hair is still warm.
3. spray strands in the front and nape area, pulling apart with your fingers to create the piecey look. alternatively apply a tiny amount of hair wax and pull to create pieces.
4. spray with gloss.
the meg
like the rachel, meg ryan's hair was a piecey, flipped-out shag. however, the overall look is shorter and choppier. the meg also features true bangs pieced out to the side with wax or hairspray.
1. blow out hair with a medium brush.
2. flip ends up with the brush.
3. using medium hold hairspray or hair wax, pull the bangs to the side in pieces. pull out more pieces all over the shag.
4. spray with gloss.
men's styles
the gladiator and matt damon's front-flip were essentially the same haircut. the cut is clippered up the sides and back and blended into a longer top. the top should be chunk-cut about one-inch long with bangs straight across.
1. apply solid hair gloss and comb everything forward for the gladiator.
2. apply hair wax to the front and pull pieces up for the flip-front.
