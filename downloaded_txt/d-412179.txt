from the website, ordering, shipping, receiving and installation, the fleck 5600sxt was problem free and easy to install.
the price is right for the unit as i had received a quote from the local culligan dealership for a unit that was over $2,100 which was outside my budget for soft water.
the product i ordered is doing everything i expect taking my water from 272 ppm to 0.
included is a shot of my installation which took a few hours to complete and all instructions were easy to follow.
thanks for everything!- curt

i just wanted to take a few minutes to say thank you for your repeated help when i install your water softeners.
after each installation i always call and talk to charlie to properly program the softener correctly.
each and every time charlie walks me through the programming and makes sure i am in good shape before we hang up.
i just installed the fifth softener i have purchased from you and will continue to offer your products.
once again i just thank you for your help.- m. cox

i spoke with jean today while determining my water softener needs and she was amazing. she was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.
i was impressed that she called me back when she said she would, and that she had done independent research between our conversations so she’d have even more information for me, and i feel very confident that i’m going with the right softener.
i have been shopping around at various online water softener companies, and have spoken to several customer service representatives at other places, and i can assure you that it was jean’s service that earned ohio pure water this sale.- jennifer d

jean,thank you so much for your help.  cleaning the injectors did fix the suction problem.  there were quite a bit of black particles in the injector and also the screen inside the injector cover. 
i was able to go through an entire regeneration cycle and then adjust the time to fill the brine tank to 13″.  (i had to reduce the time by 3 minutes.).
thanks again, and i will be sure to use ohio pure water co for future service and parts and will be sure to recommend you to friends and family.- r. verhaalen
