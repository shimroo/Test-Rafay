 current safety rules
safety rules april 2012
**********************************************************************************
new gate code required to unlock the gate and fly. you need to have 2025 club sticker on your ama card or proof of renewal(email) to fly. you can renew here on website. you do not have to have a paypal account, select check out as guest and use your debit/credit card to pay.
safety reminders your club officers would like to remind you of the following safety guidelines:
don’t fly alone, get help during engine startup and have a co-pilot watch for other air traffic and field obstacles.
follow the established traffic pattern, do not fly against the pattern.  if you don’t know which direction is in effect, ask the pilots on the flight line.
don’t fly over the runway except for landing and takeoff.  all maneuvers, including passes, should be done out over the dirt, away from the runway.
do not practice pylon racing without making sure that the other pilots on the flight line know what you’re up to.  it only takes a minute to let the other pilots know what you want to do and where you’ll do it.
don’t fly behind the deadline!  (the deadline is the white line in front of the pilot boxes  that marks the edge of the taxiway.)
show-n-tell have any modeling tips you’d like to share with your club members?  got a new airplane you’d like to show off?  we would love to hear from you!  each month you have an opportunity to share what you know during our monthly general membership meeting.  if you’re interested, please let the president or vice president know so that he can make a slot on the meeting agenda.
