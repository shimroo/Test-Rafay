our proposed transfer to natwest
in june 2024, we announced our proposal to transfer our personal loans, credit cards and savings accounts to natwest.​ the next step is for us to ask the high court to formally approve the proposed transfer at a hearing due to take place on 15 april 2025.
it's important that you understand what the proposal means for you, and what the next steps are. you’ll find all the information you need on our dedicated webpage, to help you understand the proposed transfer and how you can raise concerns or objections if you think you’ll be adversely affected. 
we’d like to reassure you that there are no immediate changes to how you use and access your account(s), and you can still expect the same trusted service from us.  
our insurance and travel money services will continue to be available as they are today and are not included in the proposed transfer.
