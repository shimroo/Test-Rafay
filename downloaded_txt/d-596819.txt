pecks pond cabin information & pa state forest leased campsites
if you're looking to own a cabin or lease a small parcel of land within pennsylvania's state forests, including near pecks pond, you’ll want to understand the unique process involved in purchasing or leasing a state forest campsite.
pecks pond picnic area & boat launch:

location: south shore of pecks pond, about ½ mile east of s.r. 402 off brewster road.
facilities:
	
potable water
public charcoal grills
picnic tables
boat launch for access to fishing and boating on pecks pond


note: there is no picnic shelter at this location, so plan accordingly for your outdoor activities.

pa state forest leased campsites:


overview: the pennsylvania department of conservation and natural resources (dcnr) oversees more than 4,000 small leased campsites throughout the state's forested areas. these parcels are leased for recreational use, typically by individuals or small groups, and often include existing cabins.


key features of state forest leased campsites:

size: each parcel is approximately 1/4 acre or about 100' x 100'.
purpose: these leased lands are primarily for recreational use—hunting, fishing, hiking, canoeing, and more.
ownership: the land itself is leased, but the cabin structure (if present) is owned separately and is transferable to other pennsylvania residents. this means that the structure can be sold, and ownership can be transferred via a bill of sale.
financing: due to the unique nature of the lease, these properties cannot typically be financed through traditional mortgage loans. instead, buyers must finance them via personal loans (not collateralized by the cabin). banks typically do not offer mortgage options for state leased campsites.



historical context:

the dcnr ceased leasing campsites back in 1970, but the existing leases continue to be transferred and utilized by the public. this makes cabins on state forest land and around areas like pecks pond a rare and highly sought-after opportunity.
leased campsites can be transferred to other pennsylvania residents, so long as they meet the criteria for the lease.
