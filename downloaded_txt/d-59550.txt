sirsidynix acquired by harris computing

sirsidynix, has been acquired by harris computing, one of six operating companies of constellation software, inc.  it purchased sirsidynix from icv partners, a private equity firm that has owned it since february 2015. unlike private equity firms, constellation does not sell the companies it acquires. it follows a strategy of acquiring businesses from founders or investors and holding them indefinitely. the acquisition marks a definitive exit from ongoing cycles of private equity investment into a permanent position within a public company specializing in the administration of technology-focused businesses. sirsidynix has seen two rounds of private equity ownership, including vista equity partners and icv partners.as part of harris, sirsidynix gains access to additional technical and financial resources.  harris has deep experience in acquiring and strengthening technology companies.  in contrast, sirsidynix was the only technology company within the icv partners portfolio.

2024 library systems report: companies focus on developing practical solutions

 
the library technology industry had a quiet year in 2023. but in the absence of major business moves and acquisitions, companies set their sights on executing strategies to strengthen their market position.
previous cycles of business consolidation have yielded a layered landscape with distinct levels of competition. at the top, a handful of large organizations with considerable resourcesclarivate, ebsco information services, follett school solutions, and oclccontinue to expand their portfolios, covering multiple business sectors and library types. middle-tier companies, including axiell, bywater solutions, the library corporation (tlc), and sirsidynix, offer growing suites of products used by thousands of libraries. and finally, a group of smaller companies round out the industry, covering specialized libraries with niche products and services.
competition at each level remains vigorous. libraries may have fewer product choices because of past acquisitions, but the options remaining are distinctive. most libraries can choose between for-profit and nonprofit vendors, and between proprietary and open source products. for instance, academic libraries can pick from a short list of library services platforms (lsps), including a proprietary solution from a for-profit company (alma), an open source product supported by for-profit companies (folio), or a proprietary product from a nonprofit organization (worldshare management services).
libraries see their technology vendors as strategic partners. they are increasingly purchasing core products from a single provider, rewarding companies' efforts to create suites of integrated applications that function more efficiently than mix-and-match offerings. these days, libraries expect third-party integration from their productsbut they generally acquire new components from a single main vendor.(american libraries, may 1, 2024)

libraries under cyberattack

the last year or so has brought incredible challenges to the digital infrastructure of some high-profile libraries. the recent wave of cyberattacks targeting one of the worlds most prestigious and well-resourced libraries brings a sobering reminder of the dangers lurking for libraries in this digital age. libraries of all types and sizes must be vigilant and prepared for any possible security breach.

project reshare and openrs: differing approaches to open source resource sharing

 

in recent months, a schism has erupted in the open source resource sharing realm. two open source resource sharing projects that previously resided within a single organization have separated, due not only to the differing functional models of their products, but also because of differences in styles of collaboration. launched in 2018, project reshare has been advancing an open source platform for resource sharing, created collaboratively among a community of interested libraries and vendors. project reshare continues with its mission to strengthen its resource sharing community and to continue to enhance and support its platform. the organization is also refining its organizational structure and articulating its values and community processes. openrs, was launched in 2023 as a new initiative to develop, support, and promote a new open source direct consortial borrowing solution. though a relatively new project, openrs moves forward with a well defined development agenda, backed by two commercial vendors, ebsco information services and knowledge integration, with substantial involvement of mobius as its first planned implementor.
