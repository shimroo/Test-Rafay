the educational window company
why choose the window man?
upon opening our doors in 1989, we at the window man had committed ourselves to being "the educational window company." all these years later, our focus remains unchanged, and we continue to teach, listen to, and respect each of our customers. for example, did you know that most window companies sell just one brand or line of windows, forcing them into a one-size-fits-all sales position? with the window man, you are thoroughly educated about the pros and cons of the various windows you are considering. each home has its own unique character, look, and energy needs. the window man carefully considers each of these factors, then presents the best options available to the customer. as our slogan states, "we educate...you decide!"
factors you'll consider...facts we'll present

what are the pros and cons of fiberglass vs. vinyl vs. wood vs. composite?
what does aama or wdma certified mean?
what is u-value?
what material options are available?
is my window easy to maintain?
will my windows decrease outside noise?
is my window energy-star compliant?
does the window man offer promotions?
