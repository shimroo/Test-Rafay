more about dr. delgado


revision work

any kind of revision surgery requires the skill and experience of a highly understanding surgeon. not only are there physical factors to contend with, such as scar tissue and mistakes made by a previous surgeon; there are also the patient’s emotional factors. it’s not easy to undergo the same surgery twice, and dr. delgado understands this completely. that’s why he works hard to correct and improve a patient’s appearance during a secondary surgery.

— dr. miguel delgado

















breast creating the body of your dreams
we all have a part (or several) of ourselves that we dislike. perhaps it’s something that developed naturally, like male breasts — or maybe it’s something that you chose yourself but didn’t turn out the way you wanted, such as a surgery. or maybe you simply want to improve a part of your body that won’t respond to diet and exercise. no matter what, san francisco plastic surgeon dr. delgado will help you achieve the body you want.

personal and professional integrity

one of the qualities that set dr. delgado apart from many other surgeons is his focus on patient safety. his surgical center is attached to a hospital for added patient safety, and he has great respect for the inherent risks of any surgical procedure—including anesthesia risks. he is also very careful about screening patients before surgery. in addition, any new technique or device must pass the test of time before dr. delgado will incorporate it into his practice and offered services.
