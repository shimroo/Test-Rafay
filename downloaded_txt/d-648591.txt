airport technology research & development
using science to make airports safe, smart, and sustainable



the airport technology research & development (atr) branch is the faa’s research hub and testing site dedicated to ensuring the safety, capacity, and efficiency of u.s. airports.

we discover and evaluate new technologies and methods that are critical to the future of aerospace. atr’s work informs policies, standards, and regulatory guidance to meet the demands of increasing air traffic, new types of aircraft, and environmental factors.

our research programs align with the department of transportation’s strategic goals of safety, equity, climate and sustainability, and transformation.
