orlando criminal defense lawyer
orlando criminal defense lawyer david p. hill is devoted exclusively to the defense of individuals accused of criminal activities. 
every criminal offense, even misdemeanors and traffic offenses, carry potential jail and/or prison sentences. even in situations where the prosecution is not seeking jail time, a person charged with a criminal offense can be  facing significant sanctions, such as: community control, home confinement, probation, fines, community service, and the prospect of a criminal conviction on his or her record.
our orlando criminal defense law firm provides legal representation on misdemeanor and felony matters in state, federal and juvenile courts. we handle all types of criminal cases including: drunk driving or driving under the influence ( dui ), driving with license suspended ( dwls ), child pornography, violation of probation ( vop ), domestic violence, theft charges, fraud, drug offenses, sex crimes, tax evasion and white collar charges.
how a criminal case is resolved can have a significant impact on you for both your immediate and long term future; it can  affect  your ability to find and keep a job, find an apartment or suitable housing, obtain certain state, business or professional licenses, or  even whether you can go to college.
many people do not realize the full impact a criminal case  could potentially have on their lives and therefore we, at the law offices of david p. hill, strongly recommend that everyone charged with a criminal offense at  least consult with a defense attorney before making any decisions regarding how to resolve their case. we understand the stress involved in being charged with a criminal violation, especially where your liberty is at stake. we will do everything we can to take that burden from you and to represent you zealously so that we can obtain the best result possible for you. you will be treated as a person, not a number, and we will always keep you fully apprised of the status of your case. call us today at (407)649-1999.

                               	    david was referred to me by a mutual friend. he helped my family out during a very unsettling time. he instantly put our minds at ease following our first conversation. he did an outstanding job and was very hands on. it was nice to always have him accessible and he was very prompt when returning a text , email or voice mail. i am more than pleased with the outcome of our situation and would highly recommend mr. david hill in the central fl area...
