south jersey jazz 25 years of impact






thank you! i wanted to pass along a huge compliment to your coaches, program, and process. i've been to tons of tryouts and witnessed years of practices and tryouts. your structure, drills, positivity, coaching, and entire process is eye impressive! the best compliment i can give you is there isn't one kid leave your gym/tryout saying they didn't get a fair and equal opportunity to showcase their skills and game.  the entire tryout was enjoyable to watch, structured, energetic, and most importantly the athletes got every chance to compete and showcase their skill set! kudos to your organization, staff, and leadership for your visions and commitment to doing things the correct way! god bless and best wishes! keep your dreams high and your goal's higher

jeffrey franquet







i can't say enough about the positive experience we've had with the sj jazz! my girls had a great time and came out with new skills and a fresh love of the game! thank you sj jazz

rachel muraca







my son had a great time at the sj jazz camp. always high energy and always worth it! my son has come a long way

tracy dubosar (spencer)







i grew up through the skills academy with sj jazz. it was a huge reason i learned the key fundamentals to bring to the collegiate level.
