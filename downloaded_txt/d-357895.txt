notes from rick
kate ritter has remained steadfastly respectful of my need for personal privacy. in addition to the lexicon, kate has created and maintained the most amazing website on my behalf, rdanderson.com. her meticulous chronicling of my career and life activities looms as one of the greatest labors of love imaginable. she knows better than most people how much i cherish and protect my privacy so it has been no easy task for her to be as comprehensive as she is on the website. even without regular correspondence she has been able to exhibit great insight into the workings of my head and heart. i must admit, sadly, that i have been of little help in her efforts; she has done it all on her own. for this i am eternally grateful and sincerely extend my unyielding appreciation.
