						wheeler lake is the second-largest lake on the tennessee river in northern alabama, second only to guntersville lake, its immediate upstream neighbor. wheeler lake is also bordered by wilson lake on its downstream side. the lake was constructed by the tennessee valley authority just prior to world war ii as a means of hydroelectric generation and flood control, as well as to facilitate navigation along the tennessee river. today the lake is mostly popular for recreation purposes and barge traffic. the name of this impoundment comes from civil war general joseph 'fightin' joe wheeler, who frequented the area during the war and later returned to the area to live.
