  undergraduate 
  ms/phd 
  prof. master's 
  combined bs/ms 


our undergraduate major has been designed to teach broad-based knowledge in meteorology, oceanography, climate and air pollution. we offer small class sizes, outstanding teachers and mentors, and an active student organization. with our proximity to washington, d.c., we are close to co-op, internships, summer and full-time job opportunities as well as museums; music, art and sports venues; and much more.

aosc program overview
our ms/phd program ranks among the top 10 oceanography, atmospheric sciences and meteorology programs by the national research council and higher than any other institution on the east coast. the department is particularly strong in the research areas of atmospheric chemistry and air pollution, mesoscale to global numerical weather prediction, data assimilation, earth sciences and climate, physical cceanography, remote sensing, and dynamics with predictability. click the image below for a general overview of aosc. 

we are now seeking applicants for fall 2024. visit the aosc graduate admissions page for details.

important dates for prospective students
dissertation information (updated september, 2021)
the master of professional studies (mps) in atmospheric and oceanic science technology is a 30-credit program designed for meteorologists, oceanographers and environmental scientists who need cutting-edge skills and knowledge in atmospheric and oceanic science, in the computational methods used in the field, and in air quality science.
learn more
the combined b.s./m.s. program is structured in that it is possible to obtain both a bachelors and masters degree within a 5 year period. students with a combined b.s./m.s. in atmospheric sciences position themselves for admission and funding opportunities in competitive ph.d. programs.

                               groundbreaking research on the gulf stream led by aosc prof. jacob wenegrat recently published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences                             




new research provides the first direct evidence for the gulf stream blender effect, identifying a new mechanism of mixing water across the swift-moving current. the results have important implications for weather, climate and fisheries because ocean mixing plays a critical role in these processes. the gulf stream is one of the largest drivers of climate and biological productivity from florida to newfoundland and along the western coast of europe. read more
