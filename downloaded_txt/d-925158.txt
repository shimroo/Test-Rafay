  log masters portable saw blade manufacturer in nacogdoches, tx

log master portable saw blade manufacturer  makes  top-quality, portable band saw blade  for any make of sawmill. we will also resharpen and set your bandsaw blades. we also sell sawmill parts so you can make your own sawmill.  we have been in business since 1993. unlike punched and sharpened or milled blades, each individual log-master tooth is ground using computer-controlled machinery. punching teeth puts unacceptable levels of stress on the blade, before it ever gets used. the result can be reduced life, inconsistent performance and blades that often need to be re-sharpened before they can be put to work.log-master offers unparalleled “out-of-the-box” performance. grinding teeth is a more time-consuming and exacting process – but the results are sharper, more reliable and longer-lasting blades. log-master blades cut straighter and faster than any blade that’s gone before it, handling higher levels of feed pressure with ease. each blade will work straight out of the box, with no further need for resetting before it can be used. explore the website and take a look at our products, their functions and features and contact us at anytime to find out your best log master options!
