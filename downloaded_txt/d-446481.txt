check out my lighthouse calendar


each year i conduct tours round the irish coast visiting the lighthouses up close and personal, like the fastnet above left and skellig michael on the southern lighthouse tour. we stay in lighthouses for part of the time, go on visits inside them and take boat trips to view the offshore ones like fastnet, inisheer, little samphire island , bull rock, eagle island. if i can't get you in them i can get you up close to them. i have been running these tours since 2009 and  have collected lots of comments.  watch a video i shot from the tour boat visiting the fastnet
