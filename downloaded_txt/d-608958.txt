hello team, just a quick thank you for yet another enjoyable, painless, seamless kit project. so far all cnc files cut perfect, parts fit perfect, layup is logical. we would love to build more of these, if you know of anyone looking for a turn key cut, fold, weld vendor we would welcome and appreciate your referrals. these little kits work great for us in between our barges and other builds. thanks again for a great product.

just wanted to touch base with your company and let them know how impressed i am with it. i bought a 20’ orca. i have been a part of building boats from scratch. but this was a whole different experience. everything fit perfect and after i was done building it, it performed even better. wow the best boat i have ever owned. thank you. i will be buying more of your kits.

this landing craft, specmar hull 624 with custom cabin, achieved a top speed of 40 knots with twin suzuki 175 hp outboards. she cruises at around 25 mph (22 knots) at 4,000 rpm burning about 10.4 gph.  she needs no trim tabs and has a perfectly balanced combo on the weight/hp ratio.
