    i designed my website and maintained it for years. it was an okay website and it did its job. however, the more websites i looked at on the internet, made me realize that i need to make the site more professional. i got in contact with with tom nguyen of mr. technique. he redesigned the site making it user friendly with the text and pictures. he did an amazing job. i highly recommend him and his team.

    tom has really crushed it for our practice. i’ve always been a little suspicious of seo services, especially from the bigger hosting companies. with tom, our practice went from word of mouth referrals to 90% google referrals without ever purchasing an ad.
