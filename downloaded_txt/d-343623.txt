what makes comand™ product so unique?
comand™ is a specialty top dressing soil manufactured using different blends of high-quality sand and a unique compost product derived from a proprietary composting process. comand™ turf soil is not a pesticide. research has shown that increased populations of certain microorganisms can suppress plant diseases in turfgrass, such as dollar spot and brown patch, as well as being antagonistic to nematodes.
