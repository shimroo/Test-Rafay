oceanside walking tour

january 28, 2025
by michael sullivan





 













 on yet another mild, dry winter day (will it ever rain again this season?), we visited the neighborhood known as oceanview, in the southwestern quadrant of san francisco. this is a densely built neighborhood, with houses close to the street, leaving little room for street trees. fortunately, the neighborhood benefits from the trees that surround the millie & lovie ward recreation center, which fills the block bounded by plymouth and capitol avenues and montana and lobos streets. the mature monterey cypresses on the west, south, and east sides of the rec center are among the healthiest in the city, undoubtedly due to the extra rain and fog typical in this section of the alemany gap.  a delightful surprise, to those of us not from the neighborhood, was the planted median on the long block of minerva street, just west of plymouth; it’s filled with a variety of small trees and palms, flowering shrubs, succulents, and art.   it was encouraging to note that friends of the urban forest (fuf) has been planting young street trees throughout the neighborhood, wherever sidewalk space permitted. this is part of a concerted effort on the part of both the city’s urban forestry division and fuf to provide more shade in areas of the city that have typically lacked tree cover. with a warming climate, the importance of trees to provide shade and cool the environment cannot be stressed enough. today’s walk begins at the main entrance to the millie & lovie ward recreation center at capitol avenue (cross is minerva street). it heads south on capitol just past lobos street, then returns to lobos and heads east to plymouth avenue, and north on plymouth. at minerva street, the walk heads east up the gentle part of the hill to about midway, crosses the median at the red steps, and returns to plymouth. it then continues north on plymouth, west on montana street, and finally south on capitol to the beginning of the walk at minerva. this walk is about 1 mile in length. numbered trees are labeled with common and scientific names and country of origin, all written in white chalk on the sidewalk; accompanying numbers, in blue, run from 1 to 32. white arrows on the pavement provide directions whenever a turn is needed. capitol avenue, minerva to lobos, east side

poppy lane buckeye

january 22, 2025
by michael sullivan





i was in glen park recently and decided to check out the massive california buckeye (aesculus californica) on poppy lane - one of the quaint unpaved alleys in the glen park neighborhood.  it’s looking great - i think it’s likely the largest california buckeye in the city.   check it out - poppy lane between conrad and diamond!

what a find!

november 15, 2024
by michael sullivan





i love the hunt for great trees in san francisco.   unlike many cities, where the local government determines what is planted, and entire avenues are planted with one species, san francisco has always given residents the right to plant what they want (within reason), which over the years has contributed to a wonderful diversity of trees in the neighborhoods.  you never know what you’ll find around the corner, a serendipity that contributes to my love of san francisco streets.   and the only thing better than finding an amazing tree is finding an amazing tree in a totally unexpected place.   that’s what happened in june of this year, when richard turner, jason dewees, sairus patel and i were chalking our 50th chalk tree on nob hill, a neighborhood famous for its many tiny alleys.   as we were walking west on sacramento street, we came upon golden court, which is so small that it’s not even on many maps.  it’s too small for cars - golden alley is actually a long sidewalk that leads to the addresses along the way.we decided to check out the alley (single file!), and you can imagine our surprise to find an amazing specimen of a lacebark tree (brachychiton discolor) near the end of the alley.   this is a tree so rare in san francisco that the four of us knew of only one other example in the entire city.  this one was a large specimen in the bloom of health. so the next time you’re at the fairmont hotel or grace cathedral, take a 3 or 4 minute stroll to golden court, to see san francisco’s “city champion” lacebark tree!

red flowering gum (corymbia ficifolia) 








eureka valley west tree tour

august 27, 2024
by michael sullivan





who would have expected that the tree geeks would be rained out on a saturday in late august? yet, that is exactly what happened when mike, sairus, and dick chose to meet at the corner of 18th and storrie streets, a few blocks west of castro street, to explore the trees in this western corner of eureka valley. the clouds had been threatening on friday and into the early hours of saturday. almost exactly at the appointed meeting time, light rains began, and continued for over an hour—all the result of a former typhoon that bypassed japan in favor of a modest hit to california.  with sidewalks too wet to accept chalk, the geeks decided to walk the route and photograph some of the outstanding trees to be seen on the streets and in private gardens along the way. this is a quiet neighborhood, on the far edge of the castro district, with homes ranging from historic victorian and edwardian to trendy contemporary styles. trees can be seen in abundance, as might be expected of this moderately upscale neighborhood with its well-educated population. among the trees noted are some city champions, and some markedly uncommon trees for san francisco.  today’s walk begins at the unnamed community garden on the southern side of the one-block-long storrie street, from market to 18th streets. previously a leftover strip of undeveloped land with topographical challenges, it has in recent decades evolved into a delightful public park, almost all at the hands of a local, born-in-san francisco chap who tends the garden daily. (he’s happy to chat with anyone who drops in to see the garden.) the park is notable for some giant cottonwoods (populus sp.) and a few eucalypts and their kin from australia.  we strolled west on 18th, passing the former sha’ar zahav jewish synagogue before turning south onto 19th street, which curves around and heads east after crossing caselli avenue. at yukon street, we noted the large monterey pines (pinus radiata) in goat hill park on the far corner, before turning north on yukon street. we turned east (right) on caselli and followed it to tiny clover lane, which rises to thorp lane. we followed thorp east to its end at 19th, and headed east on 19th to douglass street. there we turned north, walking past the glorious caselli mansion at douglas and caselli. we ended our walk at 18th. our walk was roughly a mile in length.  we may return to this neighborhood for a properly chalked walk, but, in the interim, we hope you’ll enjoy some of the photographs taken along the way.

a red flowering gum in the castro neighborhood








red flowering gums - san francisco's best tree!   why have we stopped planting them?

july 17, 2024
by michael sullivan





please join jason dewees, horticulturist at flora grubb gardens and author of designing with palms, mike sullivan (author of trees of san francisco and webmaster of www.sftrees.com) and richard turner (retired editor of pacific horticulture) in declaring the last week of july as “red flowering gum week” in san francisco.  this amazing tree is in full bloom now - we need to start planting it again!  spread the word:



whereas red flowering gum trees have stunningly beautiful red, orange, pink or white flowers every summer that outshine any other tree in san francisco; and whereas mature red flowering gums are large trees with leaves that remain on the tree year-round, and so are excellent contributors to the fight against climate change; and  whereas as natives of western australia, red flowering gums thrive in our cool coastal climate; and are one of the best adapted trees to san francisco’s conditions; whereas the largest documented red flowering gum in northern california, and the 2nd largest in the united states, is in san francisco in san francisco’s st. francis woods neighborhood in the monterey boulevard median near the intersection of junipero serra boulevard; and whereas red flowering gums bloom from early july through september, but reach their peak bloom in late july;whereas the flowering season of red flowering gums coincides with peak tourist season in san francisco, offering visitors instagram-worthy brilliant floral displays;whereas, despite these many positive attributes, the city of san francisco has virtually stopped planting red flowering gum trees; now, therefore, be it resolved, that the many fans of this amazing tree declare the last week of july now and henceforth to be “red flowering gum week” in the city and county of san francisco, dedicated to promoting the many advantages of, and sharing images and information about, san francisco’s best tree!

southeast bernal heights tree tour

july 15, 2024
by michael sullivan





 we return for a fourth walk on the slopes of bernal heights, this time to the southeastern corner of the neighborhood. known for its mix of 19th, 20th, and 21st century residences, the neighborhood also offers dramatic views to the south and east, and a lively shopping district along cortland avenue. despite the notoriously narrow streets, trees are common and diverse, including two that are “city champions” - the largest of their kind in the city. today’s walk begins at the northwest corner of nevada street and cortland avenue, and heads north (uphill) on nevada to powhattan avenue, then east on powhattan one block to nebraska street. head south (downhill) on nebraska to cortland, and then east on cortland for about half a block. the walk continues on the south side of cortland on bronte street. (be careful crossing cortland as there is no crosswalk at this point; it may be safer to go further east and use the crosswalk at bradford street.) head south (now, uphill) on bronte to jarboe avenue, then west on jarboe to putnam street, and north  (downhill) on putnam to cortland. the walk ends one block west at cortland and nevada. this walk is about 1 ½ miles in length, with some moderately steep slopes. numbered trees are labeled with common and scientific names and country of origin, all written in white chalk on the sidewalk; accompanying numbers, in blue, run from 1 to 23. white arrows on the pavement provide directions whenever a turn is needed.nevada street, cortland to powhattan, west side1. 170 nevada             sweetgum (liquidambar styraciflua), e usa to mexico & central america

grace cathedral, decked out for pride month








nob hill tree tour (6-1-24)

june 01, 2024
by michael sullivan





for our 50th (!) chalk tree tour, we chose nob hill - one of the most iconic of the city’s many historic neighborhoods. crowned by the magnificent 20th century gothic-style grace cathedral, the hilltop is the home of the city’s finest hotels, the only gilded age mansion to survive the 1906 earthquake and fire (built by james flood), and beautiful huntington park—a formal oasis in the heart of the city. as we chalked this tour on the first day of pride month, colorful flags and banners waved from all the hotels, along with rainbow-painted steps from taylor street up to the cathedral’s main entrance, all in honor of the city’s diverse and inclusive culture. with the exception of the flood mansion, all of the buildings in this predominantly residential neighborhood were built after the 1906 earthquake; the diversity of architectural styles is captivating. for such a dense neighborhood, trees are surprisingly plentiful and unexpectedly diverse. 













today’s walk is a simple one. it begins at the interfaith memorial labyrinth at the top and to the side of the steps at grace cathedral, which is on taylor street between california and sacramento streets. the labyrinth is ringed with some particularly fine purple leaf plums (a prunus cerasifera cultivar). from the labyrinth, follow the walkway north towards the canary island date palm, which is tree #1. once down at street level, head west on sacramento past jones street to golden court. after exploring this fascinating pedestrian lane, continue west on sacramento past leavenworth street to kimball place, another intriguing lane. then, return to leavenworth and head north to clay street, east on clay to taylor, and back south on taylor to the cathedral. cross sacramento and taylor streets to enter huntington park for a delightful spot to sit and rest your feet. this walk is almost a mile and a half in length.










grace cathedral’s labyrinth, surrounded by purple leaf plum trees  (prunus cerasifera)





 numbered trees are labeled with common and scientific names and country of origin, all written in white chalk on the sidewalk; accompanying numbers, in blue, run from 1 to 24. white arrows on the pavement provide directions whenever a turn is needed.

 the street addresses provided below will help when the chalk has faded. most of the trees on this walk are planted in sidewalk pockets; a few are planted within the front or rear gardens of homes along the route. and a few are found in the quaint and curious dead-end lanes that are found in this neighborhood—reminiscent of the mythical barbary lane in armistead maupin’s tales of the city.










canary island date palm (phoenix canariensis)





 2. 1230 sacramento                 marina strawberry tree (arbutus ‘marina’), hybrid of mediterranean species (tree is across the street; first introduced in san francisco) **note the beautifully shaped bougainvillea on the ornate building next door to 1230.** 3. n side of cathedral             italian buckthorn (rhamnus alaternus), mediterranean basin (this is typically a shrub but has been trained into a tree form here)













 **note the well-planted vertical garden, filled with a variety of ferns, on the north wall of the cathedral school for boys, just east of jones.** sacramento street, jones to golden court, south side4. 1155 jones                indian laurel fig (ficus microcarpa ‘nitida’), southern asia to n australia (the entire block is planted with this tree, and other blocks as well; formerly one of sf’s most planted trees) 5. 1329 sacramento     allspice magnolia (magnolia x foggii), hybrid of two asian species, m. figo and m. doltsopa (tree is growing in the narrow and dark gap between the buildings; despite the deep shade, it is flowering heavily; enjoy the intense fragrance of the white blossoms; it is likely a city champion)

red-flowering gum (corymbia ficifolia)





12. 1202 leavenworth             red-flowering gum (corymbia ficifolia), sw australia (produces bright red, orange, or pink flowers in summer; among the best and showiest of trees in sf’s urban forest; we cannot understand why the city is no longer planting this amazing tree!)

this is what we’ve lost….








bunya bunya in west portal removed by owner - another one of sf's best trees is gone

march 26, 2024
by michael sullivan












this is what you’ll see now…





another very sad story for san francisco tree lovers - the majestic bunya bunya tree (araucaria bidwillii) at 201 vicente street in the west portal neighborhood, has been removed by the owner.  nothing left but a stump.  i don’t have the details as to why, but i do know it was done without a permit - which is a no no, since the tree was a “significant tree” that was close enough to the sidewalk to require a city permit for removal.  the public works department is aware of the violation and will be dealing with the owner.  this is the second of san francisco’s “top 10” trees to be lost within the last year - the amazing california buckeye at willard street north and mcallister died of unknown causes last winter, and now this.   i previously ranked the california buckeye as my #2 in the city and this bunya bunya was #4.  both trees are highlighted in my trees of san francisco book.   so sad to lose these two landmarks!

trees of angel island (2-24-24)

february 26, 2024
by michael sullivan





i did a bike trip to angel island today, not thinking i would see a lot of tree diversity.  as expected, the island is full of coast live oaks, toyon and the occasional california buckeye and california bay.   but what i didn’t expect was to find some unusual specimen trees near the angel island immigration museum.to get to the immigration museum, you head downhill from the perimeter road at a point on the northeast part of the island.  on the walk down, on your left you’ll see a couple of stately spotted gums (corymbia maculata).  










spotted gums (corymbia maculata)





continue down the road to the open area below the museum, and to your far left is a large bunya bunya tree tree (araucaria bidwillii), native to australia.  bunya bunyas are rare in san francisco, and one of our best was just cut down in west portal at vicente and wawona, so this was a welcome sight.










bunya bunya tree (araucaria bidwillii)





at the other end of the clearing near the museum is a close relative of the bunya bunya - a norfolk island pine (araucaria heterophylla), also large and mature.  it wouldn’t surprise me if they were planted at the same time.  










norfolk island pine  (araucaria heterophylla)





and in between the two araucaria, facing the water, two canary island date palms (phoenix canariensis).










canary island date palms (phoenix canariensis)





angel island used to be full of blue gum eucalyptus trees (eucalyptus globulus), but 80 acres of eucalyptus were removed in the 1990s - among other things, they were thought to be a fire hazard that created risk for the nearby historic buildings.  however, there are still beautiful specimens of this tree to be found around the island.

and lastly, the most common tree on the island - coast live oak (quercus agrifolia).

trees of mexico city (1-25-24)

february 13, 2024
by michael sullivan





i visited mexico city with my family in late january 2024 - we stayed in the roma norte neighborhood, and didn’t stray very far from there, so this blog may not be representative of the entire city’s trees.  it was my first time in mexico city.  i had heard that the city was very leafy, and i found that to be accurate.   in fact, at least in the roma norte neighborhood, the street trees are so dense that it’s not easy to get an instagram-worthy photo of an individual tree!   this link from google maps of a street not far from our hotel will give you a sense of this part of mexico city.  we visited one of the city’s botanical gardens (jardin botanico del bosque de chapultepec), but i found it underwhelming.  the cactus and agave collections were attractive, but the park is relatively small (13 acres), and very few tree specimens were labeled.  the three species that dominated the streets of our neighborhood were shamel ash (fraxinus uhdei), glossy privet (ligustrum lucidum) and american sweetgum (liquidambar styraciflua).    two of the three are native to mexico - shamel ash is native from west-central mexico to costa rica, and sweetgum is found in disjointed areas from central mexico to nicaragua.    










shamel ash (fraxinus uhdei)





the ash trees were the most abundant of all, which saddened me a bit to think that the emerald ash borer is marching across the continent, killing every ash it encounters, and eventually i suspect will make it to mexico city.  










shamel ash (fraxinus uhdei) - closeup of leaves and samaras (fruits)












glossy privet (ligustrum lucidum) - closeup












american sweetgum (liquidambar styraciflua) - closeup of leaves





another tree that was very common on city streets was weeping fig (ficus benjamina).  it’s very rare as a street tree in my native san francisco, but i saw it everywhere in mexico city.  










weeping fig (ficus benjamina) - closeup












weeping fig (ficus benjamina)





occasionally i ran across orchid trees (bauhinia purpurea) in bloom as street trees.  










orchid tree (bauhinia purpurea)





not a tree, but another plant i saw everywhere in our neighorhood was split leaf philodendron (thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum). 













when we ventured out of roma norte into other neighborhoods, the canopy thinned out a bit (and i also started to see some more unusual tree species.  below is a cook pine that we encountered in the condesa neighborhhood, not far from the city’s botanical garden.  this tree always leans towards the equator (a discovery by botanist matt ritter in 2017), and this one was duly leaning south!










cook pine (araucaria columnaris) on calle juan de la barrera near the corner of avenida mazatlan in the condesa neighborhood





we visited casa gilardi, a home designed by minimalist architect luis barragan-designed - the family that has owned it since it was built it gives private tours.  it’s in the san miguel chapultepec neighborhood, and if you’re into architecture or home design, i really recommend it.   inside the open air courtyard of the home is a large jacaranda (jacaranda mimosifolia), a tree native to argentina and bolivia - but very popular in mexico city.

a hallway at casa gilardi












jacaranda (jacaranda mimosifolia) in the courtyard at casa gilardi





a couple of days later i saw what i think it the largest jacaranda i’ve ever seen - the address is 208 jalapa in the roma norte neighborhood.  










a huge jacaranda (jacaranda mimosifolia) at 208 jalapa in roma norte





at 7,350 feet in altitude, mexico city isn’t tropical, but since it rarely has freezing temperatures, there are lots of palm trees that do well here.   canary island date palms (phoenix canariensis) were pretty common.  










canary island date palm (phoenix canariensis)





and not far from our hotel (at the intersection of calle jalapa and calle puebla in roma norte), we found a corner full of bismarck palms (bismarckia nobilis), a tree native to madagascar.   










bismarck palm (bismarckia nobilis)





compared to my native san francisco, there were relatively few eucalyptus trees.   we did see a beautiful eucalyptus relative - a spotted gym (corymbia maculata) on avenida insurgentes sur near avenida alvaro obregon in roma norte.

bailey's acacia - first sign of a san francisco spring!

february 09, 2024
by michael sullivan





it’s a little late this year - normally this tree blooms in january in san francisco.  bailey’s acacia (acacia baileyana) is a tree from eastern australia that blooms with striking yellow flowers.  it’s the first of our trees to bloom - next will be the plum trees (later in february), then the cherries (march), and even later (april/may) the hawthorns.  as you can see from the partially hidden street sign, this tree is at the corner of 17th and shrader streets in the cole valley neighborhood.  and it has one more claim to fame - this tree was the one photographed by author and botany professor matt ritter for his (fantastic) book “a californian’s guide to the trees among us”.

fairmount hill tree tour (2-3-24)

february 05, 2024
by michael sullivan





 













 between showers on a mostly windless day, we chose a relatively quiet neighborhood wedged between the northeastern extent of glen park and the southern extent of noe valley. it covers the lower slopes of a hill known as fairmount, one of the many hills that make up the san miguel hills in this part of the city. we were pleased with the diversity of trees in this small neighborhood. but, the real draw is the variety of residential architecture, from stunning and beautifully restored victorians to modest cottages, along with some ‘50s-‘60s apartment buildings. laidley street is known for its collection of radical contemporary architecture from the ‘80s and ‘90s. take time to appreciate this diversity in residential design. today’s walk is a simple one. it begins on whitney street, at its terminus at chenery street. it heads north on whitney for two blocks to randall street, then continues on randall for two more blocks to harper street, and heads uphill on harper to laidley street. from there it heads southeast-ish on laidley to miguel street, downhill on miguel to whitney, and then north again on whitney for a few yards. this walk is almost a mile and a half in length. numbered trees are labeled with common and scientific names and country of origin, all written in white chalk on the sidewalk; accompanying numbers, in blue, run from 1 to 34. white arrows on the pavement provide directions whenever a turn is needed. whitney street, chenery to fairmount, east side1. 298 chenery            brisbane box (lophostemon confertus), e australia (tree is on whitney) 2. 263 whitney           cajeput tree (melaleuca quinquenervia), new caledonia, new guinea, e australia (3 trees, including 1 across the street; feel the distinctive spongy bark) 3. 249 whitney           ginkgo (ginkgo biloba), china (last of an ancient lineage; there are many ginkgos in the neighborhood, including some very young ones on  miguel)

on a crisp december morning, we returned to the western end of pacific heights, a neighborhood filled with well-kept victorian homes, a delightful shopping district, one of the finest branch libraries in the city, and one of the few remaining single-screen movie houses (the vogue) in town.  for this tour we were happy to be joined by josh gevertz, arboretum director at cypress lawn cemetery in colma (home to some amazing trees - it was recently recognized as a level i arboretum by morton arboretum’s international arbnet program - take the virtual tree tour here).   today’s walk begins in front of the elegant presidio branch library, at 3150 sacramento street, and heads east on sacramento to baker street, south on baker to pine street, east on pine to lyon street. the walk then turns south on lyon for half a block, crosses lyon to the east side, then heads north on lyon to sacramento, and finally east on sacramento back to the library. this walk is a little over one mile in length. numbered trees are labeled with common and scientific names and country of origin, all written in white chalk on the sidewalk; accompanying numbers, in blue, run from 1 to 25. white arrows on the pavement provide directions whenever a turn is needed. sacramento street, lyon to baker, north side

top photos of this blog's first decade!

november 05, 2023
by michael sullivan





i noticed recently that this blog just had a 10 year anniversary - my first post was august 30, 2013.  i scrolled through the decade of posts, and found some photos that made me smile.  here are my top  sftrees.com photos from the last 10 years:










spotted gum (corymbia maculata) adjacent to the mission pool at 19th street between guererro and valencia.  what a spectacular tree!












the largest monterey cypress in the country!   that’s me under the tree - in march 2021 i did a pilgrimage to see this amazing tree.  it’s located at 751 pescadero creek road in pescadero - about 8 miles inland from highway 1.












may 2020 - jason dewees (left), richard turner (right) and me on our potrero hill tour, next to a purple smoke tree (cotinus coggygria ‘royal purple’). that’s a box of chalk in my hand.  this was in the depths of the pandemic, so we were doing our chalk tree tours with masks.  












the yellow-blooming new zealand christmas tree (metrosideros excelsa) at 1221 stanyan street.  my favorite individual tree in san francisco.












a silk oak leaf on the sidewalk at 3520 18th/valencia in the mission












a red flowering gum (corymbia ficifolia) on monterey boulevard in st. francisco woods.  i love this species in san francisco more than any other.  why is the city restricting the planting of this tree??!












garage on grove street in the nopa neighborhood












a stately wine palm (jubaea chilensis) at the sunnyside conservatory on monterey boulevard.  it takes a long time for this palm species to get this tall.












and another palm - this time a mexican fan palm (washingtonia robusta) in missionbay












a doodle, courtesy of jason dewees












the california buckeye (aesculus californica) at 2694 mcallister/willard street - largest and probably oldest of its species in san francisco.   sadly, this tree died over the 2022/2023 winter.   here it is in glorious bloom in june 2020.  












a dawn redwood (metasequoia glyptostroboides) in the arnold arboretum in boston in august 2021 - that’s my sister patricia under the tree for scale.   the arnold arboretum organized the effort to bring seeds back from china after the tree was discovered in the 1940s, and this tree was planted in 1948 when the seeds arrived.  this is the largest one in the arboretum, and since their trees were planted first, it may be the largest dawn redwood in the united states!












sidewalk imprint of a london plane leaf on page street in the haight-ashbury neighborhood












california buckeye (aesculus californica) on poppy lane in glen park












tulip tree (liriodendron tulipifera) at the corner of kearny and vallejo on telegraph hill












gold medallion tree (cassia leptophylla) at 227 cole in the nopa neighborhood.  this one is the “city champion” - biggest of the species in san francisco












beautiful garage door artwork at 523 precita near precita park (the owner is the artist!)












  monterey pine (pinus radiata) at 214 santa clara avenue.  this specimen is the largest in the western hemisphere!












my husband and i took a trip to sicily in april 2022 - this is a moreton bay fig (ficus macrophylla v. columnaris) in the palermo botanical gardeny. that’s me standing behind one of the buttressing roots of the tree.












a carob tree (ceratonia siliqua) in a field in sicily

precita park/peralta heights tree tour

october 16, 2023
by michael sullivan





 sunny, warm, and windless—a perfect october day in san francisco, particularly after the past four uncommonly cool months. we chose a relatively little known neighborhood for today’s walk: peralta heights, a hilly neighborhood on the northeastern slope of bernal heights. this is a fairly warm pocket of the city, with quirky architecture and a surprisingly diverse array of trees to be enjoyed.  today’s walk begins in front of the precita park cafe & grill, at alabama street and precita avenue, and heads east on precita to florida street, then crosses precita and returns to alabama. it then heads south on alabama to mullen street, east (and slightly uphill) on mullen all the way to montcalm street, then west on montcalm to alabama, and finally north on alabama back to precita. this walk is a little under one and a half miles in length.  numbered trees are labeled with common and scientific names and country of origin, all written in white chalk on the sidewalk; accompanying numbers, in blue, run from 1 to 43. white arrows on the pavement provide directions whenever a turn is needed.

trees of copenhagen

august 10, 2023
by michael sullivan





i visited copenhagen in july 2023, and found some remarkable trees in the four days that i was there, all in the central part of the city.  some were in copenhagen’s very nice botanical garden, some in the king’s garden, one in the city’s best art museum (!), and one in a pot just outside the home where we stayed.  see below! 










lavalle hawthorns (crataegus x lavallei) adjacent to the little mermaid





perhaps the most famous tourist attraction in copenhagen is the “little mermaid”.  some of our friends told us not to bother, but we were strolling along the water on our first day in the city, and ran across it.  just adjacent to the little mermaid was a small grove of lavalle hawthorns (crataegus x lavallei).   the king’s garden (also known as rosenborg garden) in central copenhagen is the oldest and most visited park in central copenhagen - it was established in the early 17th century as the private garden of king christian iv's rosenborg castle, which is adjacent.  it’s full of stately mature trees that are happy in northern europe.










white willow (salix alba) in the king’s garden












common lime or european lime (tilia x europaea) in the king’s garden





i don’t normally expect to find landmark trees in art museums, but just inside the entrance to the glyptoteket (copenhagen’s best art museum) was this nice example specimen of a canary island date palm (phoenix canariensis).  










canary island date palm (phoenix canariensis) in the glyptoteket





and copenhagen has a lovely botanical garden in center city.  it was raining off and on the day i visited, but in between the showers i found some trees worth noting.  just inside the gate on the left was an empress tree (pawlonia tomentosa) - easily identifiable by the huge leaves and distinctive seeds.  










empress tree (pawlonia tomentosa)












empress tree - closeup of leaves and fruits





if you stay to the left after entering the garden, eventually you will reach this sweet chestnut tree (castanea sativa).  i didn’t find man of these in scandinavia on our trip, so it caught my eye.  










sweet chestnut (castanea sativa)












sweet chestnut (closeup - leaves and fruits)





i think the most impressive grouping of trees were on a small hill near the center of the garden.  side by side were two trees that are actually fairly close relatives - a dawn redwood (metasequoia glyptostroboides) right next to a coast redwood (sequoia sempervirens).  the coast redwood is the tallest tree in the world, and the dawn redwood was thought to have been extinct (known only from fossil records) until a specimen was discovered in central china in 1941.  










a dawn redwood (metasequoia glyptostroboides) on the left, right next to a coast redwood (sequoia sempervirens) on the right





and just behind these two, another close relative of both - a giant sequoia (sequoiadendron giganteum), native to the sierra nevada mountains of central california.  this is the tree that is the most massive tree in the world, and it was in the bloom of health here in copenhagen!










giant sequoia (sequoiadendron giganteum)





we stayed very close to “churchillparken” (churchill park) in copenhagen, and as i meandered there one day, i ran across this spectacular specimen of sycamore maple (acer pseudoplatanus).  we don’t see this tree much in my hometown of san francisco, so it was a treat to find it (and many others nearby). 










sycamore maple (acer pseudoplatanus) in churchillparken (churchill park)





and not too far away, next to one of the many canals, a weeping willow (salix babylonica).










weeping willow (salix babylonica) in churchill park





and finally, i think it’s a little cold for this tree in copenhagen, but just outside the home where we were staying was this baby monkey puzzle tree (araucaria araucana).  i’m sure it will be brought inside for the winter!

reunited with an old friend - american beech

july 28, 2023
by michael sullivan





i grew up in a maple/beech climax forest in herkimer county, new york.   i could walk out my door and follow trails leading into the forest behind our home, and within minutes i’d be deep in a dark forest of american beech trees (fagus americana).   i absolutely loved these trees - stately, with beautifully smooth grey bark, and beautiful leaves - one nature writer wrote that “an unearthly pale pure green clothes the tree in a misty nimbus of light”.sadly, since i left the northeast, american beech trees have been suffering from beech bark disease,  disease that causes mortality and defects in the trees.   i tried to find my old friends, the gigantic smooth-barked giants of my childhood, but they were all dead - i saw occasional stumps, but nothing else. but it wasn’t all sad - i remember clearly planting a beech sapling in the 1970s in a clearing just behind our home in poland, new york.   a few weeks ago i visited that exact spot to see if it was still there, and was so happy to see it thriving.   that’s me with my tree in the photo above. one reason i was happy to find my old friend is that i hadn’t seen one of his kind in a long time.  you’ll never see an american beech in the bay area - the tree can’t handle the compacted soils of our cities, and i suspect 8 months without rainfall is also tough for a tree that’s used to the rainy east coast.  all of the beech trees in urban and suburban california are european beech (fagus sylvatica).

valencia - guerrero tree tour

july 10, 2023
by michael sullivan





 













yes, another chilly, overcast, and ridiculously windy summer day in san francisco… we chose to focus today’s walk on a portion of the mission district that merges with the liberty hill historic district, between 19th and 23rd streets and between valencia and guerrero streets. we have touched on this neighborhood before, but this tour focused on the blocks between valencia and guerrero. in addition to some striking mature trees and magnificent victorian-era homes in the liberty hill area, there are plenty of appealing dining and drinking establishments to enjoy along valencia street.  today’s walk begins in front of the mission pool and playground, on 19th street at linda street. head east on 19th to valencia street, then south on valencia to 20th street. head west on 20th to guerrero, then south on guerrero to liberty street, and east on liberty back to valencia. continue south on valencia to 21st street, west on 21st to guerrero, south again on guerrero to hill street, east on hill to valencia, south on valencia to 22nd, and east on 22nd to guerrero again. at guerrero, cross 22nd and head back east on 22nd to san jose avenue, then south on san jose to alvarado street, west briefly on alvarado and then back to san jose. head south on san jose to the sw corner of 23rd street. the tour ends here; unlike most of our tours, this is a one-way route, not a loop. go back to valencia to return to the start of the tour. this one-way walk is under two miles in length. numbered trees are labeled with common and scientific names and country of origin, all written in white chalk on the sidewalk; accompanying numbers, in blue, run from 1 to 45. white arrows on the pavement provide directions whenever a turn is needed. 19th street, linda to valencia, north side

new zealand christmas trees at peak bloom

july 04, 2023
by michael sullivan












17th street near ord, north side





new zealand christmas trees (metrosideros excelsa), known as pōhutukawa in their native new zealand, love san francisco’s cool maritime climate - and they’re in full bloom right now (early july - a little bit late this year!).   new zealand christmas trees are in the myrtle family, and are relatives of the eucalyptus and other trees with “bottlebrush”-type flowers (what you’re seeing in the flowers are not petals, but the male stamens of the tree).  almost all of the thousands of new zealand christmas on the streets of san francisco have  red blooms, but there’s one tree at 1221 stanyan street in cole valley that puts on a show with eye-popping yellow flowers. 










1221 stanyan street





how did this tree end up with yellow flowers? the story goes back to victor reiter, san francisco’s most famous plantsman from the 1940s until his death in 1986. in 1940, there was a natural mutation of the species on tiny motiti island in the bay of plenty in new zealand. reiter was one of the first californians to obtain a cutting - from a friend who happened to be visiting new zealand. as the reiter family lived in several homes in a three-block stretch of stanyan street, they planted the curiosity in front of their 1221 stanyan address—still occupied today by a family member. and more than 70 years later, the tree is thriving. it’s a beautiful mutant with an amazing history and pedigree—and my favorite tree in san francisco.

castro/noe summit tree tour  (6-4-23)

june 06, 2023

finally, a bright sunny day in san francisco! and a beautiful hilltop from which to enjoy the weather and the views. we chose the hill that separates noe valley from eureka valley and the castro. to put it another way, we are at the divide between islais creek and mission creek watersheds. this neighborhood of beautiful homes and small but richly planted front gardens also offers an array of interesting trees around which to develop today’s walk. (don’t miss the views.) today’s walk begins at the northwestern corner of castro and 22nd streets. head west (uphill) on 22nd to the base of the steps, then cross the street and return to castro. head north on castro to hill street, then cross castro and head east on hill to noe street. at noe, turn left and continue north to 21st street. head east on 21st to sanchez street, then south on sanchez to hill, west on hill to noe, south on noe to 22nd, and west on 22nd to the start of the tour at castro. this walk is just over a mile in length. numbered trees are labeled with common and scientific names and country of origin, all written in white chalk on the sidewalk; accompanying numbers, in blue, run from 1 to 52. white arrows on the pavement provide directions whenever a turn is needed. this walking tour was organized by mike sullivan, author of the trees of san francisco and webmaster of www.sftrees.com; jason dewees, horticulturist at flora grubb gardens and author of designing with palms; richard turner, retired editor of pacific horticulture magazine and sairus patel, soon-to-be editor of trees of stanford and environs.  you can follow mike and jason on their tree-themed instagram pages at @sftreeguy and @loulufan. one other great book on san francisco trees, while you’re at it: elizabeth mcclintock’s trees of golden gate park, edited by richard turner. if you’re a tree enthusiast, buy all three books!”
