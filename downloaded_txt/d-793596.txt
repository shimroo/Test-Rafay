navigating the bible 



feb 9, 2025 – mar 23, 2025




navigating the bible february 9 through march 23, for grades 3, 4, and 5 this seven-week series will help the kids get to know the bible better and develop their skills in bible use.  the kids will learn about its organization, how the bible came to be, examine the different kinds of literature and why it’s important to the story, discover how the message moved from one man to a nation to the world, how to use all the pieces found in the bible and introduce them to resources outside the bible that can help them understand scripture better.  on march 23, we will have a bible presentation for all those in grades 3 - 5.
