increasing health and productivity with adjustable task seating since 1990 



							the human body was not made for sitting. lack of proper support while seated adds stress to the body, which over a period of time, can lead to muscle fatigue, circulatory problems and even spinal injuries. proper ergonomic seating provides the support essential to your health and the comfort you need to be productive.


at ergocentric, our sole mission is to design and manufacture the best ergonomic chairs in the world and we are recognized as north america’s premier manufacturer of high-quality ergonomic seating for office, specialty and healthcare environments.
