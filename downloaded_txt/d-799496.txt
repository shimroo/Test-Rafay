this site gives you the opportunity to view examples of our products which you can own 
and admire in the comfort of your own home.
we have been licensed by bbc worldwide since 1994 when we first began with a small 
range of doctor who items reproduced from original props. this gave people the 
opportunity to own a replica as close to the original television props as possible which 
would be something they would adore and keep for years to come.
twenty five years later, our range has expanded exponentially.
our experts put the passion and attention to detail into creating items using their 
combined experience of working within the television and film industry. we are passionate 
and professional about our work and proud to have been part of the wonderful 
world of doctor who for so many years.
