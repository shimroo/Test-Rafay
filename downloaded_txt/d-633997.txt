victoria elbroch





margaret dwyer presents watercolor winter (sa 7). engage with winter through an artistic lens alongside fellow watercolor artists! enter a frosty world of frozen ponds, wintry woods, warm lights, moody skies, and falling snow. demonstrations will address when to leave the white of the paper, use masking fluid, or add white ink. special fundraiser studio tour for our scholarship program (sa 23), march 15 at 10 am (snow date march 22). vicky and lawrence elbroch invite you to see a demonstration at their studios in an old victorian in kittery, as a fundraiser for sanctuary art connects, our scholarship program. victoria draws her inspiration from trees, especially ancient survivors. she will show you her process from sketchbook or line drawings done on location in the uk, to impressive large tree portraits either in color or black and white. her smaller work incorporates cut paper and collage and tells the nostalgic story of the english countryside she left when she was 19. lawrence is a photographer with a huge body of work from their travels in asia. his latest works are collaborations with victoria; he photographs her drawings and using them as a starting- point, mixes them with photographs of the real trees by layering in photoshop. it is difficult to know where one begins and the other takes over. these two working artists are being so generous with their time. i hope you will take the time to engage with them and their wonderful work.it’s for a good cause!cheers,christopher
