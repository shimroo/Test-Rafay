center for astrophysics
harvard & smithsonian
how can we expand the limits of human knowledge further into the unknown? the center for astrophysics is a collaboration between the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and harvard college observatory that’s designed to ask big questions about the universe, build the tools needed to answer them, and share the resulting discoveries with the world.












"the coming decade will be an extremely exciting time for astrophysics with the next generation space- and ground-based telescopes being built and coming on-line. the cfa's strength is the  expertise of its scientists and researchers across the full electromagnetic spectrum from the x-rays through to the radio and sub-mm. this year, we are developing a 10-year scientific strategic plan to answer some of astronomy's biggest questions.  our work with the smithsonian to develop nationwide education and outreach programs will bring astronomy to school kids across america."
