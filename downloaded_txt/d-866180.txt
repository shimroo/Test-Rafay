outsource with confidence

		    our extensive experience proves the common sense premise that every
			client's needs are different, even within the same industry, government
			agency, or application area.  as a result, every microadvantage
			project is customized and tailored to specific client requirements by
			our experienced and dedicated staff.  we do not have an
			"out-of-the-box" approach to digital conversions. 
			our goal is to make each project thoroughly	successful and to be accepted 
			as a long-term valued partner by our clients.

		    integrity, reliability, price and particularly quality of service set us apart from 
		    other companies in the document imaging business. we use advanced technological and 
		    procedural methods such as strict security, double-keyed indexing, hand counting of 
		    all pages prior to scanning, examining the validity of all created electronic files, 
		    and generating auditable processing records that ensure the authenticity of our 
		    electronic documents and their legal admissibility.
