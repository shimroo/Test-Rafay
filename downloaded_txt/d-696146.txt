“
it's obvious that battlefield b&b takes much pride in their business, and enjoys showing off for their guests.  it's in a prime location and has ties to the battle (i believe it was a hospital during the battle).  very beautiful inside, very beautiful grounds, friendly accommodating staff, and a great start to the day with storytelling and a 5 star breakfast!

“
the very best part was the morning history talk by local living historians. mr vice gave an excellent history of the lead up to the civil war and mr gunlock was very engaging with local stories of gettysburg, relics, and the opportunity to fire civil war era rifles. we loved that.
