meow, arf, and amen to we. 

update: 
this is something i imagined recently:
1,2 - arden and daydreamer fall back in love while 57 -garza tries 
to sort things out about the ones named casey who changed
 him forever into a orange-haired girl.
with nearly all the known team transformed into orange-haired girls,
a investigation is held especially to find out more into 
casey's plans to save the world.
3,4,5
triplet, a triple being able to  turn into three beings before the
death ray nearly killed them , goes back home to find their homeworld
full of evil speedsters which they vow to remerge them into one being.
they get creamed and tied up as 3 lost souls bad mouth the one who saved and 
tried to customize the suddenly  suprising incorporateds experienced hell full of white and black poodles.
who were immortal. three green haired boys who were not turned female try to help but a musician also
sent to harm the triplet and turn the boys female. the 6 heroines complain a lot 
about physically sou8nding the same as the female young woman who brought
all the lost incorporateds back, with much of the stuff they took from her room on their way
out of the world ship neverrest mark 3.  
6,7,8 terrel is restored curious about the fate of her girlfriend, who was involved in a battle between scarf
 and them while omeson padera tried to return for
one more battle.
9,10 halifax and lightwave must come to their mutual rewedding due to their perishing in the 
death ray. for some reason garza does her best to slow down their advances to 
each other and is later told off by the casey who survived the final battle, and garza tells casey 
she made one mistake... sending 57 incorporateds instead of one numbered 57... garza.

11,12,13 attempts to change everyone back to their own forms with power, but garza
