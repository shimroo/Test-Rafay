nyaa seeks to improve the relationship between housing providers and renters; to improve government regulations, operations and agencies that interact with housing providers;we work to improve the ability of housing providers to maintain and operate rental housing in new york city; and to advocate for better housing policy in new york state, so we can excel at housing new york.
