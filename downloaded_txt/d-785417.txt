fellatio facts.....gimme some head!!!(she swallowed it)





* new england journal of medicine * american cancer societyhealth library* fellatio * breast cancer * 6 steps to cancer prevention (ap) -- women who perform the act of fellatio and swallow semen on a regular basis, one to two times a week, may reduce their risk of breast cancer by up to 40 percent, a north carolina state university study found. doctors had never suspected a link between the act of fellatio and breast cancer, but new research being performed at north carolina state university is starting to suggest that there could be an important link between the two.in a study of over 15,000 women suspected of having performed regular fellatio and swallowed the ejaculatory fluid, over the past ten years, the researchers found that those actually having performed the act regularly, one to two times a week, had a lower occurance of breast cancer than those who had not. there was no increased risk, however, for those who did not regularly perform. "i think it removes the last shade of doubt that fellatio is actually a healthy act," said dr. a.j. kramer of johns hopkins school of medicine, who was not involved in the research. "i am surprised by these findings, but am also excited that the researchers may have discovered a relatively easy way to lower the occurance of breast cancer in women." the university researchers stressed that, though breast cancer is relatively uncommon, any steps taken to reduce the risk would be a wise decision. "only with regular occurance will your chances be reduced, so i encourage all women out there to make fellatio an important part of their daily routine," said dr. helena shifteer, one of the researchers at the university. "since the emergence of the research, i try to fellate at least once every other night to reduce my chances." the study is reported in friday's journal of medical research. in 1991, 43,582 women died of breast cancer, as reported by the national cancer institute. dr. len lictepeen, deputy chief medical officer for the american cancer society, said women should not overlook or "play down" these findings. "this will hopefully change women's practice and patterns, resulting in a severe drop in the future number of cases," lictepeen said. sooner said the research shows no increase in the risk of breast cancer in those who are, for whatever reason, not able to fellate regularly. "there's definitely fertile ground for more research. many have stepped forward to volunteer for related research now in the planning stages," he said. almost every woman is, at some point, going to perform the act of fellatio, but it is the frequency at which this event occurs that makes the difference, say researchers. also key seems to be the protein and enzyme count in the semen, but researchers are again waiting for more test data. the reasearch consisted of two groups, 6,246 women ages 25 to 45 who had performed fellatio and swallowed on a regular basis over the past five to ten years, and 9,728 women who had not or did not swallow. the group of women who had performed and swallowed had a breast cancer rate of 1.9 percent and the group who had not had a breast cancer rate of 10.4 percent. "the findings do suggest that there are other causes for breast cancer besides the absence of regular fellatio," shafteer said. "it's a cause, not the cause."

cafe habana





this is a must place to eat at after a long day shopping in nolita or soho. café habana is a cuban-mexican eatery, located on elizabeth and prince st. some of the known dishes include the seasoned roasted pork, grilled steaks and sautéed chicken. i can’t forget their mexican-style grilled corn, a gooey mixture of fresh corn topped with chili powder, melted cheese and lime, is a crowd-pleasing, albeit messy, delight that comes with a cup of individually wrapped toothpicks, one of my favorites. this is a hot spot so please be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes on a regular day and up to 30 min on a saturday night. you may catch a few movie starts in the building from time to time. so when your shopping at the boutiques on the broadway backblocks or even stopping by the nike id store make sure you stop at café habana!

the windsor knot





now something for my sophisticated brothers who rock suits!the windsor knot is a thick, wide and triangular tie knot that projects confidence. it would therefore be your knot of choice for presentations, job interviews, courtroom appearances etc. it is best suited for spread collar shirts and it's actually quite easy to do. while just about everyone can use this tie knot to tie his tie, it looks especially well on men with longer necks as its wide form shortens the perceived height of the neck a little bit.to tie the windsor knot, select a tie of your choice and stand in front of a mirror. then simply follow the steps below:     1) the wide end "w" should extend about 12 inches below the narrow end "n". cross the wide end "w" over the narrow end "n".    2) bring the wide end "w" up through the loop between the collar and your tie; then back down.    3) pull the wide end "w" underneath the narrow end "n" and to the right, back through the loop and to the right again so that the wide end "w" is inside out.    4) bring the wide end "w" across the front from right to left.    5) pull the wide end "w" up through the loop again.    6) bring the wide end "w" down through the knot in front.    7) using both hands, tighten the knot carefully and draw it up to the collar.   congratulations, you did it! you see, it is not rocket science after all. simply keep practicing the windsor knot a few more times until you can tie this necktie knot within less than 30 seconds.how-to-tie-a-tie
