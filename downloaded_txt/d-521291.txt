ask an apologist – what makes the bible trustworthy?



 







multi-event, city-wide apologetics conference in tampa bay (2/28-3/7)!

christianity is under attack. every day, people hear not just that christianity is false; they hear that it is immoral, oppressive, misogynistic, and something that must be abandoned. and people are abandoning the church and faith. study after study shows this to be the case. but you probably don’t need a study. you have the face of someone in mind right now. 

people need to know that christianity is true and satisfying. and that is what our team of apologists do best. they show why the satisfaction of our deepest longings for truth, goodness, and beauty are found in jesus christ. we demonstrate why the bible is trustworthy, why science and faith aren’t enemies, and why biblical morality is good. we present reasons to believe in the historicity of the resurrection and other proofs of god’s existence. we teach how to love our neighbor by sharing our faith with reason and respect. and we do this work to display the greatness of jesus christ. it is him we proclaim.

we are currently booking events for this year's illuminate the bay. if you are interested in hosting an event or to find out more about illuminate the bay, email us at information@apologetics.org

super bowl-winning coach tony dungy explains why others should join him in voting no on amendment 4. in this video, he cites four key reasons: it would allow late-term abortions even when the unborn child can feel pain, strip parental consent for minors seeking abortions, permit non-doctors to perform abortions and determine fetal viability, and potentially pave the way for taxpayer-funded abortions. watch now to hear tony dungy’s heartfelt appeal and learn more about why he opposes amendment 4.
