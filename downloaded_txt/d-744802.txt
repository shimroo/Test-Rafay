wiggles atmosphere for party



to help with the wiggles atmosphere you should spread out toy 
instruments around the house and cut out musical notes and clef shapes 
from black construction paper. after that all these things should be 
arranged randomly on the ceiling and walls. you can hang some old 
(probably blank) cds from the ceiling to finish decorating the area. the perfect colors for your wiggles party decorations
 are red, yellow, blue and purple.

they are perfect for the paper 
streamers and balloons. wiggles music playing in the background will 
also be a significant feature of your party. for decorations,
 you can download and print photos and pictures of wiggles.

after it’s 
done you can enlarge and laminate them and tape them on the surfaces of 
the area you’re planning to have a party in. it’s also a great idea to 
create a variety of decorations by using theimages of wiggles friends: 
captain feathersword, dorothy the dinosaur, henry the octopus, wags the 
dog.

you can hang a bunch of colorful balloons not far away from the 
entrance into the party area so your guests will know where the party is
 happening. a banner saying “welcome to (your child’s name) wiggles 
birthday party!” is also a good idea.

design with legos party



one of the main activities at a lego themed party are building  contests and races. you should give each child  present a brown paper  sack which will be filled with the same amount of legos and create cards  ahead of time which have different things they could design with legos.  to start a game you should set a timer, pull a card, and then shout  “build.” obviously the winner is the one who builds it first.

since it’s a kids’ party, you should just make sure that the decorations are fun and bright, and your guests will love it. if you decide to go by the less time-consuming route, you should buy  some of the party packs that will enable the kids at the party to create  and build with legos.labels: decorations, design, kids, legos party, supplies

hazardous indoor plants



you have to be careful in dealing with cacti. in some species (prickly pear) spines can easily go under the skin, and pull them pretty hard. this can lead to skin irritation and even the formation of abscesses. among the indoor plants there are a few of these, which must be handled carefully. for example, oleander, which is quite poisonous juice. you   must try not to touch the leaves or flowers, and if it has to do,  after  you finish your work, you should thoroughly wash hands with soap  and  water. 

especially should be protected from hazardous juice eyes. people   with very sensitive skin at the slightest contact with the leaves of   primroses room there is severe irritation, even inflammation of the   skin. many people believe that to keep the plants in the room is harmful  and dangerous to  health, because their leaves are supposedly emit a  lot of carbon  dioxide. 

 all green plants do emit carbon dioxide during respiration, but only in the dark. but no harm to human health, it does not work - so little of it. however, if the room is growing several large plants in tubs, it can increase humidity. but it is harmful only if the room is generally pretty crude. if the air is dry, a moisturizing it will only be helpful.
