[…] if you have a desire to whale watch, there is no better group to give you the experience to remember!”reuvy - trip advisor  “we had near-perfect weather conditions on our journey out to through the georgia strait, and once we were approaching a calm bay area, […] our excellent guide told us our captain […] was charting the route of five orcas. the next hour we experienced some of the most incredible moments of our lives as we watched the orcas breach the water time and time again.”hammy scotlan - trip advisor  “[our guide and captain] were wonderful and made sure everyone was comfortable, safe, and they also spoke about the importance of conservation and respecting wildlife, which i loved. tourism and people, in general, can be very harmful to local wildlife so i was very happy that wild whales vancouver is doing their best to make a positive impact.”justice_1992 - trip advisor   “best (whale watching) company in vancouver (and the whole world), for sure!!
