nancy harmon ministries






























well done, faithful servant!














although our hearts are heavy today, we know this great general now stands in the presence of her "papa god" as she so lovingly called the master. in the words of our bishop tim hill of the church of god, nancy made a kingdom difference! lives were changed because she cared, because she went the distance, because she spent countless hours and tears in prayers. she didn't stand afar off, but she went to where the hurting and the broken were. she reached out her hands of compassion and loved them just as the master did. what an honor to serve by her side, and to be present in her home when the lord said "it's time, my daughter." i will miss her all of my days, but i know where i'll find her when it's my time to go...she'll be at the feet of the one she loved more than life itself.​go rest awhile, my precious "naomi." i'll be one step behind.arrangement are located on facebook: nancy harmon ministries and nancy harmon.
