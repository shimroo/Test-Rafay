wishing you a blessed washington’s birthday

fraudsters are currently impersonating pointbank and mastercard personnel by claiming they are the fraud department. pointbank and mastercard will never ask for your fraud case number, online banking user id, password or verification code. if you receive such a call (even if it displays a pointbank or mastercard number), stop, hang up and call us immediately. should you have given out your card information, call our local customer care department to prevent fraudulent charges.
