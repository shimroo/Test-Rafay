other
        ships 
 
this part is dedicated to earthforce
                ships that, even if not isuued to e.f.n.i. naval
                service, are particularly interesting from the
                technical or historical point of view

 






warlock destroyers
the warlock is
        unanimously considered the most relevant element of the
        earthforce space power. this page not only presents the
        actual warlocks, but the whole evolution of the earth
        alliance destroyers from the inception of the omega, just
        after the end of the minbari war, through the various
        stages of evolution of the warlock.



e.a.s. titans
the e.a.s. titans is a warlock class
        advanced destroyer (1st batch) that, under the command of
        cdr. susan ivanova (navy) has been merged with vorlon
        tech, specifically the leftover components of kosh 2.0's
        destroyed transport, recovered from the babylon 5
        diplomatic station. the development of this ship and her
        evolution was supervisioned by mr. galen, tecnomage.


e.a.s.centurion
the e.a.s
        centurion is a new, powerful drednought, that will become
        a mainstay of the future task forces of the earth
        alliance navy. the e.f.n.i., with his technical section,
        gave his contribution to the development of this new
        class of ships.


e.a.s.vigilante
this fast, well
        armed unit design is the outcome of a request, made by
        the earthforce, for an unit capable to carry on the
        duties of escort and anti-piracy patrol and pursuit.


nova ii
the nova ii is a
        new line dreadnought, assigned to missions in defensive
        and offensive situations; this class will flank the
        warlocks in the most demanding and specialized anti ship
        engagements.


the brightwarrior project - part i
this page
        illustrates the outcomes of the brightwarrior program,
        carried on by earthforce, with the technical and
        informative support of the e.f.n.i. , one of the main
        supporters of this important activity, aimed to upgrade
        the combat capability of the standard units of the fleet
        in terms of weapons, protection, sensors.



the brightwarrior project - part ii

this page
        illustrates the activities of the brightwarrior program
        on the newest classes of earthforce warships: nike,
        centurion, gladium, nova ii.



 
 


 
fighters
        and light crafts





aurora starfury
the sa-26 aurora
        starfury is the most classic earth alliance fighter.
        actaully flanked and partially replaced by the new sa-32
        thunderbolt starfury and sa-34 firebolt starfury, it is
        still today the most widely used ea fighter, and with
        good reasons.
        powerful, nimble, well armed, maintained up to date
        during its long service, has shown excellent performances
        during the drakh war, it is still today more than a match
        for every known fighter, and an excellent, flexible and
        affordable weapon. 


thunderbolt starfury
the sa-32 thunderbolt starfury is the edge
        of the earth alliance fighter corps. this two places
        strike fighter, both atmospheric and space capable, is
        the most representative human dighter design.
        fast, heavily armed, sturdy and well equipped, it was
        instrumental for the victory in the drakh war: it is one
        of the most polyvalent fighters known: born keeping in
        mind the transatmospheric strike and the anti-ship
        assault roles, it has shown to be a superb space
        superiority fighter, with performancess barely matched,
        and just in a few specific fields, only by the best
        designs of the most advanced races, and it is actually
        considered one of the two or three "top
        fighters" even by many aliens observers.

the minbari sharlin warcruiser
this page presents
        in an organic form the minbari sharlin warcruiser.
        maybe the most powerful warship of the younger races,
        surely a term of paragon for every other ship, the
        sharlin, and its updated and enlarget variant, the
        shargoti, are the fundament of the minbari military
        power.
        in the page is included an interesting "first
        hand" essay about the sharlin, kindly provided by
        shay'alyt lennan neriss, former commander and actual
        "fleet leader" (commodore), that has a vast
        experience on both the sharlin and the shargoti
        warcruisers.


the minbari neshatan heavy assault ship
this page we are
        galad to present to the public is an historical and
        technical article by ph.d. lt.cdr.(n.i.) j.s. felts - of
        the efni historical department of the investigation
        office. it includes a complete overview of the neshatan
        project, one of the most innovative (even if unlucky)
        designs of the minbari technology.
        the article is conceived as an overall analysis and
        contains many background informations that allow to
        understand better the relationships between the minbari
        castes, and the relationships inside the same castes, and
        what kind of impact those have in the evolution of the
        minbari applied technology.


primus battlecruiser
the primus battlecruiser was, and is still
        today, more than 200 years after its inception in
        service, a symbol of the centauri military power, and has
        influenced whole generations of ships.
        in this page is presented a technical description of the
        primus, and a short history of it, from its debout in the
        orieni war until today. 


the centauri "firebird" program
the centauri
        republic, after the liberation from the influence of the
        drakhs, rejoined the isa, and was the first alien power
        to understand the gravity of the menaceof the thirdspace
        aliens. the centauri governement launched the
        "firebird" project, in a way similar to the
        e.a. "brightwarrior" project. in this pages we

        essays - commentaries





e.f.n.i. essential chronology
in this page is presented a synoptic table
        of the most relevant events of the earth alliance from
        his foundation to our days.
        the chronolgy is intended to present the most relevants
        events of e.f.n.i. history, and evidences the part that
        our service has had in the history of the alliance.


earth force navy and e.f.n.i. -
        structures, organizations, missions. 
in
        this page, the efni historical office presents a the
        actual structure of the earthforce navy, at the date of
        01/01/2281, in terms of organization, ships and equipment
        available. 

        the second part of this article gives an outlook of the
        efni organization, and includes the efni naval almanac. 


military intelligence in the
        shadow war
e.f.n.i.
        presents to the public an historical essay of the
        cincefni, r.admiral daryl cellini, that offers an
        original interpretation of the events of the shadow war,
        analyzed from the perspective of the military
        intelligence.


dilgar war:the earth alliance involvement
in
        this page, the efni historical office presents a short
        synopsis of the events of the dilgar war. this document
        is based upon documentation recently cleared for
        diffusion, and so can present under a new light some
        aspects of the conflict that, until now, have been almost
        ignored or erroneously presented by the press and the
        official history, or were unknown at all. even the
        participation and the activities of the efni are
        presented.


the minbari war: an intelligence
        history essay
the
        efni historical office presents with this essay an
        analysis of the political and intelligence facts before,
        during and after the earth minbari war. the tactical and
        strategic intelligence activity of the efni during the
        war is not included, because, while historically
        interesting, it lays outside the aims of this article. 

        the earth-minbari war had a preparation, a beginning, a
        development, an end and an aftermath. while the events of
        the war are well known, some other events, that were at
        the origin of the conflict, and that conditioned and
        influenced its evolution and its consequences, have not
        been presented until now.
        some of these informations, as will be seen, have deep
        implications in terms of history and policy, and allow a
        better comprehension of the great picture of the minbari
        war, of the reasons that led to this event, and of its
        consequences in the following years.

maximum battleships
e.f.n.i.
        is glad to present this historical essay, written and
        kindly offered by grand inquisitor dask, that provides a
        comprehensive analysys and an history of the various
        generations of the "tillman" heavy (maximum)
        battleships, whose actual series (tillman delta), e.a.s.
        tillman, e.a.s. texas, e.a.s. roma, e.a.s. new york, are
        enlisted in the earthforce, and are among their most
        effective combat units.


hyperion-n e.f.n.i. variant
this
        page illustrates the hyperion variant employed by the
        e.f.n.i. actually substituted by the "lupo-n"
        frigates, this ship was the backbone of the e.f.n.i.
        naval service in the period from 2248 (reconstruction
        after the earth-minbari war) to 2273. it is known to the
        public because this is the fastest variant of the
        hyperion, but it has been much more than the "racing
        hyperion". 


nova-n
        e.f.n.i. variant
this
        page presents the nova-n strike dreadnoughts, the
        customized variant of the nova used by the efni since the
        late 2240's and that, even if employed in small numbers,
        gave an extremely important contribution to the activites
        of the service. this class of ships is still employed by
        the e.f.n.i. - 
        the page includes an historical essay to present an
        overview of the origins and of the history of the nova
        class dreadnoughts. 


tiger starfury
the mitchell-hyundyne sa-18 tiger starfury
        was the first of a new evolutionary line of space
        fighters, conceptual ancestor of the nova and aurora
        starfuries.
        this light interceptor was one of the protagonists of the
        dilgar war: compact, nimble and heavily armed, was a real
        match for the dilgar's thorun fighters, and gave a
        significant contribution to the victory.


sabre class frigate
the sabre class frigate, yet defined "a
        great lost occasion" for earthforce, was designed
        after the dilgar war, and exploited the conceptual
        lessons and the technologies acquired during that
        conflict. while she did not enetered in service as
        envisioned by the admiralty (that wanted to replace with
        the sabre almost all the older escort ships and a
        significant part of the hyperion fleet), she is indeed an
        interesting unit and a very fine design, and a good
        example of the true capabilities of the earth alliance
        technology in the 2230's.


nova evolution advanced dreadnought
the nova evolution advanced dreadnought,
        while not introduced in service, is a good example of
        evolutive design; she belongs to the same generation of
        the sabre frigates, and introduced concepts that could
        have significantly reshaped the earthforce navy of the
        2230's.
        this proposed class of ships is the matching of the
        strengths of the nova class dreadnoughts with the new
        technologies acquired in the dilgar war, and represented
        a significant improvement in respect to the original
        design. one of the most interesting points of this design
        is that it was thought not only as a new production unit,
        but essentially as a conversion even for the older
        batches of ships, and introduced new concepts, both
        technologycal and industrial, that were materialised,
        more than ten years later, by the omega destroyers.


shadow omega advanced destroyer
this historical essay presents a short
        history and a technical summary of one of the most
        infamous, even if barely known, ships fielded by the
        earth alliance.
        while the number produced was small and their operational
        career was extremely short (the whole class did not
        survive its first confrontation with their oppponents),
        the "shadomegas" have become, along the years,
        one of the most rumored and discussed products of the
        earth alliance, and both the protagonists and the sources
        of an enormous quantity of metropolitan legends.
        the purpose of this article, beyond the historical and
        the technical presentation, is even to provide some solid
        informations to the public, in order to allow to separate
        the truth from the myth.

sci-fi 3d models a site run by andrey kurin, and allows access and
                download of his excellent 3d models of various
                science fiction vehicles and ships, with a plenty
                of babylon 5 stuff, either canon, official or
                fanfictional.among them, there are the very
                well done models of a series of efni designs:
                nova 2, centurion and tillman dreadnoughts,
                gladium assault vector, nike battle cruiser, lupo
                frigate and vigilante cutter. 
in the hope of
                making something liked by both the author of the
                models and by the readers of efni, i have tried
                to organize a page with links to the 3d
                models main page and to the single rederings of
                the various efni ships. the download of the models is
                possible following the links in the sci-fi 3d models main page - and i suggest to have a
                look to all the models and the renderings,
                babylon 5, star wars and whatever else, because
                they are among the best stuff that can be found
                on the net. enjoy.











a
                beautiful site with a lot of graphics, hundreds
                of designs, either canon and non canon, related
                to babylon 5 and other sci-fi series and movies,
                filled with fanfiction drawings. the owner of
                this site, david briedis, is so kind to maintain
                and run the largest b-5 drawings and fanfiction
                art site that i know; some of my drawings too, between the
                many others, are hosted by him - thanks!

                was a concept of grand inquisitor dask, and was
