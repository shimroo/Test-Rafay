ny state lotterya personal interview with the honest lotto system's creator, ken silver.q: hi ken, thanks for joining us in this interview. before we talk about your lotto system, tell us a little about your background.ken: it really all started with the lotto system. i first developed the honest lotto system in the early 90's, and it sold really well through direct mail. after a couple of years success with it i wrote a "how-to" manual about my experience and how others could do it--which also sold well. in fact you can still buy it today. then i went on to sell it over the internet in the mid-90's and sales increased massively. i wrote another, "ebook secrets" about writing how-to ebooks, and together my manuals have sold around 800,000 copies from myself and other marketers who bought the limited number of rights.q: tell us how you developed your special lottery system.ken: well, for several years in the early 90's i had been looking for ways to turn the lottery to my advantage, and i studied a lot of material. it was an interesting period. you wouldn't believe the weird, off the wall theories out there. i even read one book that claimed several thousand people could 'will' the numbers they wanted through mass esp (extra sensory perception).q: strange solutions indeed. how did you figure out your own lotto system then?ken: through a lot of hard thought and lateral thinking. it helped that my late father was a brilliant optical engineer, and some of his analytical mathematical abilities might have rubbed off me! when i found the "eureka" solution that seemed to work, i spent a further couple of years researching and checking it. although at that time i had computers that might have sped the whole research process up, the honest lotto system doesn't actually work on patterned or computed lotto numbers. so it had to be done by hand. took a while.q: why is your so lotto system different that you couldn't use a computer?ken: i found that despite the blinding speed and computational abilities of modern systems even back then, no-one had actually come up with a way to predict a win from past draws. this was the breakthrough for me. it simply told me this: that no-one can actually predict winning numbers through analysing and extrapolating past results. and when i realized this, it made my own win lotto system solution much more valuable as a result. so, although it took a while to figure out, suddenly i had found the 'missing link' to winning lotto.q: if you say that no-one can predict a win, how does your lotto system work then?ken: the lotto system works mainly by eliminating the millions of number combinations that won’t win. for example, you'll never see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a winning draw... that is pretty unlikely. and there are countless other losing combinations too. my honest lotto system identifies these bad boys, giving the winnable combinations preference. easy--once you know how!q. how is the honest lotto system different from other lotto systems out there, like lotto wheeling?ken: wheeling just gives a variety of lottery number combinations. it doesn't make any distinction between good and bad lottery number combinations, so most times you are wasting your money on the many poor number selections in there. with the honest lotto system, every line has the best lottery number combination you can find, which hugely increases the chances of winning. that makes it different from almost every other system i've studied. (and if you find a system that works like the honest lotto system, you can bet your bottom dollar that is was adapted from mine!)q: ok, that sounds good. but has anyone won with your lottery system?ken: yes indeed, many people. an australian couple who won over au$280,000.00 using it. many people have covered their costs, and as well won smaller amounts up to $50,000.00. one of the main advantages with my system is that you can be winning moderate amounts while you are waiting for the big win to come along--as it eventually will.q: is waiting part of your lotto system? why can't we get the main prize straight off?ken: what many folks don’t realize is that when a lotto system like mine can't predict a winning lotto game (and this is why i call it "honest lotto" because to my knowledge i'm the only lotto system that admits that fact), the next best thing is to 'wait in line' for your winning turn. so what you're doing here is still winning while you're waiting for the big one. the honest lotto system puts you in the line, right up near the top of the queue. when the right combination of winning lotto figures strikes - you will have the correct number combination to win it. the best thing about my system is that you don’t have to wait several thousand years - as one academic predicted for other systems. it could be just a small number of games before the right combination is hit.ny state lotteryq: so we might have to be patient? that's hard to do!ken: many people don’t have the patience to keep going, and going, even when the draws go against them, but the real winners will persist. there's a story i read in a book about the first british camelot lottery. two partners in a double glazing window business took out over a thousand pounds a week (that's about us$1400) to play the game. they were almost broke at the 3 month mark, but - luckily for them then - they won several million pounds! this is an extreme example of how persistence pays off. imagine how much quicker they could have won using my honest lotto system!q: i was going to bring that up, ken. is there another way we can win lotto quicker with your system?ken: sure. just increase the number of tickets you play. for example, when i play in my country, i buy 120 lines. but my chance of winning is very much less - not very good at all in fact - if i were only able to take out 2 lines a game.q: are you saying you've got to spend a fortune each week then?ken: definitely not. every single line using the honest lotto system gives you a better chance than any other system i know. but the more lines you have in each game, the higher your chances become. so if you can't afford many lines each week, you should maybe wait a month and play then what you were going to spend each week. but i emphasis to everybody playing any lotto game at all--make sure it is money you can afford to lose. because it might take weeks before you make it back or get a major win.q: from your website and what you're saying here, you sure don’t sound like someone trying to sell your system. you've covered the downside of playing too.ken: sure. most other systems out there are highly optimistic about you winning, but they're mainly based on guesswork and wrongly-calculated maths. i believe mine is the first honest representation of what you can and can't do with a system.q: thanks for your time here. is there a last word you want to say?ken: yes, i'd like to say to all future honest lotto system owners this... take a good look at my system. don’t spend your last cent on playing. and above all, keep going - - even when your wins are small or take a while to come through. you will eventually triumph!ny state lottery
