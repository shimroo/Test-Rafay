this book is based on work spread over forty-five years with young disabled people in bromley, greater manchester, norfolk, and west london. it is written to critically explore ideas and practices in work with young disabled people.
the intended readership is young disabled people themselves and all those working with young disabled people in whatever settings this takes place, including disabled people working in disabled peopleâ€™s organisations (dpos). it is also aimed at non-disabled practitioners, professionals and volunteers working in a wide variety of situations; in education, in voluntary and statutory sector youth and community organisations; practitioners in allied health, mental health, leisure, recreation, cultural and arts settings. it is designed to introduce students and academics/lecturers who are involved in disability studies or subjects that include disability and to inform practitioners who wish to learn a specialism, or staff in allied sectors who want to understand more about disability and how youth social action work approaches and coproduction can support their work in this field.
