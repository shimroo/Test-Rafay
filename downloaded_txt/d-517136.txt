decade news:

compatible receivers | radio license




bypass containment !

with our fm transmitters, it is possible to listen to the mass on your car radio, in the church parking lot.

also, people who don't have a vaccination passport can attend masses or other events that they wouldn't normally be allowed to. 

slight price increase

there will be a slight price increase, effective on february 1st 2022.  decade never increased any price since 1991, but with the large price increase for electronic components, wires, connectors, sheet metal, pc-boards, cardboard, solder, etc. in the last two years, we have no choice but to do the same.

the 2022 dealer price list is available.  please contact us at info@decadetransmitters.com
  



say no to planned obsolescence !
decade is against planned obsolescence, and offers products with a life expectancy far superior than that of all consummer electronic products available today.

beware of content of this website:  sourcefmtransmitter.com
this website displays false statements regarding the fcc certification / legality of many fm transmitters including our ms-100.  please be assured that our ms series of high quality fm transmitters are fcc part 15 certified and perfectly legal to use in the usa.  furthermore, sourcefmtransmitter.com also advises potential customers not to buy many models of transmitters (including our ms series), under those false statements.  instead, it emphasizes one or two products, including their own brand which, ironically, is not recommended by many fm transmitters forums.

we sincerely believe that our ms series of transmitters are the best fcc part 15 fm transmitters in the market, and no other product even comes close in terms of rf performances, sound quality, reliability and longevity.  yes, they cost more, but they are well worth it.
