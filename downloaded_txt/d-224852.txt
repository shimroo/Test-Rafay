site history
we've been online since 29th july, 1997, firstly on the penrith city library website, then on our
                  own dedicated site where we remain. we've all grown older,
                  poorer and wiser. the last two 
decades
                  have seen an exponential change in the field of collecting,
                  archiving and the book trade. it's a well-repeated phrase, but
                  the internet has created a level playing field for both
                  collectors and those looking for information. prices for once
                  scarce books have fallen dramatically. values for first
                  editions have risen but this aspect of collecting has lost
                  impetus recently among all but public institutions and the
                  extremely well-heeled. there's never been a better time for
                  people to take up book collecting! information on almost any
                  author, character, series, publisher and subject is at your
                  fingertips. no longer do you need to join a club or buy
                  expensive guides to collecting. sadly, this has led to the
                  demise of the once so common and welcoming second-hand
                  bookshop. no longer can one wander through isles of dusty
                  books or chat to long-time purveyors of books and magazines.
                  magazines indeed have mostly lost their collectability while
                  collecting clubs devoted to authors, those where collectors
                  actually met, talked and swapped books face to face, have
                  mostly faded from the scene. on the plus side, more vintage content is finding its way online, much as once rare
                  movies, documentaries and early silent movies are becoming
                  available to everyone. that in itself can't be a bad
                  thing. #

how to survive a heart 
	attack when alone
since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, without 
	help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel 
	faint, has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. however, 
	these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very 
	vigorously. a deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough 
	must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the 
	chest. a breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without 
	let-up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally 
	again. deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze 
	the heart and keep the blood circulating. the squeezing pressure on the 
	heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. in this way, heart attack victims 
	can get to a hospital. tell as many people as possible about this. it could 
	save their lives!
	(australian seniors magazine)
