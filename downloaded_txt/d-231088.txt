in search of the miraculous alexander irvingjanuary 29 - february 22, 2025opening reception: february 1, 2025, 2 - 5 pmin search of the miraculous is a text-based exhibition of prints, drawings, and video. through his reading, irving gathers phrases that resonate with him and that, while at first seem disparate, come together to form unexpected narratives.  whether evoking personal reflections or taking on new relevance in relation to current events, the words regenerate imbuing the resulting compositions with new meaning for irving and his viewers.“i write through the gesture of drawing with respect for shadow as well as light. every gesture imagines the next, every gesture becomes a word without commentary or interpretation.”-alexander irving. 























alexander irving has worked in a variety of media, always returning to drawing as a place of inquiry and wonder. graduating from the nova scotia college of art and design in 1987, he has since exhibited his artwork nationally, and internationally. his recent work is text-based in pencil, paint, and print. the work is full of beginnings, repetitions, and bifurcations that never lead to unity, an end, or an exit. i am interested in a text that negotiates the diversity of its possible continuance and becomes, as it were, infinite. my medium is repetition.view irving’s past work here
