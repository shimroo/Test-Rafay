walking in
spain 
these pages cover
walking
in spain and its islands, including climbing teide,
the
highest
mountain
on
spanish
territory. las
bardenas is
an unusual destination, rather unknown in the uk but especially
deserving
of attention from those with an interest in mountain photography.

spanish food

many peoples only
experience
of spanish food is that often served up to
package
holiday tourists in big hotels catering to northern european tastes.
the
true food of spain is varied, healthy and tasty and brings an added
dimension
to any trip. basque cooking, in particular,
is
equal to any in europe.
