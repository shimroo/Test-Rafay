farewell happy dog
the world's happiest dog is gone... the vet was pretty close with the 8 week guess... the cancer had spread... just found a tumor again on his lip last week... the final blow was a large mass in his bladder... it kept him from being able to pee, and that forced the decision to have him put down...
this is a first for me... never had to go through anything like this before, for which i'm thankful... there is such a terrible feeling of helplessness to the whole thing... i know its the right decision... i couldn't stand to let him suffer... but coming to terms with killing something you love isn't something natural...  he wasn't even my dog... the decision wasn't mine to make, and so i am spared that little bit of hell...  
and so, i say farewell to my friend of just over 4 years... his spirit is free now... he can roam where he pleases... he'll always be in my heart though...  rest in peace buddy...
