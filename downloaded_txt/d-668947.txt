“my custom harlick boots are my go-to skates for all things skating, from live performances, tv/film projects to teaching skate lessons. they keep me feeling confident and supported no matter how hard i skate on them or in what conditions, i can feel the quality under my feet.”
— candice heiden (@candai), professional roller skater and choreographer


























“we have been wearing harlick boots for years. our custom boots are tailored to our needs which lets us be our best on the ice. we can always rely on them for support and we feel confident our boots will last. without harlick’s knowledge and expertise, we wouldn’t be the athletes we are today. we’ve tried other boots in the past and we can confidently say that harlick boots are the most reliable, comfortable and supportive boots out there!”
— christina carreira (@christinacarreira) & anthony ponomarenko (@pom_pom9), two-time world junior ice dance medalists
