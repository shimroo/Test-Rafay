transforming science with large
  language models: a survey on ai-assisted scientific discovery,
  experimentation, content generation, and evaluation.
arxiv
  e-prints, 2502.05151, february 2025.
doi: 10.48550/arxiv.2502.05151.
with the advent of large multimodal
  language models, science is now at a threshold of an ai-based technological
  transformation. recently, a plethora of new ai models and tools has been
  proposed, promising to empower researchers and academics worldwide to conduct
  their research more effectively and efficiently. this includes all aspects of
  the research cycle, especially (1) searching for relevant literature; (2)
  generating research ideas and conducting experimentation; generating (3)
  text-based and (4) multimodal content (e.g., scientific figures and
  diagrams); and (5) ai-based automatic peer review. in this survey, we provide
  an in-depth overview over these exciting recent developments, which promise
  to fundamentally alter the scientific research process for good. our survey
  covers the five aspects outlined above, indicating relevant datasets, methods
  and results (including evaluation) as well as limitations and scope for
  future research. ethical concerns regarding shortcomings of these tools and
  potential for misuse (fake science, plagiarism, harms to research integrity)
  take a particularly prominent place in our discussion. we hope that our
  survey will not only become a reference guide for newcomers to the field but
  also a catalyst for new ai-based initiatives in the area of
  “ai4science”.

clara swaboda and tristan miller.
on
  the use of scale distortion for visual humour: a preliminary
  analysis.
european journal of humour
  research, 12(2):206–211, june 2024.
issn 2307-700x.
doi: 10.7592/ejhr.2024.12.2.904.
in contrast to verbal humour, visual humour remains a
  relatively underdeveloped area of research. in this exploratory study, we
  investigate whether scale incongruity – i.e., discrepancy between the
  expected and actual experience of the size of an object – can serve as
  a source of humour in the visual modality. we adapt a pre-existing visual
  data set of mundane scenes by altering the size of an individual object in
  each scene and collecting humorousness ratings from human annotators on the
  original and scale-distorted versions. our analysis of these annotations
  reveals that scenes with distorted objects are perceived to be significantly
  funnier than the original images.

preparing
  horizon europe proposals in latex with heria.
tugboat:
  the communications of the tex users
  group, 45(1):59–64, april 2024.
issn 0896-3207.
doi: 10.47397/tb/45-1/tb139miller-horizon.
this article introduces heria, a latex class to format funding
  proposals for the european commission's horizon europe program. it provides a
  basic summary of the class's use; compares it to existing packages for
  funding proposals; discusses its motivations, design decisions, and
  limitations; and reports on its real-world use and plans for future
  development. besides providing prospective horizon europe applicants with an
  overview of the class, this article may give prospective developers and users
  of classes for other proposal types some idea of the work involved and the
  potential pitfalls.

miscellany
my interests in language, math, and computers were sparked and
strengthened by exposure to the works of
willard r. espy,
louis phillips,
mike keith,
dmitri borgmann,
jim butterfield, and others.  these writers share a great talent for making technical or linguistic topics fun and accessible to a general audience.  you can check out my own contributions to popular and recreational mathematics and linguistics, plus a few other odds and ends.
i also maintain an index of miscellaneous documents and websites i've produced which don't really fit into any other section.
