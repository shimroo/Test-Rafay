we regret to share with you that marcel's will be closing on may
12th. since its opening in march 1999, marcel's has been a
cornerstone of washington, dc's fine dining community for 25
extraordinary years.


despite our best efforts, marcel's was unable to reach lease terms
with the new building owner and will not be renewing its
lease.


marcel's is the flagship of the rw restaurant group, which has
opened over 10 brands with three locations still open in maryland
and virginia and soon to be four when mussel bar & grille in
bethesda opens next month.


we owe a debt of gratitude to our dedicated staff, past and
present, whose talent and hard work have contributed to marcel's
success over the years. their unwavering commitment has been the
driving force behind marcel's dedication to its cuisine and
service.


to our guests, we extend our heartfelt thanks for your loyal
patronage and support. your continued presence has enriched
marcel's journey and made every dining experience truly
special.


as marcel's prepares to come to an end, we invite you to join us in
celebrating the memories and milestones that have defined our
establishment. while marcel's may be closing its doors, the spirit
of culinary innovation and hospitality will live on. thank you for
being a part of marcel's story and for your unwavering support
throughout the years.
