we would like to acknowledge that we live and work on unceded indigenous land - the traditional territory of coast salish peoples who have stewarded this land for generations and continue to live here. acknowledging native lands shows recognition of and respect for indigenous people and ways of life and begins to shine a light on histories untold. these histories often tell of the theft and colonization of native resources, carried out by broken promises such as the treaty of point elliott. to learn more about the native land you live on, visit native-land.ca. if you’re ready to further your contribution, you can visit realrentduwamish.org. these can be our first steps in considering our place in the story of colonization and helping us find our role in the undoing of its legacy.
