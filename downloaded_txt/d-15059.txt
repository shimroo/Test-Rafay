deserializing json to a string or a value

i love using refit to call web apis in a nice type-safe manner. sometimes though, apis don’t want to cooperate with your strongly-typed hopes. for example, you might run into an api written by a hipster in a beanie, aka a dynamic-type enthusiast. i don’t say that pejoratively. some of my closest friends write python and ruby.

career

the career ladder is a comforting fiction we’re sold as we embark on our careers: start as junior, climb to senior, then principal, director, and vp. one day, you defeat the final boss and receive a key to the executive bathroom and and join the c-suite. you’ve made it!

ever look for a recipe online only to scroll through a self-important rambling 10-page essay about a trip to tuscany that inspired the author to create the recipe? finally, after wearing out your mouse, trackpad, or page down key to scroll to the end, you get to the actual recipe. i hate those.

c# 11 introduced a new feature - static virtual members in interfaces. the primary motivation for this feature is to support generic math algorithms. the mention of math might make some ignore this feature, but it turns out it can be useful in other scenarios.

when you fail, many people will tell you how failure is a great teacher. and they’re not wrong. but you know what else is a great teacher? success! and success is a lot less expensive than failure.

calling internal ctors in your unit tests

one of my pet peeves is when i’m using a .net client library that uses internal constructors for its return type. for example, let’s take a look at the azure.ai.openai nuget package. now, i don’t mean to single out this package, as this is a common practice. it just happens to be the one i’m using at the moment. it’s an otherwise lovely package. i’m sure the authors are lovely people.

how to recover from a dbupdateexception with ef core

there are cases where recovery from an entity framework core (ef core) dbupdateexception is possible if you play your cards right. play them wrong and the result is heartbreak and tears as every call to savechangesasync rethrows the same exception.

pitfalls with eager loading of collections in ef core


    
    sep 30, 2022
  

aspnetcore
efcore


suggest edit






when using an orm with a web app, lazy loading will almost certainly result in hidden n+1 queries. eager loading is a great way to avoid this, but has its own pitfalls. in particular, for each query, you need to be careful about what you include in the query. if you include too much, you can end up with a lot of data that you don’t need. if you include too little, you can end up with confusing logic. for example, deep in your application code, it may not be clear if a navigation collection has been loaded yet or not. this can lead to unexpected behavior.

async disposables the easy way

suggest edit





in the system.reactive.disposables namespace (part of reactive extensions), there’s a small and useful disposable class. it has a create method that takes in an action and returns an idisposable instance. when that instance is disposed, the action is called. it’s a nice way of creating an ad-hoc idisposable. i use them often for creating a scope in code where something should happen at the end of the scope. here’s an exceedingly trivial example:
