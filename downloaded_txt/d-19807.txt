 what others are saying about cadd primer


mr. 
              david byrnes: cad systems magazine (june 2000)"cadd 
              primer is a fine introduction to the field of computer-aided drafting 
              and design. its discipline- independent, 
              platform-independent and program-independent coverage has something 
              for everyone, from the prospective pro/e modeller on her unix workstation 
              to the prospective formz designer on his macintosh. and if youre 
              no longer a "prospective" cadd user yourself, you probably 
              know someone whos starting out in the field. do themand maybe 
              yourselfa favor, and give them a copy of cadd primer." read 
              complete review
mr. 
              tony zilles: editor cadinfo.net magazine (oct. 2000):the 
              cadd primer is an ideal book for high school or college-level study 
              of cadsystems. it is also suitable for those considering cad for 
              work or hobby use but who are confused or intimidated by the technology 
              and the jargon that goes with it. the cadd primer contains all the 
              information that very quickly becomes second knowledge to those 
              who use cad systems on a regular basis. most "old hands" 
              learned the information the cadd primer contains over many years. 
              for the new recruit, the body of "must-have" basic information 
              presents a great hurdle within itself, even before learning a particular 
              cad program and the discipline that you intend to use it with. all 
              the basic information anyone could need is available, accessible 
              and affordable in the cadd primer. highly recommended.

              2001): "an 
              invaluable, user-friendly how-to manual....cadd primer is a unique 
              and highly recommended addition to any professional or architectural 
              school reference collection."

saskatchewan 
              school system, canada: "computer 
              aided design and drafting (cadd) is an essential element of drafting. 
              this resource introduces the common principles of cadd that apply 
              to all software packages, whether it is autocad, microstation or 
              cadkey. rather than being a how-to book, the resource is primarily 
              useful as a reference to key principles. information can be learned 
              about topics such as drawing dimensions, zoom in and zoom out, erasing 
              drawings, 3d modelling and plotting. each topic has several line 
              drawings and uses clear and concise writing. an index is included.

mr. 
              james wilson: cadd/gis center, us department of defense: 
this is a good manual to use as a guide 
              to teach someone with no cadd experience, the basic concepts of 
              cadd. it is best when it is used before an actual application has 
              been purchased. it meets its intended goals for its audience.

mr. 
              q. jeffrey ge, cad class, state university of new york: 
i enjoyed reading the book. the material 
              is well organized and clearly explained in layman terms.

prof.
