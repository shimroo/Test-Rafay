enjoyed the time working at qc and love the fact that they are honest and open and willing to work with you to make your days better and experience worth it. i also love my terminal and my driver manager for being a great personality and person toward me and other drivers."  elijah clarkcompany driver "i began working for qc back in jan of 1992. regrettably i had to leave qc in june of 1998 and move my family south. we decided to move back to wi in feb of 1999 and i have been here at the bristol terminal ever since. in these two different stints i have more than 22 year here and have put on more than 2.5 million miles with qc. this bristol terminal is a great terminal to work with as they have always treated me right, and i will be here until i retire."  tony fishercompany driver "i’ve been with qc for all these years because i felt they were the best company out there to work for and i’ve always been able to support his family. i see and speak with a lot of drivers while on the road and from listening to them i’m confident i’ve made the correct choice. i like pulling liquid and like the people i work with. i’m always moving, if the wheels aren't rolling the company isn’t making money."  bassett robinsowner operator "i like working for qc because for the most part i can choose my own loads, i get to be home with my family on most weekends and the fact that the company takes safety very seriously makes me feel safer while i'm on the road."  jamie ochoaowner operator “i worked for qc for nearly 7 of my 15 years as a commercial driver. while i left for a period of time a few years ago i am pleased to have found my way back under gcec. it is a process to learn everything necessary to be successful but i have found that the people i work with and the established processes makes the learning curve easier. it is clear to me that the driver is a priority in their business planning and growth and that helps me continue to have confidence in my future with qc and gcec.”  patrick mccoyowner operator “time spent working at quality carriers is not only successful but also rewarding for me. the people here are great to work with."  howard sealyowner operator "at
