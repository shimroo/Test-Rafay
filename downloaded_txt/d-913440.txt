- mikayla b.  
"dolly parton’s imagination library has been in my family since 2017 when my niece, savannah johnson, was born. my sister-in-law signed up for this program, and books have steadily come in month by month ever since! my niece turned five on august 5th and a day later received her last book “look out kindergarten, here i come”. a bittersweet moment it was to realize not only was our “baby” suddenly a five-year-old, but it was the last book she would receive from dpil. these books have given her greater joy and have served as a pivotal role in her love for books. whether it’s a bedtime story, a mid-day read or a plane ride to visit her daddy stationed in california, these books are always in hand. now, a mother myself, i have signed my son up to receive these wonderful books! dpil will always hold a special place in our heart for the gifts they have given our children, as will united way for making it possible for the kids in our county. together they bring imagination to life and give the gift of learning to our local youth."








- alderman road elementary
because of united way [youth growth stock trust grant], i was able to purchase formal attire for many second graders at our school, as well as items to use in my  after school programs.  the clubs work  to promote social emotional development, self esteem and confidence growth, team bonding, academic review, and more!  we’ve enjoyed having some high school students come join a few sessions too!
