jan 15 the thinking part of systems thinking
            






jack vinson 
theory of constraints, book review
this is a booklet that describes the process of thinking through a situation, using the toc logical thinking processes, to show how systems thinking plays an important role in really developing lasting solutions to problems, whether they bedevil the homeowner as in this example, or a business. thinking is the key in any systems thinking approach!

nov 22 wiring the winning organization
            






jack vinson 
book review, business, continuous improvement
the new book from steven j. spear and gene kim takes a look at what makes for winning organizations and develops what they call a new theory of performance management - why do some organizations really seem to fly year-over-year while others do not? why is it that some organizations can really take advantage of the tricks and techniques of lean or devops or theory of constraints or agile software development or <pick your approach>, while others never seem to find their footing? wiring the winning organization attempts to answer these questions. the book takes the readers through three key areas that leaders wire up winning organizations: slowification, simplification, and amplification.

nov 15 are these the real problem?
            






jack vinson 
continuous improvement, project management
an article on cio.com about why it project still fail gets me riled up. all the reasons listed are simply solutions in reverse - solutions that get suggested over and over again in various venues. the fact that projects “still” fail might suggest that these problems aren’t the real problem, that they are symptoms of a deeper cause. it’s only once we resolve the deeper cause that the problems will lessen or go away entirely.

oct 17 the mistakes that make us
            






jack vinson 
book review, continuous improvement, knowledge management, culture
we all make mistakes - big and small. but what do we do with them? how do we react? how do the people around us react? mark graban’s latest book, the mistakes that make us: cultivating a culture of learning and innovation is an interesting combination of anecdotes from his my favorite mistake podcast along with guidance on developing the environment where making mistakes is an opportunity to learn and grow.

aug 11 deming's adventures in profound knowledge
            






jack vinson 
book review, continuous improvement
deming’s journey to profound knowledge by john willis and derek lewis is the story of how w. edwards deming’s background, education and experiences inspired him to develop his system of profound knowledge. the book is sort of a biography, but very focused on those elements that led him to be the important figure in many circles.

jul  7 there are a wide variety of ways to make decisions
            






jack vinson 
business, continuous improvement, project management
what decision mode are you in? does lack of clarity here cause you to get stuck in endless discussions and “undoing” decisions that you thought were already set? here’s a way to think about decisions from the angle of decision-making authority.

jul  6 get it done - why are you motivated?
            






jack vinson 
book review, personal effectiveness
ayelet fishbach’s get it done: surprising lessons from the science of motivation was an informative read, offering exactly what the subtitle suggests: interesting (surprising?) lessons from a variety of angles on what creates motivation (or not) for people.

feb 10 the wheel of sustainability
            






jack vinson 
book review, continuous improvement
adam lawrence’s the wheel of sustainability: engaging and empowering teams to produce lasting results is a practical primer on his concept for implementing lean-oriented projects, primarily in a manufacturing and shop-floor environment.

feb  9 spin selling - practice, practice, practice
            






jack vinson 
book review, business, continuous improvement
neil rackham’s spin selling was written back in 1988. does it still make sense? the obvious thing for me in re-reading and discussing the book with some colleagues is that the concepts apply more broadly than only sales environments. in any large change project, the change agents are always selling - working to make the change happen and make that change become an embedded way of operating.this reading’s key takeaway: practice!

feb  2 goldratt's rules of flow
            






jack vinson 
book review, continuous improvement, project management, theory of constraints
efrat goldratt-ashlag has taken on the mantle of writing a business novel in the style of her father, eli goldratt. goldratt’s rules of flow takes eli goldratt’s “four concepts of flow” into project management environments and shows how some basic rules of flow can significantly reduce the chaos and improve results.

jan 16 how minds change
            






jack vinson 
book review
my review of david mcraney’s how minds change: the surprising science of belief, opinion, and persuasion, which i picked up on recommendation from a colleague. the simplest summary of the book is that “changing minds” is much more about opening people to new thoughts and experiences than it is berating them with new procedures or facts.

jun  3 dentistry with a vision
            






jack vinson 
book review, theory of constraints
dentistry with a vision: building a rewarding practice and a balanced life by gerald i. kendall and gary s. wadhwa is a theory of constraints business novel, this time focused on dentistry practice. as with many of these books, putting the story into novel form allows the ideas to develop and a “guru” to provide guidance in a more visceral form than one might get from a textbook or workbook.

apr 27 clarifying toc's five focusing steps
            






jack vinson 
continuous improvement, theory of constraints
taking a look at will kelly’s article on do devops and the theory of constraints still relate with my perspective on the theory of constraints and the five focusing steps. i suspect there are some familiar mis-apprehensions of toc embedded in the article.  happy to discuss!

apr 19 the myth of multitasking
            






jack vinson 
book review, personal effectiveness
the myth of multitasking: how “doing it all” gets nothing done by dave crenshaw is a nice, quick read and covers some familiar ground for people who talk about multitasking and the sorry effects of high work-in-process (wip) for people and their businesses. the story is of working with a busy executive, rather than with a busy team, so it has some different takeaways than i have usually seen.

mar  1 a radical enterprise
            






jack vinson 
book review
a radical enterprise: pioneering the future of high-performing organizations by matt k. parker is a curious book. it describes a vastly different way of working in organizations that enables significantly better outcomes - an exciting scenario. at the same time some of the stories and prescriptions made me either disappointed in my own ways of working or think that there is a deep canyon between my current ways of working and this radical new enterprise.

jan 11 evaporating conflicts from another angle
            






jack vinson 
continuous improvement, theory of constraints
i heard a different way to articulate conflicts today on a podcast that might help shed some light or give some different language. rather than thinking about the actions people want to take as causing the conflict, think of them as positions. and the positions come out of interests. people get entrenched in their positions, as it often seems the only way to meet their needs. but when we articulate the situation more clearly, we can start checking underneath - how does that position satisfy that interest? (how does that action meet your need?) articulating the conflict often helps us see there maybe there are some things in common as well as understanding the assumptions we have about why our position is “right.” this new terminology adds to the options i have when thinking about these kinds of situations.

jan  6 people solve problems
            






jack vinson 
book review, continuous improvement
jamie flinchbaugh has a new book out about problem-solving, people solve problems: the power of every person, every day, every problem. the basic setup is reasonable - we all solve problems all the time, how should we think about it? i like how this isn’t a set of specific directions for problem solving, but rather what any approach to problem solving should have from the individual contributors through to the leaders.

jan  3 practice makes profit
            






jack vinson 
book review, theory of constraints
graham scott has written a nice, short book that feels like a conversation, incorporating the ideas of theory of constraints - focus and leverage: practice makes profit: the small business owner’s guide to making more money by not working harder.

sep 16 cynefin - a book of many experiences
            






jack vinson 
book review
i picked up cynefin - weaving sense-making into the fabric of our world just recently, though it came out last fall as a celebration of (at least) 21 years of the evolution of the cynefin model. while i was hoping for some more insight into how people have applied the model, i appreciated most of the stories and the connections people made to using the cynefin concepts in a wide variety of applications.
