what 
we do







we educate the public and policymakers that drug use is a matter of health, not a criminal issue. 
we want to get drugs under government control and out of the hands of organised crime. this can be achieved through legalising and responsibly regulating drug markets.
 


about us












                                            don't be a harold: 
support drug reform
                                        
                











 “don’t be a harold” is a mockumentary that puts a spotlight on the unhelpful and damaging misconceptions that allow the uk’s failing drug laws to persist.
meet harold, the leader of his local community watch, whose views on drugs are rooted in moralising and ignorance just like the uk’s drug policy.
watch and share.

our anyone's child: families for safer drug control campaign is an international network of families whose lives have been wrecked by current drug laws and are now campaigning to change them.
no one doubts that drugs can be dangerous but criminalising those who get involved causes even more harm. the families in anyone’s child have come together to campaign for the legal control and regulation of the drug market to save lives and better protect our young people.
