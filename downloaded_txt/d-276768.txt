seasons
 paradise draws the attention of rock hounds, beach walkers, maritime enthusiasts, bikers, hikers, bird watchers, snowmobilers, four-wheelers, fishers, boaters, campers, canoeists, kayakers, photographers, nature lovers, young and old alike.

winter
get to places you can't in summer! paradise is a top destination for snowmobilers, but it's also tops for quiet winter sports like cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. rent equipment from a local merchant and hit the trails!
don't miss an opportunity to see tahquamenon falls in the winter -- its unique ice sculptures are fantastic and just a short walk from your car or snowmobile.

fall color is not the only reason to visit the area. like spring, fall is a quieter time and visitors can truly enjoy the solitude of the area. whether hiking the north country scenic trail or driving the tahquamenon scenic byway you'll find yourself immersed in color!
the fall migration brings birds and birders alike again to the whitefish point bird observatory.
