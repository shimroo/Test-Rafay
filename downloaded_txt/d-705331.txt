better late then never

4 seasons. 49 games. somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 + practices and enough trips to the batting cages to buy a car, even if it is a hyundai. thats how long the gr softball team has been together. 2 years of heartbreaks, close calls, and fries being bought by unfortunate strikeout victims. games called early by the 15 run rule and games that sucked the life out of you. it's been a long run for this team.somewhere along the way we found a coach. went on a unprecedented city tourney run. welcomed back a few returning members of the "og" gr team. 4 seasons later it all came together, the right people in the right place.the trophy is ours.

another night in the valley

sure it's fricking freezing outside. at least to this native so cal boy who finds any temperature dip below 70 degrees extremely uncomfortable. of course shaq and kobe are having their final rematch of the nba regular season. i'd like to see that. yup, part 2 of the 24 season opener is on tonight and after investing 2 hours of my life watching it last night i'd really like to know whats going to happen tonight. but i have business to take care of.picking up martin it's time to head over the hill. destination. the batting cages in sherman oaks. carlos is waiting for us there. c-los is one of the unsung heros of the team. quiet, laid back, and usually smiling , carlos is one of the few who regularly attends practice and shows up week after week ready to play even though he has to share his outfield spot and only gets to play about half the game in the field. the ultimate team player. he's awesome.martin's martin. team captain. always trying to get everyone pumped up for our next epic game. it works on me. on the ride up the 405 we talk about his recent trip to mammoth, speeding tickets, and whatever happened to one of my favorite bands of all time. the untouchables. somewhere in the back of my mind i file this away as a great name for a softball team.taking turns hitting high arc softballs is better then anything else i could have done tonight. it just feels right.

what bill said

the inspiration for this? going thru the recently retired number 9's blog and reading all his old softball postings. i don't wanna see all this classic stuff buried on the internet. bill's pretty special, going out on top like barry sanders.since i'm a lazyass please note that the posts are in reverse chronological order, most recent to earliest.8-5-2005: details from our 1st tournament win ever.the giant robot softball team had won only one game during the regular season and coming in last place doesn't usually get an invite to the los angeles parks and recreation city wide tournament. it's been said that we're the worst team in gr history. but like a private art school, the city will take anyone's money and our 100 dollars made us instant longshot contenders. to this moment of me writing, i'm still not exactly sure why we entered but as joel goodson would say, "sometimes you gotta say, what the fuck".our opponent was sponsored by maloney's - a bar that is frequented by ucla frat boys, sorority girls and faux cool kids trying to impress each other. they also won their park division with a record of 10 and 2. before the game started, the umpire made us stand in a line to show id - there would be no ringers for this tournament. and we were missing two of our better players. great. the first inning was somewhat pedestrian as they scored 3 runs. that's not so bad, we can keep up with that. although i have to admit, there were a lot of balls hit my way at second base and my feet felt weighed down by concrete slabs as i watched them shoot by me. as the game progressed, we began to get confortable with our surroundings. with the exception of a home run ball, there were a lot of infield hits which our lanky shortstop plucked from the ground with deliberation and turned several double plays - deflating any type of hope the other team began to swell with. i began to adjust my positioning and balls that once sped off in the distance began to nestle safely in my glove only to be quickly tossed to our oversized first baseman. too bad we didn't have golden glove awards - he'd get one for sure. eventually, we made our way to the last inning where the game was tied 10 to 10, two outs with chi on first and hap at second. we had some speed on the base path. the captain and my batting cage partner came up to bat. greg hadn't had a very productive regular season but when the pitch came over the plate, he hit a hard grounder between several of the players. hap had made his way to third and but upon seeing their player bobble the ball, he sprinted home, trying to beat the throw in. hap slid in head first dirt in his mouth, crashing into their catcher with a thud, soil shooting through the air like shrapnel. time began to move in slow motion waiting for the umpire to make his call. the blue threw both his hands out - "safe" he yelled.our giant robot softball team won our very first tounament game. thats more than half the teams that entered and better than all the teams that didn't enter. not bad for the worst team.3-8-2005 spring trainingalthough the la parks and recreation softball league doesn't begin for another month, many players from the giant robot softball team work out in the so called off-season. some continue to go to the batting cages, martin calls practice every monday, hap and carlos work on their outfielding positions while greg tinkers with his batting stance. me, i do what i do best, go shopping, because i believe in the philosophy of "looking good, playing good".so i log onto the nike website where i find a pair of kicks that have my name on em! ok, nike doesn't actually sell cleats that say "poon" because, well, i'm haven't seen any endorsement checks signed by phil knight or william perez, but, they do allow you to personalize your own shoes. awesome. when nike first began this i.d. program, someone put "sweatshop" on the back of their shoe. that was pretty damn funny although corporate headquarters did not think so. consequently, they become more restrictive with the words you could use. and apparently, they don't really like the word poon - just another example of the man trying to keep me down. but using a variation of l337 5p34k, i added a couple of x's to bypass the nike online security system. ok, so its not quite as cool as ice cube in triple x since i only have 2 x's but it'll work.of course the whole point is moot if i can't get on base. hmm, maybe i ought to go to the batting cages.1-25-2005 on the rocksthe softball game was disappointing, not just the outcome, but also the lack of support for one another on and off the field by various members of the team. or maybe we were all frustrated. there was anger inside my own body and i thought a late night trip to the batting cages might distill the festering venom. no such luck.and after midnight, there isn't really much to do. or is there. bars are always open later, but seeing as i am allergic to alcohol, asking a bartender for a shirley temple doesn't seem to have the same effect. strip clubs are open late too and my favorite porn star happened to be working tonight but she gets paid to dance, not listen to people yap about the politics of sports. eating would be good...jes, eating. something to make me forget and regret. chinese cafes are open until sometimes 4 in the morning. the regent cafe was open and i ordered the mixed grill. this dish contains 4 different animals and 5 different kinds of meat. i like that. you have the cow, the pig, the chicken and the lamb represented by the steak, the pork chop, the fried chicken breast and the lamb chop respectively. but wait, lets throw in a hot dog too cuz you know, that would be perfect. one billion chinese can't be wrong about these things.yea, tomorrow will be a carnivore hangover. at least i'll forget about the game. just like drinking...well maybe not but better than a shirley temple for sure.1-20-2005 gr softballafter a month and half of general malaise due to the holdays and rain cancellations, the giant robot softball team resume playing the game we love? with a 4 and 5 record, we were hoping to continue our three game win streak against a winless team filled with accountants and a pretty girl...and maybe my mind should have been on the game instead. or was our entire team thinking of her because none of us could field a grounder, catch a fly ball or throw an easy out at first base. although i must give credit to my right ankle. several times, it said to me "let me get the ball, let me get the ball". but as most people know, ankles are not designed to catch balls. help run, yes. catch balls, no.we lost by a tentative score of 22 to 7. after down by 10 runs, you start losing track of certain statistics. but on the other hand, we gave the accountants their first win of the season. that counts for something doesn't it?11-17-2004 seeking jamie and maxhaving pulled my ham string the previous week, i needed to make myself stronger and faster like lee majors. unfortunately, i left the six million dollars in my other pants pocket and thus, could not afford the technology. however, i did have a little bit of cheddar in my wallet and some friends to help me out to get me ready for my last softball game. these aren't bionic parts but should work for now.salonpas - greg is my oscar goldman and provided me with these six inch crazy rectangular bandages. they start off cold on contact, than about 30 minutes in, they start warming up like a mother fucker. it was like sitting on a match stick, my ass was freaking hot and smelled like menthol. but the salonpas seem to aliveate the pain. i'm curious about putting them to other uses.two pairs of underwear - it was pretty damn cold so i thought i'd wear two pairs of undies. boy shorts and longer boy shorts. did they help? i don't know but it felt strangely provocative at times.l'oreal bleach bonding - ok, this doesn't really help my game per ce. but you still gotta look good.ok, we lost last night 8- 11. apparently, bleaching my hair didn't help.10-7-2004standing at second base, i never see him but brett plays right field behind me. sometimes i see him at practice, occassionally at a skate park or at a show but really i don't know too much about him. well he's thin. kind of cute i guess. always on the up side too.also that he's married to happy. happy is japanese. brett is white. white guy asian chick. thats...not an uncommon phenomenon. some people complain about it - i always see it come up on internet message boards, read articles or overhear asian 101 students talk about it like its the next big issue. they say they they're taking "our" women away. they say they have yellow fever. is that true? i don't know, i don't even know who "our" women is. when brett first met happy, he probably just thought she seemed like a cool chick - did graphic design, played in a band, baked cookies for christmas. maybe brett didn't notice that her eyes were slanted. maybe brett didn't notice that she was japanese. maybe brett just fell in love...fell in love. and happy fell back. and i think, maybe, thats all right too.sometimes the ball gets hit over my head. all i can do is turn around and watch the white sphere sail into the horizon. and there's brett to make the catch. doing something else right.note: yellow fever is a virus infection that leads to death in about 25% of patients. the virus is carried by the aedes mosquisto. there is no specific treatment but vaccination is very effective. the united states is not a known risk country.9-21-2004 la nitea friend from new york once said to me that los angeles didn't have neighborhoods and she didn't feel connected to the people.as i was driving down the 10 freeway towards santa monica, i thought to myself, "do i really need to be driving some where this late at night. i could decrease the traffic by one and thats always worth something". but my friend was waiting for me at the park across from his house. greg was watching some random softball game. greg is the guy who will jump in if you get into a fight with 4 large ornery men. greg is the guy who will pay for drinks even though he only has a few dollars in his pocket. greg is also the guy who will chuckle and say with sincerity "its cool" when you tell him you listen to avril lavign. he smoked a cigarette, i talked to him about things that guys talk to with other guys - about relationships and ego and shit. we eventually made our way to the batting cages in sherman oaks and than ate ate cheap tacos in lovely van nuys. more driving and more driving. it was cool. good times don't cost a dime.los angeles is a pretty big place. lot of neighborhoods. but community isn't about how far everyone is...its about how close you feel to them. over mexican food. over night in l.a.9-6-2004 prelude to a seasonpeople struck out. no big thing. people bobbled the ball. no big thing. pitcher walked people. no big thing. but the giant robot softball team lost our first game of the season. was that a big thing? some people say losing is never a good thing. ok mr mr. get mad. be mad. stay mad. but the nights over and we played with effort from inning one to inning end. sometimes thats what really matters...as long as we are measured by our hearts and not by our errors, we'll be ok.sandwich: oooh, mr. russell crowe. giving the big inspirational speech.number9: don't you have a mouse to kill?sandwich: don't you have a crowd of poor to address?number9: .sandwich: .7-4-2004 a b or callie is a "dancer"...hell, she's a stripper at the spearmint rhino. her mileage isn't great but we've played a few times in the last couple of months. my cousin tells me, yea, she is a porn star aka amber rain. thats interesting. i didn't know that.the giant robot softball team played last thursday night. as we always do instead of watching friends on tv. i play third base and i can't let my mind wander too much - a hard line drive could bring in a run or more importantly, be an end to my import modeling career. so its best i concentrate. but i have to admit, going to a strip club after the game might be interesting...oops, there goes a fly ball. no worries, our outfielders are on top of it. guess i better scamper over to third in case the runner on 2nd tries to advance. nope, he stays. allie does work on thursday nights but...shit, pop fly over my head but not hard enough for b.k. to catch it. run scores. thats no good. hmm, this game over seven innings isn't going so well. wonder what allie will be wearing tonight. the game ended badly, the score something like 18 - 2. ugh.we were all leaving the park around 10:30, many of us disappointed with the loss. the team usually gets together for some food, i could eat with the boys, go home to shower, drive myself to see allie and lose myself in a gaggle of breasts. that might cheer me up. my friend shari had been in the stands rooting for us. she asked me if i wanted to eat with everyone. i looked at her and said no. we ended up on our own going to a diner and shared a key lime pie milk shake and turkey sandwich. she didn't dance for me or anything but i did notice the color of her undie as she left the car. shari wears lowriders too sometimes. the night turned pretty nice after all.choice a: dinner with martin (pitcher), brett (outfielder) and carlos (dh)choice b: dancing with a porn starchoice c: chillin with shari6-24-2004 beezlbub has a devil put aside for me..he giant robot softball team had scored 12 runs in the first inning, we were winning 14-2 in the second. while waiting for the next pitch, i thought to myself, someone must have made a pact with the devil. we had never batted this well at all, everyone got a hit right away. and so the game went on, the 43.50's trying to gain some runs, us trying to stay ahead. martin's pitching was pretty right on the entire game, getting most of his first pitches over for a strike while the shortstop secondbase of brett and sky held firm. sure they scored 5 runs here or 6 runs there, but we were seem to be still in control of the game. until that last inning where we simultaneously obtained amnesia and everything we learned about softball vanished into the thin night. they scored 9 runs and we entered the last inning chasing 5. i thought to make a motivational speech but opted against as i was up to bat. my last two at bats were line outs to the right side of the field so i decided to just hit to left field where for some odd reason, i hit a pop fly to center. bad directions. brett and rich wanted to make me feel better and followed to pop out as well. we lost 19 to 14. fuck all the haters. we'll do it on our own next week.6-10-2004 dirt off our shoulderwatching people play softball, every pitcher is different with their individual style of tossing the white sphere onto the plate. anywhere from the young man standing erect with his hands together while leaning back at a 30 degree angle to the fragile gene wilder looking man who heaved the ball as if it required every ounce of strength he could muster - i thought he was going to die of a coronary for god's sake. the captain and pitcher of the giant robot c team is martin. he eagle claw grips the ball and pitches with a slow snap as if marching to the beat of a different drum. the umpire commented to our catcher how he's seen our number eight pitch for two years but still hasn't figured it out.the season had been winless and every week, another loss created a larger burden that began to weigh heavy on our enthusiasm while every opposing run was just another painful bite into our fragile confidence and enthusiasm. the team we played tonight (thursday) was adequate at best but they did beat us 9 to 8 the last time we played. so we were mediocre? as we entered the seventh and last inning of the night, we hadn't scored many runs...but one more than they did. for now. the score was 10 to 9. martin was a little shakey tonight, having walked a few people during the course of the game - that was unlike him. they had men on first and second. two outs. we count was 0 and 2. throw rain i said to martin. in his customary crouch, martin threw the ball high into the air.martin sweats alot when he pitches. its tiring. and along with his unorthodox delivery, maybe thats why the ump's don't know what to make of him. but as this particular ball descended into the earth, and the batter took an airball swing, blue only had to say one thing. strike. yes, giant robot had won its first game.5-19-2004 softball practicewell maybe if thats going to be a problem, than maybe you should just pay me back the money you owe me and get your own insurance. well, at least thats what i wanted to say to her, my cindy aka trouble. having this open "date other" relationship is annoying at best, although we continue to ask each other who we went out with...more of a checking up tone than platonic one.the night was cold but several of us showed up for softball practice - as a winless team, we should practice. up at bat was brettb. i met brettb about a year ago, although more through his wife happy who was friends with angeline who was the sister to martin who was the editor of giant robot magazine. so my degree of seperation was rather far although he always made a point to say hi the last time we bumped into each other at the vans skate park 30 miles away from home or yell at the top of his lung, as he drove by me on the street. it was random, quirky and sweet at the same time. you could almost say thats the type of player he is, pretty far from the streamline jocks that litter our league. after practice, he said to no one aloud, "i had a really bad day, i'm glad i came out to practice".we looked at each other and i nodded. i know what you mean brettb, i know what you mean.4-15-2004 5 4 3several months ago, when i worked at the giant robot store, i use to look across the street and nod to my friend greg who worked at the small supermarket there. we would take our breaks and talk about what the hell was going on with the world - sometimes it fucked up, sometimes it has good things going for it. i don't visit that side of town very often and i miss the conversations we use to have.the giant robot softball team is fairly new - 75% have never played on this team before and chemestry is a little shaky. some of the people were playing new positions...we could be the bad news bears. i was asked to play second and i was a little nervous because a. i hadn't played there for a year b. i was working on a new throwing technique c. i tend to get overexcited and throw the ball very far away from the intended target. be it as it may, one of my goals has always been to turn the double play. oh sure, some people want to get their graduate degree, some people want to get a big promotion and some miss america's want to achieve world peace. not me, i just want to turn the double play. and so in the first inning, someone hit a bloop single to center field. it wasn't a great way to start the game. i looked over at the shortstop and i gave him the two fingers up sign. the next batter came up to plate. the pitch went up, the bat swung and a sharp grounder skidded to the third baseman. he fielded the ball and whipped it to secondbase where i stood. the ball stung into my glove and i quickly snatched it and snapped it to first...where greg was playing. he caught my throw and the ump called the two baserunners out.greg and i looked over at each other. we nodded at each other like old times.4-1-2004 homecomingmr poon!". the distinguished gentleman with the silver hair on the other side of the fence called out my name. "are we playing you this season?"having left giant robot for the last eight months, i rejoined the slightly new and unproved gr softball team for our weekly thursday night la parks and recreation league outings. there were many new faces on this team and the promotional t-shirts disguised as uniforms had not arrived yet. martin had informed me that i would be playing second base. the shortstop and partner in crime in turning the double play name was sky - i thought i was in a chinese action movie directed by wong jing. the first game of the season is always filled with excitement and hope. everyone in the leauge has the same record and everyone has a chance for a trophy...well ok, some more than others. i made my way over to my position where the infield dirt was that pretty orange brown color and evenly layed out. i dug my cleats into the soil and kept my new glove in front of me. the first pitch of the season went into the air...i looked up at that man who played for the rude boys...thats their team name, don't wear it out. i smile and nodded. yea, its nice to be home again.game notes: we lost the first game. two people struck out, we got free fries that night (team penalty). mr. poon went 2 for 3 at bat and made 2 errors in the field...i blame my short arms.3-23-2004 i, jockgiant robot has a softball team that will be playing thursday nights. the team had gotten so large that it had to be divided into two teams, one going to an upper division (b's) while others remained in c's. a practice/exhibition game was arranged monday night so that players could meet each other in addition to getting some team chemestry during real game situations. cool.earlier during the night, i had played on my monday night co-ed softball team. we're not a very good team although the captain brought banana walnut bread which always is a good thing. apparently they remembered the mercy rule this time as i stood in right field watching one of the opposing players cross home plate and the game get called off. thats ok, this gave me the time to drive across town and participate in the gr game.so a new teammate on the softball team says to me "wow, they (giant robot magazine) sure make you look a lot taller in the photos". i laughed because...well, what else could i do. but i can see that this is going to be a long season too.
