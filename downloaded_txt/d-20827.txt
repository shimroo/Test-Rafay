							the tradition and quality of the yaesu hf product line lives on with the new ftdx101mp model. in homage to the found of yaesu - sako hasegawa ja1mp - we are pleased to announce this model. this transceiver covers the hf/50 mhz bands, is capable of 200 watts of power, vc tune for the main and sub band included, along with crystal roofing filters for cw (300 hz main only/600hz), ssb (3 khz), and am (12 khz) makes this the ultimate radio. with the 3dss (3-dimensional spectrum stream) you can see signals that you might not have had the chance to tune in before they disappear. adding in the advanced and high quality sdr receivers which allow for narrow band and direct sampling sdr functions enables you to hear signals that others are unable to hear. no need to worry about which power supply or external speaker to use as the ftdx101mp comes with a combined speaker/power supply combination. this matching set makes the ftdx101mp not only a high-quality radio but a picture of beauty.

						the ultimate hf/50 mhz transceiver has arrived continuing on the tradition of high-quality hf products. named after the well-known ft-101, which is a corner stone in the history of hf transceivers, the future is here with the birth of the ftdx101d. featuring 100 watts of power, vc tune for the main band (sub band optional purchase), crystal roofing filters for cw (600 hz), ssb (3 khz), and am (12 khz) makes this radio ready to work in a weak signal environment. "we believe that hearing a weak target signal in an environment of close strong interference is the most important feat required of hf dx communications equipment in every era. raising and meeting the goal is the ultimate mission that yaesu has challenged for over 60 years."
