the culex quinquefasciatus mosquito.
the no-chemical, no-poison answer to your mosquito problem!

mosquito barrier is a very strong liquid garlic made from very potent garlic cloves. the garlic used in mosquito barrier is a very powerful variety which is much more potent than the garlic found in grocery stores (in fact, our lab people here refer to it as "super garlic"). click here to see a scientific analysis of mosquito barrier. garlic has a natural sulfur which repels mosquitoes. spraying garlic to keep insects away is not something new, farmers and master gardeners have been doing it for many generations.
since mosquitoes are soft-bodied insects the garlic juice can be very toxic to them in increased concentrations. the juice does not harm humans, pets or plants, but to mosquitoes it can be deadly. the odor of garlic chases them away for as long as they can detect the odor. the odor of sprayed garlic juice becomes undetectable to humans within minutes, but mosquitoes can detect odor as much as 10,000 times better than a human. so even though you can't smell the garlic, they can and they will stay away from the sprayed area for up to a month or longer. if the mosquitoes aren't in your yard, they can't get into your house.
additionally, mosquito barrier, when mixed with canola oil (available at your local grocery store) plus the water, coats any standing water in the area with a very thin film of natural oil. this oil suffocates the mosquito larvae which can develop in standing water. unlike harmful chemicals, mosquito barrier is a natural insect repellent that doesn't kill bees or butterflies and is completely safe for children, fish, birds, dogs, cats and other pets. be careful of traditional chemical pesticides, they can kill more than mosquitoes. read this to learn more.
generally, four applications are enough for the entire mosquito season. even in the heaviest of infestations the gallon size is almost always enough for the entire year for most homes - including areas where the mosquito is the state bird.

mosquito barrier is a three-pronged attack:
(1) it repels the adult mosquitoes for up to a month.
(2) the garlic coated plants keep mosquitoes out of the area.
(3) it suffocates any mosquito larvae in standing water, such as puddles, under decks, water in tin cans or depressions in lawn, etc.
