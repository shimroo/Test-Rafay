lofts at albuquerque high














take our residents’ word for it…

 







george


 overall, i’ve had an excellent experience with edo storage. the space was always expertly maintained and staff was helpful and courteous.

nora


 living at the lofts has been a wonderful experience, the location is convenient between downtown and nob hill, the buildings and living spaces are beautiful and impeccably maintained, and there is a wonderful sense of community. as a young person, or really at any age, i wouldn't want to live anywhere else in albuquerque.

joel


 from the living space itself, to the courtyard, to its location in the heart of the city, the abq high lofts offer a fantastic urban living experience that i wholeheartedly enjoyed.

beth


 the lofts at abq high are by far the best managed living option in albuquerque. the management keeps things clean, orderly, secure and very comfortable for me! my loft is a great base for my busy life.  



			beth, resident since 2013

 i enjoy living at the lofts because its a short walk to great restaurants and a quick drive to nob hill!

 belvedere urban courtyard, a uniquely designed condo community, is simply a lovely place to live. great location, easy walk to the heart of albuquerque, excellent professional management given by people who are 5 star.
