chair’s welcome and departmental vision statement









						gary j. bassell, phd, charles howard candler professor of cell biology and department chair
											


i am delighted to have this opportunity to work with an outstanding group of faculty, as we make new discoveries at the frontiers of cell biology, developmental biology and neurobiology. we conduct basic biomedical and translational research with an emphasis on the study of diverse aspects of cellular dynamics in health, disease and therapeutic intervention using modern methods in microscopy and imaging. our research employs multidisciplinary approaches with genetically tractable animal models and human patient cells. we are committed to provide an exemplary level of research training, teaching and mentorship of future scientists and physicians. we continue to establish new partnerships and collaborations across several academic and clinical departments within emory university, the school of medicine and several research centers. i look forward to supporting the research and teaching mission of our faculty, and our vision to have a transformative impact on understanding basic science to advance human health.







news highlights
















												frontiers in neuroscience seminar: kun memorial lecture
											
z. josh huang, phd, professor, duke school of medicine distinguished professor in neuroscience, will be this year's guest speaker for the kun memorial lecture. his talk, "genetic dissection of cortical neuron type trajectories: from developmental origin to behavioral function," will be february 7, 2025, whitehead building, emory campus, 11 am - 12:00 pm. 










												new faculty member
											

we are pleased to welcome michael deans, phd, who will join us in january 2025 as an associate professor of cell biology. dr. deans was previously an associate professor in otolaryngology at the university of utah. his new lab, located on the 5th floor of wbrb, will investigate developmental mechanisms guiding planar cell polarity, cellular morphogenesis and innervation essential for auditory and vestibular function.

























												garraway lab
											
the garraway lab published a paper, "trkb agonist (7,8-dhf)-induced responses in dorsal root ganglia neurons are decreased after spinal cord injury: implication for peripheral pain mechanisms," in eneuro. 














												shekhar lab
											
shashank shekhar, phd, assistant professor of physics, cell biology, and biochemistry at emory university, was named “cell scientist to watch” by the journal of cell science. the journal conducted an in-depth interview with dr. shekhar, highlighting his academic journey and his lab’s latest research.
read interview at journal of cell science














												ward lab
											

jill ward, phd, assistant professor of cell biology, received the emory seeds to pursue diverse funders pilot grant titled, “high-resolution emg for motor units following spinal cord injury,” in collaboration with sam sober, phd.
the office of the senior vice president for research supports collaborative projects that cross disciplinary boundaries and academic units. up to three grants are awarded annually. these grants are intended to catalyze new collaborations in support of a multiple investigator proposal submission to extramural funding programs in order to strengthen and diversify emory’s external funding for interdisciplinary research beyond the department of human health services funding umbrella.















												katz lab
											
david katz, phd, was recognized by emory school of medicine for his recent membership to the national wormboard. 
the wormboard is a representative group of working scientists and educators who use c. elegans or related nematodes as their primary model organism. wormboard will meet in odd-numbered years at the biennial international c. elegans meeting, and if possible at one of the topic or regional meetings in even-numbered years. additional business will be conducted by email or teleconference. since its inception the c. elegans field has relied on the voluntary efforts of community-minded individuals to develop and organize key resources and meetings. as the field enters its second half-century, continued growth necessitates a more formal structure for such efforts. the international c. elegans board (icb), a.k.a. wormboard, was formed in 2015 to advocate for c. elegans research internationally and to foster the continued development of community resources.

												alvarez lab
											

francisco alvarez, phd, professor and vice chair in cell biology, published a paper, “modulation of central synapse remodeling after remote peripheral injuries by the ccl2-ccr2 axis and microglia,” in cell reports,

the manuscript is co-authored by current students zoë haley-johnson, tana pottorf, william mccallum and shannon zhang among others.
this research shows that peripheral nerve injury severity modulates microglia activation in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, which transforms spinal networks controlling motor function. specifically, ccl2-expressing microglia are induced after more severe injuries, causing permanent removal of synapses carrying proprioceptive information necessary for fine movement coordination.

dr. sampson was also appointed to an associate editor position for npj parkinson's disease.





















												jiang lab
											

congratulations to dr. devesh pant, instructor in cell biology in the lab of dr. jie jiang, for receiving the live like lou’s 2023 career development award. this career development grant aims to bolster the careers of emerging scientists, facilitating the advancement of innovative ideas toward securing substantial funding for the critical study of lou gehrig’s disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
