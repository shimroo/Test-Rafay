faq



what does postponement mean for those who have already registered for a-kon 33?to everyone who snagged pre-registrations, we want to sincerely thank you for your early support for 2024. we want to reassure you that the plan is to refund all a-kon 33 registration purchases. we will reopen sales again once we are able to confirm our new dates.does a-kon mail registration badges?yes we do! all weekend badges purchased prior to the mailing deadline will be mailed to the address you provided when you registered. this means that if you pre-registered prior to the cutoff and gave us a valid u.s. address, you won't need to spend a single minute waiting in a registration line or checking in to access the event.















how do i purchase tickets to extra or new activities?if activities are available when you register, you'll be prompted to add them as part of the standard registration process. if you purchased your registration prior to activities being released, you can purchase activities anytime after they are released via the personal registration portal link provided in your registration confirmation. do kids attend for free?children under the age of 6 can attend for free! there are also discounted tickets available for kids 6-12 years of age.
