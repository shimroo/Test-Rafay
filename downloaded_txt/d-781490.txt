welcome to paradise ranch

paradise ranch, located in the beautiful okanagan valley in british columbia, canada, owned by ben and dori sawatzky, is dedicated to the preservation, breeding and exhibition of the world famous peruvian paso horse.

in pursuit of this passion, ben and dori started paradise ranch in 1996, and it has become one of breeds largest and most comprehensive breeding and training facilities, many times winning canadas coveted high point breeder of the year award. here, you will find some of the worlds finest peruvian paso horses; horses of enduring strength, arrogant style, gentle temperament and exquisite gait. we have taken great care in producing our herd, crossing the legendary bloodlines of the southern style horse of alfredo elias with the northern lines of the rissos and cayalti.
 surrounded by acres of luscious rangeland, with miles of bench land trails, orchards and vineyards, a panoramic view of okanagan lake, the city of vernon and the blue mountains of the rockies, paradise ranch provides an ideal setting for raising, riding and enjoying this royal horse of the conquistadors.whether you are looking for gentle smooth horse to enjoy on the trail, proven stallions or broodmares to begin your breeding program, or a show stopping winner in the show ring, you will find them at paradise ranch, or we will help you locate one.
