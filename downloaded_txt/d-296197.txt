customer reviews











“our experience with florida shutters was a pure delight from the meeting with tommy and buck to the installers. everyone was professional, meticulous about their jobs and very helpful. they went out of their way to make sure we understood our options to choose from and relied on their recommendations for customized shutters for one window in our home. you are not going to find this type of service from too many companies. we would highly recommend florida shutters to anyone. an excellent job and a very caring company!!” joyce and bill jeffrey







“just wanted to send you a note to tell you how pleased i am with the shutters you recently installed at my home. having just taken down the shutters myself, after the hurricane, i am very much aware of how solid and well built they are. i have no doubt that if matthew had arrived here as a category 4, the shutters would have stayed in place even if everything around it had been demolished. everyone at your company was outstanding and represented you very well."susan schuyler smith, asid spectrum interior design







“miles was phenomenal to work with - i was very picky and took forever to make decisions, but he was so friendly; patient; had fabulous recommendations and is the consummate professional!  at the end of the day, i am so thrilled with the end result - my new gate and shutters took my ok house to finished, dressed, extraordinary!  even though i have hurricane impact windows and doors that don't "require" shutters for protection, shutters add charm to a home that i just love!  miles is fabulous as a sales professional, but also understands great home design, gets curb appeal, and can guide you to a perfect outcome.  thank you miles & florida shutters!”cathy curley







“we are extremely happy with our accordion shutters and the stellar service dale and his team provide!  we highly recommend florida shutters!  they truly care about their customers!”susan barth







“excellent company.   highly recommend.   they installed accordion and colonial shutters.  they were booked out a few months, but that was ok with us.   it worked out exactly the way they said it would, but they actually started the work a little earlier than the estimated date.   excellent communications.  quality workmanship, and the installers were professional and polite, and let the job site how they found it.   couldn’t ask more from a contractor.”kevin stankewitz







“we loved our experience with florida shutters from start to finish! from our initial phone call for an estimate to the day of installation, these guys went above and beyond! unfortunately, we live in a time where we almost expect shoddy workmanship and that people don't care about their jobs. definitely not the case with florida shutters! not only did they show up on time, if not early,  but they cleaned up after themselves so well that we couldn't even tell we had any work done! they paid enough attention to detail to remember to lock the gate on our fence when they left to keep our doggies from running away and when they had to come back to do some more measuring they moved furniture and then moved it back for us. professional, courteous, pleasant, meticulous, definitely give them a call!”jamie peters







“florida shutters is the best in customer service bar none! i had a problem with my electric shutters and needed them serviced before leaving town. jeremy worked me into his schedule, showed up when i needed him to and fixed everything so i’d be prepared for hurricane season. they always do a great job, are professional and a team you can truly count on! jeremy went out of his way to make sure i was taken care of right away, highly recommend for new shutters and maintenance!”rachelle doucet







“barth construction has been using florida shutters for our hurricane protection shutters and decorative aluminum gates since starting our business in 1987.i have always found tom pease and his entire staff to be knowledgeable, professional, and eager to help us provide our clients with a quality product in a timely manner.”phil barth, owner, barth construction







“my husband and i believe this was one of the best, if not the best experience we've had with a contractor. we'd give them 10 stars if it were possible. they were top notch professionals from start to finish of our project. most of all, their communication was awesome. we're totally pleased with the results.”louise jones







“had them repair old electric shutters, they knew what they were doing and did a great job. as far as shutters and service i wouldn't call anyone else.”mark osolnick
