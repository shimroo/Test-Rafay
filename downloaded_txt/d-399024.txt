in
              1959, berry gordy gathered the best musicians from detroit's thriving
              jazz and blues scene to begin cutting songs for his new record
              company. over a fourteen year period they were the heartbeat on "my
              girl," "bernadette," i was made to love her," and
              every other hit from motown's detroit era.

by
            the end of their phenomenal run, this unheralded group of musicians
            had played on more number ones hits than the beach boys, the rolling
            stones, elvis and the beatles combined - which makes them the greatest
            hit machine in the history of popular music. they called themselves
            the funk brothers.

forty-one
            years after they played their first note an a motown record and three
            decades since they were all together, the funk brothers reunited
            back in detroit to play their music and tell their unforgettable
            story in standing in the shadows of motown.

with
            the tumultuous sixties as a backdrop, motown's unsung heroes take
            the viewer on a compelling journey in time as they trace the evolution
            of the motown sound" from its origins in detroit to its demise
            in los angeles during the seventies. through the eyes of the riveting
            characters who ruled hitsville's studio by day and the club scene
            of detroit by night, we enter a world of unparalleled soul and emotion
            as the funk brothers revisit the sites of their musical roots, triumphs,
            and eventual heartbreak.

for
            more than four decades, from the dance floors of the world, to the
            detroit riots of 1967, to the war in vietnam, the music the funk
            brothers created has played a major role in the cultural fabric of
            all of our lives. standing in the shadows of motown finally puts
            some faces on that music and introduces these heroic musical figures
            to the world.
