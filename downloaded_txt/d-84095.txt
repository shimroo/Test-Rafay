works with horn by women composers catalogfounded in 2002, this catalog has been an essential resource for performers, composers, teachers, scholars, and others who are interested in programming or studying works with horn by women composers. the catalog includes solo and chamber music with horn (original works, up to 12 instruments) by women composers from around the world. almost 2,200 pieces are listed and the catalog is continuing to be updated. i welcome your additions, corrections, and questions. please contact me using this link. in order to be more inclusive, i have changed the name of this catalog to women composers instead of female composers. this catalog includes any composer who identifies as a woman.about half of this list was originally collected from these sources. i am especially indebted to monique buzzarté and heidi boenke for their compilations. more recently, i want to thank rob deemer, ashley killam, and everyone else who is working on the composer diversity database. finally, michael allen from boulder brass offered significant contributions to the brass quintet page in 2020.here's a free piece! canzonetta by edna frida pietsch score • recording the publication of this edition was made possible by kind permission of the family of the composer and the university of wisconsin-madison.***new album!!!  the catalog was last updated 9/13/24.
