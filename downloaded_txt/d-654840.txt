what we do








 










the metabolic approach to cancer 




allow us to empower you on your cancer journey, and together, we’ll forge a path to recovery filled with hope, strength, and unwavering support. 



we implement a holistic strategy that combines the metabolic approach to cancer with a terrain-centric methodology for effective management and prevention. by integrating these two approaches, we address cancer comprehensively, fostering a synergistic method. this dual approach not only directly impacts cancer cells but also works to create an internal environment that discourages their development. our goal is to empower the body to resist and overcome cancer, promoting long-term well-being and resilience. 



 



dr. nasha winters, the author of “the metabolic approach to cancer,” offers a unique perspective based on her personal journey, providing firsthand experience with a cancer diagnosis.

we know what we do works. 



see the stories of those who have worked with us 













						i feel fantastic!! i've fallen in love with life and i'm excited about my future again. things are not perfect but i'm enjoying every day and being true to myself.

since beginning keto, i have more energy and stamina. i'm working out regularly without strain or injury, which historically happens when i start working out on a regular basis.

my moods are much more even. i noticed that i don't ruminate as much as before. i also seem to handle setbacks or bad news better. it's like i'm becoming more emotionally regulated. wow!!					





amanda aksel 






						in july 2020 i began working with dr. erin and the rest of the staff to address several health issues.  i'm approaching age 50 and not okay with living as if it is a normal thing to fall apart.  we have been working on issues ranging from health concerns during my childhood until the present. the process is slow but small changes like healthier nails, hair, and skin keep me motivated.  i'm also increasing muscle and balance, things i've been told in the past would be impossible.  i remind myself constantly how cost-effective getting healthy is, we will pay up one way or another.  i'd much rather buy healthier foods and supplements than pay for medical bills and medications.  i can't say enough about the awesome staff!!!  i ask a lot of questions often, and they are always amazing, professional, and knowledgeable. the process is definitely life-changing if you are willing to put in the work and trust the process.					





dyshel t. 






						i love the fact that my treatment plans at options naturopathic clinic are based on empirical results i can see and track. so generous with his time and expertise, dr. patrick consistently walks me through my labs, explaining what it all means--what the numbers signify about what's going on in my body and what i could/should do in response. and he's always willing to answer any questions i have. it's remarkable, and a degree of education and empowerment that is exceedingly rare in conventional medical settings. i continue to learn so much, and i can't help but wish that everyone had the option of, and easier access to, this kind of care.					





debbie k. 






						i've never felt so at ease with a dr as i do with dr. laura. she makes me feel truly cared for and she listens to everything i have to say. she had never been judgmental or pushy, but always wants for best, and if something isn't working, she is willing to make the necessary changes to help. she is one in a million!
					





hannah r. 






						since i’ve been under the care of dr. erin i have gained my healthy weight back, i feel better than i have in years. i am confident to say after 3 months taking these natural remedies and herbs i started noticing changes in my body physically, the way i think. i finally was able to temper off my blood pressure meds which i’ve have had to take for 7 years now, and i’m 27 years old. people need to stop over looking the importance of gut health. i think if natural medicine was more popular, maybe the government would cover this type of thing under insurance. i will say though it’s worth every penny coming to this clinic. i highly recommend dr. erin, and her wonderful resident dr. laura who has been so kind to come to my healing and wellness events to promote naturopathic care, more people need to know there is a better way to take charge of your health, and this clinic can provide that for you!					





tara d. 






						i cannot say enough amazing things about dr. erin and her amazing staff at options. they have been helping to treat my son who is 19 and is battling rhabdomyosarcoma. we are pleased with how thorough they have been with assessing his health and  helping get him to a more healthy state so that his body can help heal itself and correct his specific medical issues that allowed this cancer to manifest itself. they have given us hope, clarity and guidance in this most difficult time. and my family and i are extremely grateful to have such an intelligent and compassionate doctor like dr. erin.					





jennifer d. 






						i saw dr. laura and she was wonderful. she was so understanding and knowledgeable about my issues. i felt heard and understood in a way way that i have not ever been by medical physician. she was patient and so kind and took the time to really listen to me and come up with a fabulous treatment plan.  i love her integrated approach and appreciate her level of knowledge and love of holistic medicine which incorporates emotion and family history and vibrational/energetic awareness of disease. im very happy with her care and would recommend her as well as options clinic to anyone.
they also have the afterpay option for medications and supplements they offer which is so helpful.					





meredith f. 






						i would highly recommend dr. laura and options naturopathic clinic staff! i am in the last trimester of my pregnancy and feel better knowing i am under the care and guidance of dr. laura’s medical expertise to optimize the health of my baby and me!					





heather 






						dr. erin and dr. laura are knowledgeable, professional, and truly intent on helping to identify and address health concerns. after years of seeking help from conventional practitioners to no avail dr. erin has me feeling noticeably better. the entire office is delightful to work with.					





kara g. 






						dr erin has helped me tremendously. with healing comes work. it's important to stick to the diets and protocol if you want the most out of this. if you are investing the money you should have a mindset that invests in your health too! skin is clear, anxiety is gone, the fear of depression coming back is gone. more energy, better connection to self, and i experience more gratitude and satisfaction in life everyday. she is knowledgeable and her heart is in the right place. her attitude shows she's worked very hard to establish the practice she has today. my life has changed for the better. i recommend her to all my friends who are ready to change their lives.					





gabbie 






						dr. erin is thorough and truly takes a whole body approach towards healing.  over the last 15 years she has been instrumental in my health.  she has taught me that prescription medication only masks illnesses and true healing begins at removing the the cause instead of masking the symptoms. i highly recommend dr. erin  and her practice of naturopathic medicine.					





steven l. 






						dr. erin and her wisdom have been such a blessing to me. with no help from my family doctors and specialists, she offered me help. after a sudden reaction to gluten i lost muscle strength, the ability to lift my arms or legs, and most sensation. the doctors told me my illness was likely progressive, and that it was likely terminal but they wouldn't listen to me when i asked about the food i ate. they told me that "food doesn't do that" and sent me home with no plan or help. i called dr. erin in tears and she quickly helped me begin a protocol for healing. and i am getting better! 
					





rachel 






						i am very happy to work with dr. erin. i believe she listens well, and is very caring. i believe she is very intelligent, has good ideas, and is not afraid to express them. my experience with dr. laura cleg is also very very good. these two women helped me a great deal. thank you!!!! 
        i would like to add how great it is to work with julia smith. she is a good listener and her help is extraordinary. she is an exceptional caregiver and her insight is producing wonderful results. thank you julia !!!
     					





cecilia g. 






						both me and my husband have acquired the services of this clinic. they are all very friendly and eager to help. we have both received services on an urgent request as well as on a scheduled basis and were very much satisfied with how they are organised and surely with the results that they provide. dr maurino is very empathic and listens carefully as well as does a thorough interview assuring the client that is well heard and taken care of. we highly recommend this clinic to anyone who believes that naturopathy can help with one's wellness and health - both at a prevention and healing level.					





katiana s. 






						after working with dr. erin for about 13 years, i'm more convinced than ever to her approach to wellness. having been in the medical field for over 18 years i understand the conventional & non conventional approach. for my family & i the answer is clear. dr erin has helped all of us on our path to better health. my husband who was a skeptic is now convinced of her ability to treat a host of health issues including cancer.					





patti 






						dr. erin has introduced me to a whole new way of viewing medicine and our bodies. in a world of doctors who often prescribe drugs to cover up the root causes of sickness and disease, erin's approach is to actually heal yourself through more holistic methods/ a whole body approach. i am so grateful for her medical guidance and would wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone.
