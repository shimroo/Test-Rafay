    armadillo world headquarters
  













eddie wilson’s memoirarmadillo world headquarters the armadillo helped define the austin culture, creating the foundation of what would become the live music capitol of the world. read eddie wilson's memoir, armadillo world headquarters, edited by jesse sublett, to feel the room and hear the stories directly from eddie himself. available at the threadgill’s online store.

 

"threadgill's was austin's first theme restaurant, and it's theme was austin." — the la timeswhen john morthland in the l.a. times made that prophetic statement, it sounded good to me, so let's take it a bit further and claim to the 1930's through 1960's in austin as the theme of the original threadgill's on north lamar blvd. the big, new shiny one downtown sits next door to the site of the late, great armadillo world headquarters and contains a large portion of memorabilia from the musical hey-day of austin in the 1970's. the juke box holds 100 albums of artists who played the 'dillo and the piano hanging from the ceiling was played by artists as diverse as count basie and commander cody, jerry lee lewis and ray charles, leon russell and captain beefheart. threadgill's tries to serve as a link between the new austin and its past. in matters of music and food, we represent a time before disco or microwaves. i've been fortunate enough to encounter many of the colorful and talented folks who have made creative contributions to the city over the past fifty years. i've saved mementos that i'll share with you if you'll just take a moment to look around.  ---eddie wilson, proprietor
