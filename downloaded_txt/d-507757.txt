once upon a time, there was a man who lived a life centered around his will and his ego. he had a lot of trouble because of this. despite his many blessings, he couldn't see anything because he was dead to the world and to himself. then one day after spreading strife and misery , he got into a fight and had himself an epiphany. (god, that is. jesus christ. the holy ghost.) the scales fell off his eyes and he knew he had lost everything good in his life. after a prayer and a night of pain and sorrow, the man repented and asked forgiveness. it appeared to the man that all was lost, and no matter what had happened to him, it was too late to save the one he loved from walking away. but god is real and he has a plan for each of us. according to god's plan, the man began to be refined, and during this refinement, he learned how to live for the first time. then the most amazing thing happened to the man. he was given grace and blessings, and his life was renewed, as was his spirit. fear and doubt gave way to strength and belief, and his faith became real to him and those who loved him. this is the beginning of that man's life.
