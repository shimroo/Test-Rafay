 a new record for limpopo!
 11 march 2019

birders love challenges, a popular one is the “100km challenge” in which the goal is to find as many bird species as possible within a 100km radius of an area’s central point within one calendar year. the existing south african record was a tough target of 461 species, set in the wider gauteng area in 2015. a certain young birder from polokwane took up the challenge in 2018 and daniel engelbrecht’s spectacular result exceeded all his expectations! with a great deal of effort, commitment, patience and travel (and obliging dad, derek) daniel managed to tick an incredible 465 species, including some enviable megaticks such as pectoral and green sandpiper. congratulations on this fantastic record dan!!
