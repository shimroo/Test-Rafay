missionthe framingham police department's mission is to enhance public safety and reduce crime by providing exceptional police services. this is accomplished through evidence-based data, analysis, and ongoing community outreach.  message from the chiefsince being sworn in as chief of police in december 2020, i have worked alongside some of the finest men and women in uniform anywhere. i am proud of the service these officers provide every day and even more proud of their many accomplishments and community outreach.the police department continues to utilize evidence-based data and analysis to prevent and reduce crime. such analysis helps our department see areas and patterns of concern and act proactively to discourage criminal activity. the department’s ultimate goal is to have more police officers on the street, making connections in the neighborhoods, becoming part of the community, and helping to deter crime before it happens.
