client testimonials











" prior to meeting the webfactory team, i had been in touch with several other web designers with regards to designing my site. it was a frustrating process that brought no joy.

after two briefing sessions with webfactory, i let them get on with what they thought would make me smile. i was totally impressed by the overall result. and i continue to be impressed by the competent manner in which the site is maintained. friends who visit the site tell me that they find it to be classy, quirky and refreshing. i am indeed a happy chappy!"

" we were looking for a vendor to help us set up a new version of our site - this needed to be more integrated and user-friendly. the look and structure of the site had to be developed with input from various stakeholders which provided its own challenges. it was also important that the website could be managed in-house by computer-literate but non-it-specialists to keep the site up-to-date.

webfactory responded keenly to our request to redesign our site at favourable rates and were confident that they could provide rondebosch with one of the best school sites in the country. the site they developed is fast, easy to navigate and has easy access to downloads and current information.

webfactory have successfully managed to encapsulate the very essence of the ârondebosch familyâ by way of design, colour and space.

rondebosch boysâ schools are delighted with the end result."
