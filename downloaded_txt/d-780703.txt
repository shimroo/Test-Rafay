last 3 years and each experience is always a pleasure. if i am meeting cassone delivery men at 2:00 am with a trailer or during working hours for a repair they always call with a time they will be there. what a gem mary is, dealing with her is a pleasure. she respects her job and customers, i’m sure some people dealing with her must think she’s an owner. the only problem i have she gets too much vacation haha. if i was still in business i would try to steal her from you. tim another big plus i have met him many times and he’s always professional and very knowledgeable. i hope to be dealing with cassone for many years.” michael glasco playground equipment manager“i have been doing business with cassone over the past 6 years, both leasing and purchasing many storage containers for various uses. in my dealings with the company, i would describe the staff friendly, helpful and accommodating. if needed, i’ve received personal tours through their yard to look at the equipment and see how the containers can be personalized. they go out of their way to help me design every container to suit my needs. i’m very happy with the product and the customer service from the staff. i
