   anne borgen, dvm - mississippi
 “i have been a veterinarian for 32 years in the hot, humid region of south mississippi. my patients often come in with skin conditions that need to be treated and cleaned up! i needed a product that was quick, easy, and gets the animals really clean.  that’s when i began using eq solutions. i can use it on any animal- canine, feline, equine, bovine, or any other species.  eq solutions leaves the coat soft, clean and smelling fresh. it helps clear up bacterial and fungal skin conditions by cutting down on seborrhea and dry flakey skin. i love eq solutions and would recommend it to anyone!”
