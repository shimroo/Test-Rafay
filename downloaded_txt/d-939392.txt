 -ability may get you to the top but it's character that keeps you there- -i haven't failed, i have found 10,000 ways that don't work-
-winning isn't everything, neither is losing- -we live a life by what we get, we make a life by what we give- 
-what lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us- if the world did'nt suck, we would all fall off?-
-first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win- -to the world you might be one person, but to one person you might be the world- 
-if the minimum wasn't acceptable it wouldn't be called the minimum- -nothing is a problem-

majesty [here i am]
delirious?




here i am humbled by your majesty
covered by your grace so free
here i am, knowing i’m a sinful man
covered by the blood of the lamb

now i’ve found the greatest love of all is mine
since you laid down your life
the greatest sacrifice

majesty, majesty
your grace has found me just as i am
empty handed, but alive in your hands
majesty, majesty
forever i am changed by your love
in the presence of your majesty

here i am humbled by the love that you give
forgiven so that i can forgive
here i stand, knowing that i’m your desire
sanctified by glory and fire

now i’ve found the greatest love of all is mine
since you laid down your life
the greatest sacrifice

really hope all my friends get to know jesus!
