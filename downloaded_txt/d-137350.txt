a financial services company with over 160 year legacy of helping people look forward with courage, strength, and wisdom.  




 
















video transcript: 
in today’s world, companies are defined by what they stand for. our mission is to help our clients secure their financial well-being so they can pursue long and fulfilling lives.
we have a compelling story that embodies that mission. it reflects how we strive to meet the needs of our clients and advisors every day. this story is brought to life by the goddess athena. she’s been by our side since 1859 and symbolizes the elements at the heart of our story: courage, strength and wisdom.
our story also has a powerful title that embodies who we are. and that title is our name: equitable, a name that defines the attitudes, beliefs and behaviors that our colleagues and advisors bring to life every day. it defines who we are, what we do and what makes us different. it is our legacy. it is our truth.
we are equitable.




the reference to 1859 founding refers exclusively to equitable financial life insurance company (ny, ny).
