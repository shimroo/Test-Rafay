welcome to lasalle parish library.serving you in two locations :   main branch - jena, laolla branch - olla, la














serving lasalle parish for nearly 70 yearsfounded in 1952, the lasalle parish public library has long provided educational as well as recreational resources for the community in which it operates. the library also offers children programs throughout the year and facilitates the meeting of several adult clubs and organizations in the parish. we are excited to continue to serve as we move to our newly constructed facility in the parish seat.
























make it an event!
getting your child excited about reading can make a huge impact on their future. giving children the resources to explore their interests encourages thought and helps to instill the value of continued learning. we hope you will make a regular event of bringing your children to the library. we have no doubt they will remember it fondly.
