greetings!
i work on the political ecology of natural resources, and international development issues, as a university scholar and occasional consultant and activist. i have newer interests in urban bike mobility. i'm originally from the uk but have spent many years in other places, notably australia, the usa, west africa and continental europe. 
this site is oriented towards research and teaching interests, and also contains (under publications) online versions almost everything i have written since 1993. thankyou to numerous collaborators, colleagues and students over the years.

list of affordable open access
            journals academics
            could be publishing ethically, particularly in the critical social
            sciences.  generally we don't, and just stick with big publishing
            firms that take our copyrights or make a large profit for their execs
            and shareholders. and the public can't always access our work.
community bike

            virtually ignored by transport researchers - workshops where people
            learn to fix their own bikes and change their travel patterns aided by
            volunteers. i studied this during a fellowship at vub brussels in 2015
            and again in 2020, and in 2023 as a british academy fellow.

melbourne is
        a strong research and teaching university in one of the world's nicest big cities, dating back to the 1850s. initially
        modelled on oxford and part of the australian "ivy league" (group of 8) it is high in all the
        rankings, if anybody cares. i was associate professor  2004-2016 in the school of
        geography and resumed this job in 2019. by 2021 we were merged into the school of geog, earth and atmospheric sciences to save money, following the
        effects of the global pandemic. we were the  department of resource management and geography from 2008-2014 in the  melbourne school of land and environment, which was axed. until
        2006 it had the best name - sages - the school of anthropology, geography and environmental studies in the faculty of arts. this attracted me to australia
        in 2004 from the univ. of arizona, since i teach across development studies, geography and environment (sages survives on facebook!). 

 

 
phd students: i
          have usually run a group working on environment & development, international development,
          political ecology topics and engaged research, and received an award for being the university's best phd supervisor in 2019. 
i spend a great deal of time working
          with masters students, now over 50 graduated, mainly from the master of environment, oep, where 'streams' could
          be chosen including 'development' and 'conservation'. i occasionally have honours students in geography (honours is an undergrad 4th year with a
          20,000 wd. thesis in australia)
