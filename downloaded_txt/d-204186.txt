who is dr. richard tapia?











for the past four decades, professor richard tapia, a rice university professor, the maxfield-oshman professor in engineering, and a 2011 recipient of the national medal of science, has led riceâ€™s efforts to prepare underrepresented groups for success in stem fields. under his leadership, rice has significantly increased the number of minority students and women receiving doctorates in stem subjects, and tapia has spoken to almost a quarter-million students and professionals about underrepresentation and diversity around the united states. in addition, the center has provided training and guidance to over 6,000 college students and 2,500 k-12 teachers since its inception. all students should have opportunities to achieve their dreams, and the tapia center for excellence and equity in education was established to do so. read more about dr. tapia
