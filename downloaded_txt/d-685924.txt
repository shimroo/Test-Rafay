here at frighteners entertainment we pride ourselves on the 
    best products for the best prices anywhere on the net.
we do not sell just any merchandise.
everything that is selected is because it is a product that 
    we do or would use ourselves for our own haunted house.
our fantastic manufacturers: incharacter, rubies, grand heritage, 
    gag studios, gore galore, dc props and scare crow.
our very close friends that are musical artists: virgil, michael 
    hedstrom, ed and gavin of midnight syndicate and joe of nox arcana.
 
 also few new santa clause and mrs. clause costumes that are 
    the best in the business.
 
a small selection of masks will be added in the next few weeks, 
    great for the zombie or care taker in your halloween display!
stayed tuned for more updates!
we now are distributing a full line of froggy's fog fluid
