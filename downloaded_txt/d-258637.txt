welcome to www.thekennygallery.ie. we have been selling original works of art for over half a century. situated in galway, in the west of ireland, the kenny gallery specialise in contemporary irish art, exhibits the work of 19th and 20th century artists, and frequently hosts exhibitions by visiting artists from europe and the united states.
the gallery organises some eighteen solo and group exhibitions each year, including retrospectives, and we actively promote emerging talent. over the years we have showcased the work of emerging irish artists, many of whom have become household names. the works of jack yeats, paul henry, sean keating, george campbell, louis le brocquy, andy warhol, salvador dalí sidney nolan and many others have gone through the doors of kennys. in addition, we have an ongoing everchanging group show of several hundred works - oils, watercolours, sculpture, stained glass, ceramics, photography and graphics.
in recent years, the gallery has been commissioned by private individuals, companies and public institutions to decorate their homes and premises with art. a member of our consultation team can visit your home or place of business and advise on a stylish artistic layout to suit your environment. our time, advice and proposals are entirely free of charge.
