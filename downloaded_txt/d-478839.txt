wend (verb): to go in a specified direction, typically slowly or by an indirect route; to find one’s way.



wender is an international arts & performance collective with a decades-long history of generative experimentation.  originally a site-specific theater company in chicago known as “walkabout" with a dedicated laboratory ensemble focused on the creation of new works, wender is now a pluralistic collective engaged in various artistic, cultural, social and ecological actions in chicago and beyond (learn about our name change here).  as a group, we work to restore the confluences of these artificially-channelized streams of human activity, applying many years of shared somatic practice and inter-disciplinary performance research to cultivate enchantment through and beyond art.
