testimonials 










						“i have now been using the aerobika® opep, the aeroeclipse ii® ban and the ombra® compressor for a little over a year now and the results i have seen are almost dream worthy. i have never really known what it’s like to actually breathe close to a “normal” non cf patient. “					


john o. cuyahoga falls, ohio 






						“i can breathe deeper because it makes me use parts of my lungs that i have never had to use. “					


brad j.mendenhall, ms 






						“i think the thing i’ve noticed most is after i do my inhaled medications at night i have no rattling in my lungs when i go to bed.“					


tammy b.folsom, ca 






						“there’s funny little ways that it’s made a difference. i was coughing so hard and there was so much pressure in my lungs that i had to sleep sitting up. it was hard to go out walking my dog for example because i was so breathless. so i really find the device helps to clear my lungs, i've been able to lie down at night so that just in itself it is a very good thing because it's better rest.”					









						“it means better health, it means i feel better. it also helps to just clear my airways in everyday situations if i want to go out to a show which can be hard to do when you’re a cougher. i use this a lot before i go to clear my airways so i don’t have to run into that problem when i’m out.”					









						“the aerobika* opep device has proven to be more easy [sic] to use and monitor. we struggle to get my daughter to perform her chest therapy using the traditional [competitive] device. this has proven to be more effective.”					









						“i have had chronic cough for 5 years now. after just two uses i slept through the night without coughing several times during the night. i normally had severe long cough spells at least once a week…”
