student accessibility services (sas) views disabilities as an integral part of the rich diversity at the university of central florida. to that end, we work collaboratively with students, faculty, and staff to create an inclusive educational environment for students.
sas acknowledges that classroom and campus accessibility needs and considerations are expanding as more classes and campus experiences incorporate online and technological components. we are happy to discuss any course or campus barriers that may be preventing access to education and an equitable campus experience for students.
please use the links in the navigation bar above to learn more about the sas resources and processes or to contact our office.
