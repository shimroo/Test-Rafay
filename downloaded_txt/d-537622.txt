rolling, rolling! action! st. francisville stars in yet another movie production





rolling, rolling! action! st. francisville stars in yet another movie production
by anne butler
photos by bonnie marquette
pssssssst! wanna hear a secret? there’s a rumor going around, about that handsome devil kix brooks, alleging that he was seen in my bedroom… you know, shreveport native kix brooks, iconic country music star, soulful twang and trademark big black cowboy hat, one-half of grammy award-winning brooks & dunn, multiple recognitions as country music association’s duo of the year, singer-songwriter now also into acting, movie producing, wine making, radio show hosting, and a multitude of other ventures.

and yeah, it’s actually true! unfortunately i wasn’t present at the time, but it was all part of the most recent movie filming in st. francisville, a romance called “home by spring” set to air on the hallmark television channel march 31. besides brooks, who served as executive producer as well as actor (and yes, he did play his guitar and introduce a new song), other stars include delightful young london-based actress poppy drayton, plus mary-margaret humes and steven r. mcqueen who just happens to be the grandson of the late hollywood action star steve mcqueen. screenplay was written by brooks’ son.

filmed at butler greenwood plantation and other locations in the st. francisville area throughout the dreary cold month of february but featuring full-flowered spring settings, with wedding and reception scenes requiring colorful fresh flowers, the production crews spent hundreds of dollars at plant nurseries and florists throughout the st. francisville area on plants and floral arrangements. they also enriched the local economy with extensive purchases at hardware stores for building sets and props, antiques co-ops, gift shops, art rentals, service stations for gassing up the huge fleet of trucks and transportation vans, restaurants, markets and grocers for prepared prop foods. extras were also hired to appear in some scenes, like the wedding on the front lawn of butler greenwood and for the festival crowd in downtown st. francisville by the parish courthouse.

there were location rentals and overnight accommodations for a large crew…actors and directors, producers, production coordinators, script supervisors, camera crew, set lighting, grips, sound technicians, art department and set decorating, props, costumes, makeup, hair, casting, special effects, not to mention an on-site medic and caterer. staging for the large trucks and trailers was an additional expense, necessitating many loads of gravel in what seemed like incessant rain. movie scout bonnie marquette estimated total local movie spending at $1.8 million.

says laurie walsh, “they do contribute greatly to the community when they are filming here.” walsh, as director of the parish tourist commission and manager of the st. francisville main street program, serves as film liaison for both the parish as a whole and for inside the town limits. a no-fee film permit is required, as is insurance coverage. her involvement, she explains, is to assist location scouts in finding properties that fit their project needs, helping arrange scouting and reaching out to the property owners, then stepping out of the picture. she can also reach out to local accommodations to set up initial contacts when film crews need assistance with lodging. if public property or streets are to be used in filming, she helps facilitate that as well.
“we really act as a go-between and we do not get compensated or enter into any negotiations. but we see both direct and indirect impact of the movie footprint here when they rent locations, utilize overnight rooms, and reach out to the community for other goods and services.” among recent film projects walsh has worked with are gi joe 2, bonnie & clyde, magnificent 7, hap & leonard, kamp kool kids, starbright, the zoo, underground, blaze, backroads, jeepers creepers 3, oblivion, maze runner, beautiful creatures, nocturna, final girls, and “a bunch of commercials.”

with its picturesque preserved downtown district listed in its entirety on the national register of historic places, st. francisville is a little town that steps back in time very easily; throw a little dirt on the streets and you’re back in the 19th century. add to that the wealth of natural resources in the surrounding tunica hills, with terrain varying from steep hills and deep hollows, clear-running creeks with sandy beaches and towering bluffs, the mississippi river, historic plantations and formal gardens, and even that least-likely of tourist attractions the state penitentiary at angola, and the st. francisville area can provide just about any setting movie-makers are looking for. best of all, “home by spring” is actually using st. francisville’s name, promotion you couldn’t put a price on.

in 2013, louisiana was ranked number one in international film production, even above california. revisions capping the motion picture tax credit program in 2015 caused a drop-off of some 90%, after criticism of the tax program’s return on investment. but roi is what the state collects in taxes versus what is issued in tax credits, discounting the ancillary impacts, the trickle-down benefits. now the film industry is enjoying a steady comeback, because in 2017, according to the executive director of entertainment at louisiana economic development, legislative revisions have made the tax credit program more sustainable and have restored filmmakers’ confidence in it, plus adding incentives for permanent job creation, for local spending and for production throughout the state. in new orleans alone, three feature films and four television series are currently in production, with three other feature films having wrapped recently and two major features in preproduction. tom hanks is filming greyhound in baton rouge, a $50 million production, and other big productions are on location in other areas around south louisiana.

louisiana’s economic development secretary is excited by the uptick. “entertainment production is a good fit for louisiana’s creative culture and skilled workforce,” he said. “our entertainment program provides jobs and economic activity. for every dollar invested through entertainment tax credits, there is an economic impact of $4.68 across the louisiana economy.” not all legislators are on board; one metairie republican recently tweeted, “we divert more than $150 million a year away from important priorities like higher education so that we can see tom hanks in a restaurant.”

but to a little town like st. francisville, to see a celebrity like kix brooks dining at the francis or magnolia café or one of the other local restaurants doesn’t just give residents a thrill. it also means an awesome boost to the local economy, where $1.8 million spread among all the little businesses in town sure can help.
located on us highway 61 on the mississippi river between baton rouge, la, and natchez, ms, the st. francisville area is a year-round tourist destination. a number of splendidly restored plantation homes are open for tours: the cottage plantation (weekends), myrtles plantation, greenwood plantation, plus catalpa plantation by reservation; afton villa gardens is open in season and is spectacular. particularly important to tourism in the area are its two significant state historic sites, rosedown plantation and oakley plantation in the audubon state site, which offer periodic living-history demonstrations to allow visitors to experience 19th-century plantation life and customs.

the nearby tunica hills region offers unmatched recreational activities in its unspoiled wilderness areas—hiking, biking and especially bicycle racing due to the challenging terrain, birding, photography, hunting, and kayaking on bayou sara. there are unique art galleries plus specialty and antiques shops, many in restored historic structures, and some nice restaurants throughout the st. francisville area serving everything from ethnic cuisine to seafood and classic louisiana favorites. for overnight stays, the area offers some of the state’s most popular bed & breakfasts, including historic plantations, lakeside clubhouses and beautiful townhouses right in the middle of st. francisville’s extensive national register-listed historic district, and there are also modern motel accommodations for large bus groups.

st. francisville, la celebrates audubon & his birds march 16-18





st. francisville, la celebrates audubon & his birds march 16-18
 by anne butler

the forty-seventh annual audubon pilgrimage march 16, 17 and 18, 2018, celebrates a southern spring in st. francisville, the glorious garden spot of louisiana’s english plantation country. for nearly half a century the sponsoring west feliciana historical society has thrown open the doors of significant historic structures to commemorate artist-naturalist john james audubon’s stay as he painted a number of his famous bird studies and tutored the daughter of oakley plantation’s pirrie family, beautiful young eliza. a year’s worth of planning and preparation precedes each pilgrimage, and with 47 years of experience under their belt, society members put on one of the south’s most professional and enjoyable pilgrimage presentations. this year’s breath of fresh air comes from never-before-shown properties and enthusiastic new owners of old houses.

 one of this year’s featured country plantations is a remarkable house called woodland, a story of unexpected twists and turns, intergenerational connections and a fascinating trip all the way across the mighty mississippi to the ancestral lands of the present owner in west feliciana, a journey across hundreds of miles and two centuries. a grand greek revival house, woodland was built in the mid-1800s on a sugar plantation near the steamboat town of washington, but had been abandoned for years and was facing demolition when cammie and david norwood saved it. it took a year to prepare the old structure to be hauled circuitously along 375 miles of back roads and another several years to put it back together. now the woodland house has been returned to its original glory, filled with fine family furnishings and anchored to its pastoral site by well-planned landscaping, looking as if it has been there forever.

another country plantation home with a remarkable history is glorious greek revival greenwood, which has enjoyed more than its fair share of miraculous resurrections. its story began in 1798, when widowed olivia ruffin barrow journeyed by covered wagon to spanish feliciana. one of her grandsons would elope with young eliza pirrie, audubon’s pupil. in 1830 olivia’s son william ruffin barrow engaged prominent architect james coulter to build a fine home on family property that would grow to 12,000 acres.

 in 1915 frank and naomi fisher percy restored the house and opened it to the public. featured in magazines, visited by tourists and beloved by hollywood, it was called by national geographic the finest example of greek revival architecture in the south. but on the night of august 1, 1960, lightning started a fire and within three hours, there was nothing left but 28 doric columns and some free-standing chimneys. these ruins touched the hearts of walton barnes and his son richard, who purchased the house site and 278 acres in 1968 and began the enormous effort of rebuilding. in july 2016, along came new owners julie and hal pilcher, recently retired with the energy and enthusiasm to undertake significant improvements to ready the home for its first pilgrimage appearance.

an earlier country home also featured for the first time on the audubon pilgrimage this year is the cedars, its design and first cash crop—tobacco—bespeaking the virginia background of original owner simon hearty, for whom the property was surveyed beginning in 1790. the house was built between 1793 and 1795, and it was said that the artist john james audubon sketched the birdlife on cedars lane and visited with the family there. after thomas butler purchased the property from his mother-in-law in 1879, his two daughters, mamie and sarah, who stayed in new orleans after graduating from newcomb, returned as spinsters to spend weekends in a house enlarged with two-story octagonal additions; subsequent owners, the fred kings, raised a family in a home they too improved.

 today the cedars is houses a vibrant young family, the andrew grezaffis. they have filled it with an eclectic mixture of furnishings imparting the feel of having been lived in by generations of the same family, as all old homes should feel, although the grezaffis and their five small children have been in residence only a few years.

in historic downtown st. francisville are a couple of featured cottages across from the parish courthouse. miss lise’s cottage was originally built in bayou sara, the flood-prone port city on the banks of the mississippi river. in the late 1800s it was hauled up the hill into st. francisville, safe from the floodwaters, its two rooms home for the first “telephone girl” whose early switchboard was on the second floor of the nearby bank.

 until recently a conveniently located attorney’s office, now it puts the wow factor in this year’s pilgrimage and shows how adaptable these old structures can be in the right hands. the exterior facade retains the traditional creole cottage character. but oh, that unexpected interior-- all black and white and simply stunning, showing what happens when you turn loose a gifted career architect, jim dart, and a frustrated designer of equal talent, david anthony parker ii, on a charming little historic cottage, where the juxtaposition of antique and contemporary is stunning and a carefully curated collection of modern art strikes a happy balance with treasured family antiques.

some of the best-loved pieces descend from dart’s grandfather, an engineer and attorney whose law office next door to miss lise’s cottage is now home to kora, grezaffi and levasseur capital management (yes, the same grezaffi whose home the cedars is another pilgrimage feature). built in 1842, it has housed such notable barristers as uriah b. phillips who was blown up in a mid-1800s steamboat explosion, and louisiana’s last antebellum governor robert c. wickliffe.

 besides these featured historic structures, pilgrimage visitors are welcomed at afton villa gardens, rosedown and audubon state historic sites, three 19th-century churches in town and beautiful st. mary’s in the country, as well as the rural homestead with lively demonstrations of the rustic skills of daily pioneer life. audubon market hall hosts an impressive exhibit of more than sixty of audubon’s birds of america done in the felicianas, audubon state historic site features morning explorations of nature photography and birding programs (led by c.c. lockwood and dr. tom tully) augmented by a bird walk at oak hill (home of artist murrell butler). there will also be floral arranging demos, and this year the hills are alive with the sound of music as special performances are scheduled for each featured home and throughout downtown st. francisville in tribute to the late father of this year’s chairman. daytime features are open 9:30 to 5, sunday 11 to 4 for tour homes; friday evening activities are scheduled from 6 to 9 p.m., saturday soiree begins at 7 p.m.

 the historic district around royal street is filled during the day with the happy sounds of costumed children singing and dancing the maypole; in the evening as candles flicker and fireflies flit among the ancient moss-draped live oaks, there is no place more inviting for a leisurely stroll. friday evening features old-time hymn singing at the united methodist church, graveyard tours at grace episcopal cemetery (last tour begins at 8:15 p.m.), and a wine and cheese reception at bishop jackson hall (7 to 9 p.m.) featuring vintage dancers and young ladies modeling the pilgrimage’s exquisitely detailed 1820’s evening costumes, nationally recognized for their authenticity. light upthe night, the saturday evening soiree, features live music and dancing, dinner and drinks beginning at 7 p.m. for tickets and tour information, contact west feliciana historical society, box 338, st. francisville, la 70775; phone 225-635-6330 or 225-635-4224; online www.westfelicianahistory.org, email wfhistsociety@gmail.com. a package including daytime tours and all evening entertainment friday and saturday is available. tickets can be purchased at the historical society museum on ferdinand street.

other events planned for march in st. francisville include a walk in the park on saturday, march 3, from 9 to 4, bringing a festive gathering of musicians, artists and craftsmen to oak-shaded parker park.
 located on us highway 61 on the mississippi river between baton rouge, la, and natchez, ms, the st. francisville area is a year-round tourist destination. a number of splendidly restored plantation homes are open for tours: the cottage plantation (weekends), myrtles plantation, greenwood plantation, plus catalpa plantation by reservation; afton villa gardens and imahara’s botanical garden are open in season and are both spectacular. particularly important to tourism in the area are its two significant state historic sites, rosedown plantation and oakley plantation in the audubon state site, which offer periodic living-history demonstrations to allow visitors to experience 19th-century plantation life and customs.

steamboats & st. francisville: a match made in heaven
by anne butler

 “steamboat’s a’coming!” that excited cry from plantation landings and municipal wharves heralded the first sighting of one of the big, fancy floating palaces of the 19th century coming around the bend. traversing that era’s main transportation corridor--the mississippi river, the boats were lifelines to the world for isolated little communities, bringing news and mail, passengers, trade goods and fine furnishings, and picking up the all-important cotton crop for shipment to markets around the globe. all through the 1800s these vessels came and went, until the coming of the railroad and safer overland transportation options put them out of business.

but now, in the 21st century, that cry rings out once again in st. francisville. several companies operate fleets of attractive riverboats enticing passengers to cruise the lower mississippi river and rivers in other parts of the country as well. the little town of st. francisville welcomes them back with open arms, and not just for the nostalgic charm. while tugs and barges handle most of the commercial shipments along the river now, the steamboats and river cruises provide an economic boost to every little port city they visit.

 it’s a win-win situation. the well-travelled passengers come from all over the globe, but they all say that st. francisville’s charming downtown is one of their very favorite stops along the river. the entire downtown area is listed on the national register of historic places as a historic district, and it is also a main street community as well, participating in the national trust program designed to recognize significant early downtown areas across the country. over the years, the mix of residential and commercial structures has given st. francisville a 24-hour presence downtown, important in keeping it alive and vital, and visitors are impressed with its cleanliness and friendliness as well as its sense of place and appreciation of history.

the local tourist commission greets each arriving passenger at the landing below st. francisville’s bluff, providing a cheery welcome and a roomy canvas shopping bag with maps and discount coupons, stenciled with the town brand: “st. francisville: we love it here,” plus the admonition to fill it up! the motorcoaches that follow the boats on land offer continuous complimentary hop on hop off circuits throughout the downtown area, stopping at intervals so passengers (some days as many as 300!) can jump on and off to shop and tour.

st. francisville’s wonderful little shops say the boat customers mean the difference between surviving and thriving. with the advent of online shopping, overall retail stores across the country have suffered tremendous losses; in 2017 nearly 70,000 retail jobs disappeared and big-name department stores closed as did many malls. but surprisingly, the little independent retailers are seeing a resurgence of business. it’s the personal attention, unique inventory and proximity to other venues that have kept customers patronizing these mom-and-pop stores.

while shoppers will no doubt continue to get their cases of toilet paper from sam’s or costco, small downtown retailers across the country are proving the most resilient of brick-and-mortar survivors, according to one newspaper columnist who insists “main street shops (are) not dead yet.” books can be ordered online, sure, but indie book stores like the one in st. francisville can offer much more than a book, with author book signings, comfy seating for book club meetings, children’s programs, and personal recommendations. clothing can also be ordered online, but can it be tried on for fit, can the fabric be felt and the cut observed close-up, can the buyer look in the mirror and see if it actually lives up to the online promise as shown on a six-foot 100-pound professional model?

this year there are more than 100 steamboat stops scheduled for st. francisville. these upscale riverboats offer their passengers a cultural learning experience and a more relaxed way to travel than the enormous ocean-going cruise ships overflowing with rowdy young funseekers.

the american queen is the largest riverboat ever built, capable of hosting 400 guests in fine accommodations with onboard amenities like topnotch entertainment and a grand dining room with 20-foot ceilings. owned by the american queen steamboat company, the vessel actually can still use steam power. a second all-suite luxury vessel called the american duchess has joined the fleet this year, and one or the other of the aq boats will be stopping in st. francisville several times a week, offering not only hop on hop off shore excursions but also premium tours to sites of historic interest (outlying plantations or the louisiana state penitentiary, unlikeliest of tourist attractions but a fascinatingly different tour). in 2012 another organization, american cruise lines, launched the queen of the mississippi and then added the america and yet another boat, newest fleet of river cruise ships and paddlewheelers on the mississippi.

both of these, american queen steamboat company and american cruise lines, hire local guides whose knowledge of area history and attractions enhance the experience of visitors going on the premium tours and guided shore excursions. this expands the economic impact of riverboat passenger visits beyond the downtown shops, providing additional reward for area plantations and attractions as well as local residents serving as bus guides. additionally, the motorcoach drivers often spend the night as they follow the boats on land, providing income for local overnight accommodations, restaurants and gas stations.

st. francisville’s main street manager and tourist commission director comments that the influx of visitors from steamboats has had an extremely positive impact on the community. sales tax collections are up, and there is also the promise of future visits by boat passengers, who often return on their own for longer stays in an area they had time to enjoy only briefly on cruise stops. says one docent at the local historical society museum and visitor center, “the riverboat visits mean very good sales, and they love our town, just like we do.”
