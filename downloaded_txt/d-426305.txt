what we've been up to today! one of the reasons we love windsor windows, is because they stand by their warranty! these units were old enough that most companies would not have approved a warranty claim for slightly defective glass. these had some light hazing visible only in direct sun. but with windsor windows & doors, they sent us replacements free of charge, and zero hassle to get it. the homeowner is happy, and we're happy the replacements were exactly what we needed!

when working on our design, we were looking for a window that could provide an exterior look matching our intended modern aesthetic, but an interior projecting the traditional look of wood. the windsor product provided an exterior anodized option that complemented stainless steel shingle cladding, while the clear pine finish gave the interiors the desired warmth of wood.

we have been using windsor as our standard for the last 5 years. our company is well known for having standards that are higher than our competitors. we have been extremely pleased with the quality of the product, ease of operation, and service that we get from windsor and thompson windows & doors and would highly recommend both.

in our business, relationships are critical. that's why it's important to partner with a window company that understands and practices the same principle. windsor's quality, fit and finish of their product make it an easy choice for my builders. their product / customer support after the sale is crucial in performing well with my customers which makes windsor a clear choice for me.

we recently built a home, and after lots of comparing, we went with windsor windows! we absolutely love the look and quality of our windows. we were specifically looking for real wood, push out windows like we'd seen in europe. we found them with windsor.
