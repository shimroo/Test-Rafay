frequently asked questionsif you are unable to find the answer to your inquiry below, reach out to us via the contact form above.q:  what areas does property works service?a:  we specialize in properties in hendersonville, goodlettsville, madison, nashville, antioch, inglewood, bellevue, and hermitage.q: what are the requirements for obtaining a 18 month lease rate vs a 12 month lease rate?a:  when requesting an 18 month lease, you must provide funds for first and last month’s rent plus security deposit regardless of your credit score. if your credit score is less than 700, you must pay first and last month’s rent plus security deposit regardless of your length of lease.q:  how do i find out which properties are available?a:  please visit the residences section and look for the word available. specific availability dates are also listed. if there are currently no available properties but you would like to learn about those that will be available in the near future, please call our office at 615-500-3741, or email us at propertyworks@comcast.net.q:  how do i view a property?a:  call our office, send us an email, or fill out the contact form below, and we will set up a private property showing for you.q:  what are your standard rental requirements?a:  the most important requirements are a one-year verifiable rental history and 90-day employment history with current employment information.q:  will you perform a thorough check if i apply for a rental property?a:  yes. you must fill out an application form. if you use the online application, please fill the form out completely. we will check the information you provide on the application, including past and current rental history, current employment, and your credit.please note: the initial online application on our website is free! the standard $50 credit application processing fee will apply only after we progress further with the actual rental process, and will be processed only with your permission (should you choose to fill out our online application). we will never process an application or charge a fee without permission from our applicants.q:  do you run a credit check on every applicant?a:  we do run a credit check on all our applicants, even when your credit is good. this process is necessary and a benefit to our applicants, as a credit check can sometimes uncover incorrect or outdated information in your credit report that you may wish to address.q:  what about bankruptcy?a:  if you are currently in bankruptcy, we unfortunately cannot rent to you. if you have a previous bankruptcy, but have since firmly re-established your good credit, we are willing to be flexible. please call us directly for consultation.q:  what about pets?a:  pets are not allowed in most of our properties. a select few of our properties do allow either one cat or one small dog, with a one-pet maximum. unfortunately, we cannot allow a large dog, (25 lbs. maximum), and never do we allow puppies or kittens.pets will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. if your pet is authorized, there will be a mandatory $500 refundable pet deposit and an additional $25 - $50 monthly charge.please note: if you have an unauthorized pet in your residence, you will forfeit your security deposit, and you will be required to also pay the pet deposit even if your pet was not initially approved. this policy applies whether the animal was present for thirty seconds or thirty days. under no condition can an unauthorized pet enter the property.q:  what about smoking?a:  we have a smoking fine of $1000 that is nonrefundable for anyone who chooses to allow smoking of any sort inside or outside the rental unit. the reason for this policy is that the smell of smoke penetrates all wood surfaces, paint, and carpets. this requires additional time, labor, and material to clean and repaint your residence upon vacancy.therefore, this policy is enforced for any tenant who allows any smoking inside their residence or on the property grounds. this includes, friends, family, guests, etc. if you are a smoker, or nonsmoker, and do not wish to pay the $1000 fine, please do not allow smoking inside or outside your residence. if you choose not to pay the fee initially but later allow smoking, you will be charged the $1000.please be advised that the $1000 fine does not include the repairs for any damages such as cigarette burns in carpets, countertops, flooring, etc. it only applies to the required de-fumigation painting upon move-out.q: what about roommates, visitors, and subleasing?a: roommates will be subject to the same move-in procedures, background checks, and requirements as our primary tenants. roommates may not move in without prior written permission. property works must conduct a thorough check and issue its approval. subleasing is never allowable for any reason. any visitors staying more than 72 total hours in any 30-day period require written authorization. a completed application with criminal background check must be on file prior to approval. immediate relatives are an exception for short stays with prior approval.q:  do you rent month-to-month?a:  no. all of our properties are available only by leases of six months or longer. we have lease terms of 6 months, 12 months, or 18 months. certain exceptions apply but only for real estate professionals who partner with us on referrals and commissions. please note: your rent will increase by the minimum of $200/mo (refer to your lease) at the end of your lease if you do not renew.q:  how do i apply for a property?a:  call our office at 615-500-3741 or email us at propertyworks@comcast.net, and we will set up a private property showing for you. if you have not previously mailed or faxed us the online application, you will need to fill out the application form and pay the non-refundable $50 credit application fee.the normal turnaround time for an application is three days. at that time, we will contact you with additional requirements that may vary depending on the property.q:  once approved, what day does the rent begin?a:  at the time of approval of your application, you will put down the security deposit, sign the lease, and become responsible for rent from the first day of your lease through the end of the lease term. regardless of whether or not you move in immediately, you must start paying the rent and take responsibility for the security of the property.q:  is my holding deposit refundable?a:  in the event the application for residency is not approved or accepted, or if the residence is not ready for occupancy on or before agreed move-in date, the holding deposit will be returned to the applicant.however, if the applicant is approved, the applicant agrees to a move-in date, and the property is removed from the market, and the applicant then fails to sign the rental agreement, fails to provide the additional funds required for occupancy, or does not take occupancy on the agreed upon scheduled move-in date, the holding deposit will be forfeited. you will also be charged a $250 processing fee for account setup, lease preparation, and documentation.the holding deposit shall be applied toward the security deposit or rent when the rental agreement is signed.q: is a personal check acceptable for my first month's rent and the security deposit?a:  no. the first month's rent (including any pro-rated days), and all deposits (security and pets) must be presented in certified funds. after the first month, you may pay your rent in personal check, money order, or cashier's check. if you pay rent with paypal, you must include the 3% fee in addition to the amount owed. not including the 3% will cause a shortage, and you will be charged a 10% late fee.q:  if i want to buy a home, can i use property works as my realtor?a: yes. note that if you break your lease, you will be responsible for the breaking of the lease penalty. this includes a two month's rent cancellation fee, short rate fee, and forfeiture of deposit. this is very expensive.if you use our licensed real estate agent at property works as your realtor, we can apply our commission toward all the costs associated with breaking your lease, which will erase all your fees associated with breaking of your lease. you are welcome to use any realtor you choose, but you will be responsible for the broken lease cost. since the seller is paying for the commission to the buyer's agent, it is in your best interest to use a licensed agent with property works.q: can i transfer my lease to another property works property?a: yes. #1. you are responsible to allow showings to prospective new tenants to fulfill your lease obligations. #2.your deposit will be applied to making any necessary repairs or cleanings to restore the property to its original move in condition.  #3.your remaining deposit will be applied to your new deposit requirements. #4. you
