florida's 75% recycling goal







the state of florida has established a recycling goal of 75%, indicating the state’s commitment to minimizing solid waste streams entering landfills. of the 50.7 million tons of municipal solid waste generated in florida in 2022, organics, including food waste, yard waste and other paper, composed 25.3% of the total. recycling rates for organics across the state include food waste at only 6%, yard waste at 59% and other paper at 8%. as a major contributor to municipal solid waste entering landfills in florida, organics recycling is incredibly essential to reach the state’s 75% goal. for an update on the status of this goal, please visit the link provided in green on this page.
rerouting the organics waste stream to recycling centers has several environmental benefits including: diverting organic waste from incineration and landfill, treatment of pathogenic organisms, stabilization of nutrients and other organic compounds and phosphorus recycling. recycled organics can also be used to help soil control erosion, retain moisture, improve texture, improve ecology, and increase organic matter content, as well as aiding with the production of alternate fuels.
for more information on this program, please visit the florida department of environmental protection’s (fdep) website.
