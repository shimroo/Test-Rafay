there was a kiss reference on bbc's richard osman's house of games earlier today. it was from the "is it spaniel craig?" round where the 1st answer rhymes with the 1st word of the 2nd.
there's also been a few kiss questions on the latest season of never mind the buzzcocks.
not sure about the mirrored image though...

kiss have a great new fan curated kiss playlist available on spotify & youtube, the first one has been created by matt porter of the kiss room. full details can be found below!from kiss:first official fan-curated kiss playlist is live!the hidden hits playlist is an official kiss playlist curated by fans, where a dedicated fan is given the chance to select songs from the legendary kiss catalog and create their own personalized playlist. this approach of allowing fans to curate official playlists is intended to be a recurring initiative.
the first curator is matt porter, one of the most well-known kiss fans out there. as the founder of the kiss room—a podcast, facebook group, and community—matt is deeply embedded in the kiss fanbase.
now, matt has been given a fun challenge: to create an official fan-curated kiss playlist. his selection showcases kiss tracks that he feels deserve more recognition—songs he loves that aren’t played often enough, and ones that should have been hits.
the playlist is live on spotify and youtube now!
