special project















more than 80% of teachers in the u.s. are white. but most don’t know that their whiteness matters.teaching while white (tww) seeks to move the conversation forward on how to be consciously, intentionally, anti-racist in the classroom. because "white" does not mean a blank slate. it is a set of assumptions that is the baseline from which everything is judged; it is what passes for normal. tww wants to have conversations about those assumptions: what they are, how they impact our students, and how we can confront our bias to promote racial literacy.
