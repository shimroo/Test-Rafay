chilled and frozen dog semen for sale
fresh and frozen semen is available for every dog breed on canine semen.com. for pets, excellent knowledge about artificial insemination in dogs, such as estrus in bitches, sperm motility and fertility, ultrasound and pregnancy management.

semen collection
semen collection for routine analyses, fertility work-ups and breeding, is available for pets. all the instruments are also available for reproduction.

tests for progesterone
dog owners worried about their pet’s fertility often test their progesterone levels. if a dog is in heat, the amount of semen ready for fertilization may be determined by progesterone levels. progesterone levels might also signify other health issues, such as uterine cancer. it’s simple to keep track of your dog’s health and fertility by checking their progesterone levels.

ultrasound scan
an ultrasonic scan is a minimally invasive medical treatment that produces pictures of organs and tissues using high-frequency sound waves. dogs are often screened with ultrasounds for illnesses, including tumors or cardiac issues. an ultrasound scan will assist you in promptly identifying and treating any problems your dog may be experiencing if he exhibits any symptoms.

fertility is recovered
a series of procedures known as assisted reproductive technologies provide a variety of choices for breeding animals that have had trouble conceiving or sustaining pregnancy after normal breeding management using conventional breeding approaches. these canine’ issues may be discovered with a fertility examination by a theriogenologist or reproductive expert. your primary care veterinarian discusses a strategy for treating these subfertile or infertile animals.

reproductive potential enhancement
assisted reproductive services are also offered to increase the breeding potential of breeding (and reproductively healthy) animals. for animals with demanding competition/show schedules that need to maintain regular training/conditioning, semen freezing or embryo transfer are viable solutions. with frozen or chilled semen, female dogs are artificially sexed anywhere in the nation

semen analysis
to assess the reproductive potential and identify infertility in dogs, cutting-edge technology for computer-assisted sperm analysis is available.

shipments of sperm
many of our patients who are stud dogs have asked for the transmission of frozen sperm to a bitch in another city. after a collection, the semen is diluted in a commercial semen extender before being sent to other locations. the shipments are often dispatched overnight for the female’s veterinarian to get the semen. before packing, an evaluation is done, and results are sent to the stud owner and the bitch.

semen freezing
we can freeze sperm here and keep it on-site for a long time for usage or transportation in the future. one day each month is set out for the voluntary freezing of healthy animals. if a more urgent requirement arises on a different day, semen might be frozen. the semen will be collected and examined for quality, as with the regular semen assessment sessions. if declared of excellent quality, it may be diluted and refrigerated in special extenders before freezing. we assess every sample after freezing since the quality of the samples varies after processing. if properly cared for, frozen semen should endure for hundreds of years. after many years of cryopreservation, the dog has successfully produced a litter.
canine semen may be preserved using cryopreservation technology. semen may be kept or sent for a longer period if it is frozen. soon, we want to provide semen freezing for animals.

surgical, laparoscopic, or hysteroscopic insemination
depending on the species (dogs or cats), depositing the semen into the uterus has been proven to boost conception rates when straws of frozen semen are few or when there are few sperm available.

research
the reproduction program’s research is focused on three areas:

applying assisted reproduction techniques
pharmacological modification of estrous cycles and synchronisation of estrus
investigating infertility in dogs

insemination
assisted natural breeding: for individuals in good reproductive health who need little “assistance,” assisted natural breeding is a wonderful option. differences in experience or size may sometimes impact the animals’ capacity to reproduce independently. a competent breeder can often handle this at home, although some owners prefer professional help.

vaginal artificial insemination
this technique simulates the semen accumulation in the cranial vagina during natural breeding. this is suitable for freshly collected or refrigerated (delivered) semen and is best for a male and female with strong fertility.

trans-cervical insemination
the maximum chance of pregnancy for the animal is achieved through trans-cervical insemination, which inserts the semen into the uterus. the upright dog’s cervix is catheterized after a tiny endoscope with a camera is inserted into her body. through the catheter, the semen is introduced into the uterus. this approach may maximize results in our fertile patients and subfertile canines and frozen semen.

surgical insemination
in terms of where the semen is placed, surgical insemination is comparable to trans-cervical. the whole surgical procedure includes general anesthesia, shaving of the abdominal region, and an abdominal incision. a tiny catheter is used to insert the semen into the uterus. despite the possibility of success, we often do not advise choosing the surgical option for insemination owing to its intrusiveness. this type of insemination has been banned in the uk .

artificial insemination for dogs
artificial insemination is a process utilized to facilitate the reproduction of dogs without natural mating. the technique involves the collection of semen from a stud dog which, depending on the methodology employed, is placed into a bitch’s uterus or vagina. breeders may decide to use artificial insemination due to its various advantages, including the possibility for two dogs living in disparate locations to breed, eliminating the stress of travel and minimizing transportation expenses. it also opens up new avenues for introducing genes from a different country into a dog population to enhance particular traits and improve genetic diversity in a breed.
moreover, it allows dogs that had specific desirable traits and have since passed away to contribute to the gene pool. additionally, it prevents the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  (stds) . however, the procedure comes with some risks and ethical concerns such as infection or complications. this can be particularly problematic if the ai is conducted by a novice.
to avoid the introduction of undesirable traits or hereditary diseases, it is critical to ensure that dogs undergo testing for breed-specific health conditions before using artificial insemination. continued reliance on artificial methods of conception could also be problematic, particularly when dogs that cannot mate naturally are repeatedly subjected to the procedure. using artificial insemination in such instances would mean that these dogs will pass on their genes to their offspring, perpetuating the problem and potentially compromising the health and welfare of future dogs. 
three types of semen can be used in artificial insemination: fresh, fresh chilled, and frozen semen. fresh semen is employed when the bitch and the stud dog are in close proximity to each other. chilling semen allows for the prolongation of its storage, meaning it can be transported over a more extended period than fresh semen. freezing the semen, generally in liquid nitrogen, allows for extended storage, but this could affect the sperm’s viability when defrosted.
there are three types of artificial insemination: trans-vaginal or intra-vaginal insemination, transcervical insemination, and surgical insemination. trans-vaginal insemination is the most common technique and the least invasive. it involves the insertion of fresh or chilled semen into the bitch’s vagina using an insemination pipette. trained professionals should only perform this procedure. transcervical insemination is a more invasive technique where semen is inserted directly into the uterus using a catheter and/or an endoscope. any type of semen can be used for this method, and a veterinary surgeon must perform it. surgical insemination– this type of insemination has been banned in the uk.          why canine artificial insemination is getting more popular
