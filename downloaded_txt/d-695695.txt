what people say










heidi schuldt samson
my kids are loving going to school here. we drive from lakeland every day which is 70 miles round trip because this school is so great! they are college bound and are learning everything to know so they are prepared. the teachers love the kids. also, they learn about jesus and how important it is to live for him. again the staff demonstrates this not only at school but also in their personal lives!

i have been at grace for 5 years and could not have asked for a better home for my children. my oldest graduates in 12 days. i have 6 more years to go with my other 2. not only have they grown academically but spiritually. the teachers and faculty really love the children as their own.

we are so thankful to have found grace. my son was in a public middle school and just not happy. we moved him mid year, 7th grade. i worried that he would be even more miserable with such an untimely move but he has excelled. he's happy, and loving again. our plan originally was to just move our kids (we have five) as they get to middle school, but this place is so amazing we are moving them all in the fall. so excited for our kids' futures. love every staff member i've met. proud to be a new member of this grace family.
