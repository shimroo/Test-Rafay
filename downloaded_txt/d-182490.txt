graduation party announcement that ends with a bang
as your child prepares for graduation, why not consider something fun & loud to celebrate the occassion. purchase a large number of party poppers from your local party or department store, make sure you have enough for every guest. as a group, announce the name of the graduate and have your guests pull the strings (upward and away from faces); the loud pop and falling confetti will enhance the announcement and make a fun memory.

pick a date, any date - but pick it early
if you are considering a halloween party this year, make sure to pick your date and get your invites out early. halloween is a popular holiday for hosting parties. if you are planning to host one for your children and one for your adult friends, be sure to book the dates early. it is best to have the two parties on two seperate dates, or you will be too exhausted to enjoy the adult party when your turn to celebrate finally arrives. once you have chosen your dates, immediately send out the invitations. this will insure that you won't go to all the work of planning a party, only to have your guests have other committments.

spring has sprung~ time to get ready for the summer barbeque
if you are finally getting done with your spring cleaning, now is the time to get ready for the summer parties that await you.
watch for sales on paper products, soda pop and chips. check "sell by" dates to make sure that the items you purchase now will still be ready when the party gets started. shopping sales now, makes it easy to host lots of summer fun.

											what is important to remember when planning party games for kids?
									 	

when planning games, remember your age group
it is important when planning a party to focus on the ages of the invitees. what may seem like an extremely simple game to an adult could prove to be quite complicated to a small child. remember that the simple, repetative games are often the most popular for kids because they are familiar with the routine and experience a high success rate. the party games should focus on enjoyment for the entire group and not only on providing competition for one or two winners.
