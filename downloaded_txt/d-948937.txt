the leader in youth basketball tournaments and camps
the united states basketball association (usba) was founded in 2005. since then the usba has been the leader in grassroots basketball tournaments and camps for boys and girls of all ages across the united states, canada, and puerto rico. it’s our goal to develop young people and equip them with skills that will help them advance both on and off the court. fair play, sportsmanship, solid teaching, and hands-on instruction are all hallmarks of our usba programs. we believe the game of basketball has a direct impact on our young people’s lives.
