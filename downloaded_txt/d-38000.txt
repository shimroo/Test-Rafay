structurae – international database and gallery of structures
since 1998 structurae has been providing bridge, civil and structural engineers with information on the design and construction of construction projects from around the world including profiles on the companies and individuals involved as well as product descriptions. by now the site has grown into a unique information network and research tool for practising engineers and students majoring in civil and structural engineering but also for architects and other professionals in the construction industry.



database and gallery of structures and large-scale projects
with more than 84 000 projects listed from around the world structurae has one of the largest 
project database specifically for works of bridge, civil and structural engineering. 
aside from typical engineering structures like bridges and viaducts, 
dams, towers and masts, 
underground structures including tunnels 
as well as offshore and marine structures, the database also contains structurally important and complex 
buildings and works of architecture such as skyscrapers, 
stadiums, railway 
stations, etc. the collection of projects covers all kinds of materials used in construction like iron and steel, wood, membranes, glass or 
concrete with or without reinforcing or prestressing as well as stone and brick masonry structures. new materials like carbon fibres and composite 
materials consisting of several of the aforementioned are of course also included. the historical aspect is also considered as the database not only 
includes current projects but also structures and monuments built in the past as their maintenance and continued use is an important aspect of 
contemporary engineering. wherever possible technical data is made available for each structure as well as information on companies and individuals 
involved in design or construction; print and on-line references are listed as references and sources for more detailed information.


listing of companies and engineering offices in the construction sector
structurae is an ideal platform for companies in the construction sector from around the globe to present and market themselves and their products. 
engineering consultancies, contractors, manufacturers of construction materials and products, developers of structural analysis or cad software but also architecture practices and other design firms are listed. thus structurae is a unique communications platform for industry experts and leaders for the construction sector. structurae also makes it possible for companies to display their reference projects and their exact manner of participation in them to other experts in the field.


products and services for the construction sector
through the product and services listing available on structurae, companies and consultants can describe in detail which products and service they they offer. both purely technical product descriptions are available but also case studies explaining the succesful application of individual products on a specific project or type of structure that illustrate in a very practical manner how e.g. software, bearings or prestressing systems are applied.


biographies for engineers, builders and architects
aside from the companies involved, structurae also includes biographies of bridge, civil and structural engineers, master builders and architects who are presently active or were in the past. important known and historic names such as gustave eiffel, isambard kingdom brunel, thomas telford or robert maillart can be found but also lesser known individuals from around the world who contributed as engineers, designers, builders or architects to one of the projects.


geographic guide to civil/structural engineering
the project database of structurae currently contains structures on every continent of the world – including antarctica – and which can also be found via geographic browsing. this geographic guide also includes the office locations of the listed companies and firms as well as where engineers, builders and architects were born or died. if the geographic coordinates are known, the structures are shown on interactive maps of the various cities and towns available in every country.


catalog and repository of expert literature in construction
structurae's literature catalog includes bibliographic data and abstracts to journal articles, books and other media from a wide number of publishers and many different languages. wherever these offer additional information for structures, companies or persons that information is interlinked across the website. a select number of conference papers, articles and theses are available to my structurae users as full-text pdf downloads.
