precision that pinpoints opportunity.

find a mutual fund 






proven specialists in global small- to mid-cap investing
the investment team at oberweis has established its record of success using academically documented market inefficiencies to identify investable opportunities globally.



unwavering focus drives our best ideas
we believe smaller companies are the key to sustainable portfolio growth, whether that growth comes from innovation or the market’s mispricing of a company’s true potential value.



targeting tomorrow’s potential
having a disciplined and repeatable investment process sharpens our focus on buying overlooked stocks at valuations that don’t yet reflect their full earnings potential or value.



the expert’s expert
our deep knowledge of global small-cap and mid-cap companies guides our highly focused, qualitative evaluation of each company’s business prospects and its underlying valuation.








capitalize on the opportunity presented by innovative companies around the world.
