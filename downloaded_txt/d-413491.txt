dr. paneri
specialist of parkinson
ayurveda is the system of
                    traditional medicine in india. it is based on many centuries of experience in medical practice,
                    handed down through generations. composed of two sanskrit words, "ayu" or life, and "veda" or
                        knowledge, ayurveda is regarded as "the science of life" and the practice involves
                    the care of physical, mental and spiritual health of human beings. ayurveda is also based on sound
                    ecological awareness of the place of animals, birds and plants in relation to human life. the time
                    honored, well tested ancient formulas of ayurvedic medicines use natural herbs, minerals and even
                    gems, to cure disease and to promote immunity and there are no deadly experiments on animals in the
                    lab.




levodopa is the primary western medicine for parkinson's
                            disease. levodopa produces strong side effects that include:


  it appears
                                    that the side effects of levodopa bear an uncomfortable resemblance to the symptoms
                                    of parkinson's disease that it is intended to treat, which raises the question â if
                                    levodopa is missing from the system, why does it exacerbate the parkinson condition
                                    itself?


  ayurveda
                                    has effectively treated and cured parkinson's disease for thousands of years.
                                    through a combination of intensive research, ancient ayurvedic sources, and the
                                    clinical experiences at the sharma ayurveda clinic, dr. mukesh paneri, a 5th
                                    generation ayurvedic physician, has created ayurvedic formulas and drugs for the
                                    treatment of parkinson's. dr. mukesh paneri personally formulates and prepares his
                                    own ayurvedic medicines. these compounded ayurvedic formulae may be adjusted if they
                                    produce minor effects such as occasional constipation and mild dizzy spells in the
                                    early phase of treatment, but such minor possible side effects are not
                                    contra-indicative of a cure. unlike western medicines, dr. paneri's treatment has
                                    cured patients completely from parkinson's disease.
