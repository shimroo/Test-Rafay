we contacted nevin for assistance with cleaning furniture that had been stored in a home where people smoked, and he was so knowledgeable and helpful. he cleaned everything thoroughly, and we are thrilled with the quality of the services provided. he was also very responsive, professional, and kind. i highly recommend this cleaning service. it's the most thorough job i've ever seen done for furniture and area rugs. thank you!








deb hassinger


nevin's carpet cleaning service is fantastic! my light beige carpets had many pet stains on it where my older cat had gotten sick. i had tried cleaning the areas but was unsuccessful. nevin was able to get all of the stains cleaned along with my entire home. my carpets look brand new. he cleaned them 2 years ago and now this year. he was quick but thorough and explaining everything. i highly recommend his services and won't hesitate to call him again.








maria berna


we have a large carpet that several companies have tried to clean and only partially succeeded. red hot carpet cleaning did an excellent job at actually getting it clean and looking fresh. they also cleaned the grout in the kitchen and bathroom and did a superior job. they were professional, on time and responsive to my concerns. i would highly recommend them.

maintain your carpet and upholstery in between professional cleanings. it's generally recommended to have your carpets professionally cleaned at least once a year. however, the frequency can vary based on several factors:

household size: homes with larger families or more foot traffic may need more frequent cleaning, potentially every 6-12 months.
pets and children: if you have pets or young children, consider cleaning every 6 months, as they can contribute to more dirt and stains.
allergies or respiratory issues: for individuals with allergies or respiratory conditions, more frequent cleaning can help reduce allergens and improve air quality. cleaning every 3-6 months may be beneficial.
smoking: homes with smokers may need more frequent cleaning to remove odors and residue.
color and type of carpet: light-colored carpets and certain materials may show dirt more easily and may require more frequent cleaning.
regular professional cleaning helps maintain the appearance and longevity of your carpets, removes deep-seated dirt, and improves indoor air quality.
