the best candy factory

in the heart of the blue ridge mountains is a small mountain community where pride in accomplishment is still important. this is the home of my candy factory. with the help of caring neighbors, we make the greatest tasting fudge, chocolates and truffles. using the finest chocolate, fresh cream and butter and a little extra patience, i developed my original recipe for creamy fudge, decadent truffles, homestyle chocolates and lots more. folks say our candy is the best they’ve ever had. come visit us and shop our factory candy store – you’ve never seen so many luscious chocolates, mouth- watering fudges, artisan truffles and handmade candies. and at factory prices!
