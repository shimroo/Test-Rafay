																	is popcorn ceiling removal worth it?															

popcorn ceiling might sound like a new trend for modern properties. well, that is not the case. the truth is that it’s an extremely old ceiling design that is quickly fading. however, there are still a couple of homes that have popcorn ceilings. 

if you’re reading this article, chances are that you’ve got a popcorn ceiling and you’re probably thinking about reading it.  
before you proceed, you should ask yourself if it is worth the cost. the short answer is yes. removing your popcorn ceiling is extremely worth it. 
today, we’re going to share with you several reasons why stipple ceiling removal is worth it. 
better design for your property 
many years ago, popcorn ceilings were extremely popular that they became the standard. unfortunately, that is not the case today. homeowners are now adopting a modern design for their interiors.

so, if you’re planning to upgrade the interior design of your home, it’s a wise move to remove the popcorn ceiling as well.  
create more space 
popcorn ceilings provide the illusion of a puffed-up ceiling. this means that it gives your ceiling a look that appears lower than it is. because of the material’s nature, it makes the room look smaller and more cramped. of course, it’s not the best look to have if you’ve got a small house.  
getting rid of the popcorn ceiling and replacing it with a flatter option can make your ceiling look higher and less cramped. if you make your ceiling look higher, it will give the room a more spacious and open feel. it also makes the ceiling cleaner.  
thus, if you’ve got a small house and want to make it look bigger, consider removing the popcorn ceiling.  
better lighting 
popcorn ceilings create small craters that produce tiny shadows. that is why they are called “popcorn” ceilings. unfortunately, this effect is not good since it causes less light in the room.  
popcorn ceilings can make a room appear gloomy. to get rid of the shadows, you need to remove the popcorn ceiling. this will help you ensure that the light bounces off a flat surface to cover more of the room. 
better light provides the room with more ambiance. it becomes a lot simpler for you to set the mood with artificial or natural lighting whenever you are not fighting shadows.  
typically, getting rid of the popcorn ceiling is a tricky matter. this is particularly true if you’re living in a modern house. there are inconveniences you have to consider. this includes the possibility of health issues, the financial burden, and the time investment.  
however, it’s still worth it to remove popcorn ceilings. if you want to improve the interior appeal of your home, your best bet is to remove popcorn ceilings. this is especially true if you’re having issues with maintenance, unpleasant look, and bad lighting.  
however, getting rid of the popcorn ceiling will only be worth it if you hire a professional to do the job for you.

6. old beach accessories 
your sand pails and shovels can break down over time. this also applies to your old umbrellas and lawn chairs or swings. when you have materials like broken plastic, it is important to check which type of plastic materials they are made of before taking them to the recycling center. or, you can be creative and use them as house and garden designs.
