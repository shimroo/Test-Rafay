it is time to admit seminaries are what they are . . . businesses.





over at gentle reformation, president york of rpts seminaryresponds to carl trueman’s lecture about “follow the money” given at a
convocation at westminster seminary california. 
trueman lists some problems, but he states them as descriptions as
well.  ultimately, trueman is trying to
argue for a greater catholicity among the reformed seminaries, and i think this
is where both york and trueman fail to completely understand the basic nature
of the seminary as a business.  trueman
openly admits that it is a business, but also says it is a “spiritual
organization”.  he offers no proof for
that nor does he state how the two interact other than occasionally saying that
the business part militates against the spiritual part.  



york doesn’t outright deny the business nature of the
seminary, but does seem to think seminaries can operate against the unwritten
rules of business.  he argues that
non-hostile competition is healthy.  york’s
point is that one can learn from the other seminaries good points and
benefit.  but is business competition
ever really “non-hostile”?  



the answer is no. 
there is a small pool of reformed students, and they are going to choose
one seminary above another.  the minor
difference marketing that dr. trueman opposes or feels unfortunate (and york
agrees) is simply a fact of life.  it
must happen or the seminary will not thrive. 
trueman’s main application to read more broadly including journals from
other seminaries is really not an answer to the problem, but a symptom of
it.  seminaries have journals in order to
promote the minor difference, to communicate the ethos of the seminary.  it is the seminary’s version of “publish or
die” from the secular academic word.  



york’s response to this with a call to build collegiality
among seminaries and promoting the strengths of other seminaries is
pie-in-the-sky fantasy.  after all if you
have a pool of 10 students and you tell them all how great the other seminary
is, then you should expect to lose all 10 students.  trueman may be right that businesses don’t ‘rubbish’
the competition, but they don’t talk up the competition either.  can anyone imagine wendy’s talking about how
great burger king’s fries are?  bud light
doesn’t talk about how miller light makes beer with corn syrup so that lovers
of corn can see where to go to get a different beer, but to take away miller
light’s buyers.  there can be no real
collegiality between those in competition. 
and competition is healthy, but not really non-hostile since the stakes
are always going out of business and fading away.  



the complaints about seminary are good to hear from someone
like dr. trueman.  the call to follow the
confessions rather than the teaching of the seminaries is laudable.  but, as trueman admits seminaries shape the
student much more than denominations do. 
and there in is the problem.  the
denomination is the church, but has little influence.  the seminary is a business, and ends up
shaping the future of the church.  so, it
was disappointing that trueman, as a historian, stopped so short and fail to
take that next obvious step.  it is time
to end seminaries.



the church after all existed and thrived for centuries prior
to seminaries.  pastors trained future
pastors, and denominations examined them, sometimes sent them to other pastors,
and the church carried on.  in this way,
the need to meet the payroll is removed. 
the business aspect is gone.  the
denomination is back in control.  why do
we bother merge business with a spiritual mission?  why is the church handing off training to
businesses?  



the parsonage model answers all the problems dr. trueman
raises.  it avoids the inbreeding
thinking that has helped create divisions from insiders (he mentions enns and shepherd).  it protects the local church.  it places the confessions back in the center
and minimizes the minor difference.  it
forces prospective pastors to serve in the local church.  it avoids the problem of debt and of mission
creep into the realm of church (york sees this as a positive, but i agree with
trueman it is a negative).  it is in the
business of the kingdom of christ.  all
of the problems go away.  



it is time to see seminaries for what they are . . . businesses.  and it is time to stop using businesses to
train pastors.

civility is not coming back




we live in a day of uncivil discourse.  hate and contempt along with blame and name
calling are the norm.  you will find
people calling for civility in discussion and discourse.  those people are relics of the past who no
longer understand the world we live in. 
yes, civility is dead.  and it is
never coming back.



allow me to explain.



in the past, civility was part of the expectation of
participation in the public discourse. 
when a person lost civility, even if the point he was making was good
and valid, he was rebuked for being uncivil and speaking wrongly.  even machiavelli was against threats and
insulting language, even if it was for self-serving reasons.  somewhere that changed.  and it changed because the humanity of the
opponent was taken away.  the opponent is
sub-human somehow (usually through a position they hold or believe), and that
status makes his worthy of scorn and contempt, and soon much, much more.  the opponent now is a target worthy of hate.



please understand, all is acceptable if the target is worthy
of hate.  after all, do you really have
to be nice to the devil?  shouldn’t you
kill hitler if you went back in time?  so
now, you can punch a person unprovoked in the face, if the guy is a nazi.  you can say horrible things to people, if
that person is horrible to begin with.  this
is how actions are now justified, not on the basis of the action in comparison
to an objective standard, but on the basis of the recipient of the action.  this extends beyond simple words, but even to shootings.  



the result is a vicious cycle.  in order to make sure one’s actions continue
to be justified, part of the goal then is to continue to demonize the
target.  because if the target becomes
accepted by the masses or somehow is humanized, then all of your actions that
were previously justified are now all unacceptable.  this could in turn make you viewed as a
target worthy of hate, and thus all someone else’s actions against you would
now be justified.  so, there is never
room to stop and talk as equals or what used to be called “being civil”.  such an idea would tend toward making actions
against that person unjustified and could create a situation that endangered me
if the tide of opinion turned against me. 




don’t think i am just talking about politics.  this is everywhere in life.  everywhere. 
there is a minor scandal in the comic book industry about how people handle those who do not like
their stories.  one creator tried to
start a hashtag #comicsceasefire and got massive backlash.  a liberal msnbc and vanity fair editor spoke
up when a comic creator wished a critic had died in afghanistan, and was amazedat the level of hate he received for speaking up. 



do i need to even remind anyone about sports now?  but even just stating an opinion like hall of
famer chipper jones did the other day immediately is treated as worthy of hate
and past sinful actions of mr. jones are brought up in order to show he is anobject worthy of hate.  what adultery has
to do with gun control is anyone’s guess, but it does make one feel better
about dismissing and treating him poorly.



if you want to see more examples of making a person morally
worthy of abuse and then giving that abuse both gamergate and the sad puppiescampaign against the hugo awards (science fiction awards) are fine
examples.  or go to twitter and see the
daily fights that often reward people with more followers for being completely
uncivil and dehumanizing to one another. 





it should go without say why christians cannot follow or participate
in this trend.  we can never “dehumanize”
someone made in the image of god.  but we
ought to no longer expect that same respect in return.

missing churches in low income neighborhoods - why?




this atlantic article on churches in poor neighborhoods is
an interesting read if you look past the find one emotional example that the
author thinks proves his point that characterizes a lot of writing in the
atlantic.  the main point is that half of
new church plants opened in wealthier areas and church attendance is on the decline
among the poor.  and perhaps that is
because it takes a lot of money to run a church and a church in a poor
neighborhood might have more financial needs to help out the needy.  but has he really found the reason, finances
that churches are down in low income neighborhoods?  did he miss a very plausible explanation?



i think he did.  i
will grant that low income neighborhoods might be less likely to receive church
plants than in the past.  the rise in
non-denominational churches probably effects this as they have no connections
to help fund them from afar that a denomination would provide.  but i still think he has the causes
reversed.  churches are not being planted
in low income neighborhoods because church attendance is down in low-income
neighborhoods.  the author gives no proof
for saying fewer churches leads to fewer attending when fewer attending can
very well lead to fewer churches.  



and i think there is ample reason to think the low-income
flight from church is a product of a highly anti-christian culture.  sociologically speaking, the poor or lower
economic classes are quicker to take on the traits of the super-rich, or the
culture makers of society.  this is true
in almost every category.  francis
schaeffer noted this in his books on culture. 
you can see it in things like baby name trends. 
the rich pick unique names, the poor then take up those names and they
finally filter into the middle class, but by then the name has become common
and the rich have abandoned it looking for unique names again (see
freakonomics).  



and what are the elite and culture makers saying about
christianity?  christianity is the enemy
more often than not.  whether it is
christian bakers on the news as the backwater bigots or the evil group that
empowered trump, the enemy is evangelicalism. 
maybe they get it from movies like dogma (1999) where the descendent of
jesus is an abortion worker and the entire thing is an attack on christians, or
more popular and subtle fair like footloose (1984 remade in 2011), or in award
winners like brokeback mountain (2005) with its positive portrayal of
homosexuality.  maybe it is from tv in
the always award winning handmaid’s tale (2017-ongoing) or modern family (2009-ongoing).  maybe it is from books like da vinci code
(2003).  the message is the same, church
is not good, christianity is the problem, not the solution.  so, the lower classes are responding and they
are leaving church resulting in fewer in attendance and thus fewer church
plants.  



the atlantic article laments the fact that christianity
could help these people out physically and materially, yet the churches are not
there.  but the lack of awareness of the
real importance of christianity and its message of jesus christ is
striking.  for the author christianity
helps with “positive outcomes” and “assistance for struggling families”, but
fails to realize such things are the by-product of the love of christ
manifested in the church.  it is by
living out the faith that the atlantic and hollywood and many others have spent
so much time tearing down.  




in the end, the article provides a beautiful picture into a
mind that sees nothing beyond the material and understands little to nothing
about the faith.  but it does see the
damage caused when people begin to abandon that faith.

i’ve been thinking a lot about the football players’ protests of the national anthem.  on the face of things, i don’t like it.  by any accounting, americans are the most free, most wealthy, most generous people on earth, and we should be thankful for our citizenship here.  i think that this method of protest (disrespecting the symbols of our country) in order to make an unrelated political point so clouds the issue that many patriotic americans can’t see beyond it.  and trump’s nasty words had the result of making this past sunday’s protests more about him than about anything else.  but, digging a little deeper to consider the protestors’ motives, i agree that this country has a police brutality problem.  president john adams once said, “our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”  as our society becomes increasingly more immoral, and as the citizens fail to restrain themselves, it follows that the heavy and inadequate hand of the government (the police) will do increasingly more of the restraining for us.  in such a climate, a few policemen (sinners just like the rest of us) become tyrannical, and a few become so jaded that everyone appears as a law-breaker.  both situations lead to the abuse of the innocent.  how many times have we heard, on tv, in the movies, or in real life, a policeman say, “i am the law?”  this perspective is very, very wrong.  i think there is almost no justification for a policeman to use his weapon against a citizen: only in the case of an immediate lethal threat to the policeman or an immediate lethal threat to someone else.  unarmed people should never, ever be shot.  it is far better to err on the side of criminals eluding justice than the side of innocents dying.  this is an issue, a societal problem, worthy of our attention. whenever controversial issues like this one come up, i always do lots of mental gymnastics, trying to turn the situation around to see how i’d feel if the shoe were on the other foot.  would i approve of a professional athlete taking a knee to mourn the lives of all the innocent children murdered in abortion?  mmm.  i might.  i would also admit that doing so during the national anthem communicates an anti-patriotism that i do not support and distracts from (nay, even harms) the original point of the protest.  and it downright angers people for whom love of country is a more important issue (than abortion, racial issues, or whatever).  as mature, thoughtful people, we have to admit that all issues aren’t equally weighted for all people.  isn’t that one of the things pollsters are always asking in the run-up to elections?  for me, abortion is more important than racial tension or school spending or minimum wage because if we kill a person as an infant, then his race, his education, his income are all completely moot.  we have to ensure survival before we bother about secondary things.  now i have good friends, church friends even, who believe racial equality is the more important issue.  while i disagree (and am happy to debate the essential import of abortion), i do refrain from accusing them of allowing their priorities to make them de facto supporters of abortion.  as also, by the way, they should refrain from accusing me of being a de facto supporter of racism.  this brings me back to the beginning.  in our society, we seldom consider the other person’s perspective this way.  many voices in the public square these days are saying that valuing a love of country over a desire to end police brutality is the same as being racist.  and that’s not true.  just because opposing racism isn’t a person’s highest ideal does not mean that it isn’t an ideal at all.  i suspect that nfl players would find many, many more people would rally to their cause if they could make their appeal for the one thing without simultaneously disrespecting another.and now for a note about the disproportionate percent of african american people being killed by police.  african americans make up 13% of the us population.  223 african americans were killed by cops last year, which is 21% of those killed by cops.  315,000 african americans were killed last year by abortion, and that’s 35% of abortions.  now, which of these is worse for african americans, both in numbers of actual dead bodies and in percentages compared to other races?!?!  you can check my math on this, but i’m pretty sure that if you’re an african american, you are a gazillion times more likely to be murdered as an infant than you are to be killed by a cop.

tales from the box office




i keep up with the box office and movie industry.  i feel it gives a good pulse of society and
culture.  i like to play arm chair movie
manager just as much as the next guy, which seems to be a lot because people
often write about the movie industry.  



the atlantic has a piece about the horrible box officeincome of the summer, especially the last month, and while the atlantic writer
gets close, she misses two major things that show her leftist bent.  misunderstandings like this are why the industry
is losing money to places like netflix.  



the first reason why the summer receipts are so bad is not
so much betting on a few properties and putting lots of money into pushing
certain movies, but rather the calendar itself has changed.  and of course we can always play the “maybe
it would have been a better idea to put money behind the marketing of captain
underpants rather than the mummy”, i don’t think this is the real reason.  rather, the changing calendar has changed the
summer blockbuster window itself.  take a
look at the big money movies this year. 
you won’t find an august opening movie until #22.  yes, they are mostly still out, but in years
gone by you would have found more higher on the list because august was still blockbuster
season.  why the change?  school. 
most kids are back in school by the second week of august now.  the time for movie theater trips is
over.  friday night football is usually
going before september.  this is no
longer movie time, but school time.  if
you look at the list again you will find many pre-memorial day releases.  guardians of the galaxy at #3, logan at #6,
and fate of the furious at #7 are both prior. 
school is basically over for many by may.  they may be attending still, but meaningful
school is over.  so movie time it
is.  that gives them time to be out and well-reviewed
by the time memorial day hits keeping financial returns strong.  those movies also are all sequels so the
movie goer is already invested.  no need
to wait to release if the people are already waiting for you.  for movies appealing to younger children one
can be released even earlier.  see beauty
and the beast #1 and lego batman #8.  



and yes if you look at this by opening weekend alone it does
not change much.  still no august
releases until #20.  dark tower was
probably a bad movie and would have had massive drop off, but i bet its opening
would have been better if it had been released in july.  the same is probably true for the hitman’s
bodyguard, which is a typical summer movie fare, but only garnered 21 million
opening weekend thanks to it being after summer was over because school had started
back. its nice performance on labor day weekend shows that it suffered, not from story, but from the fact august people don't see as movie time anymore.  



the other major omission from the atlantic is the content of
the movies that seem to make the most money. 
hollywood really does hate its main audience.  just like political pundits cannot figure out
how trump won most of the country, they can’t figure out what makes a movie
most of the country wants to see.  the
top of the box office list is dominated by super heroes, which fundamentally
are a good v evil tale.  the heroes are
from the 40’s and 50’s and so are also fundamentally about american ideals
including traditional morality.  that is
half of the top 5.  in fact, every super
hero movie released by marvel or dc is in the top 10 including a lego batman
movie.  the top spot is taken by an age old
fairy tale beauty and the beast, which also then reflects good old morals such
as not judging a book by the cover and such things that we used to want to
teach our kids.  it did add in a few
seconds of agenda pushing, but it was so in the background no one cared.  dunkirk as well is about wwii where good
fought evil and is about heroism in leaving no man behind.  despicalbe me 3 is a franchise for kids, and
the fate of the furious is something like the 8th or 9th
entry into its franchise and features the biggest box office name in the
business today dwayne the rock johnson.  

the only exception to the traditional morality and tales is
at #10 in get out.  now get out was
universally loved by the hollywood critics probably causing an uptick in its
sales numbers.  and i do mean
universally.  the only critic to be
negative about the movie was armond white, and he was lambasted on twitter for
failing to fall down in love of this movie. 
the movie is about racism set in a horror movie genre using the suburbs
as the backdrop.  the all white people
are really racist, even the liberals, is not a theme that most people want to
see even if it is done in a unique horror movie style.  now it did make a lot of money, but it will
fall out of the top 10 soon.  the movie
will probably end up behind boss baby, another cartoon, and probably behind
pirates of the caribbean too.  but the
remake of “it” is clearly going to end up in the top 10 after the 3rd
biggest opening weekend of the year in september.  this will knock all exceptions out of the top
10.  



now look at the list of movies that littered the flop
category.  it is littered with two types
of movies.  liberal garbage, which comes
in two types: movies that preach liberalism (see fifty shades darker, emoji
movie, and the shack) and movies that are starred in by those who spout
liberalism so much they are hated by most people (ex. snatched).  detroit might be the best example here.  a limited opening garnered it critical praise
for its police brutality and civil rights themes.  it then went into over 3,000 theaters, and
still made less than 20 million dollars. 
and the other type of movie is the movie with good source material that
was changed, ignored, or tampered with to remove its traditional message that
made them classics in the first place.  now
in this group i do place those remake of 80’s and 90’s cultural icons that were
redone in such a way to show contempt and hatred for them.  chip’s and baywatch are perfect
examples.  i watched chip’s, but not
baywatch as a kid.  regardless of whether or not
you liked those shows, they were successful. 
remaking them into pathetic comedies that neither does justice to nor
celebrates the source material is bound to fail.  if you hate something, don’t try to write a
movie for it.  many hollywood people
today hate american anything from its past, so expect it to fail.  also king arthur falls here.  the heroic arthur restoring order, setting up
the round table, and searching for the holy grail is not in this movie, and the
movie failed miserably.  



you could probably add a third category of just awful story
telling.  the circle would fit that.  this movie ended in such an awful and unintelligible
fashion that you felt ripped off from what up until that point had been a
pretty good movie.  i still get mad just
thinking about all the foreshadowing that was flushed down the toilet for an
ending that i still don’t think i get.  i
actually watched the bonus features on that dvd to see what happened, and
apparently the people talked about all of this emotion building in their main
character that i never even came close to seeing and in the end she didn't act on any of it anyway.  the movie they were communicating was
completely different from what came across on screen.  no one wants to see such bad movies.  




what is the lesson? 
the lesson is the culture makers in this country are redefining
morality.  they are committed to it.  most of the country would prefer it not
changed, but most don’t fight it.  they
probably don’t have the answer which is found only in christ.  lots of people follow traditional morality
without a reason why.  the next
generation is being shaped now by these culture makers.  they are going to be okay with all the moral
non-sense.  they just won’t know how to
tell a decent story and will have no idea what entertainment actually is.

13 reasons why and the true tragedy 




13 reasons why has created a lot of discussion since its
release on netflix.  it is based on a
book, which i have not read, but i viewed the shows.  people feared a contagion affect, and it now
appears to have been happening.  it was
not hard to see coming.  when the hero of
the show is the one who commits suicide, then you are glamorizing suicide.  but the real problem of the show is not
that.  the suggestions for removing the
death scene fundamentally miss the point.

in my opinion, the problem is the accurate portrayal of high
school in a non-christian/post-christian world. 
yes, the main character hannah gets every possible type of bullying,
which is probably unrealistic, but almost everyone is going to have experienced
a couple of those types of bullying situations. 
hannah does seek help in the last show from the guidance counselor, but
he has no answers.  the problem is not
that he is just too busy, but that he has no real solutions.  the show seems to come up with some sort of “we
should love each other more” answer, but that is just hot air and kids today
know it.  they know they can’t be totally
loving, and they sure know that the people around them are not going to be
super loving.  maybe a suicide would help
for a time in a school, but even that would not be a permanent fix.  

that is the problem with 13 reasons why.  it asks the first question of the heidelberg
catechism, “what is your only comfort in life and in death?”  but it comes back with a different
answer.  it comes back with “there isn’t
one.”  when that is the answer, why keep
living in discomfort?  why keep going
when everything is painful and hurts inside? 


the culture is learning that all the reasons suicide are
wrong rest firmly on the christian worldview that the culture is rejecting at
every turn.  without any idea of
redemption, sanctification, divine love, thou shalt not kill, and being created
in the image of god, suicide cannot be condemned.  the experts in those articles don’t want it
to look peaceful, they want the suicide to show the pain and loss of the
family.  but, the non-christian world
tells us to live for ourselves and that pain is bad.  hannah was in pain, so she ended her
pain.  now her parents are in pain, they
have the same option available to them.  

13 reasons why is a horrible show because of its non-christian
worldview.  but it does remind christians
that there are a lot of people out there that in pain, in search of comfort,
and do not know the answer of belonging body and soul to the faithful savior
jesus christ.  the church has an opportunity
to reach those people.  to teach them
about jesus christ and the cross.  




“for while we are still in this tent, we groan, being
burdened – not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further
clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.  he who has prepared us for this very thing is
god, who has given us the spirit as a guarantee.”  - 2 corinthians 5:4-5

hillbilly elegy




i read the new york times bestseller hillbilly elegy, and it is a very good book.  it is well written, honest, and gives a
glimpse into a life style many don’t know. 
the subject matter makes the book tend towards sadness and pity, but has
just enough humor in it to stop it from becoming overly depressing.  the book looks at not just the life, but the mind-set
behind what we think of as appalachia.  



full disclosure, i grew up in appalachia.  so much so that when i read the opening
chapter of this book and he said his family lived in ohio from kentucky, i
thought “that is not appalachia; that is not the south.”  i had to fight against my own upbringing to
be able to listen to this ohio guy talk about appalachia.  i have been to many towns like jackson, ky,
and my own hometown would probably be middletown, oh if eastman chemical ever
closed.  i imagine kingsport maybe a lot
like the middletown that his grandparents moved to when their factory was still
open.



remembering that i actually enjoyed the book, don’t buy the
hype that this book is “a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election”
as jennifer senior from the new york
times writes.  it really has nothing
to do with the election.  it is a look
into a forgotten group of people.  maybe
this forgottenness played a role in the election, but the book is not really
trying to address any of that.  

it is a beautiful picture of a society that grows
increasingly more lost.  the brokenness,
the hopelessness, and the ever rising climate of drugs and violence are
real.  i went home to kingsport this
year, the first time in four years, and the change is saddening.  there is such a thing as mountain poor, and
this books shows it well.  it also ends
up showing how that poverty does not stay in the mountains but ends up in
places like middletown, oh.  if you want
a look at what poverty can do to people and to a community, then read this
book.  it is revealing and eye opening.



however, the book is ultimately very frustrating for not
only its lack of answers, which it is upfront about, but also its inability to
see the real problem staring it in the face. 




jd vance, the author, ends the book talking about some need
for social safety nets are needed and how some problems the government can’t
fix.  he is trying to advocate for some
middle of the road kind of approach.  but,
if he would just read his own book with a thought of christ and the gospel, he
would have the major portion of his answer. 
vance’s story involves a broken home, a mother who was a drug addict and
a father who ran off.  multiple marriages
later, and more abuse than i care to think about, vance escapes thanks to the
gi bill and divine providence that goes unrecognized.  at one point in the book, vance lives with
his mother’s second husband and adopted father. 
the father has found religion, admittedly a pentecostal variety, but he
is now married and with kids of his own. 
vance is surprised at how normal they are and how they don’t fight, they
don’t scream, and they don’t hurt each other. 
but, he does not stay because he feels he doesn’t belong and he will not
give up his rock-n-roll cds.  his own
family, including grandparents, profess but never really go to church.  he often wonders why some make it and some
don’t.  but, he often acknowledges the devastation
of the broken home created by divorce and regrets the social ethic he learned
of looking down on education and elevating fighting.  the problems mr. vance sees are sin, and the
solution is jesus christ.  the problems
stem from an unchristian worldview and can be fixed by the blood of the savior
and following his worldview.  yet, it is
not really ever considered as an option. 




it is heartbreaking to think of generations of those trapped
in the hopelessness of this environment. 
but the solution is not going to be found ultimately in anything man
invents.  the solution is the hope of
jesus christ who redeems us from our sins and saves us from all the power of
the devil.  mr. vance may have escaped
middletown, oh and jackson, ky, but he has not escaped the problem.  appalachia is a place where the reigning
power of sin has beaten the hope out of people. 
their reality demands a hopelessness. 
he has traded it for a world of money and power where the reigning power
of sin feeds delusion and lies regarding the problem, the answer, and situation
ending up in misplaced hope and shifting sand confidence.  both places are under the reigning power of
sin and subject to the wrath of god because of it.  




without the gospel, the hillbilly elegy ends much, much
worse than what he lived through. 
without the gospel it ends in damnation and eternal torment.  with the gospel, it not only avoids damnation
and gives a better life after death, but it redeems life on earth and equips
people to handle the situations faced even in the deep “hollars” of
appalachia.
