★★★★★  our family streams all of our tv and music across multiple devices simultaneously, including gaming on the switch, xbox and ps. we have the fiber 300 package and we haven’t had a single issue in over 6 months. way more reliable than the 100 mb cable internet we had before. best of all, the price is always exactly what iglou stated, and their customer service and communication is fantastic. i highly recommend iglou to anyone who has the availability.google review by brian s.
