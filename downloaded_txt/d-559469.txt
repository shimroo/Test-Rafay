harpers ferry designated a source water community
wv rivers coalition has recognized harpers ferry with a source 
			water community award. harpers ferry and marlinton are the first two 
			communities in wv to receive this award. a water utility earns the 
			designation as a source water community if they take an active role 
			in protecting the waters that serve as their drinking water source. 
			to receive the designation of a source water community, a water 
			utility must partner with the community on source water protection 
			projects and issue a proclamation celebrating drinking water week 
			during the first week of may.
