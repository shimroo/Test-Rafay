failing healthcare support for deaf residents in salford: a call for change



accessing adequate medical support should be a fundamental right for everyone, regardless of their abilities. unfortunately, in salford, a city known for its vibrancy and diversity, the deaf and hard-of-hearing community faces significant challenges when seeking medical assistance. this article delves into the issues highlighted in a recent report by the salford deaf community gathering (sdcg) and sheds light on the steps needed to rectify the situation.
the struggles of deaf residents
imagine trying to complete a complex 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle with a blindfold on. this is how some members of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community describe their experience when trying to access medical support in salford. the sdcg’s report paints a vivid picture of the challenges faced by these individuals.
ignoring the equality act 2010
one of the most glaring issues raised in the report is the apparent disregard for the equality act 2010 by salford’s general practitioners (gps) and hospitals. this legislation was designed to ensure that individuals with disabilities, including those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, are protected from discrimination. however, it appears that some medical professionals in the city are not meeting these legal obligations.
lack of awareness about british sign language (bsl) interpreters
another critical aspect highlighted in the report is the lack of awareness among healthcare providers regarding how to access british sign language (bsl) interpreters. for many members of the deaf community, bsl interpreters are essential for effective communication with medical practitioners. the absence of such support can lead to misunderstandings and subpar healthcare.
the role of the greater manchester integrated care partnership
the greater manchester integrated care partnership plays a central role in ensuring that sign language and deafblind interpreters are available for primary care appointments upon request. however, the report suggests that this information is not widely disseminated, leaving both patients and service providers unaware of this vital service.
the impact of the covid-19 pandemic
the covid-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. for individuals with hearing issues, this crisis exacerbated existing problems. the report highlights that a lack of awareness among service providers resulted in unequal access to information and communication for deaf residents during the pandemic.
concerns about video relay interpreting services
while video relay interpreting services were introduced to increase capacity, the report cautions against making them the norm. these services are not only three times more costly but also come with limitations, particularly in conveying sign language due to small video frames.
inaccessible sexual health services
another pressing issue brought to light in the report is the inaccessibility of salford’s sexual health services for those with hearing loss. it is essential that healthcare services cater to the needs of all residents, regardless of their hearing abilities. read also: long covid is considered a new form of disability
the need for community engagement
the report emphasizes the importance of direct engagement between healthcare managers, commissioners, and the deaf community. it suggests that services should be commissioned in consultation with the community to ensure they meet the needs and preferences of the people they serve. isolation in decision-making can lead to accusations of discrimination.
commitment to improvement
salford’s medical director, dr. tom regan, acknowledges that there is work to be done. he welcomes the report as a valuable tool for understanding the areas in which the city’s health and care services need improvement. dr. regan affirms the commitment to ensuring that no one is treated unfairly and strives to make healthcare services more accessible and equitable for all residents.
in conclusion, the report by the salford deaf community gathering highlights the significant challenges faced by deaf and hard-of-hearing residents when seeking medical support. it serves as a clarion call for salford’s medical services to uphold the principles of equality and accessibility. addressing these issues is paramount to ensuring that salford truly embodies the concept of “true independent living” and provides equal access to healthcare for all its residents.

proposed reforms for disability and illness benefits



the government has unveiled plans to provide enhanced support for individuals with disabilities, particularly regarding the option to work from home. mel stride, the work and pensions secretary, has presented a series of benefit reforms aimed at assisting people in finding employment while also reducing government expenditures.
notably, these reforms will not impact individuals nearing the end of their lives or those with severe learning disabilities, a point emphasized during stride’s address to parliament. nevertheless, some charities have expressed concerns that these changes might compel individuals to work even when their health is compromised.
to facilitate these reforms, the department for work and pensions (dwp) has initiated a consultation on proposed modifications to the work capability assessment. this assessment evaluates how a disability or illness may limit an individual’s ability to engage in the workforce effectively.
key proposals include:

updating categories for mobility and social interaction: the reforms seek to modernize the categories associated with mobility and social interaction, aiming for a more accurate representation of an individual’s work capacity.
acknowledging flexible and remote work: the evolving work landscape, characterized by flexible and remote work options, is also reflected in these proposals. the goal is to minimize potential challenges faced by employees opting for these arrangements.
tailored support for work preparation: individuals found capable of work preparation activity will receive personalized support tailored to the proposed changes, ensuring they are well-equipped for suitable employment opportunities.

the consultation process is set to run for eight weeks, with the government hoping to implement the reforms by 2025, following the next general election.
during his address in the house of commons, mr. stride highlighted the significant shift in the world of work over the past few years, which has created new opportunities for individuals with disabilities and health conditions. he noted that the current work capability assessment often fails to consider the potential for individuals with disabilities or health conditions to work from home, even though many successfully do so.
prime minister rishi sunak has echoed the sentiment that “work transforms lives,” emphasizing that the proposed changes are designed to ensure that no one is hindered from realizing their full potential through work.
however, disability charities have raised concerns about the potential consequences of these new plans. james taylor, the executive director of strategy at scope, a disability equality charity, warned that compelling individuals to seek employment when unwell could exacerbate their health conditions. additionally, individuals not meeting strict conditions could see their benefits discontinued, which, in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, could be catastrophic.
jeremy hunt had previously announced intentions to completely abolish work capability assessments when he unveiled his first spring budget. the dwp asserts that these latest proposals are part of the groundwork to transition toward a more supportive framework and work incentives as assessments are eventually phased out.
recent figures indicate that approximately 2.5 million britons remain excluded from the job market due to various medical conditions. the government has pledged £2 billion in investment to support individuals with long-term illnesses and disabilities in their pursuit of employment, signaling a commitment to fostering inclusivity in the workforce.

addressing concerns over york’s blue badge parking ban and support measures



the city of york, renowned for its historic charm and narrow streets, has found itself at the center of a growing concern: the blue badge parking ban and the support measures aimed at mitigating its impact. this permanent ban on disabled parking in pedestrianized areas of the city center was introduced in november 2021, ostensibly for security reasons. however, as time has passed, questions have arisen about the delay in implementing the promised measures to enhance accessibility for disabled individuals.
the ban that raised concerns
the blue badge parking ban was initially enacted as a temporary measure during the covid-19 pandemic to facilitate social distancing in york’s narrow streets. it was later made permanent, with the city of york council citing the need for anti-terror defenses to safeguard visitors and shoppers. however, what has fueled concerns is the protracted timeline for introducing measures that were meant to offset the ban’s impact.
promised support measures
at the heart of the issue are the commitments made by the council to improve accessibility for disabled people. these commitments included the installation of more city center seating and an expanded provision of mobility aids. while these measures hold the potential to significantly enhance the lives of disabled residents and visitors, their delayed implementation has left many frustrated.
dame judi dench’s call for change
one of the most prominent voices advocating for an end to the blue badge parking ban is york-born actor dame judi dench. she has been an impassioned supporter of the campaign to overturn the ban, emphasizing the importance of accessibility for all in york’s city center.
mitigation measures: a step in the right direction
recent developments have seen the council taking steps to address these concerns. at a meeting of the customer and corporate services scrutiny committee, james gilchrist, the council’s director of transport, highlighted several mitigation measures that have been put in place. these include additional funding for services like shopmobility and dial-a-ride, as well as the creation of more disabled parking bays outside pedestrian areas. while these measures are welcomed, questions linger about their timing.

timing matters
labour councillor pete kilbane questioned whether it would have been more logical to have these mitigations in place before implementing the ban. in response, mr. gilchrist admitted that, if circumstances allowed, he would have preferred that sequence. unfortunately, bureaucratic processes didn’t align with this ideal.
evaluating effectiveness
katie lomas, another labour councillor and a blue badge holder, raised valid concerns about the effectiveness of these mitigation measures. it is crucial to not only implement measures but also assess their impact on the disabled community. mr. gilchrist acknowledged that, for some individuals, no mitigation measure could entirely replace the convenience and accessibility lost due to the end of blue badge parking.
voices of advocacy
campaign group reverse the ban (rtb) has been at the forefront of the campaign to reverse the blue badge parking ban. members of this group have decried the “discriminatory decisions” that have disproportionately affected disabled and older individuals.
disability rights campaigner flick williams stressed the need for promised consultations, feasibility studies, and funding for mitigations to be delivered promptly when an adverse impact is identified for individuals with protected characteristics.
dame judi dench’s support
adding her influential voice to the cause, dame judi dench has wholeheartedly supported the campaign against the blue badge ban. she articulated that york’s city center should be a place accessible to all, including those with disabilities for whom accessible parking is essential.

australia’s athletic carnival for children with disabilities returns after 3 years of vacuum



the annual athletic carnival for children with disabilities is back at gold coast recreation and sport after a 3-year suspension due to the pandemic. approximately 500 students with disabilities participated in the 400 numbers that were contested.
“there is no doubt that the potential of future paralympic athletes who have triumphed today has its roots in a carnival-class competition,” said gold coast recreation and sport chief executive, anna-louise kassulke, as quoted by abc news, saturday, september 10, 2022.
according to kassulke, this event was held to encourage and explore the interests and potentials of children with special needs through the safe zone. kassulke added that the safe zone must be passed by children with disabilities so that in the future they can compete in a more inclusive life. in addition, the gold coast carnival is an opportunity for children with special needs to show their abilities in front of the non-disabled community.
“these students, some of them are in inclusive education, so don’t have this opportunity in their school,” kassulke said.
one of the winners in this athletic competition is daniel nesbitt, 11 years old with autism and adhd. in this competition, daniel managed to win gold medals for the 50-meter and 100-meter sprints. “this is my favorite day of all time,” said daniel.
feeling proud and accepted by the environment is very important for every child, including children with special needs. besides being able to increase self-confidence in dealing with relationships outside the disabled community, sports competitions also teach children with special needs to be fair and sportive.
“this event is one of our favorite events because here we can free students to compete inclusively and according to their ability level, there is potential that is really being explored, we prepare for it throughout the year,” said david tuzi of varsity college.

invite disabilities to achieve, ovo and grab collaborate to support asean para games



equality for disabilities does not only apply in public facilities, but also in the world of sports. sports can be an encouragement for people with disabilities to show off their achievements on an international scale.
to support this spirit, two leading superapps in southeast asia and indonesia, grab and ovo, are collaborating to support the 11th asean para games 2022 in indonesia. this support is also in line with the theme of this sporting event, namely together be win.
chairman of the indonesia, asean para games organizing committee (inaspoc) gibran rakabuming raka thanked grab and ovo for their support for this event. he hopes that the 11th asean para games 2022 can motivate many people to continue to make achievements in various things, including sports.
“therefore, we welcome contributions from grab and ovo, which really help us in realizing these expectations through various activities,” said raka on saturday.
the man who also serves as the mayor of solo also invites all parties to contribute to this southeast asian disability sports event. by making these contributions, this event is not only enjoyed by people with disabilities, but also the entire community.
“of course, it is a challenge for us to organize a disability sports party of this size, for that we really appreciate the support of all parties. we want the 11th asean para games 2022 to be felt and celebrated by all parties, not just people with disabilities,” said gibran.
on the same occasion, president of grab indonesia ridzki kramadibrata said, this support cannot be separated from grab’s commitment to providing equality for the community, including people with disabilities. this commitment can also be seen in grab’s passion and hard work to continue to make indonesia and southeast asia proud by becoming a partner of the 11th asean para games 2022.
“equality for all, including people with disabilities, is one of grab’s main commitments. we are proud to be part of this historic moment and support indonesia’s journey to hosting the largest disability multi-sport event in southeast asia after five years of absence. the tenacity, hard work, and trust of the athletes in breaking through limitations have inspired grab to continue its efforts to bring indonesia and southeast asia forward,” said ridzki.
ridzki added the support of the digital platform ecosystem can provide the same champion spirit for anyone. this is evidenced by the grab award for indonesian athletes and coaches who brought home gold medals at the 2021 paralympics, which will take place in tokyo, namely leani ratri oktalia, khalimatus sadiyah, and hary susanto.
invite volunteers and smes
in addition to awards, grab also opens opportunities for driver-partners with disabilities or not in surakarta, to participate as volunteers during the activity. to make it easier for volunteers and committees, grab also provides environmentally friendly electric scooters to facilitate mobility during the event.
as a form of support for msmes, grab and ovo also collaborated with inaspoc to provide various attractive promos during the event which takes place from july 26 to august 6, 2022, one of which is by providing thousands of discount vouchers for grabcar, grabbike, and grabfood services using the promo code paragames.
this voucher can be used by the public to travel to and from the match location in three cities/districts, including semarang, surakarta, and karanganyar as well as the grabfood food promo which is a collection of msmes and local legends .

long covid is considered a new form of disability



a lawyer in the united states considers long covid to be a new form of disability that has the potential to permanently affect millions of workers. this condition is considered to affect the life of the sufferer after recovering from covid-19.
symptoms and timing of the onset of long covid vary. long covid patients are those who still experience covid-19 symptoms even though they are not infected with the coronavirus. the us government accountability office predicts that the long covid-19 has affected 7 million to 23 million americans.
the notion of long covid as a new form of disability was conveyed by the university of pennsylvania law professor, jasmine harris. unfortunately, according to him, the medical condition is difficult to accommodate by the americans with disabilities act of 1990.
this is because the legal definition of disability or disability is different from the medical definition. medical professionals continue to study the patient’s condition to determine what long covid is, with many experts theorizing that it is an umbrella term for a variety of conditions.
if we look at the law, a person with a disability can be defined as someone who has a mental or physical disorder that limits himself to more than one activity. harris said the serious impact of long covid was limiting patients.
these medical conditions can affect different individuals to varying degrees. more than 200 long covid symptoms have been documented, ranging from persistent tiredness, coughing, lack of function of the senses of taste and smell, hallucinations, erectile dysfunction, the inability to record new memories, and feelings of discomfort.
“we need to know more. whether it substantially limits one or more major life activities, such as thinking, walking, and in some cases, work,” harris said, quoted from fortune’s page.
long covid is generally an ‘invisible disability, as it does not involve wheelchairs, crutches, or other assistive devices. such disabilities are not very visible and difficult to document. this condition can be a problem for people who want to apply for jobs, as well as for companies.
harris gave an example if someone has chronic fatigue due to covid-19. if these conditions are not communicated to the employer, employees can get into trouble. the solution, employees can ask for flexible working hours, in addition to asking for information from a doctor.
in harris’ opinion, the emergence of a new form of disability that is widespread is an opportunity for employers to initiate a number of innovations. for example, reviewing the workplace to make it adequate for employees, both in terms of doing business and bringing employees together in the work environment.
he recommends that employers invest a lot of time determining whether an employee qualifies to work from home and whether that time could be better spent. likewise, how to foster a climate of mutual trust and respect in the company.
employers can also provide ergonomic work equipment and more flexible working hours to increase morale and productivity for all employees. “the question is, how do entrepreneurs want to allocate time and money going forward?” said harris.

research: the importance of dedicated platforms for disability issues in mainstream media



should disability issues have their own platform or remain part of the mainstream media?
many readers are still not familiar with disability and therefore disability is considered an unpopular issue, especially when compared to political or economic issues. some media that publish news related to disability tend to attract readers’ attention by presenting disability in the wrong way. therefore, to correct this fallacy, should disability issues have a special platform or remain part of the mainstream media?
the mistaken mainstream media picture of disability

disability as inspirational porn

inspirational pornography is defined as a way of portraying persons with disabilities as contradictory role models: strong, but also pitiable. in other words, although disability is increasingly accepted, abnormalities are still the biggest source of fear.

misusing disability terminology

the term disability is often used by the media as a character trait, plot device or carrier of a bad mood. this kind of representation is neither accurate nor fair. sometimes, disability is reinforced by background stories, such as describing people with disabilities as ignorant and misbehaving.

issues that are rarely discussed

because disability issues are considered unpopular, only one percent of the media in the united states, for example, are interested in discussing disability issues. in fact, many journalists tend to give a gap of up to one year between discussing one disability issue to another. this action is related to the number of readers. therefore, the issue of disability is still difficult to grab the attention of readers.

hyperheroism

hyperheroism refers to the behavior of people with disabilities that are actually normal but are interpreted by the media in an exaggerated way. this method often displays misperceptions through an assumption based on physical bias. for example, superheroes are rarely depicted as humans with artificial organs.
new media landscape

public opinion cannot be encouraged by the media

there is no evidence that public opinion can be driven by media framing. in addition, public opinion is also influenced by their way of thinking. there are many possible causes of behavior and public opinion towards disability.

the news value behind the issue

disability issues that are often published in several countries are already quite developed. the reason behind this progress is that the media plays an important role in bringing forward important issues that support people with disabilities. for example, media coverage of the process of publishing the national disability insurance system (ndis) in australia reached 455 articles in the australian media.

changes in the value of readers

the number of media readers no longer relies on the circulation of media products but on the standard of reader interest. recently, disability issues are considered as part of social criticism of discriminatory regulations made by the government. an example is the matter of disability insurance under president trump’s law in the united states.

increased awareness of disability

some companies have started using disability images to raise public awareness about disability issues. including disability issues in advertisements can help companies fulfill their social responsibilities. in addition, this kind of advertisement also increases the value of the company among media readers.
a comprehensive control system for disability issues in mainstream media can be established in a special platform while enabling persons with disabilities to fully participate in strengthening their movement or rebuking critics through the media and creating the control system itself. such platforms can also encourage mainstream media to be more concerned about disability issues.
