veterinary fences in the kaza tfca:
assessment of livestock disease risks of potential removal of specific fence sections, with an emphasis on the botswana-namibia border


this new (2024) report is one of the most important ones we've collaborated on in several years. it is the second of a three-part project under the auspices of the kaza animal health sub working group, evaluating veterinary fences in botswana's component of kaza, some of which border namibia, and their impact on the overall vision for an ecologically and economically successful tfca. the first phase, completed in 2022 (and which ahead hopes to have in the public domain in 2025), evaluated the fences based on their impacts on wildlife movements and recommended the removal of sections of several fences from a wildlife conservation perspective. the second phase (this new report, which includes a thorough summary of the first phase report starting on page 152) analyzes how the risk of important livestock diseases might change, or not, if these same fence sections were removed to promote habitat connectivity across the greater kaza landscape. 
this assessment was conducted to inform national, bilateral and kaza-level planning efforts on veterinary fences and includes delineation of risks at each fence line under three different scenarios assuming that (i) no changes are made, i.e. status quo, (ii) the fence section is removed and (iii) the fence section is removed with specific risk mitigation in place. while veterinary fences have a longstanding role in disease control in southern africa, there is growing recognition that the time has come to consider alternative disease control methods in some parts of the region. this risk assessment offers a look at how key fence sections might be removed in areas deemed critical for wildlife and habitat connectivity, while maintaining low levels of risk for transboundary diseases. although land use and livestock density around each fence contribute to its unique risk profile, there are some commonalities in the risks assessed at each fence, including but not limited to the finding that the risks for disease outbreaks remained the same under proposed fence section removals. removing fence sections can increase the risk at certain steps in a risk pathway, but in all cases, the probability of disease occurrence and overall risk estimate were the same under both the status quo and proposed removal. in some cases, the probability of disease occurrence decreased with the addition of risk mitigation measures.
                

the report's top-line recommendations, finalized based on a may 2024 validation meeting involving, among other stakeholders, expert coauthors from dvs botswana and dvs namibia, are featured in the map below. a third and final phase will entail consultations with communities that could be impacted, positively or negatively, by the removal of any specific fence or fence section as proposed by the first two phases and associated deliberations, which also yielded a compelling recommendation for broader community access to the herding for health (h4h) model in (for example) botswana's eastern panhandle as a key disease risk mitigation approach. it's worth noting that the costs of implementing h4h broadly in ngamiland may compare favourably with the expenses associated with the constant need for fencing repairs due to elephant damage and other causes. 
                
cumulatively, the three phases of work have been designed to inform planning efforts at various scales within the context of regional collaboration and cooperation in the areas of disease risk management, natural resource use and management, and community development.

fence sections recommended for phase 3 community consultations on potential removal (green) with risk mitigation or re-evaluation in future (yellow) based on bilateral consideration. sections of the western border fence (dark and light orange) were not recommended for removal at this time, though one 23 km section (light orange) was highlighted as
being a potential candidate in the future pending further information.

what is ahead?
ahead works to create enabling environments that allow different and often competing sectors to literally come to the same table and find collaborative ways forward to address challenges at the interface of wildlife health, livestock health, and human health and livelihoods. we convene stakeholders and provide technical support and resources for projects locally identified as priorities. ahead, one of the first applied one health programs, recognizes the need to look at health, disease, and the environment together, while always taking a given region's socioeconomic, political, and policy context into account.

what
                    is ahead?
animal & human health for the environment
                  and development was launched at the 2003 iucn world parks congress
                  in durban, south africa. by assembling a ‘dream team’ of
                  veterinarians, ecologists, biologists, social and economic
                  scientists, agriculturists, wildlife managers, public health
                  specialists and others from across east and southern africa,
                  we were fortunate to have tapped into some of the most innovative
                  conservation and development thinking on the african continent-
                  and ahead was born. since then, a range of programs addressing
                  conservation, health, and concomitant development challenges
                  have been launched with the support of a growing list of implementing
                  partners and donors who see the intrinsic value of the one
                  world, one health approach. 
ahead is a convening, facilitative mechanism, working to create
                  enabling environments that allow different and often competing
                  sectors to literally come to the same table and find collaborative
                  ways forward to address challenges at the interface of wildlife
                  health, livestock health, and human health and livelihoods.
                  we convene stakeholders, help delineate conceptual frameworks
                  to underpin planning, management and research, and provide
                  technical support and resources for projects stakeholders identify
                  as priorities. ahead recognizes the need to look at health
                  and disease not in isolation but within a given region's socioeconomic
                  and environmental context.
in short, ahead recognizes the importance
                  of animal and human health to both conservation and development
                  interests. around the world, domestic and wild animals are
                  coming into ever-more-intimate contact, and without adequate
                  scientific knowledge and planning, the consequences can be
                  detrimental on one or both sides of the proverbial fence. but
                  armed with the tools that the health sciences provide, conservation
                  and development objectives have a much greater chance of being
                  realized – particularly
                  at the critical wildlife/livestock interface, where conservation
                  and agricultural interests meet head-on. ahead efforts focus
                  on several themes of critical importance to the future of animal
                  agriculture, human health, and wildlife health (including zoonoses,
                  competition over grazing and water resources, disease mitigation,
                  local and global food security, and other potential sources
                  of conflict related to land-use decision-making in the face
                  of resource limitations). historically, neither governments,
                  nongovernmental organizations, the aid community, nor academia
                  have holistically addressed the landscape-level nexus represented
                  by the triangle of wildlife health, domestic animal health,
                  and human health and livelihoods as underpinned by environmental
                  stewardship.
