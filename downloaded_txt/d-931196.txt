for enterprises
if you're a large enterprise, taking advantage of new and emerging technologies
                                        while still maintaining
                                        productivity can be challenging. it is not always easy to stay on the cutting
                                        edge. with so much on-premises
                                        infrastructure and so many legacy systems deployed across multiple departments
                                        and lines of business, progress
                                        can be slow. knowing there's so much to gain by moving to the cloud but you
                                        just can't get there. if you're paving the way for a
                                        new cloud strategy, figuring out how to begin migrating your applications or
                                        just jump-starting one of the many new
                                        cloud offerings, we can help.
                                    







for universities
universities face unique challenges in deploying applications to the cloud. with
                                        many high-end systems tightly coupled to
                                        proprietary student and faculty processing systems and serving a diverse user
                                        community, the .edu space sometimes requires a different
                                        approach. having experience in this space, we've been able to tailor our
                                        processes to the specific challenges facing universities
                                        that can ease the migration path to the cloud. if you're a university and
                                        struggling to figure out where to begin and how to take
                                        advantage of the cloud today, we can help.
                                    







for startups
we understand the difficulties in building a platform in
                                        the early stages of growth.
                                        finances are tight and development can be expensive. as a result of launching
                                        several cloud-based startups ourselves,
                                        we're making available our cloud-based platform specifically designed for
                                        startups and small businesses.

                                        azure cloud, complete with frontend ui,
                                        middle-tier services and a variety of integrated data processing and backend
                                        options. if you're interested in
                                        deploying your solution to the cloud fast with end-to-end automation, we can
                                        help.

                                our platform delivers a fully-automated model for standing up infrastructure, launching
                                services and managing
                                change through scripted ci/cd pipelines tailored to your needs and aligned with your
                                existing processes.

history


                        founded in 1992 during the internet explosion of the early 90âs,
                        insolutions began as a as a software development
                        company with the goal of building data-centric, secure applications
                        for the web. through an initial partnership with the american real
                        estate association, insolutions delivered one of the first
                        database-driven, online property listing services of its time.
                        the new listing service was piloted in maryland, virginia and the
                        district of columbia and provided the initial momentum that would
                        fuel the growth of the online real estate market for the next
                        25 years.
                    

                        in 1995, insolutions was contracted by the department of defense
                        to assist with the dissemination of âunclassified, but
                        limitedâ information to their contractors around the
                        globe. the requirements would highlight the need for robust
                        application and data security, along with a new approach for
                        the web. the resulting solution was unveiled at the pentagon
                        and became one of the first applications at the dod that
                        leveraged web-based authentication, role-based access control,
                        ssl and proprietary data encryption as the foundation for a
                        comprehensive, secure, document delivery infrastructure for multiple
                        defense organizations.
                    

                        in 1997, java was introduced into the community as a new
                        development language that would revolutionize how software is
                        built. at a symposium in mcclean virginia, insolutions
                        participated in one of the first regional java conferences
                        focused on promoting the technology as it began to gain traction.
                        we made a conscious decision to move in that direction and began
                        building custom applications on the java platform while extending
                        and integrating existing applications to leverage the new technology.
                    

                        within the next few years, a new philosophy began to emerge -
                        to design solutions that are built on open-standards, leverage new
                        advancements in tools and technologies and have practical,
                        real-world applications. through a specialization in java and
                        web technologies, combined with the security experience gained
                        from the department of defense, insolutions was able to establish
                        a foothold in custom development and became a key player in identity and access management
                        space
                        that continued to grow throughout the early 2000's.
                    

                        in 2000 we signed on with sun microsystems, as a premier systems integrator
                        and began to extend our development practice to include key off-the-shelf tools and products
                        into our solutions. in 2001 insolutions was offered a seat on the
                        governing board of the first sun software partner council for a
                        two-year term and in 2003 was awarded âpartner of the yearâ as a
                        sun systems integrator then continued on with oracle for a short time after their acquisition
                        of
                        sun in 2009.
                    

                        from that point forward, weâve been building upon the
                        foundation established in the early days and have partnered
                        with many product vendors and software development companies to deliver comprehensive solutions to
                        our clients. we continue to expand our depth and breadth of
                        knowledge in software as we discover new ways to improve, secure
                        and simplify our solutions to adapt to ongoing changes in technology and the cloud.
                        we strive to build long-term relationships with our clients, for it is
                        from these relationships that our most meaningful solutions are built.
