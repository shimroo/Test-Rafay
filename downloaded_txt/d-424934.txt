history of the "cam father"
                the name ed iskenderian is a legend among racers worldwide.
                ed's life history parallels the proverbial success story.
                he was born in 1921 in the grapevine country of tulare county, california.
                his future as a winemaker never materialized because several heavy frosts destroyed the vineyards.
                these conditions forced the iskenderian family to move to los angeles. 

                while attending polytechnic high school in los angeles, ed's pet project was building a model t ford roadster.
                ed learned the fundamentals of mechanics by working with the model t fords and later adapted the overhead conversion by frontenac (more commonly known as fronty), as well as the george riley head known to the racers in those days as the "multi-flathead."
