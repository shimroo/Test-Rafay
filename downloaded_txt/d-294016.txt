how to import species download in excel



          when you download a list of species from algaebase, the data is supplied in csv format with a ".txt" file extension, which will usually open in notepad on windows pcs and laptops.
        

          due to a persistent microsoft bug, opening this file directly in excel will cause problems with diacritical marks, e.g. "kützing" becomes "kã¼tzing".
        

          to use this file in excel, you should use the import feature:
        

create a new blank workbook
click the "data" tab
click "from text/csv"
select the downloaded file, which should be in your "downloads" folder and will be called "species_download.txt"
click "import"
in the resulting dialog, make sure that "file origin" is set to "65001: unicode (utf-8)" and "delimiter" is set to "comma"
click "load"
