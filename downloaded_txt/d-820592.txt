about us


at crane garden buildings we have been handcrafting garden buildings for 50 years and over this time built a solid reputation for our outstanding quality. a family-run business from humble beginnings making simple sheds from our diy shop in a small village in the heart of the norfolk countryside in 1974, we now offer an extensive range of garden buildings including sheds, summerhouses, garden rooms, offices, studios, greenhouses, and more. we aim to create a garden building that perfectly matches your style and intended use, which is why each building can be customised to meet your every expectation.
over the years we have experienced expansive growth and gained a wealth of knowledge and expertise that enables us to produce the best luxury garden buildings on the market. with sustainability being one of our most important values, all buildings are produced at our norfolk-based workshop using fsc certified timber.
our range of timeless garden building designs, our exceptionally high building standards, and our outstanding customer service, are what have earned us our glowing reputation over the years, so thank you for visiting our website; please explore at your leisure, and if you would like more information on our garden buildings, please contact us.
