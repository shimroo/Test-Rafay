stiftelsen 3,14 becomes kunsthall 3.14
for the  last 10 years ”stiftelsen 3,14” was run as a kunsthall. the past 3 years  3,14  has been a member of 'kunsthallene i norge',  and it was a natural progression to now change our name to kunsthall 3.14.

100år! / 100years! 
the future is now. and also the past. we are about to celebrate the centenary for women’s right to vote in norway, by launching the project 100 years! 

                  for many norway is the symbol of a privileged reality in which human rights and the right to vote is a given. but even in one of the most egalitarian societies in the world we have still not reached the goal of gender equality. for many norwegians the word feminism is a four letter word.
