           merry christmas & happy new year from asper biogene!
our thoughts are with the ukrainian people as their lives are affected by aggression for a third winter.           asper metabolic disorders portfolio has been expanded to include galactosemia, lactose intolerance and coeliac disease.  »          we have updated the ftaad gene panel with genes associated with ehlers-danlos syndrome.
the analysis of familial hypercholesterolaemia now includes 8 genes.
the changes can be found in the asper cardiogenetics and metabolic disorders portfolios.  »          myotonia congenita tests were added into asper biogene’s neurogenetics portfolio. metabolic myopathy and rhabdomyolysis panel has also been modified. neutropenia has received an update in asper biogene’s hematology portfolio and asper biogene’s oncology portfolio has received a new test in the form of ovarian cancer.  »          there have been several updates among asper cardiogenetics and neurogenetics.  »          we have a brand new portfolio!  »          asper dysmorphology now offer panels for joubert syndrome, ehler-danlos syndrome, bardet-biedli syndrome and many more.  »          the cardiogenetics, metabolic disorders, and otogenetics panels now offer mitochondrial genome sequencing.  »
