information about our internet!the local wifi name is “seamist” and our password is “sandybeach” in case you need to connect your phone or computer to the internet.
recommendation for breakfast!if you are interested in a great breakfast just a short walk down the beach, try the beach lodge at beach marker #9 which is just a couple hundred yards down the beach to the right. our boardwalk over the sand dunes hits the beach at beach marker #5. this local dive also is open through the day if you want a break from the beach to grab a nice cold beer. enjoy!
details about parking and your parking pass!when you turn on banyan beach drive, you will find an entrance to a parking lot before the road ends. this is the view in the left picture. take a right and immediate left to drive past the condo to the corner of the complex as seen in the middle picture. park in the space numbered #127 on the parking curb. there is a parking pass in the condo unit so fill it out with #127. please put this pass on your dashboard so our property manager can tell your car is supposed to be there. cars without passes are at risk for getting towed, especially during the busy seasons. the entry to your condo unit will be from the stairs on the back of the complex. your car is easily seen from your condo balcony.  4 extra spots are available on a first come-first serve basis.  coming soon are 4 golf cart parking spots in the front left corner of the lot.
