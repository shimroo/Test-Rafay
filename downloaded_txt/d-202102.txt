wedge-ease helps create a better fit between you and your workspace.

          wedge-ease ergonomic forearm support products are an inexpensive solution to help eliminate uncomfortable work postures and pressure points from resting on a hard worksurface. our products are designed for microscope users and for people who need hand, wrist and forearm support during seated work tasks.  laboratory and bench workers often experience discomfort in their hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck and back. if ignored, discomfort can develop into a painful musculoskeletal disorder. known risk factors include awkward posture, repetitive motion, force, static postures, contact stress and inadequate recovery time.  make wedge-ease part of your personal, healthy work place.
