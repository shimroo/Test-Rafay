                                        i ordered the dazzling dozen for delivery,  which i had to change to pick up. they put my delivery charges into the bouquet itself and it was absolutely stunning. the wife loved it. good job westside flowers. i'll definitely be back

                                        i was initially looking for an edible arrangements or 1-800-flowers location in red bluff, ca but found none and after a few failed attempts at placing orders through a sketchy online delivery site, my order got canceled and i decided to instead look at local floral shops that would deliver as well. and i am so happy i found this floral shop! i am always a big advocate for shopping locally but since i do not live in ca, i did not know what it would be like going this route. but like i said, i am beyond grateful and thankful i chose westside flowers & gifts! they delivered it with ease and my recipient was in love with such a simple, yet bountiful bouquet of roses! thank you again, westside flowers, and now i know where i will be getting all my flowers/arrangements delivered from in red bluff, ca if i ever need that service again! highly highly recommended floral shop!
