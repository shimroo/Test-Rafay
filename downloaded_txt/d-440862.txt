our design philosophy 



fully supportive homes 



harmonizing with natureyour land has a voice that called to you and now seeks to be shaped in resonance with its unique essence and your vision. by attuning ourselves to the land, we craft homes that feel as though they organically emerge from the landscape—like they’re truly meant to be there. our designs embrace sustainable principles, drawing inspiration from organic forms, natural materials, and the surrounding environment. interiors foster a connection to the outdoors through natural light, ventilation, and truly epic views. focus on feelinga home is more than walls and a roof; it’s an experience— a feeling that touches every part of your being. it’s the warmth of sunlight streaming through the windows, the way the spaces invite you to relax and be yourself, and the quiet reassurance of being surrounded by what matters most. a well-designed home fosters connection with the land, with loved ones, and with the rhythm of daily life. every room, every corner, carries an energy that resonates with a deep-rooted feeling that you are exactly where you’re meant to be. enduring designmore than a structure, your home is an heirloom — crafted to endure, adapt, and enrich every chapter of life, regardless of changes in age, ability, or season of life. by blending timeless aesthetics with practical, accessible features, we create spaces that evolve with you and your family’s needs, creating a legacy of lasting comfort and joy for generations to come. authentic individualitywe champion radical expression of your unique life and lifestyle, while simultaneously embracing the practicalities of everyday life. we believe your home can be a source of inspiration and a supportive environment for daily tasks and responsibilities. by artfully blending your vision for life with functional design elements rooted in sustainability, efficiency, and timeless beauty, we create spaces that inspire you every day, while seamlessly supporting the nuances of your life.

what our clients say about us 










						jenny knew what we wanted better than we did!					





madeleine sheeran 






						we had an idea of what we wanted, but couldn't find the right person able to translate it into a design that felt right for us and our unique property... until we found jenny pippin. and we're so glad we did!					





liz studer 






						jenny was able to take my vague description of how we were trying to transform our house and truly made it even better than i could have imagined!					


lisette sazama 






						thank you for this wonderful gift...i have dreamed about all of this in my head for years.					


laura & eric ferguson 






						“i can honestly say that i would not change even one thing if given the chance.” 					


donna economos 






						we could not be more pleased. we have a unique home that reflects us and our tastes perfectly. we definitely consider this money well spent!					


skip & maria s. 






						this is the last house we planned to build and live in. jenny took our concepts and vision and put them into reality.  she listened to all our concerns, incorporated them, and added unique design features that definitely delivered the distinctive house we were after.

how it works 



overview of our design services: 
















 









 





getting to know you 



in order to design a home that will truly be supportive of your unique life, we first need to get to know you, your family, the people you will share your home with, and everything that’s important to you. this begins in our very first phone call and is supported by our in-depth design questionnaire, followed up by a 2-hour initial consultation with jenny in which she listens to your story and tunes into the specific needs of your intended spaces. 
 















 









 





getting to know your land – site assessment 



jenny has a sixth sense for reading the language of the land. during an in-person visit of your property, jenny learns how the land wants to be built upon, the natural features to be enhanced, the location and direction of best views, the path of the sun across the property, sunny/shady/windy areas, the existing trees to be saved, and any special natural features noted.   















 









 





conceptual design 



jenny hand draws sketches of the preliminary design concepts, including sketches of the initial floor plans, exterior elevations, and a site plan concept. this is an organic and creative discovery process in which she intuits and interprets potential design solutions for your home unbound by the confines of a computer program. 

 

























 









 





design development 



preliminary design concepts are entered into cad and the details are fine-tuned to create a more comprehensive set of design drawings. these cad drawings include floor plans, exterior elevations with 3d perspective views, a roof plan, and a site plan.

 















 









 





construction drawings 



based on the final approved design development drawings, we create detailed construction drawings that provide coherence among your entire build team. collaboration with your chosen team during this final stage is the most supportive way to fill out all remaining details.

jenny’s 



story 



from tragedy to triumph. 



 



jenny’s inquisitive and visionary spirit has been the driving force behind a life full of passion, continually pushing the boundaries and searching for better ways to live.in her early 20’s, jenny had a near-death experience that rendered her temporarily disabled while living in a home that was far from accessible. it was also an inadequately designed passive solar home that had lots of natural light, though it turned into an oven in the summer.this experience highlighted the necessity of incorporating the environment into a home’s design. it also taught her invaluable lessons about functionality, flow, and accessibility that no formal education could convey.life and home have always been her greatest teachers. this seminal experience sparked her passion for green, sustainable, healthy homes and sent her on a path to become a recognized industry expert in crafting homes that are truly supportive.
