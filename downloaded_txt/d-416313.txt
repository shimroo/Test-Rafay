the original woodgas website 



welcome to paul anderson's primary website. 



dr. thomas b. reed, the internationally renowned scientist and inventor, typically used the term woodgas in casual conversation about biomass gasification, as the term was readily understood in its association with wood, the first renewable energy source in use for more than 100,000 years.  and when he established this website in 1999, he used this term as its title (woodgas) and domain name (woodgas.com).shortly before his passing in 2018, dr. reed transferred his popular woodgas website, along with all of its digital assets, to his friend and associate, dr. paul s. anderson (also known as dr tlud).  dr. anderson continues his work today as an internationally renowned expert in the applications of biomass gasification and biochar production.now rebranded as woodgas international, this website will preserve and make freely available all digital resources from dr. reed’s original websites, and it will serve as the new home for dr. anderson’s digital resources from his former websites (drtlud.com, juntosnfp.org, and woodgas.energy). 








 "woodgas pyroneers" (left to right) paal b. wendelbo, dr. thomas b. reed, and dr. paul s. anderson.  wendelbo and reed are credited with independently creating the first tlud devices in our modern period. they met only once when they were honored at the 2011 partnership for clean indoor air (pcia) forum in lima, peru for their “significant contributions to the development of top-lit updraft gasifier stove technology.”  anderson is the developer of the award-winning champion tlud cookstove.

















 







wood gasification 



harnessing renewable energy from biomass for more than 100,000 years 



as noted by the founder of our website, dr. thomas b. reed, biomass gasification is a very old art.   and today, with refined methods and carefully designed devices, biomass gasification is widely utilized to produce a fuel gas – often called wood gas — that can power furnaces, stoves, kilns, and even vehicles.
