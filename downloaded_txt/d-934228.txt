we believe that in a nation of plenty, no one should go hungry.
food gatherers is the food bank and food rescue program serving washtenaw county. the lead agency for hunger relief in the county, food gatherers supports a network of more than 140 community partners with free and low-cost food, deliveries, and trainings. we operate several large direct service programs — the food gatherers community kitchen, the summer food service program, and the healthy school pantry program — and work closely with community schools, universities, and healthcare providers to address gaps in services. because hunger will not be solved with food alone, we advocate for policies and system changes to create an equitable food system.
in our last fiscal year, food gatherers distributed 9.9 million pounds of food — the equivalent of 8.2 million meals — through our network of partner programs.
this would not be possible without the support of our community. will you join the fight against hunger where you live?
