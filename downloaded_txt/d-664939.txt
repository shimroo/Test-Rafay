this is me
iâm an ish. agile-ish, lean-ish, design thinking-ish, strategist-ish. you get the idea. i value conversations over process. i understand that each business is a bit different-ish and what works for one client isnât the same for another. i value building relationships with people, simply because i give people my full attention. itâs my superpower â active listening!
most of all, i love creating things that people love.









what floats my boat

experimentation
some people call this innovation, for me itâs as simple as trying something new. looking back i had no idea how the world wide web was going to pan out. do you ever recall that tiny window of time where emails supported flash? i jumped onto opportunities as quickly as they disappeared. could you even think of a website now that was intentionally designed to be completely and utterly confusing? that was the concept we presented to chupa chups.
consumers loved it!

failure is learning
when you experiment things break, and thatâs totally ok. iâve experienced failure through launching campaigns, products and experiences and seeing it tank. now i can fail early and quickly through user research and testing.
trust me, itâs much better this way.

digital is unpredictable
i canât predict what is going to happen in the next 5 years, but can you recall life before youtube, google and facebook? just because we donât know what the next big thing is doesnât mean we canât do meaningful work. change. adapt. improve.

transformation is about catching up
so youâre going âdigitalâ. well youâre in safe hands â but you gotta move fast because youâve already been left behind.
i can help.

iterate! iterate! iterate!
what i love most about design is the ability to improve on the experience once something has been launched. have a grand vision but start small, from little things amazing things happen.

creativity requires psychological safety
when i worked in advertising you can be guaranteed that ideas are celebrated and cherished. the day you run out of ideas then youâre out of a job. itâs no wonder the environment is designed to stimulate creativity. but in the real world having permission to be creative is all it takes, because innovation hardly occurs sitting at the desk right? thinking time allows you to connect the dots. design thinking allows for everyone to be bring their ideas to the table, all you need is a âwhat ifâ and away you go.

design thinking
so youâve got a great idea. how do you know itâs the right idea? how does it enhance peopleâs lives? are you thinking short term or long term?
design thinking is the process of using research to understand the real problems that people face. from there we can create meaningful innovation that is purpose led. happy users are happy customers.

asknicely
we make award-winning customer experience software to help frontline teams serve every customer right, powered by customer feedback (specifically, appreciation). the science and psychology of human behavior proves that people are best motivated when you catch them doing things right. when people feel appreciated in their role, their customers (also people) have a great experience and the business (which is really just a collection of people) sees better results on the bottom-line.
it's all connected.
