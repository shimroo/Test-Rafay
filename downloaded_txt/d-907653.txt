about me





mary lou cheatham


hi. how are you? i’d like for you to read my blogs. one is called collardpatch.blogspot.com. a few years ago, i started cooking collard greens and cooked them for two years. i fixed collards every way i could and published recipes and a cookbook about collards. it’s out of print, but people started calling me the collard queen and going to my collard patch blog.

 in the meantime, i wrote other books, mostly historical fiction with a vital element of family and a sprinkling of romance.


 my latest book, all her dreams of love, will soon be released on amazon. it’s a romance taking place in the 1880s in mississippi. a woman waits for her husband to return. she watches for him faithfully. will he return? she goes looking for him. meanwhile, other men seek her company.
