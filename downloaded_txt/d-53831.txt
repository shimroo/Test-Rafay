what you can expect from the new
      outer saver pre-filter: 
oiled foam attracts dirt quickly, causing foam filters to clog in a short period of time robbing power from the engine depending on your driving conditions.

outer saver repels dirt for a much longer period of time giving you many more tanks of gas before cleaning.
the rim helps separate the screen from the foam allowing for better breathing and better separation from the oiled foam. 


when driving in high-moisture or wet conditions,
        foam filters allow water or moisture to travel into the carburetor.


the new outer saver repels moisture and water keeping foam dryer longer. 
the new outer saver pre-filter can easily be put on and taken off by the push of
            a button which bites into the cord keeping the pre-filter wrapped securely.
lead ropes coming out of the lock are short so they do not interfere with any linkage or gearing.
