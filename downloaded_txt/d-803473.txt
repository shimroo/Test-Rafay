law enforcement torch run
the law enforcement torch run® for special olympics virginia unites officers from law enforcement agencies and corrections departments across the state to raise more than a million dollars annually. each summer, law enforcement officials carry the flame of hope across the state culminating with the torch run final leg and the lighting of the cauldron to officially open our summer games in richmond. the 1,900-mile, 8-day torch run involves more than 2,000 law enforcement officers and personnel representing more than 200 law enforcement agencies across virginia.
