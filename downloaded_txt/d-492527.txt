so, who is financing land 
                                    loans in 2014? - quick answer, a few are 
                                    starting to get back into the game including regional, national 
                                    banks, credit unions, and of course the non 
                                    traditional bank loans. or what is know in the 
                                    industry as hard money, bridge loans, swing 
                                    loans or, private money land loans which is 
                                    basically the same terminology for 
                                    non-bankable loans. pricing, interest, and 
                                    term are determined by the amount of risk 
                                    associated with the opportunity.
