**alert ** 3-hour late start (2/6/25) 






guidance regarding conferences and attendance:beacon and simpson conferences: we recognize that a late start combined with an early dismissal can be difficult for families. for this reason, any absences will be excused if parents choose to keep their child at home.if school remains open for the full adjusted schedule, elementary students will still have an early dismissal at 12:10 pm.conferences: all afternoon conferences will continue as scheduled, even if school starts late. if school is canceled, conferences will be rescheduled.junior/senior high students: this schedule change does not affect montesano jr/sr high students, as they have full school days and no afternoon conferences.we appreciate your patience as we navigate the weather conditionsplease continue to monitor [website/social media/local news] for any further updates. your safety is our priority.
