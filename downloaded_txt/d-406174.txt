2023 oso bowling signups  


bowling season (for all athletes currently registered with oxford special olympics) is starting tuesday september 26, 2023 and we have electronic signup forms (see link below).
(unified partners must have unified forms and class “a” forms on file if you plan on competing, please select competition)
practice location – 
**** lakewood lanes 694 lakewood road, waterbury, ct 06704 ****
(if you are new to oso or haven’t trained with oxford special olympics, then please send an email to larryd@oxfordso.org before signing up)
if you are already a part of oxford special olympics then please click the following link to signup for bowling:
https://bit.ly/2023osobowling (the last day to signup is friday september 22)
if you don’t sign up using this form, you won’t be eligible to bowl.
all athlete and volunteer forms must be up to date and on file before thursday september 21, 2023 (you will be unable to train and ineligible for competition until your forms are up to date and on file).
bowling competition weekend november 18 & 19, 2023 (individual athletes on one day and unified teams on the other – which day we will be competing is not known at this time)
(we do not know which venue we will be competing at as of this time)
that includes volunteers and family members.
if you have not filled out the forms or are unsure, please contact mo (momblees@oxfordso.org) or larry (larryd@oxfordso.org) to find out.
do not wait until the last minute for forms, if your forms are expired (athletes, partners and volunteers) you will not be able to bowl!)
practice is every tuesday from september 26 thru november 14, 2023 at 6:15 pm
(there will be no bowling on halloween)
*******************************************
in lieu of everyone paying to bowl, we are asking each bowler to bring something for the food bank to every practice. (please no expired foods)
oxford special olympics pays $12.00 for every bowler each week, so we are asking you all to “pay it forward” and bring items for the food bank.
we can all make a difference if we work together.

some suggestions:

cereal, instant oatmeal, boxed potatoes
canned potatoes, canned vegetables (any kind), canned fruit (avoid glass!)
tuna fish, baked beans, peanut butter
progresso or chunky canned soup, canned stew or chili
soap, shampoo, conditioner
healthy snacks (granola bars, nuts, dried fruit)
pasta, pasta sauce, mac ‘n cheese
ketchup, mustard, relish, mayo
cake mix, frosting
paper towels, toilet paper
toothpaste, toothbrushes, razors, shaving cream
local supermarket gift cards!

together we can make a difference in the lives of local families.share this:click to share on facebook (opens in new window)click to share on twitter (opens in new window)click to share on pinterest (opens in new window)click to share on tumblr (opens in new window)click to email a link to a friend (opens in new window)click to print (opens in new window) 
 

 

2023 winter sports signups (alpine, snowshoeing & cross country) 

it’s been a very long time since we have trained for winter sports, and we are getting ready to start up again in january 2023 – fridays and sundays during january and february are our days to practice – sunday for alpine skiing and friday for snowshoeing / cross country.
so, it’s time to register for 2023 winter sports season (alpine skiing / cross country skiing and snowshoeing), we have to let special olympics ct know how many we will have training and competing. 

our alpine sports registration is due to the state office by november 30, so that gives us about 3 weeks to gather all of the information.

alpine practices will be starting on sunday january 8, 2023 at powder ridge mountain – please check our calendar of events for any updates of dates and times (www.oxfordso.org). 
snowshoe/cross country practices will be starting on friday, january 6, 2023 at oxford center school – please check our calendar of events for any updates of dates and times (www.oxfordso.org). 

2023 special olympics ct winter games will be held march 4 & 5 2023. 
competition will be only one day – we don’t know which day yet!
if you will not be available that weekend or are unable to make either of those days, then you should select “training only”
there is no staying over this year! 
one day only 
no dance, 
no hotel
unified partners and coaches please sign up also, so we are sure we have enough help and that you will be registered
** certified coaches: if you plan on helping at competition, please select “competing” on the registration forms.      
practices will be held on sunday evenings at powder ridge. (check the oso calendar in december for updates)  
(depending on how many slots/tickets we are allotted – if you are signing up for “training only” there is no guarantee that you will be allowed to train.)       you may train in multiple sports, but since the competition is on the same weekend, you will have to choose only 1 sport to compete in. 
if you would like to train in multiple sports then you will need to fill out both forms if that is the case.
please select the sport you will be training/competing in and click the proper link below:
1)      alpine ->  https://bit.ly/2023osoalpine (this form needs to be filled out by tuesday november 30th – there will be no late entries)
2)      snowshoe/x country ->  https://bit.ly/2023osowintersports
can’t hurt to say this again… depending on the number of slots/lift tickets we are allotted, there is no guarantee that you will be allowed to “train only” in alpine. (we also need to make sure we have enough coaches for each sport.)

if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
sports
oxford special olympics will be training in two sports this season – golf and croquet competition will be at the “2022 special olympics connecticut fall sports festival”. 
golf competition will be held at sleeping giant in hamden on sunday september 11, 2022. croquet competition will be held at ocean house in rhode island either saturday or sunday september 17 air 18, 2022 (we will find out which day we compete at a later time). there will be a unified croquet qualifier on saturday august 20, 2022. 
important information – croquet
fyi: croquet competition is held out of state in rhode island. it is a unified event, which means athletes will be paired with a unified partner of equal ability and age. we will need unified partners to sign up for competition in order to form teams.if we do not have partners of similar age and ability, then athletes will be able to train, but may not go to competition.special olympics ct gives each local program an “allotment” of how many teams we are allowed to bring to competition, the last time we competed, we only had 8 teams, which means only 8 athletes were allowed to participate in competition along with 8 partners. we do not know the exact number that we will be able to bring this year, so it is very important to sign up for croquet competition early.
important information – golf
if you do not have golf equipment, please let us know via email, so we can try to get you some.athletes will be signing up for individual skills competition, unless they have previously competed in “unified alternate shot”. in order to be considered for unified competition the following rule shall apply (and is at the discretion of the head coaches) alternate shot golf with a unified partner: 
the standard for eligibility is for an athlete and unified partner to have completed an individual skills competition with a total score of at least 60 points. in addition, the athlete should score 10 points or more in at least four out of the six skills, with one of the four scores of 10 being in either the wood or iron shot. the athlete should also achieve a minimum of five points in the two skills that total less than 10. if the athlete is scoring above 100 in the isc (minus the bunker shot), it is recommended that they begin participating in level 2 competitions.
if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
