    no labels,
no limits

we do not work with labels. we work with children and adults to improve perception and understanding. we were founded in 1997 and have been pioneers in the field.in response to her son's behaviors consistent with those of children on the autism spectrum, mary bolles researched the nature of mild brain dysfunction and its relationship to sensory processing problems in the brain stem area. she explored a variety of developmental learning approaches and became determined to find a new learning system that would dramatically change the way her son saw the world—a method that would go beyond medication, tutoring, and behavior modification.after extensive independent study and an internship with the john-david learning institute in carlsbad, ca, mary discovered that combining three individual modalities (visual, auditory, and vestibular) into one multi-sensory experience was capable of providing the positive results she'd been seeking for her son. mary bolles founded the 
sensory learning institute international, inc. 
her phenomenal work has since been continued to this day by her daughter, julie stoots. the practice has provided a method for learning for people who have suffered brain trauma, who have been diagnosed with developmental disabilities, and in other circumstances.we work with children and adults to improve perception, understanding, and the ability to learn. the sensory learning program is not a treatment. it is not a cure. it is an innovative approach to developmental learning that unites three modalities (visual, auditory, and vestibular) into one intervention, allowing individuals to better integrate sensory messages. when this happens, lives change.

prior to the intervention, a listening profile and a visual field measuring photocurrent are taken. these 'perception maps' help provide baselines that are used to customize the program for the individual child. these evaluations are done throughout the program to track improvements in sensory regulation.

testimonials
    "i cannot believe "j" is 19! we are so excited that he is doing well and proud of all that he has been able to achieve over the past eight or so years. one thing that always stands out to me about "j" is when he befriended a little boy that was also going through sensory learning at the same time. he was extremely kind and nurturing to him.  i know "j", along with you and the girls, had quite an impact on that family! "n" and "n" were also a joy, and we are proud of them and all that they are now accomplishing! we still have their origami pieces scattered throughout our offices."@brodievisiontherapyandsens13359 years ago
 "my son is 19 now. he was 11 or 12 when he did vision educational programs and sensory learning. he was dyslexic and couldn't concentrate. since doing the programs, he is a completely different kid. i contribute his success to these programs.  he wouldn't be where he is today without dr. schakel and his staff's help. friends of ours have always commented how he has matured so much. his sisters also did the sensory learning program. they are doing much better than they were in school and at home.  i would recommend dr. schmakel's programs to anyone who has kids struggling in school and coping with life. please check it out for yourself. don't base your decisions on one person's opinions."

   "we did not end up needing vip since dr. schmakel properly diagnosed my son as needing bifocals. who would think that a 14-year-old would need them? certainly not any of the other eye doctors that my son had previously been to in the 5 years he had been wearing glasses. my son kept telling me that he was having problems with his glasses but until we found dr. schmakel, no one was 
able.to figure out the real problem. my son is now 20 and is still very pleased with the eye care and attention to detail that dr. schmakel and his staff take at every visit."@outlandishmccandlish38739 years ago
 "i am an adult and went through the sensory learning program after having a stroke on my right optic nerve.  i benefited from focusing my mind on specific information. it improved my memory and my vision improved a bit immediately.  i am still getting more benefit from the program and my vision is improving"@sandrakrichbaum93039 years ago
