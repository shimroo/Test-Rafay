history

we are a steward of the honey hollow watershed, a national historic landmark – the first upland watershed in agricultural use and multiple private ownership to demonstrate that cooperative local action, supported by federal assistance, is a practical method of achieving national goals in water, soil science, wildlife conservation, and flood prevention. honey hollow was designated as a registered national historic landmark in august 1969.



conservation

we maintain a thriving nature preserve with six miles of hiking trails open to the public daily from dawn to dusk for trail walking, bird watching, or simply enjoying. see our trail map. the grounds also boast an organic vegetable garden, audubon pond, meadows, forests, agricultural fields and, of course, honey hollow creek.
see our advocacy position statement.



education

we manage the honey hollow environmental education center and offer programs for all ages.  each year bucks audubon provides high-quality educational programs for over 5,000 people, from our popular summer and holiday camps for children to lectures and birding trips for adults.
see our education page for more information on our programs.
