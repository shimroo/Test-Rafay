dear valued guest, 
 thank you for considering the old town inn for your place to stay in san diego.
 we are proud to be a third generation, family owned and operated san diego hotel. our guests appreciate us for our value, our cleanliness, and our friendly staff. our hotel was built in the classic roadside inn style, with exterior corridors and park your car near your room. with an average weather of 70+ degrees year-round, you are typically stepping out into our warm san diego sunshine! 
 we offer a complimentary continental breakfast, free internet, free parking, dvd players in all rooms and a free movie library. we never charge hidden fees!
 the hotel's location is a bit unusual, right on pacific highway, in an industrial pocket. we're a 10-minute walk to historic old town state park and across the street from amtrak and the old town transit center, making it easy to get around town without a car. across from us is a shuttle stop for the free san diego flyer that can easily pick you up/drop you off at the san diego airport (san). we are also a quick 10-minute drive to historic liberty station, with its parklike setting, museums, and the popular liberty public market! 
 our goal is to make sure we are the right hotel for you, for your family, for this trip. please browse our website (especially our location tab and our e-map which has valuable information about where we are located), read our online reviews, and above all, please call us and speak to one of our friendly and helpful front desk agents. let our wonderful staff help you determine if we are the right hotel for your stay in san diego.
 yours humbly,
