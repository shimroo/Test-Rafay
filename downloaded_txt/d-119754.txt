	 ethan's new word of the day
    


ethan created a new word last night - commerate.  while looking for a box he could make his 'treasure chest', he asked if i could 'commerate' some of my stuff so that he could have an empty box.  when i asked him what that meant he had the most assured look on his face and explained to me that it basically meant reorganizing things from one place to another.  but of course!labels: ethan

	 close call
    


we had a terrifying experience this past friday night.  our youngest son, connor, had an allergic reaction and went into anaphlatic (sp?) shock. connor is allergic to eggs, milk and peanuts, so we are constantly reading labels and keeping track of food that is around him. we have a fairly good idea what set it off this time. he has had severe reactions before but never like this. thankfully lisa and my mother-in-law made it to the emergency room in time where they gave him a shot of epinephrine, put him on oxygen and a steroid. lisa said that he was like a rag doll in her arms. about four hours later we were on our way home with our little angel sitting next to us dancing and singing along with the radio. it is really scary to think about how close we were to losing him. i honestly don't know what i would do if i lost another child. unfortunately with connor's food allergies we will always have this fear in the back of our mind, but thankfully he made through this time.

connor got his first haircut on thursday, so he looks like a totally different little boy now. hopefully people won't mistake him for a girl anymore. on friday, lisa took the boys to get their picture taken together. as you can see they are really growing up fast.labels: ethan and connor

	 update on our boys
    


hey everyone....well now that christmas is over we are back into the swing on things. ethan will be 5 years old this year! we sometimes can't believe that he will be that old and going to school in the fall! connor is now 15 months old. he had his doctor's appt. at the shriner's hospital for children about 1 1/2 weeks ago. we went because his feet/ankles might have had something wrong going on with them. so after extensive x-rays and at least 2 doctor's checking his feet over they came back and told up that he was perfect and the results of the x-rays couldn't be more normal. he isn't walking yet, but he has started to stand all by himself. yeah!! probably this time next month he will be walking. i can't wait to see what this year...2007...has to hold for our family. god has blessed us so much already with our 2 wonderful, healthy boys!labels: ethan and connor

my four year old son, ethan, gave me quite the christmas present over the holidays. i had an issue of wizard sitting around one day while ethan was drawing and to my surprise he started flipping through it. he apparently found the inspiration he was looking for and drew these:supermanspider-manhuman torchgreen lanternneedless to say, i'm one proud poppa!labels: ethan
