john "jack" alexander obrien



									may 16, 1938  december 12, 2024

jack 
									obrien, a proud irish american, dedicated 
									community member, loving family man, and 
									military veteran, passed away on december 
									12, 2024, at his longtime home in upper 
									marlboro, md. he was 86 years old.

									born in washington, dc, on may 16, 1938, to 
									thomas and anne obrien, who immigrated from 
									ireland in the 1930s, jack was deeply proud 
									of his heritage and carried the values of 
									hard work, devotion, and community service 
									throughout his life. he was predeceased by 
									his beloved wife, regina cord obrien, and 
									their son, stephen cord obrien. he is 
									survived by his devoted son, timothy casey 
									obrien, and his three cherished 
									grandchildren, casey, alexander, and zachary 
									obrien. jack was also the dear brother of 
									michael obrien, the late thomas joseph 
									obrien, and kathleen wood, and a loving 
									brother-in-law to eleanor coene, ann 
									obrien, marilyn obrien, and thomas wood. 
									he was a steadfast supporter and mentor to 
									numerous other family members and friends, 
									offering wisdom and guidance whenever it was 
									needed.

									jacks education was grounded in washington, 
									dc, where he attended st. martins grade 
									school and graduated from mckinley tech high 
									school. after completing his education, jack 
									proudly served in the army national guard, 
									where he demonstrated the same sense of duty 
									and dedication that would mark the rest of 
									his life. his military service was a source 
									of pride, reinforcing his lifelong 
									commitment to his country and community.

									following his time in the national guard, 
									jack began a successful career at the 
									government printing office and served as a 
									union official for over 38 years. his career 
									was a testament to his work ethic, 
									dedication, and commitment to supporting his 
									fellow workers.

									jack was deeply involved in the irish 
									american community and made significant 
									contributions to preserving and honoring 
									irish culture and history. he was a devoted 
									member of several irish american 
									organizations, most notably the ancient 
									order of hibernians, where he served as a 
									national life member, as well as being a 
									member of the irish american unity 
									conference and the irish american club. in 
									recognition of his lifelong commitment to 
									irish heritage, jack was honored as the 
									grand marshal of the washington, dc, st. 
									patricks day parade, a distinction he 
									cherished deeply.

									jacks leadership and political acumen were 
									instrumental in numerous projects aimed at 
									maintaining and celebrating irish heritage. 
									among his many contributions, he was proud 
									to have curated the irish brigade monument 
									at antietam national battlefield. his work 
									on the monument, dedicated to the brave 
									irish soldiers who fought in the civil war, 
									was a labor of love, ensuring that the 
									legacy of the irish brigade and their 
									sacrifices would not be forgotten. he was 
									also a driving force behind the creation and 
									preservation of several other irish 
									monuments in the washington, dc, area. one 
									of his most notable projects was the 
									commodore john barry memorial at the naval 
									entrance gate in annapolis, md. more 
									recently, jack worked to help rededicate the 
									nuns of the battlefield monument wayside 
									marker outside st. matthew's cathedral in 
									dc, which honors the courage and sacrifice 
									of irish american nuns who served during the 
									civil war.

									throughout his life, jack was a passionate 
									advocate for a united ireland and for 
									keeping irish history alive for future 
									generations.

									jack and reginas lives were profoundly 
									shaped by the loss of their beloved son, 
									stephen cord obrien. the grief they 
									experienced from his passing was a heavy 
									burden, but jacks strength and unwavering 
									support for regina during this difficult 
									time reflected his deep love and commitment 
									to his family. although the loss of stephen 
									left an irreplaceable void, jack and regina 
									found comfort and joy in their enduring 
									relationship with pam, and their cherished 
									grandsons, alexander, and zachary. the love 
									they shared with pam and the grandsons 
									brought light into their lives during the 
									darkest of times.

									jack was not only a pillar of strength in 
									the community, but also a deeply devoted 
									husband. in the final years of his wife 
									reginas life, jack became her unwavering 
									caregiver, providing her with love, 
									compassion, and comfort during her illness. 
									his dedication to regina, as well as his 
									ability to balance his personal 
									responsibilities with grace and tenderness, 
									exemplified the depth of his character. the 
									way jack cared for regina, especially in her 
									final days, was a testament to the enduring 
									love they shared.

									above all, jack was known for his warmth, 
									generosity, and the unwavering love he had 
									for his family. his strength, wisdom, and 
									sense of humor left a lasting impact on all 
									who knew him. he will be remembered not only 
									for his dedication to irish american affairs 
									but also for his role as a loving father, 
									grandfather, and brother.

									may jack obriens memory be a blessing to 
									all who knew him.

the rare ould times from the irish people newspaper, feb. 9, 1991
 by the late joe stynes
it was the year 1922, and the ira was split in two. the company i belonged to, c company of the 2nd battalion, had several of its members go over to the free state army. several became neutral, and the rest remained in the ira, loyal to their oath of allegiance to defend the republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic. the ira had taken over the four courts when they established their headquarters.
on june 27,1922, c company of the 2nd battalion, dublin brigade, meeting at 42 north great george's street, were ordered to remain for the night. next morning, on orders from lloyd george, prime minister of england, the free state army with british cannon attacked the four courts and the fight was on between the free state and the ira. the 2nd battalion took over o'connell street and parnell street.
 our company c was assigned to healy's public house in parnell street, where we set up barricades inside and outside the building. before we left 42 n. great george's street, i cycled home to get two lee-enfield rifles. our equipment was very poor; we had only five or six rifles, seven revolvers and one machine gun. the first night we were attacked by the domestic enemy with two armored cars. we withstood the attack, but not before they had blown away the barricade on one of the windows. we began boring holes in the walls connecting the building. when there was sufficient opening, i went into the next house, and crouched up in the corner was a young woman and her children. i assumed nothing would happen and brought her food and milk. she was so grateful she gave me a piece of caul (it's something that comes with the birth of a baby) and told me it would keep me safe. i still have it.. --- continue
 



saoirse newspaper

saoirse  irish freedom is the voice of the irish republican movement. 
		the monthly newspaper of the republican movement, it takes its name from 
		irish freedom  saoirse, a fenian paper which first appeared in november 
		1910 and continued as a monthly publication until december 1914 when it 
		was suppressed by the british authorities. among the contributors to 
		that paper were bulmer hobson, ps hegerty, terence mcswiney, pádraig 
		pearse, ernest blythe, piaras beaslaí, pat devlin, fred cogley, jw good 
		and roger casement.


		irish republicans have always attempted to produce a newspaper, as a 
		means of speaking to the people. as revolutionaries we have had to rely 
		on our own resources to counter-act the status quo message promoted by 
		the establishment media.

		more than 200 years ago, on january 4, 1792, the first number of the 
		northern star appeared. the paper, produced by the belfast society of 
		united irishmen, promoted unity among irish people of all religions. it 
		was a popular target for the opponents of irish unity and freedom. the 
		proprietors of the northern star and its printer, john rabb, were 
		charged with sedition in january, 1793. its offices were again raided on 
		september 16, 1796 in a general clamp-down on the united irishmen in 
		belfast. the presses of the northern star were smashed by a pro-british 
		militia on may 19, 1797.

		a new paper, the press, appeared on september 28, 1797.

		in a short article in the first issue of the republic, on december 13, 
		1906, produced by the dungannon clubs, bulmer hobson wrote:

		ireland today claims her place among the free peoples of the earth. she 
		has never surrendered that claim, nor will ever surrender it; and today 
		forces are working in ireland that will not be still until her claim is 
		acknowledged and her voice heard in the councils of the nations.

		to that end the republic has been started. it has not been brought into 
		existence to make a party among the political parties of ireland, nor to 
		carry on a party propaganda nor to waste time quarreling with any 
		political party. it has been started to gather together all that is best 
		and greatest, most progressive and far-seeing in ireland round the 
		republican banner and to build up, not a republican party, but an 
		independent irish republic.

		we stand for an irish republic because we see that no compromise with 
		england, no repeal of the union, no concession of home rule or 
		devolution will satisfy the national aspiration of the irish people nor 
		allow the unrestricted mental, moral and material development of our 
		country. national independence is our right; we ask no more and we will 
		accept no less.

		an independent irish republic, then, is our aim  governed by the whole 
		people of ireland in the interests of the whole people, without let or 
		hindrance, supervision or interference on the part of any other power 
		under heaven. we owe allegiance to no country save ireland, and we will 
		yield none to any other.

		the old hate and the old bigotry that have kept catholic and protestant 
		divided  the old grovelling spirit of toadyism must be killed and 
		forgotten by the people. the ineffective and outward political 
		movements, unionist and nationalist, must be superseded and silenced 
		and, in their place, a national movement, virile and militant, that 
		recognises no creed save that of irishman, and no party save the nation, 
		must be established.
