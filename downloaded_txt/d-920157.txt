                        - dallas, tx






i happened to find a book on piqueassiette (literally
                        meaning "stolen plate") mosaic art in 1999 and said to myself, "i can do that"....."i want to do that"......."i need to do
                        that".......and it has become an obsession.  my collection of broken china in the basement now had a purpose - i didn't have
                        to throw them out!  they would have a second chance to become beautiful again!  the simple act of putting them back together
                        is therapeutic for me, as i find it difficult to part with anything from my past.  i have since broadened my tesserae selection
                        to smalti, vitreous glass, art glass and pretty much anything that will break........i hope you enjoy my work!  please check
                        back often, as i will be adding new pieces........

                        of china "shards"for piqueassiette (black and white wedgwood transferware)"only damaged china was used inthis
                        process".........
