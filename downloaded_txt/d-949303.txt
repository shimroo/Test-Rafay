all because two people fell in love...

we met in february 1989, started dating in may, and got married in september. and josh came *almost* 11 months later, just in case y'all were wondering. and then no more came. we waited, and waited, and then lauren decided to make her debut in may 1995 (5 weeks early), and then kayley 1997, jacob 1998, krissy 2001, lindsey 2004 & joey 2006. we lived in texas until 2005, and then we moved to arkansas, just about 25 miles north of texarkana, texas. fortunately all my children are texans (and my handsome husband) because texans are just cool. wish i was a texan... but husband had to settle with a california gal, which i think is pretty cool too.

little mari




many of you know that my brother and his wife cindy adopted a little baby girl with numerous handicaps when she was months old.  she was born the day before their 5th child eathyn, so mariela & eathyn have always been "the twins."  this was when they were about 2 years old.



this past march brett & cindy told us that little mari was soon leaving us.  we knew she had been having lots of medical problems for a few months, but we also knew that her time on earth was not going to be long.  we were all sad, and waited for the call.  brett absolutely loved mari, he loves all his kids, but mari was special to him.  she always smiled when he walked in the door.  you knew she was happy and good when she was smiling.  this was one last picture i have of brett & mari, the day before she passed. 



cindy's parents had already come in, and my sister holly had already bought her ticket from utah.  the funeral was going to be saturday, and holly was going to speak.  this was already planned before mari had even left us, but her body was shutting down, and hospice had been brought in.  just before she died, cindy called holly to tell her that it was time, and asked if she wanted to speak to her.  cindy held the phone up to mari's ear, and as soon as holly began to sing a sweet song to her, her eyes lit up.  holly always loved to hold mari and would sing sweet songs/coos to her.  she was an angel that had been sent to our family.  



the call came to say she had passed.  her family was around her as her sweet spirit left her earthly body and earth life.  she was sealed to her family in june 2010, so we all know we will be able to see her again...

is it winter or spring?




only in the south and texas can you ask
that question because...



eleven days after lindsey was baptized, and being spring-like weather, it snowed.  the winter had been a very mild one, so a lot of us were shocked when snow was predicted.  but sure enough, we woke up to snow.  schools all over the area were cancelled except our district.  my kids stayed home.  shawn was also home from work that day.  that was february 13th. 



by february 17th, kids were outside like this:



and the birds were starting to come out and play, and be a bit crazy.  this one flew into our front door, and jacob heard it.  he went outside to see what it was, 

and there the bird was on our porch.

lindsey's baptism day!




february 2, 2012  i don't know how i forgot to blog about this, but i did.  her birthday was on a thursday, and shawn just so happened to be off that day.  i wrestled in my mind as when it would be the best time and if i needed to tell shawn way in advance to ask for a sunday off, but in the end i chose her birthday day.  my mom came up for it.  dad was just to busy with work.  josh was home too.  we always take the baptized child out to eat afterwards of their choice.  lindsey chose chick-fil-a.  i tried to get her to go elsewhere, but she insisted.  lauren took the other kids home, and the 3 of us plus josh and my mom all went out.  afterwards we went home for cake and presents.











a great day to be 8!!

happy 5th birthday!!



the day after christmas we decided to make a quick 3 day trip to college station to visit laura & dwain, since shawn hadn't seen them forever, and then 2 days to killeen.  we had a good visit with l&d, and on tuesday (27th) we headed up over to killeen.  it also was joey's birthday. he was so excited for turning 5!i was suppose to make a cake after we got to my parents, but i was way to tired.  so mom and i were going to go to the mall to get a cookie cake for him.  we went to walmart first, and they had all those christmas iced cookies on sale, so mom bought a lot...and we came home and stuck 5 candles on one of them...and sang happy birthday to him.  he was happy because 1) we were at mimi & grampa's house, and 2) his bestest cousin jared (only 6 weeks younger) was there, and he got to go spend the night at his house. this picture was suppose to be first.  for dinner we ate at chick-fil-a... his favorite place to eat in the whole wide world!  even better than mcdonald's!! but this cute little boy has not forgotten that i told him i would make him a cars cake (i have the pan), so i guess i better get myself siked to do that soon!!happy birthday joey!!  we love you!!

nativity



on december 22nd, our family did the nativity again at the church. and i had these pictures in order, but they didn't come out in the order i wanted.  we did this last year too, and krissy made front page of the newspaper on christmas day.  it was pretty cool.kayley, lauren & jacob as the wisemen.amanda just so happened to be visiting josh and us for a week (left the next day), so she was able to be in it too.  here they are as mary & joseph.the wisemen again.krissy, lindsey, cousin maddie & joey as the cute shepherds. and mary & joseph again.shawn had to work this year on our scheduled night, so i opted not to be in it.  i took the pictures with my blackberry, thus not the great so looking pictures.  and this was it for christmas pictures.  i wasn't good with the camera this year, but we had a great day.
