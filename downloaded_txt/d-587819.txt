if you are getting this screen it means you are getting the default index.html file.
what is happening is that when you type www.50megs.com/users2/username it actually loads
www.50megs.com/users2/username/index.html (index.html must be lowercase)  -  this is the default file
that is loaded when you type www.50megs.com/users2/username  -  this
being the case, to stop getting this page you need to create your
own index.html and copy it over the current index.html that is
your directory.  you can do this by logging into your online
manager and deleting the current index.html and uploading your
own index.html file.

thanks,
