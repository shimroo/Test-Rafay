with field-proven resilient positioning, navigation and timing products, safran provides precise timing, synchronization, simulation, inertial solutions, and more pnt products for both commercial and defense industries. innovating the future of resilient pnt
 
pnt, short for positioning, navigation, and timing, is the backbone of modern navigation systems and relies heavily on global navigation satellite systems (gnss), such as gps. these systems provide essential services across various industries, ensuring precise data for navigation and time-sensitive operations. resilient pnt, also known as assured pnt, addresses vulnerabilities by introducing redundancy and diversity into systems. 
safran, formerly orolia and spectracom, is the global leader in resilient pnt because of our diverse technology portfolio and decades of expertise. by diversifying signal sources and implementing robust backup systems, we enhance the resilience of pnt against potential threats, safeguard critical operations, and mitigate the impacts of gnss vulnerabilities.

precision timing and synchronization
with over 20,000 units deployed in over 100+ countries, our time servers are field proven for sub-nano second accuracy and reliable synchronization.
