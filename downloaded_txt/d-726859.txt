the california native plant society (cnps) is a state-wide 501(c)3 non-profit organization
    of lay persons and professionals who share an interest in california’s
    native plants. the society, working through its local chapters, seeks to
    increase the understanding of california’s native flora and to preserve
    this rich resource for future generations. membership is open to all.
the bristlecone chapter covers all of mono and inyo counties
  and northeastern kern county, an area that includes the east slope of the sierra
  nevada, the northern mojave desert, the inyo and white mountains, and the owens
  valley. the southern end of the bristlecone chapter’s geographically
  large territory, in and around the indian wells valley, has its own sub-chapter, creosote
  ring.
