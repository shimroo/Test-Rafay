free software foundation europe


        free software foundation europe is a charity that empowers users to
        control technology.
      

        software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives. free software
        gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt, and share
        software. these rights help support other fundamental rights like
        freedom of speech, freedom of press, and privacy.

corner: mia or dead contributors - does it matter for your software project?
community

if your software project operates on multiple contributions, and a contributor
becomes uncontactable or passes away, this can become an issue in
certain situations. here weâll discuss when a missing or deceased
contributor affects your software project, and what options you
have.

      the fsfe does great work to further software freedom locally, nationally and in the eu and i enjoy the podcast and the news rss so it felt natural to become a supporter. i also want to be more involved with the free software community.

      if software is licensed as free software, we can audit it, and be sure
      that it does what it's intended to do (and nothing else). public
      institutions develop software, and hire companies to make it, and the
      citizens should own and reuse all that code. i contribute to free
      software with translations, user help desk, finding free software
      alternatives at the university... but i cannot reach the policy-makers,
      nor people and institutions in other countries.

      the most fun part about engaging for fsfe is meeting real people and exchanging substantial information about relevant issues. these can be anything from rooting your cell phone, to learning git, to understanding free software based business, to speaking up for the use of open standards in public organisations.
