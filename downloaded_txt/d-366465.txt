i've finally decided to move my blog!!!please email me if you would like the link.  it's not a private blog, but...i'm not totally comfortable with a complete transfer of readership.  i guess it's the control freak in me.  if you don't feel you can email me, well, you're just going to have to work to find me.  that said, if you don't feel like you can email me, i guess what that really means is maybe it's time for you to ask yourself why that is. it's a big world, and the internet isn't good for keeping secrets.  i'm not exactly an underground personality, considering my job(s)!  so...i'm find-able.thanks for all the reads over the years.  it's been... interesting!xoxolindsaysassylittlepunkin[at]gmail[dot]com

sassy little punkin: 

someone once told me: "stay sassy. it keeps 'em guessing."
...and, yes, people really do call me 'punkin.'
