rated #1 attraction in mount ida, arkansas
tripadvisor (4.5/5 stars) - google (4.6/5 stars) - facebook (4.8/5 stars)




            “so many good things to say about the place i’m not sure where to begin. my family and i have been 8 times so far and are ready to go back for our 9th. wonderful atmosphere, great prices and a staff that couldn’t be any better. not to discredit any of the other staff but kevin, lance, and morgan always make it a great experience for my family and i. plus with the amount of crystals you can find at the price you pay makes the 2 1/2 hour trip worth it. if you don’t mind getting dirty and doing a little work to find beautiful crystals then this is definitely a place you should visit.”

            “i absolutely love this place. great place, employees are always so very friendly. we always find beautiful crystals. fyi i love the dogs they are friendly. kids love to do digs and we make necklaces out of what we find. thank you for the wonderful experiences we have here.”

            “we made the 2 hour trek to check out the wegner quartz mine and it was well worth the drive. the staff was friendly and genuine. the whole place felt like family. we arrived in between hosted trips up to the big mine so we went off on our own past the sluice and dug around. there are quartz crystals everywhere and it’s remarkably peaceful digging around in the dirt. after you’ve lost track of time and decide it’s time to head back, you get to keep anything you’ve found. they also have a large selection of every mineral you can think of for the best prices we found in the area. the old tree that’s been carved into a statue of a native american angel is pretty awesome as well. we’ll definitely stop by for another visit.”

            “this was a great experience. we will definitely be returning. we did the 6 hour phantom mining experience. i filled my 5 gallon bucket up so much that i couldn’t carry it!! hahaha, it was great! the guide was helpful, he showed me what i was looking for and explained so much to me. not only was this a blast, but it was a great learning experience. the ride to and from the mine was entertaining too! the staff were kind and extremely helpful. it was more than what i expected.”

            “great experience. 
            the staff was exceptional and took the time to talk to the kids about the geodes we purchased. i highly recommend it.”
