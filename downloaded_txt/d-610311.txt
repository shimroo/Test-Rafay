most higher ed leaders are struggling to differentiate their institutions.

and the struggle + slow pacing are impacting the overall budget.

that's why we created the differentiation toolkit.

in just eight weeks, not 12-18 months, you can:

‚Üí pin down what truly makes your school unique with brand anthropology.
‚Üí focus your efforts with a targeted competitor analysis.
‚Üí align your offerings with real labor market demands.

          great listing of real practical obstacles for pses when it comes to #microcredentials deployment and the stuff about "let's get past the framework".

but i'd love to see more about different models for #microcredentials, beyond just "microcredentials as add-ons to degrees". 
are we still just talking about serial students here? maybe alumni topping up? 

i think there's a  lot more "there" there in terms of models, and i would love these folks to dig into that. see chris long's stuff from penn state and later, or the work mark brown and his colleagues in ireland and elsewhere have done...

          i think about this frequently---as educators, how do we best prepare students for a life with ai without short-cutting the quality of the true knowledge base that students need to have to be successful in their chosen careers?

how can we use ai to improve instructional design and curriculum as a whole? what learning options can be included? think of all the learning supports that can be incorporated to support those first and second year students...if you are able to retain those students at your institution, think of the added revenue that would create.  

the value of ai may be simply added retention.  consider the business adage, it's easier to keep a current customer than get a new one.  ai may be the tool to help higher ed retain more of their "customers"

how higher ed can adapt to the challenges of ai (chronicle.com)

          did you know the k-12 professional development market is worth $18 billion? yet only 29% of teachers are satisfied with current pd offerings. it's time to reimagine professional development that works. 

in my latest blog post, i dive deep into:
‚Ä¢ why traditional pd is failing our educators
‚Ä¢ how credit-bearing programs boost teacher retention
‚Ä¢ a real-world case study showing 20% improvement in student achievement
‚Ä¢ the roi of strategic professional development

plus, discover how one high school teacher transformed her career and expanded college access for low-income students through targeted pd‚Äîat a fraction of traditional costs.

want to create pd programs that teachers value while achieving your district's goals? the solution might be simpler than you think.

          i love reading old articles by david brooks. in his article "the modesty manifesto," written in 2011, he discusses how american culture has shifted towards higher self-esteem and overconfidence. according to him, americans, especially students, often rate themselves highly despite not performing well in objective measures. brooks connects this cultural shift to social and political issues, such as increased consumption, debt, and partisanship, and argues that this self-centered mindset has weakened collective responsibility and intergenerational awareness, contributing to fiscal and social challenges. in a related note: i often wonder why humility and curiosity are not the norm in washington debates. it's so important to cultivate intellectual modesty. i note there is often more emphasis on what people believe should be brazil's stance rather than listening to understand what is actually is, its perspectives. no one has to agree with that. there is a lack of listening, modesty, and intellectual curiosity in many discussions. https://lnkd.in/efr6ey-w

          this really stood out to me in this article. importance considerations...what will we do as we look forward to the future with ai?

two big questions stood out:
how will ai affect the teaching of foundational skills?¬†if ai can do a lot of elementary work, such as summarizing, outlining, defining, and classifying, does that mean students can skip to the next steps? or do they still need to learn those skills? and if so, how should ai be treated in gateway courses?

who is going to train professors to teach with or about ai?¬†i met several people whose institutions had little to no budget for such work. and given how quickly the landscape is changing, it seems as if one-time workshops might not be enough. add to that the lack of time and energy many instructors have to devote to professional development, and we‚Äôre facing a problematic fall semester.

          "dancing between clarity, inquiry, and mystery" is a particularly relevant pattern these days, from the wise democracy pattern language deck. it's also the subject of my friend, mentor, and colleague tom atlee's recent blog post, linked below in the comments section... which i highly recommend reading. 

other patterns i'm particularly drawn to these days include "appreciative thinking" https://lnkd.in/ggtyhtyt which is not always so easy to do, though usually quite worthwhile...

as well as "working creatively with diversity and disturbance", https://lnkd.in/g8jb4ri2  which has to do with, appreciating the creative possibilities often hidden in challenging circumstances. 

wishing everyone here well, in this northern hemisphere time of shorter days and longer nights...

          ‚Äúsustaining and scaling innovation in education is not about jumping on the latest technology bandwagon. it‚Äôs about thoughtful, deliberate growth that places student learning at the center. by creating structured pathways for innovation and fostering collaboration between it and instructional teams, school districts can ensure that the tools they adopt are not only exciting but transformative‚Äîand built to last.‚Äù

thank you to education technology insights for the opportunity to share our framework.

          this is such an important discussion for any to consider if you are providing feedback on the ed proposed regs.  specific examples on your institution's situation and what it would take to implement would be great.
the comment that there is often pushback on how hard/expensive any change is rings true -- so providing actual examples is important.

          the us department of education outlined 5 key areas for ed tech providers to consider in developing this shared responsibility with schools:

- designing for education.¬†developers should begin to understand specific education values and challenges. educator and student feedback should be included in all aspects of product development.

- providing evidence of rationale and impact.¬†educational institutions need evidence of an ed tech tool‚Äôs advertised solutions.

- advancing equity and protecting civil rights.¬†ed tech providers should be aware of representation and bias in data sets, algorithmic discrimination, and how to ensure accessibility for students with disabilities.

- ensuring safety and security.¬†ed tech providers need to lay out how they will protect the safety and security of users of ai tools.

- promoting transparency and earning trust.¬†to build trust with district leaders, ed tech providers, educators and other stakeholders need to collaborate.

          just finishing up my slide deck for aurora institute's curriculum symposium. i am so excited to be presenting on how ai can be used to bring udl to life in the classroom. 
major takeaways:
- udl helps to develop self-regulated learners who thrive in their lives both in school and beyond
- genai can help us to understand barriers to learning and plan ways to support our learners overcome them

it's going to be jam packed with strategies and take and use prompts. will anyone else be joining be in louisiana?!

          as we approach elections next week, this article talks about how math understanding is a civil rights issue -

1.  marginalized students lack access to quality math experiences, which perpetuates a cycle of inequality.
2. lack of understanding of math affects a society's ability to understand, critique, and use data in solving our most pressing challenges - from elections, to healthcare, to climate,  to many others that affect daily life.

too many people fear and avoid math at all costs, and we as an american society are ok or indifferent with this notion. 

do we know the actual cost for not having a math literate society?  

thanks luis duany for sharing this article with me!
