 “my son had been in several programs before coming to chileda, but it was here where he developed the skills to identify and talk about the triggers that would get him upset. chileda provided leadership opportunities that helped build his self esteem, and the staff were positive and upbeat. i would highly recommend chileda, even if it’s not close to your home. we were very pleased with the skills and thoughtfulness he learned while there.” tamaraparent






 “as i watched the staff members work, i felt a swell come over me. this team work and patience could not be replicated in any school i have ever worked in. this observation reinforced the thought that i have had for many years: if i ever had a child with multiple severe disabilities who could not be sustained at home, i would want him or her to be at chileda.” betty deboerph.d. in school psychology






 “chileda is a one of a kind place. the feeling you get when you walk in and a student excitedly yells your name can change your entire day around! hearing a student express how they're feeling or use a full sentence for the first time is such an amazing feeling. in addition to watching the students learn and grow as being a great part of the job, i have also developed friendships that will last a lifetime. i can't imagine what my life would be like without chileda.” chileda staff
