          “when i think about the most important traits in a ceo, what matters to me most is a leader who can create a clear vision & mission for the company and then inspire its employees along that path.  david is the embodiment of this trait.  i also highly value a leader who cedes ground where appropriate, even if he's capable of engaging at depth.  david frankly has the mental horsepower to engage on most topics at most depths, but always provided the space for myself and others to learn, grow, and succeed.  i would work with him again in a heartbeat.”

          this 👂 podcast episode and insight’s from a16z bio + health's julie yoo spoke so clearly to the fundamental challenge facing both 🩺 clinicians and 🏥 healthcare systems. 
there is a huge disconnect between supply, in the availability of clinicians, and demand, in the increasing volume and complexity of healthcare needs.
-     36% of physicians plan to reduce their hours next year according to the ama
-     48% of physicians reported feeling burned out in a 2024 medscape survey

at the same time, the demographic baby boomer bubble and steady increase in the prevalence of major chronic disease, which consumes up to 90% of healthcare expenditures according to some estimates, is driving demand.

with this context, yoo points to a major opportunity for ai adoption in healthcare in 2025. yeah, a vc hyping a wave of new ai companies that will replace the decades of training and experience of clinicians, the skeptic would say.  

but yoo is thoughtful in pointing to the role ai can play, and is already playing, through solutions such as ambient, autonomous scribe solutions (of which local star abridge is leading the pack) in not replacing, but freeing up productivity for clinicians. there is so much unstructured context in both the complexity of disease and treatment options and the social/emotional considerations that we shouldn't be looking for ai to *replace* clinicians. but companies are getting better at finding the structured, repetitive and time-consuming places where ai tools can *help* clinicians. 

nearly two-thirds of doctors cited bureaucratic tasks as the leading contributor to burnout. rigorously trained-ai driven solutions can be a force multiplier for clinicians, and i’ve seen several interviews where nurses and doctors go as far as to say some of these solutions are ”restoring their joy in practicing medicine”. 

our health is precious; and we rightly want any technology engaging with it to be developed thoughtfully and thoroughly tested. this requires top ai talent and diverse and realistic training data. pittsburgh’s strengths in both areas is why we are an emerging hub for data-driven healthcare.

          🏥 the future of healthcare is preventive, not reactive.

this week, wellworthy spoke with truemed's justin mares, agelessrx's co-founder sajad zalzala m.d., and 23andme's noura abul-husn to break down proactive healthcare.

the reality: half of americans have at least one chronic disease. but there's a better way forward through prevention and proactive health choices.

here's what the experts recommend:
🔍 get baseline diagnostics early 
🥗 focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods 
😴 prioritize quality sleep 
🤝 maintain strong social connections

"we have more control over our health trajectory than we think," says mares. "starting with one healthier decision today could change your healthspan and life."

          a prescription for the sick retail healthcare model.

early this year, there were a peak 1,800 retail clinics in the u.s offering healthcare. now, after substantial closures and retrenchment, the future of this model is uncertain. 
 
what happened? timothy hoff's harvard business review article lays it out nicely - but i would add one crucial point -- most of these retail health clinics  (hoff says 96%) were in urban areas (that already had great access to care and/or were crowded) and the ones that are located in rural do not have enough density. so...it doesn't work in urban or rural suburban areas.

my prescription - mobile healthcare - that dynamically moves to where it is needed. without the sunk cost of brick and mortar or stationary staff. retailers would be wise to adopt "omnichannel" like they did with ecommerce. give patients choice (offer to deliver care to them or the ability to walk in to their store). 
 
as hoff pointed out as well, some of these answers reside in bringing care to patients through mobile medicine, telemedicine and leveraging technology to monitor patients and provide proactive care. at docgo, we facilitated care for nearly 1 million patients last year, and we are able to follow patients over the long-term, connecting them to providers when they need additional treatment.

i hope everyone wins. just 1 primary care visit by a patient improves health outcomes and drives down healthcare spend by thousands on the system.

we are doing our part....

          there's been a lot of headlines lately about the demise of #virtualcare. but, forward-looking care delivery companies and healthcare purchasers aren't abandoning virtual care; we’re reimagining and rearchitecting it to be less of a siloed service and more of the connective tissue across all of healthcare. https://lnkd.in/gfb8fdn8 #telehealth #includedhealth

          in a private healthcare market, we need private capital. 
 
that being said, i fully support more scrutiny and accountability for delivering the best patient outcomes. 
 
if private capital providers continue to demonstrate a lack of regard for patients (as, unfortunately, there is a history of some firms doing so), more regulation is needed.  
 
this is one of capitalism's challenges. it is not a values system that defines what is right and wrong.  
 
when you remove the long-term incentive for doing the right thing (funds typically look to invest for 5-7 years before an exit), patients are more likely to be neglected in the pursuit of short-term gains.  
 
that's why we don't have a fund cycle. we are not under pressure to sell within a fixed timeframe, so we can make decisions for the long term.

          platforms are in, point solutions are out as the healthcare ai category leaders come into focus this year.

in conversation with shelby livingston at endpoints news, i shared:
1. why ai-first companies have the greatest platform potential and heuristics for identifying these opportunities at the earliest stages,
2. how companies are differentiating through co-development and distribution partnerships with leading healthcare institutions, and
3. strategies for navigating anemic budgets and constrained market sizes through business model innovation such as ai-enabled services and pay for performance models

          “so... apple is entering the hearing space!” 
for the past two weeks, i've been flooded with messages asking how apple's latest announcement will impact concha labs. another consumer tech giant is stepping into the hearing space, but what does this really mean?

with over 1.5 billion people affected by hearing loss globally, this is a massive market. yet, like mental health, hearing loss is something people don’t talk about much. if you ask anyone who’s tried hearing aids, you’ll likely hear stories of frustration—they’re often disliked because of impersonal sound quality. for me, they were always too loud or too quiet, and i could never find the “right” fit.

this isn’t new. apple, like bose before them, will likely face similar challenges in replicating the status quo. despite their audio expertise, bose entered the hearing aid space but exited due to the same hurdles. bluetooth earpieces, with their short battery life and social awkwardness, also highlight how hard it is to create a practical, long-term solution.

but here’s the good news: more attention on hearing health, thanks to apple’s announcement and the otc hearing aid act, is a win for everyone. it’s sparking conversations about hearing loss—something i kept hidden for decades. concha labs' hearing aids are nearly invisible, like contact lenses. when i tell people i’m wearing our product, they’re always shocked because they don’t notice them, even with my hair up! (and this goes for the guys who wear them, too!)

what’s clear to me is that while awareness is growing, real innovation comes from solving actual user pain points. that’s where concha labs comes in: we offer a fully personalized hearing experience, much like how spotify revolutionized music personalization beyond itunes.

our solution is designed for real-world usability—comfortable, discreet, personalized, and customizable in multiple sizes and colors. created by people who were tired of the status quo (like me!), our concha sol hearing aids are made for those who want something better.

so, if you’re tired of the same old hearing aids, let concha labs empower you to hear clearly. we promise, you’ll notice the difference. 😉

          this made no sense to me, ever. it’s as if the folks that write these requirements have absolutely no actual patient care experience:)

in addition, in what world does it make sense to pay based on metering data! #rpm and #rtm should be serve the active management of a patient in a home environment and that is the true measure rather than arbitrary number of days or tying payment to the number of days which doesn’t align with paying for value.

          ***from best practices to next practices***

digital health is an emerging determinant of health says oced's first-ever chapter on digital health in their annual health-at-a-glance report.

digital health readiness is considered a determinant of health as it influences health data usage, healthcare service delivery, and health outcomes through digital transformation. 

countries with higher digital health readiness have better responses to health crises, improved resource utilization, lower costs, and enhanced patient experiences.  

perhaps the most important point is featured in the image below, where the human factors live. we have over-invested the last decade in the technologies and data systems to support digital health, however, we have heavily under-invested in the capacity and literacy building, community collaboration, transparent governance, and systems thinking that is required to take advantage of said technology and data.

i liken it to 100 years ago, in 1924 when the automobile first arrived. at that time 95% of the world was still operating the horse and buggy, it took 40-50 years later to harness the power of the automobile to transport goods and services to every community. it's time we realize our healthcare system is the horse and buggy of this century...

          there is a misconception emerging that ai agents will lead to immediate reductions in healthcare labor costs. while ai agents can automate end-to-end workflows such as booking appointments, answering basic patient questions, and performing form completion for prior authorizations, automating a single task is not equivalent to automating an entire job.

nurses are a prime example. certain nursing tasks, such as care coordination and patient documentation, are highly automatable by ai agents; however, there is a tremendous amount of work nurses perform on the ground that cannot be fully automated with current technologies such as direct patient care, physical examinations, medication administration, wound care, patient support, and clinical assessments. these nuances make full role elimination less likely with current technologies.

when articulating the roi of an ai agent, we need to be both precise and accurate. automating a task is more often not automating an entire profession. for roles that encompass many functions, such as nursing, ai agents can be invaluable tools for unburdening staff, increasing efficiency, and boosting throughput—benefits that are particularly valuable given current healthcare staffing and resource shortages.

the most promising job candidates for full role elimination through ai remain positions with monolithic task structures, of which there are relatively few in healthcare today—scribes, medical coders, and data entry specialists for example. it is therefore unsurprising then that the most progress has been made in these categories.

          another large funding round in the virtual behavioral health space. it's interesting to note talkiatry's focus on a physician-centric care model with w-2 providers, as opposed to most of the other players who are delivering care with 1099 mid-level therapists. however, it's still not clear to me how they are measuring care quality and outcomes, which is the foundation of true value-based care.

          these unique advantages in venture capital are indeed compelling, which raises the question: why haven't they been widely adopted in the industry?

we can distill the resistance down to a few key misconceptions:

1. **overreliance on capital influence**: the belief that "having capital is sufficient to drive change" often leads to an external, top-down approach that may not align with the realities on the ground.

2. **underestimating physician business acumen**: the outdated notion that "physicians lack business prowess" has been repeatedly disproven by numerous real-world examples across generations.

3. **overvaluing back office capabilities**: the assumption that "our back-office provides superior insights and analysis" is flawed. in reality, the same fundamental principles apply across the board: successful exits, founder intelligence, robust deal flow, and iterative processes that optimize analytical costs.

these misconceptions hinder the adoption of game-changing approaches in venture capital.

          as wearables - or devices with biometric sensors - become more commonplace, there’s more scope to use them for longitudinal studies and analysis. this will be far more interesting than looking at last night’s sleep, and really offer insight into how your health is changing over time. 

this chat with evidation is a window into the real possibilities for wearables.
