devices work, here’s a quick overview. you can find more detailed information in one of our faqs on ignition interlock devices. in a nutshell, ignition interlock devices are car breathalyzers, mandated by the state of florida. the iid is connected to your vehicle’s starter. when you blow into the handheld device, the system will detect if there is alcohol on your breath. if there is, you fail the breath alcohol content (bac) test, and you won’t be able to start your car. the system prevents the starter from working.if you haven’t been drinking and you pass the breath test, you will be able to start your vehicle like you normally would.you should know that ignition interlock devices are highly sensitive to alcohol. they can detect the tiniest amount of alcohol on your breath, and if you have a breath content higher than the state allows (generally around .02), you will fail the test, and the device will record that you failed the test. because of this, we suggest that you rinse your mouth with water before you take the breath test. you should also avoid things such as mouthwash, cough medicine, or energy drinks. all of these items can contain enough alcohol to cause you to fail the test.rolling retestsafter you’ve been driving for a while, the ignition interlock device will start sending you reminders to take occasional “rolling retests” to make sure you didn’t start drinking after you started the car. we advise against submitting a breath sample while the car is in motion. the device sends you an audible and visual signal several minutes before you have to do the rolling retest. you will have time to pull over or find a place to park your vehicle before you submit a breath sample.even if you fail a rolling retest, the device will record will not shut down the engine. this is for safety reasons, in case you did actually take the rolling retest while the car was in motion. but if you fail the test or skip a rolling retest, the device will record that.monthly service visitsflorida law also mandates that you to bring your vehicle in to your alcolock service center for monthly service visits. these service appointments usually only last about 20 minutes. at each visit, the technician will upload all records from the iid to your monitoring agency. this is generally the department of highway safety and motor vehicles (flhsmv). the device records include:the number of breath tests you took with the date and time you took themhow many times you passed or failed the testif you skipped a rolling retestif you attempted to disconnect or tamper with the iid systemif you tried to get someone else submit a breath sampleand moreyour court paperwork will specify your program requirements, and the flhsmv paperwork will give detailed information as well. fair warning — if the flhsmv finds that you have violated the program by trying to tamper with or disconnect your ignition interlock device, or tried to bypass the breath test by having someone else blow into the device, the department will immediately drop you from the restricted driving program and reinstate your suspension.your service center will remove your ignition interlock device if
