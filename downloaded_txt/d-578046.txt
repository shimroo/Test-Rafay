3. get quotes: contact several car removal services to get quotes for your vehicle. this will help you compare offers and ensure you get a fair price.
4. verify licensing and insurance: ensure your chosen company is licensed and insured. this will protect you from potential liabilities during the removal process.
5. ask about recycling practices: if environmental impact is essential to you, ask the company about their recycling practices. reputable car removal services should have eco-friendly disposal methods.
