our mission
to live as god’s family under the cross– loving, serving, praising and proclaiminggod’s family: through grace we become god’s children, and differences between us dissolve (gal. 3:26-28). god makes us family (gal. 6:10), and our task as a church is to live out that unity (eph 4:3). one of the ways we try to do that is through body life. on sunday evenings during the school year, small groups (6-12 adults) gather in homes for fellowship, study, and prayer. this allows us to get to know each other more intimately than we can in larger groups. our family ministry also sponsors activities that help us to grow closer together.learn more
