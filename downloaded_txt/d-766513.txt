note:	new legislation in 2005 resulted in the texas duck (or waterfowl) stamp being changed and is now the texas migratory game bird stamp, and will be required for not only duck and goose hunting, but also required for hunting doves.


the texas turkey stamp has been changed to the texas upland game bird stamp and will be required for hunting not only turkeys, but also quail, pheasants, and chachalacas.
