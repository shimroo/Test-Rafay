            gabrielle chapdelaine, playwright of the retreat
          










mille mercis à l’équipe magique d’imago theatre. as a francophone playwright, it means a lot to me to share my work with the anglophone community in montreal, the city where i live. it's special, unique and precious. krista jackson took the risk to choose and direct a super weird, unknown play written by a slightly weird, relatively unknown playwright, and i'll forever be grateful to her. the imago team stands out for its ability to make everyone feel at home and at ease. no word is too much; everything is done wholeheartedly while tackling the issues head on. plein plein plein d’amour.








            david gagnon walker, translator of the retreat
          










when krista jackson took over the ad role at imago, the retreat was sitting in a pile of scripts for consideration left by the previous leadership. she read it and decided to program it without ever having met gabrielle or me. that kind of thing never happens, and i think it says a lot about the company. everything about working with imago backed up what this first contact suggested: they care deeply about the art they make, and they care deeply about the people they make it with. my experience with the imago team was fun, rigorous, considerate, and tremendously rewarding. i can't wait to see what they do next.































art is a basic human right.








            pay-what-you-decide tickets
          










available for all performances of imago theatre productions. you can choose to pay any amount that you decide. no amount is too big or small.








            surtitles
          










imago theatre presents in-person productions with french surtitles. the french translation of the script is projected visibly on the set and is performed live by a technician.








            relaxed performances
          










imago theatre welcomes an audience with various access needs, who may benefit from a reduced sensory experience of the show and a casual audience environment.
