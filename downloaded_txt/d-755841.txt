    executive director job announcement
  


























honoring leland payneappropriately named by french nursing students, leland lavern payne, 88 means: meadowland aldergrove countryman, a perfectly suitable description of him.  a strong steward of the land and a man of few words, it was clear to anyone who met him that he was a guiding light to many and a myriad of decisions hinged on his opinion. he taught respect for the fellow human as well as the forest, wildlife, and natural resources. a quiet, yet powerful man, there is no doubt that many will attempt to channel his wisdom when faced with difficult choices.  leland passed at home at 1:10 p.m. on january 31, 2025. a perfect time since he gave 110% always, all the time.  leland was a believer in education, creativity, and the clear work of god’s creation he studied every day in the forest.  in leu of flowers, please consider a donation in leland’s honor to the following:  1) tillamook forest center, www.tillamookforestcenter.org, 45500 wilson river hwy, tillamook, or 97141. – specifically the tillamook burn education because his family not only fought the fire, his homestead was a place of respite and nourishment for the firefighters. 2) oregon small woodland association (oswa) - 187 high st. ne suite 208, salem, or 97301- specifically education and lobby efforts, because he believed in the uniqueness of a small forest owner’s needs and rights. 3) yamhill carlton school district, 120 n. larch pl., yamhill, or 97148. – specifically the outdoor school program because leland believed in providing healthy and eye opening experiences for the young.   thank you to everyone who loved, cherished, and respected this great man. until we meet again.
