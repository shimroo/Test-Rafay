both of my children love their teachers and everything they are learning every day.  the focus on heart growth and bible teaching just puts this school over the top.  we are immensely grateful to be a part of lcs!

            - lcs parent 2022        







at lcs students are taught with academic excellence and rigor, while maintaining a christ centered, caring environment, that targets not only educational, but spiritual growth for the students. we are blessed in sending our child to lcs!

            - lcs parent 2018        







lcs teaches my child as a whole person, not just focusing on academic benchmarks.  the staff is warm and friendly and the teachers keep learning fun and engaging.  my children are excited to go to school every day.
