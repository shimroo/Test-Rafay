welcome to vnas of vermont
the nine member agencies of the vnas of vermont provide a full range of high-quality home health and hospice services to the people of every city and town in vermont, regardless of ability to pay. each year, member agencies deliver more than a million home visits by nurses, speech therapists, physical and occupational therapists, wound care specialists, social workers, home health aides, personal care attendants and others.
the vnas of vermont was originally incorporated in 1971 by the directors of vermont’s non-profit medicare-certified home care agencies as the vermont assembly of home health agencies (vahha). in 2014, members changed the organization’s name to the vnas of vermont.
as a professional trade association, the nine-member vnas of vermont represents vermont’s local independent, not-for-profit home health and hospice agencies and the people they serve in the policy and regulatory arenas, creates educational opportunities for agency leaders and staff, and provides a forum for member agencies to share best practices. together, we support a healthier vermont, build stronger families and transform our communities.
