[botox® and dysport® are not bioequivalent. one unit of botulinum toxin type a (botox® allergan irvine ca) is equivalent to approximatly to 2.5 units of botulinum toxin type a (dysport® ipsen limited uk)].
following a rare opportunity of treating more than 7000 patients affected with hh in the last 30 years, i came to the conclusion that information regarding this disorder is still inadequate and many people still undergo needless surgeries to stop sweating when simpler solutions are available. the therapeutic options vary according to the age of the patient, the area involved, the severity of the disease and the patients own tolerance to previous medications.
