the club of amsterdam is an independent, international, future-oriented think tank involved in channelling preferred futures. it involves those who dare to think out of the box and those who don’t just talk about the future but actively participate in shaping outcomes.
we organized events, seminars and summits on relevant, global issues and publish findings & proceedings through various off-line and online media channels. we understand us as catalysts for innovation in industries, science and society. currently our main activities are the club of amsterdam journal and the future now show.
