celebrating 25 years online!!
happy holidays!  it's time to get your flu shot (and those other vaccines), but meanwhile, it's a great time to shop online!
if you haven't visited us before, our goal is to promote texas artists and provide interesting info about texas and maybe a little history and cultural stuff, too.   so, browse around and if you know a texas artist or crafter who needs a little more exposure, tell 'em about us.  
at truly texan, we don't sell anything.  we find texas artists, craftsmen and companies who we think merit your attention - and business!  while some of the products are "texas gifts", most of what you will see is simply designed by texans who, oddly enough, don't actually eat, breathe and sleep texas.
thanks and have a great day and stay safe!featured items
