"from a user perspective and having used groupworld for 5 years and having
tried all other online whiteboards for tutoring, it is by far the most comprehensive
online tutoring software available. from a developer perspective, groupworld
also is the best for integrating into other software solutions." - charles sterling, founder @ tutortag.com.
"groupboard has been an incredible resource and is used by the saturday school
team with incredible impact; allowing us all to create dynamic and interactive
learning experiences. the wonderful gesture of a free version for small
nonprofits like ourselves has been crucial for us, giving our teachers a
superb, user-friendly resource which is fully accessible for our students and
scholars. - graeme rough, director @ saturday school ltd.
