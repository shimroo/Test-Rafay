hereâs what our clients have to say...













































747 orchestra was our dream band come true. if youâre looking for an engaging, high-energy, interactive motown band with the ability to play newer hits as well- this is it! nanci, the manager and bandleader, worked in partnership with our venue, our dj, our events coordinator and the kitchen to deliver a seamless experience that flowed without interruption and brought our vision to life. she ensured seamless production of our reception, and despite her initial reservations, entertained and implemented our crazy ideas. nanci is a true professional and will get into the extreme details to ensure that nothing is missed. the band is out of this world. people are still talking about the night 2 months later. the floor was packed the entire evening.

747 orchestra provided music and entertainment for our wedding ceremony, cocktail hour and reception and did a phenomenal job! our priority was to ensure that the dance floor was packed all reception long and 747 delivered!  we are lovers of r&b, soul, and funk, so 747âs style fit us perfectly. in addition, they provided beautiful classical and jazz music during the ceremony and reception. several guests contacted us after our wedding solely to compliment the awesome band. we had a fantastic and fun night and never left the dance floor. working the nanci, the 747 orchestra bandleader, was a pleasure. she is professional, thoughtful, responsive and kind.




the 747 orchestra was the apex of entertainment at my wedding. they were hands-down absolutely amazing. the band members were so great â as they sing and perform they also dance with the guests, truly giving an up close and intimate experience between the performers and the dancers. iâm confident my guests will always remember my wedding because my band was so damn fantastic. they wasnât a single person sitting down- everyone had a great time listening to great music and dancing their feet off.
