the newcomer family tradition



                    newcomer funeral homes benefit from a long and 
                    rich tradition dating back to 1893, when d.w. 
                    newcomer opened a funeral home in kansas city. 
                    followed by his son, grandson, and great grandson 
                    ren newcomer, the tradition of providing quality 
                    funeral service at a fair price has guided the 
                    family for generations.
                

                    simply put, these principles are the cornerstone 
                    of our funeral home. we believe you deserve personal 
                    service, merchandise of the highest quality, and a 
                    price that is fair to you.
                

                    you have our word that we will continue to work 
                    faithfully to uphold the family heritage that has 
                    served our families so well for generations.
