who we are
sorbentsystems, the online presence of impak corporation (with locations in both los angeles, ca and sebastian, fl), is a leader in providing complete packaging systems for products that are sensitive to specific aspects of their environment - whether it be humidity, ultraviolet light, oxygen, or trace gases. learn more about us
what we offer
flexible packaging
we provide flexible packaging materials with reclosable features and high
o2 / h2o barrier properties. we manufacture mylar® bags,  and if you don't find exactly what you need here we welcome your inquiries
for custom specifications and sizes or quantities. mylar® is manufactured by dupont teijin films.
sealing equipment
flexible materials are an ideal medium for heat sealing. our vacuum sealers  and heat sealers  come in many varieties. tabletop sealers produce 2.0, 2.7, and 5.0 mm seals. foot pedal units are available in 2.0, 2.7, 5.0, and even 10.0 mm seal units with constant heat sealing jaw options that will seal the heaviest foil materials. we have produced custom units as wide as 51.0". vacuum sealing is the most efficient way of minimizing the air volume in a package which must be dried or deoxygenated. our temporary barrier clips are liquid impervious.
sorbents & desiccants
if you are looking to ensure a dry environment for your food storage, valuable documents, electronic equipment, etc. our desiccant section is the answer. our oxygen absorbers  come in a wide variety of sizes and quantities to suit all of your packaging and budgeting needs. these oxygen absorbers  are held to the highest production and testing standards and are even approved for use by the u.s. military.
we have an extensive technical literature section with information on desiccants
(including chemical analyses) and oxygen absorbers. we are a producer and provider of technical products made to specifications that are available to our customers and raw material suppliers. msds data and technical information are readily available on all items.
