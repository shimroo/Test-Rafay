a blogging we
      will go...
      for someone who once lived on the bleeding edge it's about time i finally
      gave in.  so here is the link to my blog, which is updated a heck of
      a lot more frequently than this site: http://kelleytown.blogspot.com/
there are some mildly amusing (and informative) things there you might
      want to see.  or not.
 reader's theater scripts
if you are looking for scripts for your reader's theater to perform, there
are now quite a few posted at the reader's theater 
page.

      terrifying (and somewhat amusing) experience of our move, the wait is
      over.  read all about it at the move: if i
      only had a brain.
