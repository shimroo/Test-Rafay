b park snack shack vandalism and arson
on monday night, july 22nd, at around 11:00 pm, the snack shack at b park was vandalized, burglarized, and set on fire. rohnert park cal ripken is working with the city of rohnert park and our insurance company to address the situation.

            we are incredibly grateful for the support from our community and baseball families. our goal is to rebuild the snack shack, a place that brings us together, providing meals, snacks, and memories for all who love baseball.
please share our gofundme link, donations will be used to rebuild the b park snack shack and repair our other snack shack locations that were vandalized this season.

                we sincerely thank our community for the continued support and generosity.
