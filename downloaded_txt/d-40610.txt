the commuter (2018)the liam-neeson-caught-in-a-pickle formula is basically its own sub-genre at this point. it’s been quite the surprising and profitable turn for neeson, who spent his early career in dramas and light-as-a-feather comedies. now a proven action star, he’s back once again in the commuter, his third collaboration with director jaume collet-serra...


downsizing (2017)movies as crushingly misguided and poorly-executed as downsizing make me want to paraphrase roger ebert’s legendary review of 1994’s north. “i hated this movie. hated hated hated hated hated this movie. hated it.” “i have no idea why [alexander payne], or anyone else, wanted to make this story into a...


the disaster artist (2017)connoisseurs of bad movie viewing know the best ones think they’re good movies. that’s why you can keep your sharknado and basically any self-knowing impostor. those films know they’re bad and can only hope the viewer plays along. 2003’s the room, now a cult sensation that still enjoys midnight screenings...


the man who invented christmas (2017)charles dickens’s a christmas carol is as timeless as stories come because its themes are universal and forever. greed, lack of awareness of the consequences of our actions, and redemption are ubiquitous. it’s impossible to read or watch a christmas carol and not want to do something charitable or even...

kingsman: the golden circle (2017)


  by  bill clark  september 21, 2017 september 21, 2017  movie reviews  


 kingsman: the secret service emerged as one of the biggest surprises of 2015; an astute and self-aware roast of the spy movie genre (read: bond movies) that delivered almost incomprehensible carnage with sly wit and likeable characters. easier said than done. most importantly, it didn’t take itself remotely seriously and,â¦ continue reading

good time (2017)


  by  bill clark  august 25, 2017 august 25, 2017  movie reviews  


 it’s almost impossible not to compare robert pattinson’s career arc with that of leonardo dicaprio. both were teenage heart-throbs in iconic roles. both took time off after said roles, then began taking on smaller projects to re-invigorate their careers as adults. good time, a frenetic and grimy crime thriller, isâ¦ continue reading

dunkirk (2017)


  by  bill clark  july 20, 2017 july 20, 2017  movie reviews  


 it’s been an amazing run of excellence for writer/director christopher nolan. undoubtedly one of the twenty-first century’s most accomplished and groundbreaking auteurs, few can compete with his ability to deliver stunning visuals and thought-provoking, challenging narratives. unfortunately, dunkirk only delivers on the visuals, and that’s simply not enough if you’reâ¦ continue reading

47 meters down (2017)


  by  bill clark  june 15, 2017 june 15, 2017  movie reviews  


 for most people, simply being in the water near sharks is enough of a nightmare. being forty-seven meters (154.2 feet for my fellow americans) under the surface, bleeding, and with sharks circling is whole different beast. in 47 meters down, writer/director johannes roberts takes this seemingly simple narrative setup andâ¦ continue reading

it comes at night (2017)


  by  bill clark  june 9, 2017 june 9, 2017  movie reviews  


 travis’s grandfather is not well. as it comes at night opens, he has been infected with an unknown disease. his body is covered in open sores, his eyes black, and occasionally he contorts and vomits blood. he mercifully passes on, much to the family’s sadness but ultimate relief. the nextâ¦ continue reading
