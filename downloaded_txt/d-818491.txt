         wildcat: piercing jewellery of the hightes quality    


the wildcat brand has always been a synonym for quality and individuality in the field of piercing. wildcat is one of the main reasons why millions of people all over the world wear piercing jewellery, first for their ears and nowadays all over their bodies.
in 1989, our adventure started with the production and sale of our first piercing jewellery lines worldwide. in the beginning, it was an underground movement - today it is a true cult and has turned into a special kind of jewellery and a fashion item. over the years, wildcat has refined its catalogue and distribution network and has become the leading brand in the field of piercing. for our uniqueÂ titanium piercingÂ jewellery collections, which have strongly supported the remarkable growth of the piercing movement, we guarantee the highest quality and ensure said quality continuously with the highest possible standards. this quality standard is reflected in our commitment to our customers and in our online shop, for the safe and certified purchase of piercing jewellery. our standard jewellery includesÂ rings,Â labrets,Â barbellsÂ and a huge selection ofÂ balls and attachmentsÂ for your individual piercing. but, as connoisseurs and professionals of the scene know, wildcat offers much more. in addition to the best ideas for bellybutton piercings, ear piercings and piercings of any other body part, wildcat also develops exciting innovations such as the triple piercing recently.
development and innovation have made us great: 1990 brought the first big breakthrough for wildcat: we introduced the first tunnel ever, known as flesh tunnel, to the scene. so if you are looking for a shop for your new tunnels, then you have come to the right place. wildcat offers the first and original tunnels in a variety of materials, sizes and colours in almost endless combinations. we are a bit proud of the fact that over the years, wildcat piercing has become a jewel in every respect. the classic timeless naval piercingÂ or the newer piercing novelties like the smiley piercing, the septum piercing for the nasal septum, and from tragus to nipple piercing: with us, you will find great and individual piercing solutions for your demands.
even many years ago, our wildcat innovation concept was one of the first companies in the industry to introduce wildcat into the new world of sales: the world wide web! all pieces of jewellery produced by us and presented in our collections come with a quality certificate and registered trademark. benefit from our longtime experience in the piercing scene, we take care of our customers' needs and their piercings carefully and attentively. our aim is to offer you the highest degree of reliability and safety. for this reason, we only produce and sell piercing products that meet the high demands of our professional customers â€“ we also provide them with the best quality piercing supplies and consumables.
wildcat allows you to shop both as a private and business customer. in order to benefit from the special conditions of our business customers, please register here. only customers with a valid tax number will be activated by us as business customers.
wildcat gmbh reserves the right to check the specified tax numbers. wildcat gmbh is a german company and the invoice issuing without vat can only be made to parties authorised for transactions within the european union.
