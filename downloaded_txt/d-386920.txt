our products
these are high quality buildings that can be used in gaming, christmas villages, and just to collect. our buildings 
                    are unique in that their roofs lift off so that you can view and use the interior, as well as at times the flooring between levels is removable so you can really get "into" your building.


about us
we build and sell resin cast pre-painted miniature buildings that are ready to use out of the box. that's right! no longer do you need to paint your building - the work has already been done for you.
