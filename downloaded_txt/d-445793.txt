youssouf's sheeplog - youssouf: cuddly sheep / world traveller



this weblog is about sheep. sheep only. why? i - youssouf - am a cuddly sheep, a fluffy plush toy sheep myself. people talk about people. sheep talk about sheep.
so, what can you expect here? sheep!
and of course you can expect a lot of photo's from my travels around the world. since i'm a fanatic world traveller as well.
read this post to learn more about my backgrounds.

off to turkey!



yesterday i went off to turkey. i'm going to antalya, with some sidesteps to kemer and antalya. for a week only. i don't expect many photo's, since my travel buddy only has a film camera, not a digital one.but the temperature (25oc) sure beats the rainy and cold dutch weather!

i thought other people might like the where-am-i-map on the left i blogged about.i had the application submitted (a friend helped me out, somehow cuddly sheep seem not to be recognized as application developers) at yahoo!'s application gallery.have a look at: http://gallery.yahoo.com/apps/15419.don't forget to rate the application ;-)if you use it on your blog or site, please let me know. i'm curious. and feel free to link to this blog.

where's youssouf? look at the map!



last saturday i've returned from a brilliant journey through cambodja. really awesome.but the visitors of this blog had no way to see easily where i'm currently around the globe. that's why i've done some sheepish hacking with yahoo! maps and some other tools.the result can be seen permanently in the left sidebar. the map displays my photo :-) you can zoom in and out and drag the map around. from now on it's easy for me to update where i am.i hope you like this gadget!

staring at the little mermaid in copenhagen, denmark - 16 august 2007



 from 16 till 21 august 2007 i went to copenhagen in denmark. the weather was cold, but i had plenty of sun already this year.i went there to visit some friends. of course i did a bit of wandering around. not much though.to see where this photo was taken exactly, have a look at the interactive map and zoom in and out for a better overview.in front of the little mermaid  this statue of the little mermaid sits on a rock in the copenhagen harbour in churchill park. this small and unimposing statue is a symbol of copenhagen, and a major tourist attraction.the statue was commissioned in 1909 by carl jacobsen, son of the founder of carlsberg, after he had been fascinated by a ballet about the fairytale. the sculptor edward eriksen created the statue, which was unveiled on 23 august 1913. he used his wife eline eriksen as the model.and of course i, youssouf, had to have my picture taken with this small but beautiful landmark. here i am, with the statue in the back.looking at the little mermaid  i had to stare at her for minutes. i did not really get her attention.
