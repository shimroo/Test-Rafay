rediscovery





i've been away for a while. there's been some transitions in my mind and heart around spirituality and spanking in general. i see previously i posted about having a more mature attitude around spanking. add to that now, a renewed sense of spirituality and a new creed that connects me with the human heart side of spirituality, whereas before it was mostly intellectual.now that i feel connected with my heart and understand that connection with the universe, i'm able to more clearly see the role that cp has in it. corporal punishment is close to my heart. it's not just arousing sexually. it's also a way for me to express my love. now i have no hesitation in saying that i have felt like spanking someone for non-sexual, love-oriented reasons. i understand that means i'm understanding in the most personal way, the oneness between my heart and all other hearts. the only differences we have as humans is the way we express our love and the way we deal with our fears and desires. i'm so much more okay to be who i am now. among other things about me, spanking is vitally important to me. and that's just fine. someone had to be me.

my maturing attitude on spanking?





i say that as a question because i'm not so sure yet if it's really maturity or just a difference. i try not judge people - myself included.my attitude towards spanking these days is that i still love it. it's still very deeply embedded in the core of my sexual psyche (and my psyche in general). but whereas i used to really revel in the underground, secretive nature of it (in fact preferring it to stay that way and never become "popular"), i now am much more open to all its various appearances in the world.it's now more like i feel an unconditional love towards this old friend. of course there's always going to be a dark, secretive underground nature to spanking and corporal punishment in general, particularly where it leans to the more severe side, or wanders into the socially risky area of age-play. i still love the dark stuff.i also am starting to appreciate its more ubiquitous appearance in popular culture. it seems like instead of the old jest about "whips and chains" that you used to hear, there's now more of a tendency to joke about spanking. i used to resent that because i always felt they used spanking because it was perceived as less threatening. but now i say, what the heck. if "buffy" in the beamer wants to be a little kinky and "cool" by getting her ass slapped a little, i say go for it!as long as butts are being smacked, i'm good with it. and now it seems to be the era of wearing thin, soft, skin-tight pants. and not just that, there are pants out there that hug women between the cheeks, highlighting each cheek individually. she may as well be bare-bottomed, only you don't see skin. i'm no longer going to resent this happening as throwing temptation in my path. i'm just going to see it as a happy day in my seeing life. thanks to god for my eyes. thanks to you, lady, for wearing those pants.happy spanking

            traditions by swillary hankandra taylor knew she had mis-calculated on a number of levels. first of all, she had underestimated how much her father would care what happened to that old white landrover. she had figured that since he had three or four newer models, there was no way he'd get so upset about a relatively minor scratch/dent. second, she underestimated the political influence her father had over local law enforcement. apparently, his reach was not fully state-wide. third, she had mis-calculated the available credit on her gold card. it really wasn't enough to pay for the spring break hotel for her friends and buy her a $10,000, get out of jail 'til trial pass. so daddy really wasn't too happy to have to pay one of his attorneys to fly down to palm beach to bail her out. and he wasn't too happy about the landrover. it was a cheaper model, primarily used for puttering around, and a couple years old, but had sentimental value to him. and he was embarrassed that this was happening just before an election cycle. andra's mis-calculations started to make her bottom feel nervous. she assumed, quite rightly, that she would be spanked. the question in her mind was whether this was going to be merely a punishment hour or, perhaps, more.she was startled out of her reverie by the ringing of her cell phone, as she slouched down in the back of the limo headed for the airport."hello," she said nervously, recognizing her father's number immediately. she pressed one hand to her face, bracing herself."andra, you're getting way out of hand," her father said, getting right to the point.she immediately recognized the tone that he and her mother always used when they were about to pass sentence."i'm sorry, daddy," she replied. it wouldn't do much good at this stage, but she knew it wouldn't hurt to try."i know you're sorry. but you will have to be punished of course," he said. andra swallowed hard and shut her pale blue eyes tight. "you're in for a punishment day," he continued."no! please!" she whined. "i won't do it again.""i expect not after this," her father said. "goodbye, pumpkin. i love you." he hung up, knowing that the only conversation that could possibly follow was his daughters pleadings and his refusals to listen. he simply wanted to spare them both the stress.greg taylor, andra's father, and his wife becky immediately began sending out invitations to all the appropriate family members who would participate in andra's punishment day. additionally, they booked caterers and blocks of rooms at the local imperial suites for out-of-towners.andra could only think of one person she needed to call - her boyfriend."doug, i'm not going to be able to make it to your yacht party," she blurted out after he'd answered his phone."sorry to hear that, babe! why not?" he asked."long story. i ended up getting arrested for d.u.i. and my dad had to bail me out.""ouch," doug empathized."ouch is right. i'm getting a punishment day," andra explained."what do you mean? are you getting grounded for a day?" doug asked."i wish," andra continued. "it means i'm getting spanked most of that day.""what?!" doug was caught in a rare, speechless moment.  "yeah. my family really believes in corporal punishment. i mean really! one thing they do to you when you're really in trouble is have a punishment day. a bunch of relatives and family friends come by and bring their favorite implement. they each get to give you ten spanks.""that sounds abusive. can i ask why you're going through with it? can't you just not go home?" doug's question was reasonable, logical, and andra had heard the question and responded to it from others hundreds of times."honestly, i can't not go. if i don't show up, they'll cut me off, and i'm just not meant for the menial labor i'd be condemned to. i've always taken it and i have to take it to keep my lifestyle. in other words, it's worth it," andra said, being brutally honest with both herself and doug."i see," doug said. "well... i don't know what to say... call me if you need help.""sure, doug. but i won't. there's always plenty of breaks for water and food. and, of course, they have the best medical staff on retainer in case someone goes overboard. but thanks for offering.""i love you, andra. good... luck..." he stammered."yeah," andra said, "love you too."all around the country and in parts of europe, the taylor family and its branches were receiving their invitations. observing tradition, they never asked other family members if they had received an invitation, trusting the wisdom of confidentiality. while booking their airline tickets, they searched through closets and chests for their favorite paddles, belts, straps and canes. some packed nothing, realizing that there would be plenty of good switches on the land to choose from, or simply believed in the power of the palm against bare bottom.after a long flight involving plenty of martinis, andra arrived in her home town. from the airport, she rode in another limo, appreciating how comfortable it was to sit at that point, and relishing it.upon arriving in her bedroom, she searched through her underwear closet for the traditional white t-back underwear. the punished were expected to take it bare-bottomed, but definitely not to show their privates. andra always wore the t-back.the next morning she awoke to the smell of bacon frying and coffee. she pulled the velvet mask off her eyes and slowly opened her eyes to let the bright sun in. andra had finally gotten to sleep a couple of hours ago. up 'til then she was too consumed with thoughts of choosing between the rock of living without her family's millions and the hard place of another marathon spanking. she finally had cried herself to sleep, feeling as sorry for herself as ever."perhaps," she thought, "i'm too cried out to cry any more. that would save me some embarrassment." andra knew this was wishful thinking. she had plenty of tears left to drop down her cute cheeks. usually, she could taste the salt of her tears in the corners of her turned down, pouting mouth, during these punishments.becky, andra's mother, came into the room followed by one of the domestics, who carried a breakfast tray. becky shook her head and tch tch'd. "mom, please," andra said. "i don't need this today. besides, you and daddy are over-reacting. it's only a minor dent. you both know i didn't mean to.""andra, you never mean to." becky was tired of dealing with her daughter's spoiled behavior. "just finish your breakfast and put on the robe."andra nibbled on the bacon and had a couple bites of the egg and toast. she had never been able to eat much when she was about to be punished this way. it was partly the nervousness and partly the fear of farting during her punishment, thereby adding insult to her injury. setting the tray aside, she pulled off her pajamas. noticing herself in the mirror, andra became aware of the fact that her tan lines indicated she'd been wearing a thong bikini at the beach. some of the older-fashioned family members would definitely not be happy with that. no doubt, this relic of her fun would result in some hard licks. andra moaned.she pulled the ceremonial robe out of her closet, donned it and proceeded to the punishment room. her father and mother were waiting there and pointed to the spanking bench. she swallowed hard, her eyes widening. somehow she never got used to the idea that they had had this piece of furniture built expressly to facilitate punishing her. it just seemed so cruel. she knelt up on the lower, padded shelf, designed for her knees. once there, she bent over the higher shelf. her father began fastening her wrists into the padded cuffs, stretching her arms out in front of her. meanwhile her mother pulled up the back of her robe and tied the robe's sash in such away as to keep it up, even when andra would start wriggling her bottom to avoid the blows that she would feel like she simply could not take.once she was in position, bending across and tied down to the bench, her mother pressed a button on the nearby desk and the whole apparatus tilted forwards, making her bottom jut more into the air. it positioned her as if she had been placed over the lap of a giant. her father and mother looked at each other. satisfied that each other was satisfied, they turned to let in the first of a long line of family members that would contribute to her punishment day.uncle ted was the first in line. he carried his trusty, smooth-polished, eight-holed paddle. seeing his niece awaiting her punishment, her bottom so vulnerable looking and untouched, a part of him felt soft-hearted. becky must have sensed this sympathy in him. she said, "don't let her sucker you. she can take your paddle and a lot more. she's a madison as much as she is a taylor. she can take it."uncle ted shrugged and walked over to stand beside andra. he pressed the paddle against her bare bottom to measure the exact stroke. it wouldn't pay to be at all inaccurate with the paddle. when andra felt the paddle being pressed against her bottom she couldn't help but let out a moan. ted pulled back, sweeping a fairly wide angle with the paddle. he brought it swiftly against andra's bottom."owww-ah!," andra whined. whacked again, she yelped, "ow!" upon the third whack andra began giving the first of her moot instructions. "slow down! wait. don't... ow!"others waiting in line heard the punishment begin and were feeling a combination of relief, sympathy, and the exhilaration that comes with any exercise that is so primal. they all understood spanking. they knew that this thing being done to andra was both necessary and helpful. it would not kill her or even seriously injure her. yet it would be painful. they hoped on a number of levels, for a number of reasons, that it would be the most painful experience of her life.as uncle ted reached strokes nine and ten, andra began to cry. her cute little turned down mouth was stretched into an exaggerated frown. she looked forlorn as if no one loved her. but of course, she missed the entire point that this was happening because she was loved.having given his alloted ten strokes, ted walked out with his paddle. following him in the punishment line was cousin brenda. unfortunately for andra, she had just come from a trip to england, where she learned about caning. loving artifacts, brenda had purchased what had been advertised to be a conventional schoolroom cane. she was chopping it up and down in the air and it made a whippy sound that was most horrifying to andra."oh no!" she said, not even having seen what was making the sound. brenda approached her cousin

deadwood possibilities





int - afternoon... hotel across from the gem saloon.alma garrett and seth bullock lie in bed together, she in his arms, one leg draped across him while he lies on his back...                 alma garrett        do you ever stop to think about who        we are, mr. bullock?                 seth bullock        who we are? i suppose we're two hapless        souls who love each other, but have no         business being together in the eyes of         a hypocritical society.                 alma garrett        that's not what i mean. i'm thinking more         about you as the man you are and me as a         woman.                 seth bullock        man and woman...                 alma garrett        yes. i mean i don't need to tell you how         much more powerful you are than me physi-        cally. it's just... [she swallows hard]        it's both awe-inspiring and yet completely        frightening. you could, say, if you wanted        to just pull me over your lap and spank me         like a child. and as strong as you are you         could spank me so hard and for so long, i         don't think i could stand it.                 seth bullock         i suppose you're right. but i think you          know me too well to be really afraid. you         i would never do that unless you deserved         it.                  alma garrett         [she draws the covers up to her chin]          suppose i were to tell you that i actu-         ally think i do deserve it. what if i          told you i never loved my husband and          in fact i hated him. he was such a weak-         ling!                 seth bullock         [putting a finger over her mouth] shhh...         there'll be time for admissions and con-         fessions in due time. and, if there's a          need for punishment at that time, i hope          you understand you can count on it from me.         and you will take it like a woman.                  alma garrett         i don't know what to say... i'm so... i          don't know what to say.seth grabs her left wrist in his right hand and pulls her across his belly.                  alma garrett          mr. bullock! what are you doing!?he takes aim with his left hand and smacks her bottom hard.                   alma garrett          ouch! he lets her go, allowing her to rub her bottom, which now shows a red patch roughly the size of his hand.                  alma garrett          when i get my true punishment, it's          going to hurt so much... i... how           will i stand it...he strokes her hair and kisses her tenderly on the forehead.

"charmed" women mention flogging





i meant to post this last week, when i actually saw the episode. but i still think it's fun to talk about as well as think about. and i know many of my fellow spankophiles don't really like flogging, but i must as always, be true to myself.i watch the re-runs of "charmed" on tnt in the mornings at 8 while i'm doing my stretching and working out before i go to work. i won't bore you with talking endlessly about how cute and sexy those women are. if you've seen the show and have similar tastes to me, you already know. if you haven't seen it, check it out and let me know what you think. there's always a very endearing undercurrent of sexual energy and typically that undercurrent is bdsm-like. i recall with great pleasure the episode where rose mcgowan's character - page, is it? - sold her soul to faust in order to save an innocent. she spent one seen in a short, ragged, plain dress with her wrists cuffed together in front of her as she waited to be auctioned off. yum!i thought that was about as good as it was going to get until the one episode i saw last week where because of lady godiva having been plucked out of history, the women's rights movement never happened. i thought what i usually think about the story, which is something like "ok, this is just a cute story. don't get too caught up on how bad the writing is or the acting. just enjoy the eye candy." then something made my ears prick up. the three of them were walking down the street in the changed future where all the colors were drab and all the women were silent and subservient. piper made a comment that was something like, "we'd better not attract too much attention. we don't want to get flogged." what? what?! it was a good thing i wasn't taking a sip of hot coffee at the time.i looked very intensely at the show then and turned the sound up. the three of them looked up at a sign that said something like, "women talking unnecessarily will be flogged!" so i tried valiantly to reign in my imagination, understanding that this was american network tv. but part of me couldn't help but hope that they would at least get caught and put into position, maybe chained to a whipping post or something. of course magic would save them. it always does. but would it be so bad to gain a little audience sympathy by taking a few lashes? i ask you... they did end up getting caught and put into jail where they were threatened by the guard with several floggings. tease! tease! tease! add to that the fact that phoebe asked, "what is flogging?" and piper said, "let's not wait around here to find out!" you mean none of the three of them knew?!?! i really really wanted to show them!so after my experience of this non-consensual teasing, i just had to take it with a sense of humor and gratitude. typically this is the type of thing that would have happened to me in my younger days, and in the presence of family and/or friends that didn't know about my proclivities. a scene like that would come on and suddenly i'd be frozen in place and non-responsive. it was horrible. in order to respond i'd have to miss this rare event. yet not to respond meant i was interested very intently in what was going on on screen. and the natural question would be what's so interesting? this is the down side of having so many smart people in your life. i just knew i was transparent, that everyone could see i was focused on the fact that the characters were talking about corporal punishment of some kind or someone was taking a spanking or whipping.i had lived in fear for so long that my "sickness", my "weirdness" would be found out, exposed. i also lived in a constant dread that i would never find anyone i could honestly share this aspect of my life with and be understood. i've been blessed to have found communities that contain people that can and do understand and whom i can share things like this with. i even found my soul mate among them, and she actually agreed to be in a domestic discipline relationship with me. life is wonderful! mostly...i still, despite the fact that i'm sooo well aware of how grateful i should feel (and i do), crave friendships with others who share my fetish. as wide and broad as the community in our area is, it still seems to be such a rarity to meet other spanking/corporal punishment fetishists. why? i still don't understand it. and i'm afraid i'm still feeling lonely in this area.as far as my theories on why, i can think of a couple of possibilities. one, is that most of the spankophiles are either already a part of a couple or are busy trying to couple themselves with someone and don't really have time for or feel the need for just friendship. two, is that i may just not be in the right communities. it seems from what i've read or heard at times from us spankos is that many of us don't relate to or want to be any part of a bdsm community. they can sometimes even be squicked by bdsm and honestly don't feel that spanking is bdsm. that can be debated of course, but it really doesn't matter. what really matters is how they feel.i would never reject or disavow my relationship to the bdsm community or my interest in bdsm in general. i wonder if that means i'm giving up a great number of potential spanking friends. that would be a shame.still, i have a feeling... my intuition is telling me they're out there and we will discover each other soon. i must carry forward the lesson i learned when i met my soul mate. i only met her after i just began to live the way i live and appreciate being on my own. i think that's my clue for this issue. i should just continue imagining, viewing, doing and writing about spanking and corporal punishment. the friends will come when it's time. when the time is right, they will be there.

spanking is just wonderful





sometimes it's alright to state the obvious. sometimes it just feels good to say or hear the obvious when it's something you're passionate about. we say "i love you!" to our partners on a daily basis, right? ;-) well, i should say more often "i love spanking women!" that's just the best thing one can do. it's good for you. it's good for the woman. i know it hurts her, but it's a good kind of hurt, right? of course it is.it can be innocent fun. the woman doesn't have to be naked. it's just good to have her draped over my lap, bottom sticking up and putting down those stinging spanks. we heat up those bottoms because they need heating. we make them weak from endorphines or cry because they need to feel that weakness and/or cry. it's deeply satisfying to warm up a woman's bottom that way.and, oh my god, the variety! spankings can be long or short; serious or playful; sexual or fun or disciplinary; implements or hand. mmmmm...you! random woman... what do you think? have you thought about it? what if there were no rules and you could just come up to me when when you see me and ask "hey, mister. i could use a good spanking. would you mind taking me over your lap and give me a good, hard spanking? don't bother if you don't intend to make me hurt..." well, ok! if you keep your shorts on, where's the risk. that thin cotton is no barrier to the that deep, delicious sting you crave.utopia. spanktopia!
