why world equestrian center





i have been a regular vendor at the world equestrian center in ocala for over a year.  what a beautiful and fun place to work!  the management and vendor coordinator have been so pleasant and easy to work with, i’m eager to come back for the next show!

throughout the winter circuit, the wec vendor team checked in with me weekly to ensure i had everything i needed to be successful as a vendor and brainstorm on solutions to any challenges i experienced.

tenney’s is proud to be a vendor at world equestrian center.  our missions are aligned in providing an exceptional experience for the exhibitors and general public as well.  the staff is great to work with and the fees are very fair.  i’m looking forward to an amazing summer at wec!

the opportunity to be a vendor at wec has been very advantageous for both brand awareness as well as sales. the vendor village is second to none – well laid out, cozy, and inviting, with amenities beyond what is available at most other show venues.

being a vendor at wec for the past five years has given equestrian sundry a great opportunity to connect with equestrian enthusiasts from across the country and canada.  from pony kids to adult ammys, to grand prix riders to pony moms & dads and everyone in between!  they all seem to really enjoy our equestrian inspired gift, home and apparel that we carry. we’re grateful that we can make meaningful relationships and expand our customer base within our storefront in the one-of-a-kind vendor village at wec wilmington.

as a vendor i particularly like the indoor village square setting and beautiful storefronts of vendor village. not only is it the best environment to display products rain or shine, but it also keeps the merchandise protected from damage. i design and sell fashion apparel and show competition coats, so this is especially important to me. it is a pleasant shopping experience, and i always meet friendly and interesting customers.

wec ensured that vendors were in high traffic areas, but done safely to make sure horses, riders and spectators did not get congested within the show grounds.


jill grant

the wec (wilmington) staff was a dream to work with!  the staff is friendly, responsive, and cares deeply about your satisfaction and the quality of the facilities.  any issues were minor and the team worked quickly to remedy through great communication.  i will return again soon!

the wec organization has come together to provide a state of the art facility for the equestrian community, and we at farmvet are proud to be able to service our customers at this beautiful venue. the professionalism of their leadership team has made doing business here a win-win for us, and for our customers.

this facility is truly world class. as a vendor that travels to some of the nicest horse facilities in the usa, this place is unequaled. wec offers the finest in all aspects of horse showing, with wonderful amenities for the horse, rider and vendor. the harris family is so grateful for the opportunity to attend shows here at wec. the staff is amazing and they are always ready and willing to do whatever it takes to make our setup smooth and uneventful.

wec is much classier and cleaner than most facilities i’ve been at and the faculty is tremendous to work with! the simplicity with setting up and tearing down in between shows in vendor village and not having to cover up or put away product is very convenient. the security that goes along with our product in vendor village is very important and with wec’s security we never have to worry about product being taken or ruined. being able to have a booth in the village that i am able to close a door, lock, and walk away from allows for peace of mind.
