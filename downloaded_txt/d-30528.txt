one of the first things that we want to
                      point out to you is that we believe that we are unique from
                      all of the other bird dog businesses that you may be
                      familiar with.


                     what makes us unique?
                    we provide all of these things for
                    youwe are a one stop shop if you wish:

our
                    business - bird dogs are our # 1 business. 
                    we make our living raising, training, hunting, and
                    selling bird dogs!
                    
breeding-



      
                      quality - we only breed to the best, proven wild 
                      bird dogs that are field tested, the primary goal that we 
                      are trying to measure and reproduce.    



      
                      championship stock - we own field champions and breed 
                      to field champions or dogs that we believe have the potential 
                      to be field champions.  
                      most of our foundation females are direct descendants 
                      of field champions.



      
                      dna tested  most of our dogs have been dna tested.  
                      we were dna testing our foundation dogs years before 
                      it was a requirement.  
                      we did this to improve our breeding results as well 
                      as certify parentage of our dogs for our customers.



      
                      facilities - we have a state-of-the-art breeding 
                      facility engineered by years of experience.



      
                      price  over the years, we have been able to keep 
                      our prices very reasonable.  
                      it doesnt cost much more to buy a quality dog that 
                      will be with you for ten years.  
                      our pups start at $750.



     
                      
all of our dogs and customer dogs are fed 
                      only the best dog food available on the market today  purina 
                      proplan.  they 
                      get a great start using purina and if you continue this 
                      feeding program they will develop to their full potential!
