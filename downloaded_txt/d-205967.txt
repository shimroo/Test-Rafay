seishindo - wisdom tools to help you live the life you desire

 

i have worked with thousands of people from many different countries and walks of life. i am best known for my work in smoking cessation, managing and dissolving depression, and alleviating the symptoms of ptsd. seishindo is a coaching modality based on the theories and philosophies of nlp, self-relations therapy, clarity coaching, aikido, and ericksonian hypnosis.  i will help you to understand the goals and dreams you deeply hold, and then i will gently guide you to achieve what it is you truly desire. together we can achieve what has been outside of your grasp when working alone. i will help you see and understand what has been ever so much outside of your sight so far. i will help you generate your true potential. listen to our podcasts, try out the many exercises available on the site as well as the seishindo channel on youtube, and take the time to find the information and experience that suits you best.  when you feel ready, we can talk for a half hour or so, and i will help you get clear on what your true goals are. and don’t worry, i promise to not try and sell you!send me an email here!
