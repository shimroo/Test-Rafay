testimonials 



 






						highland hall ensures that children are academically challenged in an extremely well-rounded supportive environment.					
amy saffireparent 








						it’s completely in line with my values. i fully support anything that encourages children’s innate intuition, self-exploration, connection to nature, and results in a true and deep love of learning.					
alison penelleparent 








						waldorf education provides a balanced, ethical and academic education that has served my kids well.					
jacqui dresparent 








						our son was formerly a student at a lausd elementary school up to grade 3. while he was doing well there, he regularly spent so much time on homework and test preparation. so much time after school doing his work. when we first did a tour of highland hall at the recommendation of a friend, we were amazed at the school grounds, all the space to run and play, grass and trees! the kids were actually allowed to play in the rain, with mud and puddles, of course with the correct footwear. he is allowed to be a kid here. he has a woodshop class and is learning chinese and spanish. the assignments are much more creative, and he really enjoys them. his main homework is practicing his cello, and i can't believe he sounds so good after one semester! he also loves the garden area and brings home fruits that he got to pick from the tree. the values at highland hall matched ours so thoroughly, that it was a no-brainer for us to commit to this amazing environment for our son.					
jeff bigmanlower school parent  








						highland hall's early childhood center (pre-k and kinder) have been amazing for my daughter who is highly-sensitive. having consistency in the schedule, the food preparations, being outside and in nature, and the warmth and nurturing of the teachers and staff have been tremendous. i have been blown away with their values for diversity, celebration, connection, and support for our school community and the world at large. it's been an amazing place for my daughter and me as a mother to be

						waldorf education has given my children the ability to lead their lives in an innovative and empathetic way. they have the ability to consider what they need and want but at the same time consider others and act based on both views. it truly has been amazing to witness as they grow up.					
blair allenhigh school parent 








						waldorf education supports the entire family and brings much needed community to raise inspirational and resilient kids.					
shannon garciaprek/kindy parent 








						we value a waldorf education for our children because there is no technology in the classrooms, for the emphasis on nature and community building, and also for the way arts and languages are integrated into the curriculum.					
rachel damianilower school parent  








						the teachers are incredible, the curriculum is holistic/fun/creative, and our children are a part of an amazing experience.					
hiwa and brendan elmslower school parents 








						we joined highland hall when our daughter entered 8th grade. it was such a positive, transformative experience for her. we feel fortunate we’ve been able to give her a waldorf education even if we got a late start. she feels at ease walking around the beautiful campus where faces are friendly and welcoming and she gets to have meaningful conversations with her teachers. highland hall is such a gift.					
pamela & sean barneshigh school parents 








						i picked waldorf education because, honestly, i was so impressed with the kids in the high school...they knew themselves. they were present, thoughtful, articulate and compassionate. they were smart, interesting people, and the most amazing thing about them was that you could tell immediately that their hearts were as educated as their minds.					
patti nicolellaalumni parent 








						the greatest thing about highland hall was that it was part of the fabric of our lives. the students, the teachers, and the parents were part of our community. it was a very loving and nurturing community to be part of and it was like an extended family.  what highland hall gave me was an enthusiasm and passion for learning and being creative. those things are much more important to your success in college and beyond.					
david whiteattorney, alumnus class of class of ‘81 








						highland hall presented me with a balance of my creative and analytical aspects -- it is what makes an engineer/artist possible.
