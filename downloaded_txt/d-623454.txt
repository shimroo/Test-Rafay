discover the luxurious culloden house
at the time of the jacobite uprising in 1745-46, bonnie prince charlie used culloden house as his lodging and battle headquarters prior to that fateful battle on culloden moor.
sense the pull of history as you relax in this most iconic of highland spots. and imagine the young prince, having inspired dreams of a jacobite victory, now on the eve of his last battle, badly in need of rest.


today, this historic inverness luxury hotel stands in nearly 40 acres where you are free to wander about the woodland and private gardens to enjoy the exceptional peace, tranquility and majesty of the grounds.
undoubtedly our greatest asset is the staff. here highland hospitality has been elevated to its highest art form without being “stuffy” nor too “proper” or reserved. after all you deserve, without compromise, the very best.
