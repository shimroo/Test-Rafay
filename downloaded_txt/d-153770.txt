this leaves them free to concentrate on the task at hand: keeping pets happy, fit, and funny as ever. when our doctors are happy, your pets are happy.

selling a veterinary practice? are you ready for a change? wellhaven pet health helps veterinarians and their teams succeed both personally and professionally. we value our owner veterinarians and encourage them to stay. our focus on personal growth, practice support, and life balance provide the framing of the relationship we want to have with our doctor leaders. for those who wish to exit practice management, we support them with a smooth transition plan focused on both the owner and the hospital team.







when i decided to consider the sale of my practice i did not know where to start. fortunately, i was approached by the wellhaven team and decided to talk to them. i’m glad i did because i still wanted to be involved with the practice, but i was ready to hand the management aspect over. wellhaven has been a very supportive group, and i still feel like my voice is important. i enjoy the camaraderie of the wellhaven team.

dr. m. philippson / dvm, ark pet hospital , st. paul,  mn





as a new grad veterinarian, i feel so lucky to have found a company that cares as much about my personal wellbeing as they do my professional success. from day 1, wellhaven has provided me with the support and resources necessary to becoming a confident and skilled veterinarian, as well as happy and well-rounded person. now, my schedule is a perfect mixture of surgery, urgent care, wellness visits, skiing, hiking, and exploring all that this beautiful area has to offer. it’s truly the work-life balance of my dreams.

dr. r. wertheimer / dvm, vancouver veterinary hospital





my favorite thing about working at wellhaven is helping out with people’s pets, having a smile on the owner’s face after we help them. always love hearing them being thankful with us, and being thankful they came in. it’s the best thing about being a tech

yareli / veterinary technician





at wellhaven we have a good solid team and communication is key. we’ve worked so well together. making sure things get done at an appropriate time, helping the doctors, just helping everyone. even though we may not be assigned to that role for that day, we still help out and it makes the day go by sooner.

practice management
you became a veterinarian to help families take the best possible care of their pets, not to balance the books, chase down payments, or do any number of other administrative chores. we understand these stresses – and we’re here to help.

learn more about this service.




life/work balance
when selling your practice to wellhaven, you will be free to focus on what you love: taking care of our four-legged family members. we help you to set the perfect balance for both your professional and personal lives. why stay after hours if you don’t have to?

learn more about this service.




empower your team
we won’t forget about your vet nurse technicians and other employees. with such busy schedules, it can be hard to continue their education. wellhaven works to provide opportunities for learning that will help their careers in the short and long terms.

pet care that truly cares
pets give so much to the family while asking very little in return. the occasional belly rub, table scrap, or walk in the park. but when they no longer seem interested in any of those things, something is wrong.
whether they got into something they shouldn’t have, have issues with oral health, or simply just getting older, let our veterinarians take a look. we offer full “nose to tail” care for your four-legged family member.













virtual care
providing face-to-face consults from the comfort of your home will allow our vets to more efficiently work with our patients. these visits will also remove the stress pets can often feel when in a new environment, no matter how safe and comfortable our clinics can be.




wellness plans
whether it’s kitty’s first shots or dental work for your old trusty companion, wellhaven wellness plans provide care for your pet throughout their lifetime. as your pet ages, their needs change - and our plans will change right along with them.




nutrition counseling
is your tabby getting tubby? is fido getting flabby? studies show that more than half of adult dogs and cats are obese. let us outline a diet plan to get your pet back to a healthy weight. and, yes, we’ll make room for the occasional treat.




internal medicine
it can be stressful to see your pet in distress even though there is no visible trauma. every wellhaven clinic is outfitted with an in-house diagnostic lab and radiology (x-ray) department so we can see, analyze, and make recommendations for treatment when your pet just isn’t feeling right.

number one, i love pets. i love helping them – that’s why we’re here at wellhaven. and i love client education. taking somebody from their first new pet and seeing it to the geriatric age and seeing that progression of them learning through the years of what to expect. and then seeing them with a new pet. they’re not new pet owners anymore. it’s great. 
brian / certified veterinary technician





at wellhaven, we all come from different backgrounds and we have different life experiences, and yet we’re able to come together and deliver excellent patient care, work together, and be a wholehearted team. it’s really hard to find that. and i feel like we’ve got that here at our house and it all boils down to taking care of the patient.
