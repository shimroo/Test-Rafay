the state of cancer research
and we already know how small a role the cancer gene plays in the onset of cancer: there has been an 8-fold to 17-fold increase in the incidence of cancer in the last hundred years, but not even one-millionth of 1 percent of that increase can be related to genes.
genes evolve over hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years, which means that the so-called cancer gene has had no impact on the huge increase we’ve seen since 1900. virtually 90 percent of the cancer that we see today cannot possibly have anything to do with genes.

comparing google ai and deepseek ai:  how does a cleaning service develop its first “quality management system” ?
posted by michael a. s. guth on  february 18th, 2025 

from google ai:


to develop a first quality management system (qms) as a cleaning service, you should start by clearly defining your quality standards, establishing customer-focused expectations, documenting cleaning procedures, training staff thoroughly on these standards, implementing regular quality checks through inspections and client feedback, and continuously monitor and improve processes based on feedback to maintain high quality service delivery; this can often involve utilizing a framework like iso 9001 as a guideline. 












key steps to build a cleaning service qms:









identify customer needs and expectations:
conduct surveys or meetings with clients to understand their specific cleaning requirements and priorities. 
















develop quality standards:
create detailed cleaning checklists outlining specific tasks, areas to focus on, and acceptable cleanliness levels for different environments. 
















establish a quality policy:
write a formal statement outlining the company’s commitment to providing high-quality cleaning services and continuous improvement. 
















staff training and education:
train all cleaning staff on proper cleaning techniques, chemical safety, quality standards, and the use of cleaning equipment. 
















implement quality checks and inspections:
regularly conduct site inspections to verify adherence to cleaning standards, including random checks and documented feedback. 
















client feedback mechanism:
establish a system for collecting client feedback through surveys, direct feedback, or complaint logs to identify areas for improvement. 
















documentation and recordkeeping:
maintain detailed records of cleaning activities, inspections, staff training, and client feedback to track performance and identify trends. 
















continuous improvement process:
regularly review quality data, identify areas for improvement, and implement corrective actions to enhance cleaning services. 




consider using a recognized quality management framework:












iso 9001: this widely used standard provides a structured approach to quality management, including requirements for documentation, process control, and continuous improvement. 



important aspects to focus on:







leadership commitment:
ensure management actively supports the quality management system and promotes a culture of quality. 
















communication:
clearly communicate quality standards and expectations to all staff members. 
















employee engagement:
encourage staff to participate in quality improvement initiatives and provide feedback. 
















data analysis:
utilize data from inspections and feedback to make informed decisions about process improvements. 







from deepseek ai:





developing a quality management system (qms) for a cleaning service is essential to ensure consistent service delivery, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. here’s a step-by-step guide to creating your first qms:

1. define your objectives

purpose: clearly outline why you need a qms (e.g., improve service quality, meet customer expectations, comply with regulations).
goals: set measurable goals, such as reducing customer complaints, improving response times, or achieving industry certifications (e.g., iso 9001).


2. understand customer requirements

identify what your customers value most (e.g., cleanliness, punctuality, professionalism).
gather feedback through surveys, reviews, or direct communication to understand expectations and areas for improvement.


3. document processes and standards

standard operating procedures (sops): create detailed step-by-step instructions for all cleaning tasks (e.g., office cleaning, carpet cleaning, window washing).
checklists: develop checklists for each service to ensure consistency and completeness.
quality standards: define what “quality” means for your services (e.g., no visible dust, sanitized surfaces, no streaks on windows).


4. train your team

provide comprehensive training on sops, safety protocols, and customer service.
emphasize the importance of quality and how their work impacts customer satisfaction.
conduct regular refresher training to maintain high standards.


5. implement monitoring and inspection

supervisory checks: have supervisors or team leaders inspect completed work to ensure it meets quality standards.
customer feedback: use customer feedback as a key metric for quality.
mystery shopping: hire third-party evaluators to assess service quality anonymously.


6. establish key performance indicators (kpis)

track metrics such as:

customer satisfaction scores
number of complaints/resolution time
completion rates (on-time, within budget)
employee performance and adherence to sops




7. create a feedback loop

regularly review customer feedback, inspection results, and kpis.
use this data to identify trends, areas for improvement, and training needs.
communicate findings and updates to your team.


8. develop a corrective action process

address issues promptly when quality standards are not met.
document problems, root causes, and actions taken to prevent recurrence.
use this process to continuously improve your services.


9. consider certification (optional)

if you want to formalize your qms, consider pursuing certifications like iso 9001 (international standard for quality management).
certification can enhance your credibility and attract more clients.


10. use technology to support your qms

implement software tools to:

schedule and track cleaning tasks
manage customer feedback and complaints
monitor employee performance
generate reports for quality analysis




11. review and improve

regularly review your qms to ensure it remains effective and aligned with your business goals.
update processes, training, and standards as needed based on feedback and changing customer expectations.


example of a simple qms framework for a cleaning service

customer requirements: clean offices to a spotless standard within 2 hours.
sops: detailed steps for dusting, vacuuming, and sanitizing.
checklist: a 10-point checklist for each cleaning task.
inspection: supervisor inspects 20% of completed jobs daily.
kpi: 95% customer satisfaction rate.
feedback: monthly customer surveys and quarterly team reviews.
improvement: address recurring issues (e.g., streaks on windows) with targeted training.


by following these steps, your cleaning service can establish a robust qms that ensures high-quality service, satisfied customers, and a competitive edge in the market.

reflections on aging
posted by michael a. s. guth on  february 9th, 2025 

from join1440.com
“background
aging is the progressive decline of the human body’s function that results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors. as our cells accumulate damage, important systemic processes within the body become dysregulated, leading to an increased rate of disease and mortality (see overview here).
the global population is aging at an unprecedented rate, a phenomenon that carries significant social and economic challenges. societies are investing heavily in the fight against aging—a recent analysis revealed that a slowdown of aging by just one year could be worth $38t in the us alone.
what happens to the body
as we age, our cells accumulate damage on many fronts, including mutations in dna (the information code of our cells), shortening of telomeres (protective end caps on dna strands), and epigenetic alterations (changes in how our cells read dna information).
this causes our microscopic machinery to go awry. the result is decreased cellular function, impaired mitochondrial energy production, and less efficient repair mechanisms. read more about the causes of cellular aging.
as our body’s building blocks break down, our organs and tissues experience an associated loss of structure and function. this results in a cycle of inflammation and tissue fibrosis that reduces the functional capacity of our vital organs.
all of these microscopic changes add up to what we see as “getting older.” our bones lose the ability to resist stress (i.e., osteoporosis), the structural integrity of our skin fails (i.e., wrinkles), our heart no longer pumps with the necessary strength (i.e., heart failure), and we are more at risk of injury and disease.
what happens to the brain
the same cellular- and tissue-level changes associated with aging have a particularly destructive effect on our brains.
as cellular function decreases, inflammation rises and the accumulation of cellular waste disrupts the ability of our brain cells to talk to each other. this impairs our processing of complex cognitive tasks and weakens our memory (what happens to your brain through life).
these neurologic changes often translate to depression, social withdrawal, and increased susceptibility to diseases like alzheimer’s and parkinson’s dementia.
chronological versus biological aging
while the most familiar convention of measuring age is “chronological” (that is, measuring age in years), there is an emerging interest in determining “biological age.”
this method uses formulas or blood test results to estimate the cellular age of a person. in other words, biological age is not a function of time but rather of how well cellular and organ systems are functioning in each individual. in this way, interventions such as exercise, healthy lifestyles, and perhaps even medications could reverse one’s biological age—all while their chronological age increases.
while some testable biomarkers have emerged as candidates (e.g., the epigenetic clock), there is ongoing research to uncover simple, reliable means to measure and track one’s biological age over time.
lifespan versus healthspan
while tremendous recent progress has been made in the field of aging, the emphasis has begun to shift from extending lifespan (the number of years one is alive) to maximizing an individual’s healthspan (the number of years one is active and without disease).
researchers emphasize a holistic approach to nurturing your healthspan, including consistent daily movement and exercise, high-quality sleep hygiene, a balanced diet with whole foods, and more.”

patient compliance, investigator compliance, and more compliance
posted by michael a. s. guth on  february 9th, 2025 


importance of compliance: compliance (adherence to the study protocol by participants and researchers) is a cornerstone of successful clinical trials. poor compliance can lead to unreliable results, increased costs, and even trial failure.
types of compliance:

participant compliance: refers to how well participants follow the trial protocol, including taking medications as prescribed, attending scheduled visits, and completing required procedures.
investigator compliance: involves adherence by researchers to the trial protocol, including proper data collection, reporting, and ethical conduct.


consequences of non-compliance:

non-compliance by participants can lead to biased outcomes, reduced statistical power, and difficulty in interpreting results.
non-compliance by investigators can result in protocol violations, ethical issues, and compromised data integrity.


factors affecting compliance:

participant factors: lack of understanding, forgetfulness, side effects, and personal beliefs can reduce participant compliance.
trial design factors: complex protocols, frequent visits, and burdensome procedures can discourage participation and adherence.
investigator factors: inadequate training, lack of resources, and poor communication can lead to non-compliance by researchers.


strategies to improve compliance:

participant engagement: educating participants about the importance of the trial, simplifying protocols, and providing reminders (e.g., phone calls, text messages) can enhance adherence.
investigator training: ensuring researchers are well-trained and motivated to follow protocols strictly.
monitoring and feedback: regular monitoring of compliance and providing feedback to participants and investigators can help identify and address issues early.
incentives: offering incentives (e.g., financial compensation, travel reimbursement) can improve participant retention and adherence.


technological solutions: leveraging technology, such as electronic monitoring devices and mobile apps, to track and improve compliance.
ethical considerations: ensuring compliance should not compromise ethical standards. participants must provide informed consent, and their autonomy and well-being should always be prioritized.
conclusion: compliance is not just a minor detail but a fundamental aspect of clinical trial success. addressing compliance proactively through thoughtful trial design, participant engagement, and investigator training is essential for generating reliable and valid results.

best podcast episode of all the podcasts in 2024
posted by michael a. s. guth on  december 18th, 2024 

the best single episode of any podcast (subscribe to 70) that i have heard this year. the episode is so good, i will probably repost this message a couple times in 2025.
“in 1962, president john f. kennedy said, “those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.”
it was a recognition of a universal truth in human history: social stability, the rule of law, and civilization will eventually break down if a population is immiserated for too long while a handful of elites profit. and just two months after that speech, kennedy honed in on the health care crisis in america, pressing for the passage of what would become medicare. ”
“what we are now talking about doing, most of the countries of europe did years ago,” he said at a madison square garden rally. “we are behind every country, pretty nearly, in europe, in this matter of medical care for our citizens.”
i’ve been thinking a lot about that moment in history in light of the news over the past week. all of a sudden, after the murder of unitedhealthcare ceo brian thompson, everyone is talking about health care, even though almost nobody was talking about it during the presidential campaign.
david sirota reflects on the shocking murder of united health ceo brian thompson and the surge of public anger it unleashed against america’s broken health insurance system. why hasn’t this longstanding outrage translated into universal health care — a system every other wealthy nation already has?
tracing decades of broken promises and corporate influence — from the clinton and obama administrations to today — sirota looks at how political corruption has trapped americans in a system that profits from their suffering. drawing on jfk’s 1960s warnings about social stability and justice, this audio essay explores the health care crisis as a symptom of a deeper democracy crisis — and asks what it will take for americans to finally demand change.

surgical implantation of autologous dopamine neuron progenitor cells (danpcs) into the putamen of patients with parkinson’s disease
posted by michael a. s. guth on  november 14th, 2024 

parkinson’s disease 

parkinson’s disease (pd) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after alzheimer’s disease. performed market assessment for some of the latest (2024) treatments for pd. (1) produodopa—a new treatment approved by nice for people with pd who experience movement-related symptoms. it’s delivered continuously by a small pump that’s inserted under the skin. (2) vyalev—(foscarbidopa and foslevodopa) is a solution of carbidopa and levodopa prodrugs for 24-hour continuous subcutaneous infusion that’s been approved for pd motor fluctuations. (3) crexont—a new formulation of immediate- and extended-release levodopa with carbidopa. (levodopa is converted in the brain to dopamine, the chemical that goes missing in pd; carbidopa helps levodopa get into the brain and decreases side effects.) (4) safinamide— a novel experimental drug that shows potential in the treatment of pd and epilepsy. it works by blocking voltage-dependent sodium and n-type calcium channels, inhibiting glutamate release. (5) methylphenidate and atomoxetine—noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors that are being investigated for their effects on balance and gait. (6) levodopa inhalation powder—a formulation of levodopa that can be used as needed when medication effects wear off. (7) focused ultrasound—a minimally invasive treatment that uses beams of heat to generate acoustic energy and precisely target areas of the brain that control voluntary movement. (8) deep brain stimulation—a surgical procedure that involves implanting electrodes in the brain to deliver electrical impulses and disrupt abnormal circuitry. (9) bemdaneprocel—a cell therapy that’s showing positive results in clinical trials, including improved motor function and symptom control.
aspiro clinical trial (phase 1 & 2a). autologous dopamine neuron progenitor cells (danpcs) are surgically implanted into the putamen of patients with pd. the putamen is a round structure located at the base of the forebrain (telencephalon). the putamen and caudate nucleus together form the dorsal striatum. the putamen is a subcortical structure that is part of a group of structures known as the basal ganglia or basal nuclei. (“basal nuclei” is technically more accurate, because “ganglia” usually refers to clusters of nerve cell bodies outside the central nervous system.) the putamen is adjacent to the globus pallidus and together they are sometimes referred to as the lentiform or lenticular nucleus. the putamen is involved in (reward-related) learning and motor control, including speech articulation, language functions, reward, cognitive functioning, and addiction.

pd affects the putamen in several ways, including dopamine depletion—pd causes a gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (snpc), which leads to a depletion of dopamine in the putamen. this depletion causes motor dysfunction. atrophy—the putamen can undergo atrophy, which is associated with motor symptoms and cognitive status.  shape changes—the putamen can undergo shape changes, particularly in the right putamen. decreased activity.




other parts of the brain that are affected by pd include the caudate and nucleus accumbens, which can also experience dopamine depletion. dopamine replacement therapy can partially restore motor function, but long-term treatment can lead to motor complications.
the effect on pd symptoms, safety and tolerability, and cell survival are assessed for 5 years post-transplant (with mri and pet imaging scans of the brain). safety and tolerability are assessed annually for an additional 10 years via telephone call (total follow-up of 15 years).
the biologic implanted, anpd001, is an experimental product derived from autologous skin cells converted to induced pluripotent stem cells. the stem cells were differentiated into danpcs. dose escalation will be achieved by bilateral injection of these danpcs into the putamen.
primary outcome measures: incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (teae) and serious adverse events. secondary outcome measures: “on” time without troublesome dyskinesia [time frame: 1 year (primary follow up) and 5 years (long term follow up)]. post-injection change in movement disorder society – unified parkinson’s disease rating scale (mds-updrs) part ii (activities of daily living – adl) and part iii (motor score) in the on state. “on” time or on state simply means the period when the parkinson’s medication is effectively managing symptoms, allowing for normal movement with minimal side effects.
 the anterior commissure (ac) is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects different parts of the brain and is important for communication between the brain and the body. the ac is a white matter tract that connects the two cerebral hemispheres across the midline, in front of the fornix columns. although pd is primarily considered a gray matter (gm) disease, alterations in white matter (wm) have gained increasing attention in pd research recently. recent evidence from mri scans reveals correlations between wm changes and specific pd symptoms, and these wm abnormalities may be caused by changes of oligodendrocyte (ols)/myelin in pd.

an independent review of camrelizumab-rivoceranib combination therapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and rivoceranib for gastric cancer
posted by michael a. s. guth on  september 8th, 2024 

https://biomedres.us/pdfs/bjstr.ms.id.009118.pdf 
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383861594_an_independent_review_of_camrelizumab-rivoceranib_combination_therapy_for_the_treatment_of_hepatocellular_carcinoma_and_rivoceranib_for_gastric_cancer/
abstract: the cares-310 clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of camrelizumab, an anti-pd-1 antibody, combined with rivoceranib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (vegfr2)-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki), versus the obsolete standard of care sorafenib as first-line (1l) treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uhcc). in this independent analysis of the cares-310 trial, potential bias in the choice of comparator and the clinical significance of the results are reexamined. although rivoceranib (also known as “apatinib”) is approved in china to treat patients with advanced gastric cancer, the clinical trial conducted in the usa for patients with gastric cancer seems to indicate missed endpoints and weak evidence to justify fda approval. due to a nondisclosure agreement, the principal investigators are unable to comment on these results. however, from a table of functional benefits and harms, readers might well conclude that palliative hospice care is non-inferior to rivoceranib for patients with stage 4 gastric cancer.

https://biomedres.us/pdfs/bjstr.ms.id.009118.pdf
conclusion
the cares-310 clinical trials produced a new longest median os of 23.8 months for patients with uhcc treated with c-r.  however, the cares-310 clinical trial may have been overweighted with an asian population with preexposure to antiviral therapy and better preservation of liver function at time of hcc diagnosis. conversely, the cares-310 trial was underweighted with western patients who have nafld, diabetes, obesity, and other co-morbidities and confounding factors.  oncologists already have 1l patient treatment experience for uhcc with roche’s fda-approved anti-pd-l1/vegf combination tecentriq and avastin and with astrazeneca’s ctla-4 checkpoint inhibitor imjudo combined with its pd-l1 antagonist imfinzi for treatment of uhcc. it would be useful to compare the c-r proposed therapy with these drug combinations and determine if c-r maintains an 8.6-month median os advantage over the new comparator(s).
when rivoceranib plus hospice care was compared to hospice care alone in a clinical trial of patients with advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, the results data were mixed. for some measures of functional benefits and harms, the patients with hospice care alone had higher percentages for certain functional benefits and lower percentages for some harms and adverse events.  the rivoceranib-treated group failed to consistently outperform hospice care alone using these measures.  based on those benefits and harms, hospice care alone was not inferior to rivoceranib + hospice care, which calls into question the underlying clinical value, if any, of rivoceranib to the american patient population with advanced gastric cancer.  the fact that rivoceranib, known as apatinib, is approved in china for treatment of advanced gastric raises anew questions about fundamental differences in patient populations between china and the usa or europe for medical conditions such as uhcc and advanced gastric cancer.

covid-19 treatment strategies:  september 2024 update
posted by michael a. s. guth on  august 29th, 2024 

 image:  computer simulation of sars-cov-2. reprinted with kind permission of janet iwasa of http://animationlab.utah.edu/cova
update september 2024
covid-19 treatment strategies

as of 2023, a few small-molecule antiviral drugs (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, remdesivir, and molnupiravir) and 11 monoclonal antibodies have been marketed for the treatment of covid-19, mostly requiring administration within 10 days of symptom onset.
hospitalized patients with severe or critical covid-19 may benefit from treatment with previously approved immunomodulatory drugs, including glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone, cytokine antagonists such as genentech’s tocilizumab, and janus kinase inhibitors such as lilly’s baricitinib.
repurposing rna polymerase nucleotide drugs, such as gilead’s remdesivir and merck’s molnupiravir, to inhibit viral rna synthesis should have a relatively high probability of success, but it remains a trial-and-error endeavour to identify nucleotide/nucleoside analogs that escape the sars-cov-2 proofreading mechanism.
repurposing dna polymerase inhibitors, such as gilead’s tenofovir, to inhibit the rna synthesis of sars-cov-2 is likely to fail due to their different mechanisms of action.
hiv protease inhibitors, such as lopinavir, should not be repurposed for sars-cov-2 treatment due to the lack of similarity between the drug-binding pockets in hiv and sars-cov-2 proteases.
except for nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors such as tenofovir, ribavirin, and lamivudine, other virus-targeted inhibitors have not been approved by the fda to treat more than one infectious disease. they are not good repurposing candidates because their chemical structures are often designed to target a particular drug-binding pocket with high selectivity, and thus they are unlikely to have a similar level of potency against an unrelated target.
cationic amphiphilic drugs (such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and amiodarone) that induce phospholipidosis should not be repurposed, because cellular phospholipidosis is often misinterpreted as antiviral efficacy.
a new one-step immunoassays has been developed for rapid and sensitive detection of sars-cov-2 by using a single-chain variable fragment (scfv) fused to alkaline phosphatase (ap) or nanoluc (nluc) luciferase. first, a high-affinity scfv antibody specific to the sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid (n) protein was screened from hybridoma cells-derived and phage-displayed library. next, prokaryotic expression of the scfv-ap and scfv-nluc fusion proteins were induced, leading to excellent antibody binding properties and enzyme catalytic activities.
upregulation of interleukin-6 (il-6) has been associated with worse prognosis in covid-19 patients. janssen conducted a phase 2 randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of free il-6 sequestration by the monoclonal antibody sirukumab in severe and critical covid-19 patients. in critical covid-19 patients who received sirukumab, there was no statistically significant difference in time to sustained clinical improvement versus placebo despite objective sequestration of circulating il-6, questioning il-6 as a key therapeutic target in covid-19.

the cdc confirmed today the first case of the omicron variant, which is officially known as b1.1.529,  in the united states.  the most concerning aspect of this new variant is the number of mutations associated with it.  viruses are not living organisms; they require a host to continue or survive. the more hosts that viruses can find, the more likely they are to mutate further and potentially become more harmful to the hosts. viruses cannot replicate on their own.  instead they capture or “hijack” the reproductive mechanism in the host cell, redirect it to copy the genetic code of the virus, and seal it in a packet called a capsid. in a single human being, there can be a billion or even a trillion copies of the sars-cov-2 virus. most of the time, these mutations or mistakes involve different amino acid sequences that may give rise to different proteins but do not enhance the ability of the virus to infect or replicate any better than the original copy. occasionally, a mutation will increase infectivity and may, or may not, code for a new protein that the immune system fails to recognize.
the spike protein on sars-cov-2 interacts specifically with the ace2 receptor, which is found on the surface of our cells mainly in the gi tract, the respiratory tract, and our vasculature. when the new  viral particles are created, they may have slightly different proteins either inside or outside the viral particle.  of particular interest, the mutation may exist on the outer tip of the spike protein, which is called the receptor binding domain (rbd).  our immune system recognizes the sars-cov-2 based on the rbd. thus any mutation that changes the proteins in areas that make it easier for the virus to bind to our cells’ receptors or evade detection by the immune system will be advantageous to virus survival.
let’s compare omicron to two prior variants:  alpha and delta.  as to the virus particle itself, alpha had 23 mutations, delta had 17 mutations, and omicron has 50 mutations.  as to the spike protein, alpha had 9 mutations, delta had 7 mutations, and omicron has 32 mutations. as to the rbd, alpha had 1 mutation, delta had 2 mutations, and omicron has 10 mutations.  the number and variety of mutations associated with the omicron variant deserves serious concern.

scientists are now focused on three questions: (1) what is the transmissibility of the omicron variant?, (2) how well does it evade our current covid-19 vaccines?, and (3) is there a change in the virulence (the variant is more deadly)?
 
from july 24, 2021

the delta variant (b.1.617.2) has proven to be more contagious than the original sars-cov-2 (r0 = 3.5–4.5 vs r0 ~ 2.5) perhaps through better binding or better evasion of the immune system. (the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is coated with sugar molecules, or glycans, that help it evade the immune system.) the react-1 round 12 report (imperial college london) found the delta variant prevalence in those aged 5–49 was 2.5 times higher at 0.20% (0.16%, 0.26%) compared with those aged 50 years and above at 0.08% (0.06%, 0.11%). while people over age 50 may have higher vaccination rates, the delta variant may pose a higher risk of infection for younger-aged individuals. as to hospitalization, the lancet published correspondence (june 26, 2021) on a study in scotland that the delta variant had a 1.85 times higher risk of getting the person infected admitted to the hospital with severe covid-19 [hazard ratio 1.85 (95% ci 1.39–2.47)].  the scottish study used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) tests and a cox regression analysis, which adjusts for age, sex, economic status/deprivation, temporal trend, and comorbidities.
as of july 2021, the pfizer-biontech vaccine was shown to be effective against the delta variant symptomatic infection at 88% (uk study), 87% (canadian study), 64% (israeli study), 79% (scottish study), and effective against the delta variant resulting in hospitalization at 96% (uk study) and 98% (israeli study). the data for the moderna vaccine are more limited and show the vaccine is 72% effective against symptomatic infection and 96% effective against hospitalization for the delta variant after just the first dose of the two-dose vaccine. the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine was found to be effective against the delta variant at 60% (uk study), 67% (canadian study for single dose), 60% (scottish study) for symptomatic infection and 93% (uk study), 88% (canadian study) effective against delta variant hospitalization. for the j&j vaccine, real-world evidence on effectiveness against the delta variant is not yet available; however, j&j’s internal lab study showed it was highly effective against the south african variant, which was most prevalent at the time, and that the antibody response to the delta variant is even better: a very good antibody response to the delta variant based on lab testing.

for early-onset covid-19 cases (positive covid-19 test and at-risk for progression of the disease but not experiencing symptoms requiring hospital-ization): “the fda has halted the distribution of lilly’s combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab in arizona, california, florida, indiana, oregon and washington––all states where coronavirus variants from brazil and south africa account for more than 10% of those with the disease. the antibody combo had previously been paused in illinois and massachusetts.
providers in those states should use regeneron’s antibody treatment of casirivimab and imdevimab, as per the fda. lab studies have shown that option is more effective against the brazilian (p.1) and south african (b.1.351) strains, according to the agency.” [https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-halts-use-lilly-covid-19-antibody-treatment-6-states-where-variants-are-prevalent]
timing is important: mabs are very good at stopping the virus outside the cells. once the sars-cov-2 has infected the cells, antibodies are not able to neutralize the virus. the patient then needs cytotoxic t-cells.
two randomized clinical trials of vitamin d, one from india (shade study) and one from spain (calcifediol study), have shown that vitamin d supplementation definitely benefitted patients with covid-19. emerging evidence shows vitamin d combined with either or both vitamin k2 and magnesium potentiates the benefits of vitamin d. source for k2 synergy: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/

n-acetyl-cysteine (nac) (600 mg) has known antiviral and liver protective properties. one argument for use with covid-19 is https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780893/ and another https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24968347/ and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9230243/
sleep (7 – 9 hours): antibody and immune response after (flu) vaccination is improved if the patient has had a good night’s sleep, particularly the hours of sleep before midnight (slow wave sleep). optimal t-cell production for disease prevention also requires optimal sleep. melatonin may help patients get to sleep and has anti-viral properties. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32347747/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32768490/
at the early stages of covid-19 infection, the innate immune system is responsible for attacking the virus (primarily using monocytes & natural killer cells) through production of interferon (ifn). sars-cov-2 delays the body’s ifn response. patients with severe disease had less type i ifn activity in their blood compared to patients with mild to moderate disease. (the innate immune system diminishes with aging.) any method to enhance the innate immune response in the early course of the disease could limit progression of covid-19. sauna baths, hot water baths, and other sources of human hyperthermia can induce a tenfold increase ifn-gamma synthesis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3132509/ these results suggest that raising the core body temperature akin to a mild fever may stimulate the innate immune system (particularly if followed by a cold shower or rapid cooling) and thereby attenuate covid-19.

“to be clear, sars-cov-2 is not the flu. it causes a disease with different symptoms, spreads and kills more readily, and belongs to a completely different family of viruses. this family, the coronaviruses, includes just six other members that infect humans. four of them—oc43, hku1, nl63, and 229e—have been gently annoying humans for more than a century, causing a third of common colds. the other two—mers and sars (or “sars-classic,” as some virologists have started calling it)—both cause far more severe disease. why was this seventh coronavirus the one to go pandemic? suddenly, what we do know about coronaviruses becomes a matter of international concern.” why the coronavirus has been so successful, the atlantic

the outbreak of sars-cov-2 disease (covid-19) is currently, march 2020, affecting more than 100000 people worldwide and, according to the who (world health organization), a pandemic is shortly expected. the virus infects the lower respiratory tract and causes severe pneumonia and mortality in approximately 10% and 3-5%, respectively, of cases, mainly among the elderly and/or people affected by other diseases. ahcc is an α-glucan-based standardized mushroom extract that has been extensively investigated as an immunostimulant both in animals and/or in humans affected by west nile virus, influenza virus, avian influenza virus, hepatitis c virus, papillomavirus, herpes virus, hepatitis b virus and hiv by promoting a regulated and protective immune response. although the efficacy of ahcc has not yet been specifically evaluated with respect to sars-cov-2 disease, its action in promoting a protective response to a wide range of viral infections, and the current absence of effective vaccines, could support its use in the prevention of diseases provoked by human pathogenic coronavirus, including covid-19.

star anise oil (pimpinella anisum)





“the chinese star anise plant has a long history as a healing herb — for digestive problems, women’s health, and for treating colds and flu. the swiss pharmaceutical company, roche, focused in on the cold and flu benefit and then “subtracted out” all of the “extraneous” biochemicals in the plant until they settled on one component, shikimic acid, that they said was responsible for the star anise plant’s ability to inhibit colds and flu’s. from shikimic acid, they synthesized oseltamivir (for patent purposes), and thus was born tamiflu. this is a subtractive process. you eliminate everything “extraneous” and get down to one single active ingredient. of course, there are major problems with this magic bullet approach.” https://www.jonbarron.org/colds-flus-infectious-diseases/using-anti-pathogens

screening for antiviral activities of isolated compounds from essential oils 
astani a, et al. evid based complement alternat med 2011.
essential oil of star anise as well as phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenes, for example, trans-anethole, eugenol, β-eudesmol, farnesol, β-caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene oxide, which are present in many essential oils, were examined for their antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) in vitro. antiviral activity was analyzed by plaque reduction assays and mode of antiviral action was determined by addition of the drugs to uninfected cells, to the virus prior to infection or to herpesvirus-infected cells. star anise oil reduced viral infectivity by >99%, phenylpropanoids inhibited hsv infectivity by about 60-80% and sesquiterpenes suppressed herpes virus infection by 40-98%. both, star anise essential oil and all isolated compounds exhibited anti-hsv-1 activity by direct inactivation of free virus particles in viral suspension assays. all tested drugs interacted in a dose-dependent manner with herpesvirus particles, thereby inactivating viral infectivity. star anise oil, rich in trans-anethole, revealed a high selectivity index of 160 against hsv, whereas among the isolated compounds only β-caryophyllene displayed a high selectivity index of 140. the presence of β-caryophyllene in many essential oils might contribute strongly to their antiviral ability. these results indicate that phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenes present in essential oils contribute to their antiviral activity against hsv.

compounded tirzepatide therapy for weight loss:  a health outcomes researcher’s perspective
posted by michael a. s. guth on  june 23rd, 2024 

objective:  a male health outcomes researcher, age 55 – 65, with bmi ≥ 27 kg/m2, but without type 2 diabetes, took compounded tirzepatide 7.5 mg/week therapy with a goal of losing 10% of body weight over approximately four weeks and restoring bmi ≤ 25 kg/m2.  this study was also intended to offer a more sophisticated perspective of what compounded tirzepatide therapy entails and dispel some of the hype and myths currently circulating in popular media about tirzepatide and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1) class of injectable drugs. all previous medical journals articles that mention tirzepatide have referred to the branded product, while this article is the first one focused solely on compounded tirzepatide.
 
methods: the patient received subcutaneous injections of 7.5 mg compounded tirzepatide over four and a half weeks.  in the first, third, and fourth weeks, the patient received 7.5 mg of compounded tirzepatide as a bolus injection.  in week 2, the 7.5 mg dose was distributed over two injections of approximately 3.75 mg each given two days apart.  the primary end point in the trial was the percentage change in body weight from initiation to end of treatment.
 
results: with a little over four weeks of compounded tirzepatide therapy, the patient achieved a 5% reduction in body weight and a bmi = 25.8. despite having a healthy vegan diet and supplementing with many vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and nutrients, the patient experienced most of the adverse events associated with the branded tirzepatide drug and the glp-1 receptor agonist class of injectable drugs. however, the study revealed an undulating pattern  in which the compounded tirzepatide lost efficacy—or the patient built up resistance/tolerance for the drug—and also produced desirable side effects, both of which were findings not previously reported in the literature. 
 
conclusions: although compounded tirzepatide represents a welcome addition to the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip) and glp-1 receptor agonist class of drugs in chronic weight management, a 7.5 mg weekly dose of compounded tirzepatide over four weeks is unlikely to produce a lasting 10% reduction in body weight over the course of a month even for average-weight (male) patients, even for those patients practicing intermittent fasting and choosing a vegan diet, let alone those patients with the typical american eating habits and diet. neither the center for medicare and medicaid services (cms) nor other payers should cover the ten times more expensive branded version of these drugs for weight loss until the manufacturers can prove with real-world evidence (rwe) that the patients’ weight losses are permanent as desired. in contrast, the compounded versions of these peptide drugs are affordable and reasonable tools for continued clinical study.

current research on drug used for obesity and weight loss
posted by michael a. s. guth on  april 18th, 2024 

in the obesity landscape, glucagoon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) agonists dominate the weight loss market. amylin agonists work differently from glp-1s but may be able to induce similar weight loss with fewer adverse events. my client wanted to understand the molecular differences between various amylin assets and their hypothetical impacts on the efficacy / adverse event profile.
project’s key research questions/topics include:
(1) describe the medical literature as it pertains to amylin for obesity specifically – e.g. years researching, articles on amylin published, clinical trials, or other types of experience – please specify.
(2) comment on the differences between cagrilintide, petrelintide, amycretin and any other amylin agonists?
(3) describe the theoretical physiologies of the various subsets within amylin receptors (calcitonin, amy1r, amy2r, amy3r).
(4) comment on whether the ph of the assets differ, and whether these could have material impacts on the drug profile?
(5) comment on the solubility of cagrilintide and other amylin assets, as well as the corresponding impacts on the drug profile (e.g. half-life)?
despite the similarities between glp-1 and amylin agonists (e.g. both molecular classes slow gastric emptying, decrease glucagon, and inhibit food intake), there are important distinctions between the central and/or peripheral pathways that mediate their effects on hyperglycemia and energy balance.

can proteins be modified to fight diseases and cancer?
posted by michael a. s. guth on  january 4th, 2024 

alternative title: medical writer michael a. s. guth’s summary of external research on cancer treatment using proteolysis targeting chimera (protac) biochemistry and the body’s ubiquitin-proteasome system (ups) natural degradation process to eliminate disease-causing proteins. oral protacs have shown encouraging clinical trial results in the treatment of some genotypes (er+/her-) of breast cancer and in previously treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mcrpc). protacs degrade a targeted protein by attaching ubiquitin molecules (a process called “ubiquitinating”) the target proteins and stopping tumor growth. protacs—which are bivalent chemical protein degraders—are multifunctional molecules that act on specific endogenous proteins through the e3 ubiquitin ligase pathway.
protein degradation is required for maintaining homeostasis of cell proteins and to regulate numerous cell processes, such as gene transcription, dna pairing, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. the ups is a crucial way to specifically degrade proteins that are involved in various metabolic activities, mainly including cyclin, spindle related proteins, cell surface receptors (epidermal growth factor receptor, etc.), transcription factors (nf-κb, etc.), tumor suppressor factors such as p53, oncogene products, and intracellular denaturing proteins, whose deregulation is related to the pathogenesis of many diseases. ups relies on adenosine triphosphate (atp) and consists of two steps: polyubiquitination of target protein and proteolysis of polyubiquitin by 26s proteolytic enzyme complex. 
compared to ups, two conventional treatment methods, small molecule inhibitors (smis) and monoclonal antibodies (mabs), suffer from some inherent limitations due to their mechanisms of actions. the fda has approved over 62 smis that target about 20 different protein kinases. however, for most protein kinases, there is a lack of suitable active sites to target. in addition, molecule-targeted therapy is easy to induce drug resistance. mabs have a large molecular weight and mainly target proteins located at the plasma membrane.
