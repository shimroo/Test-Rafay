the moto exchange |
established in 2002

the moto exchange was the first piaggio dealer in america.

originally providing piaggio and aprilia® scooter sales and service to the east bay, demand quickly grew, and aprilia® motorcycles, royal enfield, and kymco brands were added.

our sales department can help you with every aspect of your purchase from gear and accessories to finance and insurance. a helpful and pressure-free environment is what keeps our customers coming back. with nearly two decades of industry experience, we would be glad to hear what you're looking for and point out what might fit best for you.
