plan for your trip
before leaving for your trip, it is advisable to have a plan. it will make it easy to monitor all your belonging and documents. when you have a plan for your trip in place, make sure to check it twice. make a list of all the documents and items that you will need throughout your journey. it should include passports, visas, traveler’s checks, credit cards, and other important things.
use cash instead of credit or debit cards
it will help if you use cash while traveling in a foreign country. credit and debit cards have the same access to your account and details. for this reason, if someone gets their hands on it or uses your credit card number, they can easily access your bank accounts and transfer money.
if someone gets their hands on the cash you’re carrying around with you, it will not affect your financial situation, as credit cards do. if someone steals your credit card or uses it without authorization, the money won’t come out of your bank account immediately. having an identity protection system in place should help you avoid this.
keep important documents in one place
you should put all your essential documents in one place. it can be a tote or backpack that you bring with you. it should include your passport, other identification documents like driver’s license and birth certificate, travel insurance information (including emergency contact phone numbers), any prescriptions for medications you take regularly, and cash in the local currency of where you are traveling.
never post your whereabouts on social media
most people do not know the effects of oversharing online. posting your whereabouts online makes it easier for others to track down and find out information. you never know who is watching or what kind of background they have. leaving a bread crumb trail will only lead the wrong people to exploit your data, even more so when traveling abroad.
be careful with public wi-fi networks
apart from public social networks, also be careful when using public wi-fi networks. most hackers use public wi-fi networks to steal passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. make sure that the website you’re visiting is secure before entering any sensitive data.
keep copies of your documents
it’s a good idea to keep copies of your documents in a separate bag or wallet. this way, you can take them with you when asked by authorities, and they won’t be lost if your other belongings are stolen from the hotel room while you’re out exploring.…

traffic control is a significant part of the present society because it focuses on the supervision of the vehicles to ensure efficiency and safety. we can solve this problem with proper traffic control. highly trained staff must be observing and monitoring the traffic control structure. like in any other profession, education and training are of the most extreme significance when working in the traffic control field.
traffic control can be utilized to deal with the movement and development of cars and other sorts of transportation framework. without traffic control, these vehicles will be unable to move from one place to another with ease. when that happens, accidents would unavoidably occur. there are different circumstances in which traffic should be controlled. driving through traffic control zones requires that you know a couple of critical principles to the extent safety is concerned. either you are the one driving, or you are the one controlling the traffic. you don’t entirely depend on the traffic flows and signs to a traffic controller. as a driver, you also should know traffic rules and regulations to help with the traffic flow.

in some countries, before you can have your license to drive, you are going to take a test about traffic rules and regulations. also, you will be required to take a test drive and pass it, or else you will not have your driver’s license. this is an excellent idea; you shouldn’t permit people without a license to drive, especially when they aren’t aware of what the traffic rules and regulations are.
we can say that a traffic controller is significant in today’s society; they can help us to prevent accidents and keep our traffic flow go smoothly. when the traffic is stable, you don’t waste your precious time on something that is not important; instead, you can use it to do productive things that can help you.

tips before going to a good pub crawl 
5 feb,2019
james kwan 


when you go to a pub crawl, you expect to have a whole night of excitement. planning it ahead of time will ensure that you will get what you wanted. being with the right person, preparing yourself physically, mentally and emotionally and knowing what to expect from your escapade will do the trick. and of course your budget, it is basic that you should be prepared with your most important passport for a night of adventure. here are some tips that you might need so your night crawl will be something for keeps.
consider your state of body and mind
don’t go for a night crawl when you don’t feel like you going. consider your mood. insisting on going to an event without you having a good state of mind will definitely not give you the best results. be sure that you are also physically fit so you can stand the rest of the night bar hopping. you will need all the energy to bar hop all the pubs that interest you.
and if you have something bothering you, don’t go if you cannot leave your worries behind. you will be sorry to find yourself destroying your friends’ enjoyment.
 
be with the right company
choosing your companions will ensure that you will have a memorable night. just like you, do not go with friends who are not on their best state of mind or you will be disenfranchising yourself of a night of excitement and fun. go with friends you are familiar with. your drinking buddies for many occasions already are the best choice to give you company. be sure that you have the same level of excitement to assure you that no one among your companions will act as antidote to a whole night of partying.
be familiar of the venue
having to research about the place you are going may not be a good idea to some backpacking partygoers. but doing so will prevent you from some compromising scenarios. having to know things like safety factors, how expensive the wines and beverages are, or how far are the bars from each other will give you the best preparations. for sure you would not bring along your cigarettes if the there is a strict ‘no smoking’ ordinance in that place.
know your limitations
planning on a night pub crawl, you should consider how many pubs are there and how many should you want to enter. knowing your drinking capacity is important so you will be able to adjust your dosage to stay alive and kicking the whole night and not to have a mental lapse on those moments that are worth remembering for a lifetime. assisting your friends in watching out their intake of intoxicating drinks will ensure that you will not consume all your energy for a long bar-hopping spree ahead.
choose your brand
pub crawls are not the best time to experiment on drinks. choose the ones that you are very familiar with. you may not be compatible with some drinks even if they are highly recommended in the new pub you are in. of course, you don’t like to have stomach problems while in a pub crawl. or some wine may be too strong for you to consider walking to the next pub.
it is best to stick to your brand, drink moderately, forget your worries, enjoy, and pray that you will be able to wake up the next morning without a big headache.…
