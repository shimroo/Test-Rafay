the technicians are friendly, and helpful. one year they advised me that my old chimney liner was crumbling and should be replaced and gave me a good referral for the job, but they don't push expensive unnecessary extras. i was concerned about my 15-year-old oil tank having some rust on the legs recently but the technician didn't suggest i repair or replace the tank immediately but said the rust was minor and the tank was still sturdy so i could wait awhile! arleen d.kaufman fuel customer i had a service call yesterday with marvin from kaufman fuel. we had an issue with our third heating zone which he investigated, then quickly and efficiently dealt with it — also taking time to explain to me what was happening. i really valued his polite and professional approach. 5 star service. also thanks to claudia at reception for getting me a service appointment quickly. thanks much 🙏 micheal m.kaufman fuel customer       hoursmonday : 8am – 4:30pmtuesday : 8am – 4:30pmwednesday :8am – 4:30pmthursday : 8am – 4:30pmfriday : 8am – 4:30pmsaturday :  closedsunday :  closed    phone+1 866-395-7220    our solutions  home heating oil propane boilers generators furnaces air conditioning tank replacements service agreements  join our newsletter join our newsletter for all updates             62323  pennsylvania  altemos energy   brinker's energy   ddm energy   galbraith oil delaware  ddm energy   galbraith oil connecticut  automatic tlc energy   crc energy   ddlc energy   kaufman fuel   mercury energy   valley oil   dominick fuel new york  kosco heritage rhode island  ddlc energy vermont  keyser energy new jersey  brinker's energy   ddm energy   galbraith oil   metro energy massachusetts  alliance express   cernak fuel   oil express  © 2024 hop energy. all rights reserved.                 hop energy llc, is a full service energy company, offering services through our local branches.  © 2024 hop energy – all rights reserved. privacy policy. ct: s1 #303006,  ri: rm #7945, pm #7945; pa: hic #15690; nj: paul collins master hvacr #19hc00693300; de: lic #1018, lic #uto713; ct hod #s: 393, 394, 398, 385, 403, 298, 1168, 1184, 402, 885, 112, 1189, 1287      book appointment        new customer         service requests                                               we use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website. if you continue to use this site we will assume that you are happy with it.okprivacy policy
