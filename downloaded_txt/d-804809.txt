design’s knowledge-application gap
27 september 2023


i've worked with numerous designers over the course of my career who could talk design proficiently, critique design well, and identify great design... but couldn't actually produce great design themselves. what are the reasons for this?here are just a few.

the job seeker 10-second rule of thumb
07 july 2023


here's my simple rule of thumb for job seeking: you have ~10 seconds before hiring managers bounce to another candidate or decide to take the next step with you.
"next step" translates to roughly two things:a) spending more than 10 seconds on your resume, portfolio, or linkedin.b) contacting you directly.
but hold on, is 10 seconds my recommendation for standard operating procedure as recruiters and hiring managers? of course not. yet regardless of how much time they actually spend, your most important info should be quickly digestible. ten seconds or ten hours, don't bury the lede.
here's how you can use the 10-second rule of thumb to your advantage.

who’s left to be experts on design?
03 july 2023


it's often a mistake to believe design leaders must be experts of the products they lead. yes, being a subject matter expert can be helpful. but that's not why they hired you.
they hired you to be an expert on user psychology, how you tap into this with the most effective visuals, interactions, and content, and how you lead others to do the same with their peers and stakeholders. after all if no one else is an expert at this in your organization, who's left to do it?

“be the leader you wish you had.”
26 may 2023


as i look back over my career, it's possible i've gotten more leadership source material for writing, speaking, and mentoring from ineffective leaders above me than great ones.
if true, here's the takeaway: don't underestimate the opportunity to become a better leader by observing those you don't aspire to become, especially if you can't change your circumstances right away. as one of my mentors once said, we are each other's clinical material and we would do well to remember this.
"be the leader you wish you had" sounds trite. but it's a powerful maxim for putting your hard-earned experience to use.

10 pro tips for hiring managers
22 may 2023


"don't work with jerks" has been one of my key principles for years. "don't interview with jerks" is a close companion.
in a down market like this, the best hiring managers treat candidates with profound respect, realizing they're probably doing double the amount of interviewing compared to a healthy market. yes, the interview process has always been a two-way street but it takes a mature, experienced hiring manager (or recruiter or executive) to treat it as such.
here are 10 pro tips to treat candidates with respect.

like a lamb to the ai slaughter
04 may 2023


i have a hunch the ai revolution will be akin to the product design revolution in the early 2010s when traditional graphic designers were unwilling (for better & worse) to embrace product design.
today the tables have turned. product designers are facing an ever-increasing future driven by ai across all phases of design. for many the question looming in the back of their minds is identical to that of traditional graphic designers years ago:"is this really how i want to evolve as a designer?"

the curse of a designer. i can't go anywhere without seeing norman's the design of everyday things lessons in, you know, everyday things.

the podcast standards project
28 march 2023


today the podcast standards project (psp) officially wills itself into existence. psp was informally established in 2022 by a consortium of independent, prominent players in the podcast space with the purpose of protecting the open nature of podcasting, enabled by the decentralized distribution of rss.
that’s a fancy way of saying someone’s gotta fight for openness and psp is stepping up to be that someone. rss is our rally cry.

my problem-solving process in a nutshell
02 february 2023





it's never too early to explore design ideas.after all, it's called "design thinking" for a reason — critical thinking doesn't happen only inside your head; it also happens on paper, ink, pixels, or whatever medium you prefer.

putting the kibosh on ui vs. ux
06 december 2022


this year i've seen more attempts than ever to draw distinctions between the practice of visual design vs. experience design, or "ui" vs. "ux", or whatever labels you prefer.let me be clear about this: this is ill-advised and misguided.we need to stop acting as though the two disciplines are warring against each other. "should designers code" has been replaced with "should ux designers do ui" and "should ui designers do ux."

“what if” time
01 november 2022


in my experience design teams lack “what if” time and are over-leveraged for “what are” time.what if we did this amazing thing?– vs –what are we delivering this cycle?they’re not always mutually exclusive, but teams with adequate “what if” time are definitely a minority.

don’t settle for designing in between meetings
26 october 2022


designers, don't settle for constantly designing in between meetings and endless slack bombardment. you deserve better than this.✣ close slack for a few hours and ask teammates to text you if urgent.✣ set recurring blocks of 3-4 hours in your cal for focus time. this week and next are probably slammed for you. look 2+ weeks out and you'll find openings…

“design sprint” vs “design jam”
24 august 2022


"design sprint" has been contorted and somewhat abused over the years. for some it means a regimented 5-day process for answering specific business questions, for others it means open-ended exploration, and for others anything in between.
ambiguity on the purpose of a "sprint" leads to non-design stakeholders questioning the value of said sprint, among other issues.
here's the direction i gave my team earlier this year to use these specific terms.

write more to interview less
19 august 2022

ugh, layoffs. but you’ll be ok.
02 august 2022


i grew a design team to 10 during the dotcom boom in the 90s/00s and then company layoffs reduced my team to just 2 when things imploded. let me share with you a few things i learned.
✢ you will be ok. i promise.
some of you have already been laid off, perhaps more of you to come. you’re hurting right now emotionally, financially, or in other ways. you’re terrified about the future. it may take time to get to ok, but it will eventually come.

minimizing ‘surprise’ in interviews
07 july 2022


give candidates your questions before the interview.all of your questions? not necessarily.if most of your interview loop consists of "tell me about a time" questions that are a surprise to candidates, you might be biasing toward hires who can give detailed, articulate impromptu answers. or who happen to have matching case studies on hand.

the ‘what if’ of design
16 june 2022


one of design’s greatest super powers is to ask “what if” and produce concepts that visualize this quandary.when we require design to justify its work with the big 3 — business priorities, roadmap scope, and data — we marginalize this super power and relegate design to a reactive role. yes, the big 3 should drive most of design’s work but not all of it. the most magical outputs sometimes come from the most unjustified inputs.here are a few ways you can create space for what ifs.

this is a diagram i've created for framing discussions at pendo about the audience we're serving and it seems to be resonating over the past few months. it maps usage vs. functionality and demonstrates that most of the software we build serves a spectrum of users rather than one discrete audience. this spectrum only broadens as your product suite scales.
