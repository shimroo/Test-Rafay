joe 
				barkson has been writing and publishing under the pen name "the 
				chef at worldwide recipes" since 1998. he came to food writing 
				late in life following checkered careers in computer marketing, 
				graphic design, and teaching high school spanish. a lifelong 
				interest in food and cooking ("i've been eating since i was a 
				baby," he is fond of saying) was nurtured by extensive 
				international travel during his formative years, and this 
				accounts for the emphasis on world cuisine in his choice of 
				recipes and themes. twice married and currently happily single, 
				he lives in rural georgia with a hyperkinetic schipperke that 
				answers to cooky when the mood strikes him.

				salt? see the
