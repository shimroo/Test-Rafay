testimonial


 



i am a first-generation college graduate and worked throughout college. i didn’t know what i wanted to do with my life. many students who come to us, students of all ages, have experiences like mine. that’s one of the things that make community colleges special. we all have a tremendous opportunity to make a difference in the lives of our students, our community and to have our lives shaped by them as well.
dr. charles w. lepper, president
