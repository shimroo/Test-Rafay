   port lines has been in the "s" business since about 1985.i have grown to the point that today, i believe i offer one of the largest varieties of af repair and restoration supplies and parts available anywhere in the country!  quality is foremost in my product line. i will not stock lesser-quality parts just because they are cheaper. i carry the best quality part available, even if it means a slightly higher price.in addition to the af parts segment of my business, i stock products from a large number of s suppliers and manufacturers.
