	 banville's future
	 
    

cast your mind forward to 2050. in a biographical dictionary you read: 'banville, john: irish author of numerous novels, all of which are entirely forgotten. chiefly remembered for a scurrilous review of lord mcewan of islington's masterpiece, saturday. some of his novels, which banville had written under the pseudonym benjamin black, are still in print.'

	 why one hasn't written a novel
	 
    

john updike's goal is 1,000 words a day. richard ford awakes at six so he can begin as soon as possible. philip roth follows nathaniel hawthorne and thomas wolfe in preferring to stand for hours on end. oh, the discipline and routine needed to be a writer.

	 loosen up, litmags
	 
    

editor dan crowe talks of the present and future of literary magazines, using granta as a case in point: "with the deaths of george plimpton, founder of the paris review, and barbara epstein, a founding editor of the new york review of books, and the change of ownership at granta, this is a critical time not just for granta but also for the future of the literary journal as an art form. it is no longer enough for a literary magazine to publish 'good writing', or even 'new writing'. we've got the internet now. when plimpton founded the paris review it was an act of rebellion; similarly for bill buford when he relaunched granta in the 1970s. they wanted to shake things up a bit. with the new owner in place, it is time for another shake-up. granta must loosen up; it must rock and roll. it must not only seek to publish good writing, but it must seek to become original again - original and broad-minded in the ways it communicates with its readers."

	 amis again
	 
    

apologies for going on about martin amis' new book yet again, but here's another review by david aaronovitch that's more sympathetic, more considered, and, as such, definitely worth reading: "through qutb and others amis came to the realisation, chronicled in the second plane, that islamism itself was a problem, since what it loathed about the west was, as amis puts it, not our active seductiveness, but our passive attraction. 'we should understand,' he writes, 'that islamists' hatred of america is as much abstract as historical, and irrationally abstract too; none of the usual things can be expected to appease it.' amis connects this existential envy to the political failure of islam and attributes this in turn to the suppression of women in many muslim countries."

	 wodehouse, the realist
	 
    

david twiston-davies reviews a wodehouse handbook: the world and words of p. g. wodehouse by n.p.t. murphy: "the great myth about p.g. wodehouse, until he died at 93 in 1975, was that his characters had only the vaguest connection with reality. they were solely the fruit of one man's fantasies, nurtured over decades while living abroad, it was claimed. 'wodehousean' has come to imply a world of idle etonians little touched by the fall of man, while 'bertie woosterish' is an insult employed by the left against anyone it wants to tar as an ally of the house of lords. colonel norman murphy started investigating the matter more than a generation ago, and these two stout volumes contain some of the most dedicated sleuthing in the history of literary detective work. " this ought to be fun to read. of course, chances that it'll be available at any library or bookstore around here are marginal. you'd have to visit one of the world's 10 best bookshops. (what, none from india? what an insult to our national pride. quick, let's start a protest.)

reviews of martin amis' views on a post-9/11 world, the second plane, are being written, and all of them will, inevitably, mention terry eagleton. such as this one (forgive the long extract, but something like this will be at the heart of all discussions of the book):  "one of the arguments that runs through this book is that barbarism is all but indistinguishable from religion and that the opposite of religious belief is not atheism, but independence of mind. the highest expression of independent minds in western enlightened culture is, to amis, its literary fiction ('reason at play'). his personal struggle against the 'dependent mind' of islam is thus fought on the level of playful language."for all the verbal thrill of much of this engagement - more than enough to make it essential reading even for terry eagleton - there is an undeniable hubris at the heart of it. in equating human value to literary value amis finds a way not only to place himself on the frontline of the struggle against the forces of darkness, he also comes close to dismissing half the world as morally inferior and psychologically backward without visiting any of it or hearing from any of its citizens."this, it would appear, is another one of those cases of the reviewer putting words in the author's mouth. nuance be damned.meanwhile, ian mcewan answers questions after the successful film adaptation of his atonement. he tells you why he favours 'realism' over 'modernism' and airs his views on blogs: "i don't read the blogs much. i don't like the tone-the rather in-your-face road-rage quality of a lot of exchange on the internet. i don't like the threads that come out of any given piece of journalism. it seems that when people know they can't be held accountable, when they don't have eye contact, it seems to bring out a rather nasty, truculent, aggressive edge that i think slightly doesn't belong in the world of book reviewing."

an earlier report on debutant authors in the guardian, that one overlooked, is fascinating in that it makes those rarefied creatures come across as so...regular. nick harkaway (the gone away world), son of john le carre, says anxiously, "can you make me look cool? in family photographs, i'm always standing at the edge looking like the country cousin." mohammed hanif (a case of exploding mangoes) reveals, "my son would try to read bits over my shoulder while i was writing the book. i think he got bored because it took me two years. he would say, 'are you still writing that mangoes book?' " joe dunthorne (submarine) says, "saying i'm a writer is one of the most uncomfortable things. you can't help but feel you are showing off." and, in a confession sure to gladden the hearts of mumbai's commuters with literary aspirations, lucie whitehouse (the house at midnight) says that her novel was written over six years, mainly on the train to work. come on now, all of you who're reading this: you can do it, too.

even richard ford left him out of the new granta book of the american short story. unfair. the time is ripe for a malamud revival, and joyce carol oates seems to agree: "given the relative narrowness of malamud’s subject matter, the more subdued range of his writerly voice, and an aesthetic puritanism temperamentally at odds with the flamboyant self-displays of bellow (herzog, humboldt’s gift) and roth (portnoy’s complaint, etc), it seems inevitable, if unfortunate, that he should come to seem, in time, the least impressive of the four." (the fourth being isaac bashevis singer.)

“when you sit down to write something, it should mean something. this is a day of your life that you’re never going to get back. this is a day you should be doing something well. this is something that should be the culmination of a lot thinking you’ve already been doing... i don’t think you should write anything knowing you’re going to throw it away.”- richard ford

	 now we know where that beatles reference came from
	 
    

as it turns out, the famously curmudgeonly, pop-music-hating, child-abhorring philip larkin spent some time with a fellow-poet's family in 1964, playing with their children when they were listening to the stereo and even writing a beatles-type song for them: "don't like your song/ it gets me down./ it's much too long,/ it makes me frown./ can't think why this god-awful noise/ makes daughters miss their dates with boys." the mind boggles.

	 neuroscience and the novel
	 
    

a.s. byatt has an extremely thought-provoking essay -- in more ways than one -- in the tls about how changes in the presentation of human nature over the ages have affected the novel. from characters with immortal souls to love being the only thing that matters to the life as the expression of the libido and the selfish gene, all of this has been grist to the mill of novelists. now, of course, we stand at the frontiers of a new comprehension of the mind. as byatt writes, "neuroscience, and the study of the activity of the brain, is beginning to bring its own illumination to our understanding of how art works, and what it is. i have come to see the delight in making connections – of which metaphor-making is one of the most intense – as perhaps the fundamental reason for art and its pleasures."in just a slightly different context, one can think of at least two other novelists who have been inspired by scientific studies of how consciousness works: david lodge, in his thinks... (also see his essay, consciousness and the novel) and richard powers, with his galatea 2.2 as well as the more recent the echo maker.

	 myers' manifesto
	 
    

one can't help but admire b.r. myers' independent, if utterly audacious viewpoint -- even if one wonders whether he's taking his agenda too far. consider his review of denis johnson's tree of smoke. now, this is a novel that has been lauded by critics all over, being mentioned in more than one "best of the year" list (here's what the washington post said, for example: "to write a fat novel about the vietnam war nearly 35 years after it ended is an act of literary bravado. to do so as brilliantly as denis johnson has in tree of smoke is positively a miracle").but myers isn't impressed. he tears the prose and the subject to bits, with ample quotations from the book to prove his point. fair enough: the man's entitled to dislike the book, and he's given reasons aplenty for doing so. but he doesn't stop there. he also takes petulant issue with the critics who've reviewed it favourably, finding it "difficult to believe" that they like the novel. and he positively froths at the mouth when he writes: "...once we americans have ushered a writer into the contemporary pantheon, we will lie to ourselves to keep him there."good heavens. and people thought his a reader's manifesto went too far.

	 the worst of times
	 
    

as a struggling writer, do you find yourself writing in short, simple sentences using relatively few characters, featuring melodramatic plots heavy on violence, sex and tear-jerking sentiment? don't worry: you'll sell millions in japan.

	 another literary light turned off
	 
    

critic, essayist and author elizabeth hardwick died yesterday. she was 91. from a 1979 interview: "...i call myself a feminist in that i believe there are cultural, social and economic boundaries set for women which are immoral and unnecessary and which should be resisted publicly and privately." says joyce carol oates: "she was a brilliant essayist, absolutely. she was a kind of genius in that difficult form, in which the personal and the critical, or cultural, were melded together in brilliant prose."
