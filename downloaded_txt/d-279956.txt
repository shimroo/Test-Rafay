green lacewing - chrysoperia carnea








product id: gvp10
the green lacewing larvae is the most beneficial stage with the lacewings. they feed on soft-bodied insects like aphids, but will also feed on caterpillars and some beetles. the biggest benefit of lacewing larvae is how aggressive they are. they will eat anything they can catch, and they are always hungry. they’re also cost effective, especially the eggs. they have the ability to quickly knock down moderate levels of aphid infestations, as well as help control many other pests.
green lacewing eggs are oval and pale green. just before the larvae hatch, eggs turn gray. the eggs are shipped in vials with food and a carrier such as rice hulls, bran or vermiculite.

fly parasites predators & prescription program








product id: fpp10
there are 3 species of mixed predatory fly parasites in your order: spalangia cameroni, muscidifurax zaraptor and muscidifurax raptorellus. fly parasites search fly-breeding areas for fly pupae containing developing flies. once inside, the eggs hatch inside the fly pupa and feed on the developing fly and after two to three weeks of feeding, an adult fly parasite emerges to repeat the cycle. each female fly parasite can kill approximately 100 immature flies in her lifetime.
