or mollusks 
          ? if you prefer!
the words "mollusc" or "mollusk" (are both correct) derived 
          from the latin word mollis meaning "soft" study of molluscs, "malacology", 
          comes from the greek word for soft, malacos. the term "conchology" is 
          also used for the study of molluscs; however, it is usually applied 
          to those that study the shell only. 

          the mollusc illustrated above is a terrestrial gastropod from british 
          columbia.
