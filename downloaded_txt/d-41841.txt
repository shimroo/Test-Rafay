"o thus be it ever when free-men shall stand
    between their lov'd home and the war's desolation;
    blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
    praise the pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us a nation!
    then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
    and this be our motto: “in god is our trust!”
    and the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
    o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!"
    --4th stanza of the american national anthem
dedicated to the memory of all americans--past, present, future--who
    have died or will die in the name of 
american freedom...




in support of our american troops 
    in iraq
