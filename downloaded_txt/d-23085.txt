golf league software for golf league management from golfsoft company







welcome to golfsoft.com, home of
golf league secretary
                software for windows

















gls version 
				v9.955 - 02/11/22 is available as a  no charge
complementary edition for 2022 for all users...

golfsoft's golf league secretary 
				2022 
				(gls), is golf league software compatible with all versions of 
				windows, including windows 7, 8 and windows 10.  although gls 
				was written in vb6 code, and optimized for window xp, it 
				operates fine with later versions of windows.  
				 gls is a 
				windows desktop program; it is not a smartphone app.

if you are new to gls if may be advisable to look for an 
				alternative program which is designed specifically for windows 
				10 and 11, and has the on-line and mobile features of newer 
				windows programs...  and which offers customer support.  check with your golf pro.


				gls makes organizing and 
				maintaining a golf league fun and easy!  many golf league 
				management programs on the market are either "very weak" in 
				features or specialize in golf handicaps with some league 
				options.  gls is golf league software extreme!

download a fully 
				functioning, no charge trial-version of
                   golf league secretary.  experiment with the 
				sample leagues or set up your own.  create custom 
				scorecards; calculate golf handicaps; develop a schedule; and 
				generate weekly and year-to-date reports.   all the 
				reports can optionally be exported as
                   html, so you can post them 
				on your website or send as email.  gls reports can also be 
				saved as
                   ms excel spreadsheets or as xml
                   documents.  compare the long list of
                   gls features with other 
				golf league management software. 
                   golf league secretary v9.9 now features, among other software enhancements, the 
				modified stableford points system, user defined 
				points, and user defined prizes.

for more detailed information you can download a copy of the 
gls help files to look over 
				offline.  check out the
                   set up checklist, a 
				list of league parameters you may want to consider when deciding 
				how to run a golf league.  look at the 
sample league 
				rules 
				document to get some ideas on how to set your league rules.  
				also, see frequently asked questions 
				for more information.  download the free "golfsoft 
				client viewer," a software program which your players 
				can install to create, view, open, edit, and save gls reports 
				and spreadsheets on their own computer.
