the office of strategic services (oss) society honors the historic accomplishments of the oss during world war ii, the first organized effort by the united states to implement a centralized system of strategic intelligence, and the predecessor to the central intelligence agency, the u.s. special operations command, and the u.s. department of stateâs bureau of intelligence and research. it educates the american public regarding the continuing importance of strategic intelligence and special operations to the preservation of freedom. the oss society was founded in 1947 by general william donovan as the veterans of oss. it was based in new york city for 50 years. in 1997, it became the oss society and moved to washington, d.c.
the oss society led a successful effort to have a  congressional gold medal awarded to the oss. the oss congressional gold medal act was signed into law on december 14, 2016, and was presented at a ceremony on capitol hill. it led another successful effort to have the oss and original cia headquarters on navy hill in washington, d.c., added to the national register of historic places. it hosts the william j. donovan awardâ® dinner, the preeminent annual gathering of the us intelligence and special operations communities. in addition to the william j. donovan award®, the oss society also presents the hugh montgomery award®, the peter ortiz award®, and the virginia hall award®. the oss society has established oss memorials throughout the united states and in europe. it publishes the oss society journal. the oss society is planning to build the national museum of intelligence and special operations® that will honor americans who have served at the âtip of the spearâ and inspire future generations to serve their country.
