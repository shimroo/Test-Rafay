			leaders in transducer development
		

electroâvoice stands apart as one of the few companies to design all components inâhouse â enclosures, waveguides, drivers â ensuring excellent quality for every audio application, from a standalone loudspeaker to a networked sound system. our products literally speak for themselves: we strive for complete transparency and linearity in our transducers, so the need for external processing is minimized. ultimately, it's our track record of patents proves the point: we invent, others imitate.
