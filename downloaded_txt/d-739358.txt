 testimonials










                                           my child is entering her third year at new hope academy. she likes the small atmosphere and the personal attention that teachers give her. i went from having a child who hated school to a child who looks forward to her school day. i am impressed with the level of learning and the opportunities the children have. from the foreign language program and the in-depth music program to the dance program, i am seeing opportunities that were not available in her last school. i am very happy with our experience.

new hope is a safe, secure environment where students can work in peace.



2017-18 upper school student




our children have been attending new hope academy for nine years now. they love it! the teachers, staff and other parents are a community that come together to teach, nurture and provide a safe environment that is free of teasing and bullying. we also appreciate the diverse backgrounds of the faculty and students. i highly recommend new hope academy for families who are looking for a school that offers technology, math,science, pe and promotes experiences through the arts, music, writing, drama, and dance.

                                            i have worked at many schools throughout the years. but the time i spent at new hope academy as a fifth grade teacher was by far one of the most rewarding experiences of my teaching career. the students were eager to learn , the atmosphere was conducive to learning; and the staff was like a second family.
