about sd association
founded in january 2000 by panasonic, sandisk and toshiba (now kioxia), the sd association is a group dedicated to establishing sd standards and facilitating their adoption and development. at its outset the association represented just 14 member companies and has grown into a global alliance comprised of around 800 member companies. by developing and adopting sd standards, members enjoy better compatibility of member cards between devices, greatly enhancing consumer enjoyment and convenience.
