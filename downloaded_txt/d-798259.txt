we arelife training institute 



life training institute offers programs designed to train laypersons, ministers, and professionals to be effective in many areas of life. we are committed to the wholistic approach to ministry, wellness, and recovery that is taught from a biblical perspective. man is a tri-part being. he is a spirit with a soul that lives in a body. true ministry, wellness, and recovery are achieved when these three areas are appropriately addressed. 



all programs of study have been designed with this concept in mind for such a time as this! our world and society is changing, and although god‚Äôs message does not change, the methods often do.

wait, what is naturopathy? 



naturopathy is based upon a belief in the body‚Äôs innate god-given natural ability to heal itself when given an appropriate internal and external healing environment. naturopaths are not involved in the practice of medicine and do not use drugs or pharmaceuticals, nor do they perform surgery. they have traditionally been referred to as ‚Äúdrugless practitioners‚Äù. in reality, naturopathy deals with wellness and relief from conditions that are the result of stress whether from mental, spiritual, nutritional, environmental, or physical factors.
