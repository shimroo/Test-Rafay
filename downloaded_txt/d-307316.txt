the nightblooming jazzmen 
                continue into a new era!
it is with much joy that we announce the continuation of the night blooming jazzmen. chet jaeger's family has decided that the band should continue to perform, spreading our usual excitement while also paying tribute to chet's legacy to the jazz community.
les deutsch has moved from the piano chair to play cornet and lead  the nbj. trumpet is actually les' first instrument - and it is a whole lot easier to lead a band from the cornet position. check out this interesting sample of les' cornet playing (in fact, he pays all the parts on this video!) andrew barrett will take the piano chair. the remainder of the nbj remains intact.
mike olson is taking over the business manager duties. as such, if you are reading this and wish to hire the nbj for a fesitval, jazz club, worship service, or private party, please contact mike. you can reach him at piano-88@hotmail.com or by phone at (909) 694-9021.
the night blooming jazzmen (nbj, or "nightbloomers") is a traditional, or dixieland band, formed in october 1975 to represent the society for the preservation of dixieland jazz at the third sacramento jubilee. there were very few jazz bands in existence then – not enough to put on a festival. the nbj was started as an ad-hoc "pick-up band." it was not expected to survive – but the nbj were so well-received and had so much fun that they stuck together. since then, they have played thousands of concerts, church services, funerals, house parties, grand openings, jazz clubs, wedding receptions, dances, etc .. and several dozen cruises and land trips to china, japan, australia, new zealand, alaska, hawaii, the caribbean, the panama canal, the amazon, the mediterranean, and many other parts of europe.
the night blooming jazzmen has been one of the busiest bands in the nation â and they hope to be so again soon! they have a lot of fun with their audiences and each other â and despite this their music is top-quality. they play well and put on a great show. the band's sunday morning "hymn-a-long" often typically has the largest attendance of any event at a festival.
 





currently, the band personnel is:
les deutsch - cornet & leader
                    mike olson - reeds
                    les benedict - trombone
                    
                        andrew barrett - piano
                          peter cho - banjo
                          mike earls - bass
                    nick scarmack - drums

personal changes!


our long-time reed player, jim richardson, has retired from the nbj. he  sold his home and is living his dream, traveling around the usa. we will miss jim. 

                      mike olson has moved from the banjo chair to the reed chair. you likely have heard mike playing clarinet or sax with the nbj as a double, or with his own south burgundy street jazz band. 

                      this left the banjo chair open - but no worries as peter cho has joined us, bringing his virtuosic playing to the band and lowing our average age by quite a bit in the process.


                      finally, les benedict has joined the nbj as our new trombonist. we are very excited to have les, and all of his experience, with the band - and it means there are now two of us named "les."
                    


 


 


 






long-lost nbj cazoo songbooks!!


here's an item i'll bet fans have been searching for... offical night bloomin jazzmen "cazoo song books." yes, the nbj used to spell "kazoo" as "cazoo", and, yes, these were recently discovered in a local archeological site - chet's house. there are two versoons, "red" and "pink" named for their cover colors. they are actually identical except for the cover page. the blue version contains a photo of the band that is very old - but nostolgic. these are free for download â simply click on either version.
