photo provided by george young, "knight 6" 1964







the "knights of the air" consisted of
    four combat ready flight platoons. the white knights, red knights,  cobra's and lancers who were in operation only in
    1966-1967. in addition, there was the gold knight "the commander" and our blue
    knights "road service". the company was based at vinh long air field, republic
    of south vietnam from may 1963 to february 1972. during the nine years in vietnam, the
    114th assault helicopter company (ahc) participated in 16 combat campaigns and was
    presented with 8 unit citations. after departing the republic of south vietnam in february
    1972, the 114th aviation company was assigned to the panama canal zone where it served
    with distinction. the 114th was deactivated at fort clayton, panama canal zone in october
    1987.  this site is dedicated to those "knights", both pilots and crewmen,
    who did not return home.

        as the newly formed aviation companies arrived in vietnam, their ao's and
        call signs were confirmed. to foster esprit de corps, young aviators set about designing unit pocket patches. their boundless imaginations and
        the skillful vietnamese artisans, leave us a colorful, tangible, legacy, of that unique conflict.
"prior to conus departure the company and platoons selected call signs for use
        in vietnam. thanks to captain cliff ohlenburger and his alma mater, st. marys university san antonio, texas (the rattlers) the rattler call sign
        for the company was chosen. major henderson's wife, ramona, gets credit for the firebird call sign (from stravinsky's ballet). captain
        ohlenburger designed the rattler emblem/patch for the company and the firebird for the gunship platoon. captain marvin schwem originated the
        esquire patch for the 1st lift platoon, captain jesse james the phantom patch for the 2nd, captain ray young the snake doctor patch, and major
        thomas e. connell/captain billy w. taylor the patch for the 151st transportation detachment."

hello gentlemen, 
         

          i trust the first few weeks of 2022, are treating you well.
          please see below, the link to my latest volume.
           
          please also see my new and only email address, which i had to change due to a home move.
however, my old isp cut me off a month
        early, (1st nov) and
          has failed to enable the closed mailbox function.
          thus, any non-response after that date, is not due to the reason of ignorance.
         
        best regards & stay well, 
        john

 114th
        aviation company scholarship program

         
the
        association members at the omaha reunion business meeting in september,
        authorized the association to fund a perpetual $1,000 per year
        scholarship program in the name of the 114th aviation
        association company with the army aviation association of america
        (aaaa). funding has been sent to aaaa, which will allow the first award
        to be given out in the spring. 

 the deadline for applying for a scholarship is december 15th 2021.


















who
        can apply:




 family
        members, including spouses, children, grandchildren, and siblings of
        life members, current active members of the 114th aviation
        company association and vietnam veterans that were killed while serving
        in vietnam with the 114th assault helicopter company are
        included.



application
        process:




 the
        applicant will log on to the aaaa web site (www.quad-a.org)
        and under join check student and join aaaa (cost $15.00). the
        applicant will then receive a member number, which is required in the
        application process. next, the applicant will click on scholarship then
        apply to start the pre-qualification process. from this point on, the
        web site has clear instructions to the applicant as to what is required.
        it is suggested the parents of the applicants become familiar with the
        requirements.


if
        more than one family member is intending to apply for a scholarship, the
        association member can help them save money by joining the aaaa and
        allowing each of the members to use his membership number. there is no
        limit as to the number of family members that can use this number. the
        cost to the member is $26.00.



timing:





 applicants
        can start the pre-qualification process in january 2020, and must
        complete the full application by may 1, 2020. please coordinate with
        family members, if there is going to be more then one so the member, if
        they want, can join aaaa and have a member number before the family
        member starts the process. 


 applicants
        should start the process early in the coming year, as there will
        probably be over 600 applicants from all aaaa affiliates around the
        world and late entries may not have time to process.


the
        national director will appoint an individual who will coordinate with
        the aaaa scholarship director to screen all applications to assure that
        the sponsor will qualify as a member of the association. 


this
        is a very competitive program, but be aware that every applicant has the
        possibility of scoring high enough to be awarded a scholarship higher
        than $1,000. 


if
        there are any questions about the program paul gail will be happy to
        give or get the answers for you. you can contact him at 1-703-625-4253.
        please leave a message as he gets between 5 and 50 spam calls a day and
        probably wont recognize your number.
         


please
        note that the deadline for the full application is may 1, 2020. the
        earlier an application is submitted, the sooner it can be processed.
        remember that it may take aaaa some time to process your membership.

welcome home!
        vietnam vet radio
 
        bookmark it now!




        vietnam vet radio is an internet only non-profit radio station dedicated
        to the men and women who served in the vietnam war and their families
        and friends. with a few exceptions all the songs played are from the
        vietnam war era. we also play the authentic jingles and public service
        announcements that were played on afvn (american forces vietnam network)
        radio.
while vietnam vet radio is neither political or
        religious it is most certainly a pro-america and pro-military radio
        station that acknowledges that we are a blessed people. no anti-war
        rhetoric or anti-war songs.
please contact us with suggestions on how vietnam vet
        radio can better serve you.

        ~agent orange~



        the u.s. military sprayed millions of gallons of agent
        orange and other herbicides on trees and vegetation during the
        vietnam war. several decades later, concerns about the health effects
        from these chemicals continue. va offers eligible veterans a free agent
        orange registry health exam for possible long-term health problems
        related to exposure.

   connecting
        veterans 
 to their benefits

making
      a transition from active military to civilian life can be challenging. u.s.
      veteran compensation programs provides
      a range of social supports, compensation and pension services that make
      reintegrating into the community simpler. nothing is more important to us
      than giving back to those that served honorably in the armed forces.
