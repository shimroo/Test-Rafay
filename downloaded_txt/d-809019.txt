tumc is a christian community in the mennonite-anabaptist peace church tradition. we aspire to be a family of faith that welcomes people of diverse backgrounds and stories, worshipping and supporting each other, while following christ’s example in working for peace and justice in our urban context.1





this sunday
newcomers and guests are always welcome to join us sundays at 11 a.m. for worship, in person at 1774 queen east or online. in this season we are exploring the theme of “together on the journey” from various angles. come early, at 10 a.m., for faith formation classes for kids from age 3 through high school. for adults, there’s sunday brew, conversation over coffee and tea, in the second floor meeting room; currently we’re exploring the intersections of faith and work as various congregants talk about their interesting work lives! stay after the service for fellowship in the lobby. during the week, there are typically lots of other events, from youth games nights to retiree lunch gatherings to contemplative prayer by zoom. whether you’re looking for a church home, wrestling with spiritual questions, or simply curious about christian faith in the mennonite/anabaptist tradition, there’s room for you at tumc!




church on the ground meets at 1774 queen st. e., in the beach neighbourhood. we’ve relaxed our anti-covid practices, but masks are encouraged.
church in the cloud is open to everyone, far and wide, via the zoom link available in the emailed announcements. (don’t get the announcements? contact divy before noon friday.)

				truth & reconciliation: our pledge			


our congregation meets in territories of the wyandot, haudenosaunee, and michi saugig nations. as beneficiaries of a violent history of colonization, we recognize our responsibility to uphold treaty relationships and so seek to be guided by indigenous truth-tellers toward restitution, restoration, and reconciliation. learn more by clicking the photo above.
