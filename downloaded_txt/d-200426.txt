in 2008, the royal college of psychiatrists in the us 
        stated that having an abortion greatly increases a woman's risk of a 
        mental breakdown. in response the british parliament is considering a 
        bill to limit abortions from 24 weeks to 20 weeks.  (from a 
        statement released to the uk times)
