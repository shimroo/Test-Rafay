new paradigm organisation consulting 
















welcome to new paradigm
organisation consulting.
we offer businesses and organisations
help with change,development and 
strategy. our web site has four main aims:

to give information about richard
    seel & new paradigm consulting:


an organisation is a pattern of 
  relationships. in particular, stories and conversations are the heart and soul 
  of organisational life. the stories people tell reveal and shape their 
  commitment to the organisation and their sense of what is possible. the 
  quality of the everyday conversations and negotiations they have with each 
  other and with customers will determine the quality of service and the 
  effectiveness of the operation. yet in many organisations the stories are 
  negative and the conversations are blocked or fall into destructive loops.
we recognise that change cannot be imposed or 
  controlled from the top or from the outside. instead we work with people from 
  all levels in the organisation to help them tell new, positive stories about 
  what is possible and what can be done better. we help
  facilitate new kinds of conversation, often across boundaries within 
  the organisation.
whether we are working with executives on 
  strategy or scenario planning, with teams on their development, or with the 
  whole organisation on cultural change we focus on those interactions which lie 
  at the core of the organisation. systems, structures and processes all help 
  the effective organisation but they count for little if the personal 
  relationships are not right.

    we do including:


culture change, organisation development, 
strategic &  business planning, team development, management
development and facilitation.
