i couldn't be happier with my experience at independent carpet one. cathy and the staff and crew truly understand customer service and the quality process. cathy, dominic and joe made sure the structural and decorative elements were what i needed/wanted for a satisfactory kitchen floor redo.
tony and luis did a fabulous job with the install. you can tell they enjoy what they do and were very knowledgeable and a pleasure to work with. i am more than happy with the finished job.
i would recommend independent to anyone needing to update their flooring.

i would like to thank cathy for getting new kitchen flooring and carpeting in my home on a very tight schedule! the customer service is excellent and a pain free experience! tony and partner, the floor installers were great to work with! there was no clean up when they were done! ely, the carpet installer was quick and efficient! i will recommend independent carpet to all friends, family and strangers!

a big thumbs up to carpet one for the beautiful job they did carpeting my whole house. bob and cathy helped me choose a carpet that best suited my needs. they were professional, knowledgeable and friendly, and i am very happy with my choice.
a special thumbs up to my installation team, mike (ahmad) and hessan. the job took three and a half days, so i got to know them a bit. they were friendly, polite, and very hard working, going above and beyond to make sure i was happy. when they were done, everything was cleaned up. they did a fantastic job!
