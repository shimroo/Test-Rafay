below please find important information about this transition:

oam is an independent, single-specialty practice and no longer part of spectrum healthcare partners.
spectrum and oam have worked collaboratively to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruptions.
patients will continue to receive high quality orthopaedic care from the same physicians, providers, and support team.
the surgery center in portland and the orthopaedic practices in brunswick, portland, and windham will continue to operate.
spectrum healthcare partners will continue to provide anesthesiology and radiology care to oam patients.
