history
brookelynn premium cigars is locally owned and operated since 2001 and prides itself in offering the finest quality products and service! owner steve gimello traces his cigar roots back to his grandmother catherine gimello, who rolled cigars for extra money as a teen in the early 30’s at various cigar factories in camden, n.j. steve also developed his love for cigars from sitting with his grandfather rocco, who enjoyed smoking a fine cigar and talking baseball with steve and friends. steve enjoyed fine cigars while in college and eventually became a sales representative for a prominent manufacturer before opening his own company, named after his daughter, brooke lynn.
