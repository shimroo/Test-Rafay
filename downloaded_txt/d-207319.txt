acknowledgement of the land       the lands on which we are gathering today are the traditional territories of the anishinaabe and haudenosaunee peoples.  we acknowledge their enduring presence on this land, as well as the presence of the huron-wendat, metis, inuit and other first nations from across turtle island. we deeply respect the many generations of people who have cared for this land and whose spiritualities, teachings and ways of knowing are closely tied to it.  we seek to build right relations with these peoples, to learn from them and to live together on this land with respect and gratitude.
chalmers moving forward statement
we are continually striving to be:

a spiritual home where people of any age connect in significant, thoughtful, and relevant ways, and where we listen to one another and freely explore important questions
a caring, hospitable and diverse community of faith
a restorative community of faith where decisions are made in healthy and productive ways, and where differences of opinion are acknowledged and discussed restoratively
a community of faith that honours its history, admires its beautiful building and stained-glass windows, and rejoices in the sanctuary’s shape that encircles us
a community of faith where the power of music underlies and strengthens our worship
a community of faith in the united church of canada, where we offer our energy and gifts to the world beyond our walls, to demonstrate our faith in practical ways
