happylegs bullmastiffs



welcome to happylegs bullmastiffs! 
happylegs is a breeder of champion and companion bullmastiffs located on 18 acres just north of ann arbor, michigan.
we invite you to explore our site to learn a little bit about us, the bullmastiff breed, and to discover what makes a happylegs bullmastiff a little different from the rest.
news
after over 30 years we have retired from breeding. we will continue to post information regarding upcoming litters out of females we co-own and our stud dogs. please feel free to browse this website for information on the bullmastiff.
