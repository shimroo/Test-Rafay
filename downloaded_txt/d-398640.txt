jb's harbor of rants about life



rants about life, politics, stupid people, and anything else that just trips my trigger. if you are offended by bad words and someone else's opinion based on whatever info is available, maybe this isn't the place to visit. if not, come on in, tie up, grab a beer and stay awhile. comments are welcome, really.        living life through the windshield!

fwd: wal-mart vs. the morons---(not a joke)





             wal-mart vs.  the morons..(not a joke)         this is quite interesting.  it's long but it's worth reading to the end.        even if you do not forward it, read it all  the  way to the end...              wal-mart vs. the morons     (not a joke)                                                       1. americans spend $36,000,000 at wal-mart every hour ofevery day.         2. this works out to $20,928 profit every minute!             3. wal-mart will sell more from january 1 to st. patrick's day (march 17th) than target sells all year.            4. wal-mart is bigger than home depot + kroger + target +sears + costco + k-mart combined.         5. wal-mart employs 1.6 million people, is the world's largest private employer, and most speak english.             6. wal-mart is the largest company in the history of the world.            7. wal-mart now sells more food than kroger and safeway combined, and keep in mind they did this in only fifteen years.             8. during this same period, 31 big supermarket chains sought bankruptcy.            9. wal-mart now sells more food than any other store in the world.               10. wal-mart has approx 3,900 stores in the usa of which 1,906 are super centers; this is 1,000 more than it had  five years ago.              11. this year 7.2 billion different purchasing experiences will occur at wal-mart stores. (earth's population is approximately 6.5 billion.)               12. 90% of all americans live within fifteen miles of a wal-mart.              you may think that i am complaining, but i am really laying the ground work for suggesting that maybe we should hire the guys who run wal-mart to fix the economy.            this should be read and understood by all americans??democrats, republicans, everyone!!            to president obama and all 535 voting members of the legislature            it is now official that the majority of you are corrupt and ineffective:         a..the u.s. postal service was established in 1775. you have had 237 years to get it right and it is broke.            b..social security was established in 1935. you have had 77 years to get it right and it is broke.            c..fannie mae was established in 1938. you have had 74 years to get it right and it is broke.         d..war on poverty started in 1964. you have had 48 years to get it right; $1trillion of our money is confiscated each year and  transferred to "the poor"and they only want more.        e..medicare and medicaid were established in 1965. you have had 47 years to get it right and they are broke.            f..freddie mac was established in 1970. you have had 42 years to get it right and it is broke.          g..the department of energy was created in 1977 to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. it has ballooned to 16,000 employees with a budget of $24 billion a year and we import more oil than ever before. you had 35 years to get it right and it is an abysmal failure.            you have failed in every "government service" youhave shoved down our    throats while verspending our tax dollars.      and you want americans to believe you can be trusted with a government-run health care system??      folks, keep this circulating. it is very well stated. maybe it will end up in the e-mails of some of our "duly elected'  (they never read anything) and their staff will clue them in on how americans feel.     and     we have lost our minds to "political correctness"    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      we're "broke" & can't help our own seniors, veterans, orphans, homeless etc.,???????????            in the last months we have provided aid to haiti , chile , japan and turkey ..and pakistan ........previous home of bin laden. literally, billions of dollars!!!       our retired seniors living on a 'fixed income' receive no extra aid nor do they get any special breaks--nadda beyond shopping discounts...      now, it is estimated that 90,000 illegal alien children under the age of 16 will be in our country by the end of the year.   we will feed them, provide health and education and they will get everything a hard working american citizen gets - just for crossing the border illegally.   obama is proposing we give millions of dollars to el salvador, hondouras and guatamala to "help" the children. do you really think this money is going to get to the children that really need it?   meanwhile, mexico is charging for allowing them to pass through mexico to get to the us border, paid for by the drug cartels. they are keeping the border guards busy changing diapers while the drug lords funnel tons of drugs into the us to turn our children into zombies.      in gitmo, the 147 muslim terrorists have one doctor for every prisoner, a state-of-the art hospital system, are provided korans and prayer rugs, food approved by the koran, exercise and additional perks.      our veterans die waiting to see a va doctor while the directors get bonuses.              and congress wants to freeze social security payments...      you do  know that congress voted themselves a pay raise for 2013???google this--it's true!!!     99% of peoplewon't forward this.   i'm one of the1% -- i just did

gentle thoughts for today





birds of a feather flock together . . . .and then shit on your car.a penny saved is a government oversight.the older you get, the tougher it is to lose weight, because by then your body and your fat have gotten to be really good friends.the easiest way to find something lost around the house is to buy a replacement.he who hesitates is probably right.did you ever notice: the roman numerals for forty (40) are xl.if you can smile when things go wrong, you have someone in mind to blame.the sole purpose of a child's middle name is so he can tell when he's really in trouble..did you ever notice: when you put the 2 words 'the' and 'irs' together it spells 'theirs...'aging: eventually you will reach a point when you stop lying about your age and start bragging about it.some people try to turn back their odometers. not me, i want people to know 'why' i look this way. i've traveled a long way and some of the roads weren't paved.when you are dissatisfied and would like to go back to your youth, think of algebra.you know you are getting old when everything either dries up or leaks.one of the many things no one tells you about aging is that it is such a nice change from being young.                                       ah, being young is beautiful, but being old is comfortable.lord, keep your arm around my shoulder and your hand over my mouth amen!
