search glynngen.com!


glynngen.com is a genealogical 
and historical website compiled by volunteers. 

this website is not a 
corporation; there isn't a team of researchers working behind the scenes. 

this 
website and its content are managed by only one person so please be patient when 
waiting for a response. 

also, when requesting help, please be specific, give 
names, dates, and provide url's if you are quoting information from a web page. 
thank you!

within this site you will 
find many transcriptions and actual images of historical documents spanning 
glynn, camden, brantley, ware, wayne, and mcintosh counties just to name a few. 

this website is completely maintained by
amy 
			lyn hedrick 
who also pays out of her own pocket, with the help of donations, to keep this website online for free access.

permission to copy entire pages 
			of content will not be granted, please don't ask.

the copyright stamp 
			on photos and documents is not necessarily the original copyright 
			date of the document. 
these later dates were just a mass stamping 
			due to recent theft of the website. most of the cemetery photos were 
			taken between 2004 and 2006; therefore, if a 2013 date is on the 
			photo, that is just when the photo was "protected" from theft.

i have 
many family trees at ancestry.com, the largest is the coastal georgia families 
linked below.
