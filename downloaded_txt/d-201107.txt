superior sheds giving back




								memorial hospital pembroke in hollywood, florida was affected by a surging amount of patients which resulted in overcapacity of patients due to the covid-19 pandemic. in an effort to continue to attend to patients during these troubled times, memorial hospital pembroke turned to superior sheds for an expedited solution to their space constraints. the superior sheds team immediately went to work and was able to build and deliver a total of (4) sheds in record times. we want to thank our superior team for being an essential team that is always willing to go the extra mile for our community.
