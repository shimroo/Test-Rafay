dharma talks and meditations
talks on the practice of meditation are a vital aspect of the ims retreat experience and help to bring alive the buddha’s teachings of freedom. at the retreat center, teachers offer talks on a daily basis. at the forest refuge, talks usually take place twice a week.

the spirit of generosity guides all aspects of ims’s vision and operations
generosity is the first of the ten parami, or qualities of character, that the buddha taught his students to cultivate. the practice of generosity develops lovingkindness and compassion, deepens awareness of our interconnectedness and encourages non-attachment.
