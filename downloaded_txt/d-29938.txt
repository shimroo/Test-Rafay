fly tier's bench: how to tie craven's lil bit nymph 
sometimes the hardest part of perfecting a new fly is knowing when to stop tinkering and call it good. one of craven's favorite mentors, john barr, epitomizes this trait and there is nary a material in any of his flies that doesn't have a good reason to be there. the same goes for pat dorsey and lance egan. their flies are minimalistic in materials, simple to tie, and mimic naturals without any unnecessary window dressing. 

his latest offering, dubbed the &#8125;lil bit, does not feature complicated tying tricks or unusual materials, but is a simple and easy-to-tie nymph that catches trout like crazy.

how-to/techniques
ed jaworowski's functional fly casting part 1: acceleration
it's vital to understand that, since fishing conditions and situations change endlessly, there can be no rigid or fixed rules or instructions for casting. you cannot specify where to start, move, or stop your arm or rod, or the direction and distance to move them, before deciding on the result you want from the cast. you must take various factors into account, including the fly being cast, the desired direction and distance, wind, any obstructions—whether overhead or to the side or rear—and more.
