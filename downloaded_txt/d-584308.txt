as somebody who remembers the confusion and excitement of entering college without a clear path but with a wide-eyed appreciation of the range of options, i enjoy the chance to teach students who may not have considered economics before. some discover a new interest and direction, and i hope that the others learn a powerful way of thinking about markets and social issues that they can carry with them.derek lemoine, associate professor of economics
