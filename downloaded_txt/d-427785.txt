m1  abrams tank
approved for production in 1990, the m1a2 represents the u.s. armyâs technological improvement of the basic m1a1 design and the most modern battle tank in the world. outwardly similar in appearance to the m1a1, the most notable exterior changes on the m1a2 are the redesigned commander's weapon station (cws) and the addition of a commander's independent thermal viewer) on the left side of the turret forward of the loader's hatch. internally, however, the m1a2 has been radically redesigned to take advantage of newer technology.

















m2/m3 bradley fighting vehicle
the bradley fighting vehicle family currently consists of two vehicles: the m2 infantry fighting vehicle and the m3 cavalry fighting vehicle. just as with its predecessor, the m113 family, the bradley will eventually be the platform for a wide range of support vehicles.

















mine-resistant ambush protected (mrap)
with v-shaped hulls, raised chassis and armored plating, the mine resistant ambush protected vehicle (mrap) has proven to be the single most effective counter to improvised explosive devices (ieds). blast-resistant underbodies and layers of thick, armored glass offer unparalleled protection, while all-terrain suspension and runflat combat tires ensure marines can operate in complex and highly restricted rural, mountainous and urban terrains.
