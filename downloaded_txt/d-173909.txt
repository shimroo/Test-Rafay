welcome to tan!





we are a social club promoting clothing-optional recreation and social nudism. we advocate the acceptance of the nude human body as wholesome and natural, and we enjoy the freedom of going au naturel.
we are located in the raleigh-durham-chapel hill "triangle" in central north carolina. tan is a non-landed club, which means that we do not own land or facilities. we enjoy social nudism at house parties, on beach trips, and other travel destinations. if you enjoy skinny-dipping and the sun, or if you like to talk, laugh, and have fun in a safe, friendly, clothing-optional environment, then tan could be for you.
our diverse and friendly membership rotates events among members' homes and occasional travel destinations throughout nc and beyond. we have two to three events per month in the summer and one to two events per month the rest of the year. summer events usually consist of potluck pool parties, picnics, or travel. most other events are themed indoor potluck dinner parties such as halloween or games night.
