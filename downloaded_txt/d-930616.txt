they are good for the skatepark, the roughest streets. transition, and tech ledge skating. i think they help absorb impact when you skate big gaps, so i’ve been loving that. they slide good when you want them to. you can still revert all your tricks. they feel a little softer so they roll over cracks real good and its basically all you need to know. these things kill it! so, get yourself some and i’ll see out there you soon.— pro skater ryan decenzowhat’s up everyone dakota servold here to talk about the new x-formula. i was pretty hesitant to try these out cause i loved the bones street tech formula i was already skating and was afraid of losing that nice snappy sound. because of the way the formula is explained, you think you're getting a cruiser wheels but bones kind of mixed them together so you have a wheel that goes on rough terrain and also still slides which is just really hard to wrap your head around unless you actually skate a pair and that’s what kinda happened to me then after i did it. there was just no turning back after i did so open up your horizon and try a pair of the new x-formulas. game changers.— pro skater dakota servoldlately i’ve been skating x-formula and overall its just a solid wheel made for any terrain you’re trying to get down on. it’s really good for skating impact, and it absorbs vibration. its definitely a wheel you can rely on in the long run. buy a fresh set and hit the streets with your homies.— sponsored am christian holtx-formula are crazy wheels. i hated changing up my street tech's and i avoided x-formula at first but when i heard everyone else talking about them i had to tap in. x-formula is crazy because it operates like a traditional harder wheel but it feels slightly softer so you can go skate the parks, ledges, flat bars and handrails in the streets, but at the same time you dont have to switch up your wheels to go skate rough spots. you can still go skate the ditches and you’re not stressed about hitting rocks and you can still power slide on them. its the most bizarre, coolest formula i’ve ever skated.— pro skater, matt bergeri wanted to let you know about the new bones wheels x-formula. its a really good wheel made for all terrains. it feels a little bit on the softer side so it absorbs a lot impact for those jumpers but its not too soft where you are going to stick on any slides. still has really good sound and board feel to it. overall 10 out of 10 so im giving it a solid 5 star rating. get yourself some and enjoy the ride!— pro skater trevor mcclungjust wanted to say thanks from australiai i recently switched to the x-formula and rode them for the first time today and they are amazing!
