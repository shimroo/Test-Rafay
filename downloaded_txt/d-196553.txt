welcome to replica plantswelcome to replica plants, the home of innovative, exceptional quality and unique artificial plants and trees. buy online a large range of artificial plants and artificial trees or get in touch to discuss our bespoke services and installation. with over 16 years of experience, we handpick the highest quality products available. our focus is to provide only the best and most lifelike products.over the years we have undertaken commercial installations across a variety of industries. we have particular expertise in artificial plant installations for hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants and bars as well as office installations where we help to create a more calm and productive working environment. our installation team are trained to fit on commercial sites as well as install our artificial trees and plants in residential and smaller commercial projects.we have completed artificial plant & tree installations throughout the uk, europe and beyond. a 15m tall gold leaf apple tree in azerbaijan in a shopping centre being one of the more interesting projects that we've worked on!we have the ability to make real timber stem trees and manufactured trunks. we can also provide inherently fire retardant artificial foliage where needed. we also specialise in artificial boxwood and buxus hedges, artificial green "living walls" and artificial foliage ceilings. we have completed hundreds of supply and install projects of artificial foliage, hedges and ceilings, often working at height.with our experience in this field we will always find solutions to help with a project where real trees will not be possible, due to lack of sunlight and other practical problems. we also plant real beech hedges when we plant artificial trees on commercial projects.we would be happy to discuss any residential or commercial artificial tree, hedge or replica green wall project you have. when projects are discussed we will often have one of the team come to the site and advise on the installation requirements and advise on correct fixings and systems to install the display that you need.other services include the building of multiple trees, artificial plant displays and artificial hedges for shop, bar and restaurant chains where a continued theme of artificial foliage is required. in addition to all of the above we can now offer a comprehensive artificial tree cleaning and maintenance service through our leaf clean department. artificial trees do get dusty and with this service we can keep your displays dust-free, clean and more vibrant and stop them being such a dusty fire hazard. often while completing our leaf clean service, we can identify branches and foliage that may need replaced to extend the life of your artificial trees.please call us on 01661 871481 or email on sales@replicaplants.co.uk and we would be very happy to discuss your project.
