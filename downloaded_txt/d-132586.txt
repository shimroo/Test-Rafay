pricing and market access
a strong pricing and market access strategy is integral to what it takes to bring a product to market and is, therefore, integral to deal making. pricing assumptions can have an enormous impact on the valuation of an asset and are frequently a cause of misalignment with potential partners. a strong pricing narrative and a solid data generation plan to support it, is essential for success.

our track record


commercialisation strategy challengepharmaceutical company growthbiotech licensing transactions



we conducted a detailed assessment of the market opportunities, technology risks and developments, launch and marketing costs via scenarios of “go-it-alone”, “outright sale”, “out-licensing for royalties” as well as “out-licensing with co-promotion”. the value generated was modelled and the scenarios were prioritised. partnering and deal strategies were developed for the selected optimal strategy and incorporated into a business plan.

pharmaventures developed a customised search strategy based on the specific requirements of the client, which involved a systemic country by country identification of candidates with the correct therapeutic indications, combined with their commercial potential and availability for the territories of interest.

pharmaventures conducted a compound valuation (bottom-up and benchmarking using pharmadeals agreements® data) providing the basis for future negotiations. we also carried out a thorough company screening and evaluation assessment to identify and prioritise potential licensees. following the screening, within the space of a month our transaction team approached all the target companies with a carefully constructed value proposition using a non-confidential information package.
