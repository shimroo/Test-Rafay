what our customers say about the braun experience 










						“we talked with some of the largest departments in the country and they all had exceptional reviews about working with braun industries. in the end, braun was able to deliver on all of our requests - when no other manufacturer could. they went above and beyond in proving to us they were in it for the long haul.”					
chief carl floresnew orleans ems 











						“the quality of the braun product is very evident, they put the other ambulances in our fleet to shame.  before you commit to buying any new ambulance, or when you pick one up, be sure to take them up on the offer of a factory tour. i have never seen a manufacturing facility that is so organized and clean."					
chief douglas lafondallen park fire department 











						“when choosing braun, it essentially came down to the fact that there was no design challenge that we threw at them that they were not able to facilitate for us. the quality and craftsmanship of braun was unparalleled to other units we looked at and also weighed heavily on our decision.”					
ryan ferris, transport emt, evofletcher allen health care 











						“the braun ambulance speaks for itself. there’s no other vehicle out there built as well…and they would, of course, be more than welcome to look at ours. out of all the many ambulances i’ve worked in during my nearly 30 years in the business, the braun always comes out on top as the best for many proven reasons."					
john marko, executive director & paramedicnorthern onondaga volunteer ambulance, inc. 











						“the police department’s ambulance fleet consists of approximately 40 braun chief xl ambulances. our ambulance fleet provides a critical service to our residents. our buses provide around the clock assistance in often times harsh driving conditions. my automotive supervisors who prepare the specifications for our buses and those who oversee the maintenance of these vital pieces of equipment can attest to their superior quality, roadworthiness and workmanship."					
donald f. halbohn, police inspectornassau county police department 











						“whether you buy one ambulance a year, or one every 10 years, the staff at braun ambulances are committed to building quality ambulances and forging lifelong relationships.  from my very first tour of their plant in van wert, oh and each one in between, it’s easy to see the men and women at braun ambulances are dedicated to building the safest and most durable ambulances in the industry. braun’s commitment to their customers doesn’t end when you drive away, in fact, it’s just beginning."					
peter o’leary, fire chieffond du lac fire rescue
