“my husband and i had an amazing day biking the wineries and backroads of franschhoek with bike and hike! what an unforgettable way to experience wine tastings and appreciate the environment. we ended the ride with a picnic in the vines and it was absolutely perfect! we appreciate the great photos that our guide took along the ride. we bike ride all over the world and bike and hike is one of the best. they respond quickly to emails and questions; tailor the trip to what you want to do; accommodate the most basic bike riders; provide high quality bikes, and take photos of you along the way.”
