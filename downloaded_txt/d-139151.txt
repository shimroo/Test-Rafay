position on inclusion
the wsa upholds the following positions on inclusion. we believe that: 

everyone benefits when individuals with ws are meaningfully included in educational, work, and community settings 
individuals with ws should receive all necessary supports and services to fully participate in their family lives, communities, and society as a whole
high expectations should be the norm, and individuals with ws and their families should decide how they best learn, work, and enjoy social settings
“inclusion” is not one-size-fits-all, and will look different for each family based on each individual’s desires and needs
inclusion creates a sense of belonging in society, meaningful relationships, and opportunities to achieve dreams
