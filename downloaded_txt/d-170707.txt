investing in fine art to strategically plan for medicaid eligibility 


medicaid planning is a critical consideration for many as they age, especially given the high costs associated with long-term care and nursing home facilities. one of the less traditional but potentially effective strategies involves investing in fine art. this article explores how individuals can use fine art as an asset for estate planning and medicaid eligibility, ensuring their needs are met without depleting their life savings.



understanding medicaid eligibility



medicaid provides health coverage to millions of americans, including eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults, and people with disabilities. however, to qualify for medicaid, applicants must meet certain income and asset thresholds, which vary by state.
since medicaid is designed to aid those with limited income and assets, those with significant assets may need to “spend down” or restructure their finances to meet eligibility requirements. strategic asset planning can help protect an individual’s wealth while ensuring they qualify for the necessary aid.



the role of fine art in asset planning



fine art can be an attractive investment not only due to its potential to appreciate over time but also because of its use in non-traditional estate and medicaid planning. here’s how fine art can be incorporated:



1. investment and appreciation



fine art often appreciates in value, especially if the piece is from a renowned artist or has historical significance. by investing in art, you not only diversify your investment portfolio but potentially hold an appreciating asset that can be passed down to future generations.



2. medicaid asset planning



assets like fine art are considered countable assets for medicaid eligibility. however, the actual valuation of art can be quite subjective and varies greatly depending on market conditions, the artist’s recognition, and other factors.



strategic gifting of art



a common strategy to qualify for medicaid is reducing your countable assets through gifting. transferring your art investments to your children or heirs is one way to legally adjust your asset level. here’s how it can be structured:



1. timely gifting



medicaid has a look-back period of five years. this means that all asset transfers made within five years prior to applying for medicaid can be penalized. therefore, early planning is crucial. gifting art well before the look-back period is essential to avoid penalties and delays in benefits.



2. documentation and valuation



when gifting art, proper documentation is necessary to establish the gift’s legality and the art’s value at the time of the transfer. it’s advisable to have art appraised and to keep detailed records of the transaction to present to medicaid if questioned.



3. legal and tax considerations



transferring valuable art can have legal and tax implications. it’s important to consult with legal and tax professionals to ensure that the transfer is done in compliance with current laws and that any potential tax burdens are minimized.



benefits and risks of using fine art for medicaid planning



benefits:



asset diversification: fine art can diversify your investment portfolio.potential appreciation: art can increase in value, providing more assets to pass on to heirs.estate planning: allows for the transfer of wealth to the next generation in a form that can be both meaningful and valuable.



risks:



market volatility: the art market can be unpredictable. values can fluctuate widely based on trends, economic conditions, and changes in cultural interest.liquidity: art is not a liquid asset. selling a piece of art quickly can often result in a sale price that is much lower than its appraised value.legal and tax complexity: the transfer of valuable art must be carefully managed to avoid legal pitfalls and unexpected tax consequences.



practical steps to begin



research: understand the art market by researching artists, trends, and historical sales data.professional guidance: consult with art advisors, estate planners, and attorneys who specialize in both art investment and elder law.purchase with intent: acquire art with a clear understanding of its potential role in your estate and medicaid planning strategy.plan early: begin the gifting process well before the medicaid look-back period to ensure compliance and minimize penalties.



conclusion



using fine art as a component in strategic medicaid planning is an innovative approach that can offer both financial and personal rewards. however, it requires careful consideration, expert advice, and meticulous planning. by understanding the complexities involved and seeking appropriate guidance, fine art can be effectively integrated into your estate planning to meet your future needs and those of your heirs.

i had to sell the family jewels to pay for her long term care 

my wife and i had both worked really hard to raise our two kids and at the same time live a comfortable life.  we did some investing in stocks and real-estate but my wife always had an affinity for jewelry, especially diamonds.  we both retired in our early 60’s and planned of traveling and enjoying retirement.  that’s when it all changed one day when my wife went to her doctor after complaining of some mild forgetfulness.
we thought it was nothing other than old age but her doctor told us that she had the early stages of alzheimer’s and it was rapidly progressing.  they said with medications she may have 10-15 good years left.  our mind jumped to how to pay for her long term care in a nursing home if it ever came to that.  as i said, we had some assets in stocks and savings but most were tied up in jewelry.  this happened in 2008 near the market low and we had to sell about $200,000 dollars of diamonds for about $70,000 once the medical bills started to pile up.  long term care insurance was something that our financial advisor told us about five years before but we never acted.
we naturally called the first long-term care insurance company we could find after we got the diagnosis but they told us it was too late for her but i could still get it.  the guy we spoke with was from south carolina about 10 miles from where i grew up and he worked for a company that sold a bunch of different companies.  he got me a long term care insurance plan but could not find anything for my wife. they were great and if you ever need long term care insurance info call them, their site is here.
my wife on the other hand was going to fund her care by selling all her jewelry which included seventeen high-end diamonds.  some of her jewelry had been in her family for years and it was tough to let it go… but we had to do it.

my love affair with pink diamonds. 

pink diamonds are so pretty!
whoever said a thing of beauty is a joy forever must have been thinking of rare pink diamonds. pink diamonds evoke passion, fine taste and style. whether they’re embedded in an engagement ring or pendant necklace along with other gems, or placed in a brooch, tiara or crown, or set in white gold or rose gold as earrings, pink diamonds mesmerize.
only a small number of pink diamonds are mined annually. pink diamonds are extracted from the argyle mine located in western australia. it has been estimated that in five years’ time, pink diamond supply would have dwindled further, making the jewels even rarer and more expensive.
authentic pink diamonds emanating from the australian mine come in varying shades of pink – some come in brownish hue, others in champagne, and some are purplish. the more intense the pink shade of the diamond, the greater the value. the value of natural pink diamonds surpasses white diamonds.
one of the biggest vivid pink diamond that had its unveiling in monaco is the steinmetz pink. the flawless 59.6 carat diamond was discovered in southern africa. another famous diamond with a light pink color is the darya-i-nur, which occupies a prominent place amidst the iranian crown jewels. among the royal owners of the darya-i-nur was india’s first mogul emperor. shown at london’s crystal palace exhibition sometime in 1851, the priceless diamond has been preserved in the treasure vaults of the central bank of iran.
in the contemporary era, luxury jewelers to the stars, like harry winston, chopard, jacob & co., fashion pink diamonds into jawdroppingly stunning pieces worth flaunting. some luxury jewelers have created extraordinary rings set with white diamonds along with pink diamonds, mounted in platinum 18k rose gold for its discriminating clientele. others convert heirloom pieces into splendid works of art.
among the privileged few who have been gifted with rare pink diamonds are royalty like queen elizabeth ii and hollywood actresses like jennifer lopez, jennifer garner, and victoria beckham. singer mariah carey received a pink diamond engagement ring from nick canon. it was studded with numerous intense pink diamonds and two half-moon diamonds on each side, reportedly amounting to over two million dollars.
the exquisite pink diamond wedding gift that queen elizabeth ii received from canadian geologist john williamson back in 1947 was a stunning rock that has been made into a brooch pin with alpine rose design. cartier designed it, surrounding the pink diamond centerpiece with colorless diamond petals.
given its immense value and symbolic meaning, a pink diamond ring is truly a gem like no other. the beauty of a pink diamond can be quite inspiring. getting such a gift speaks volumes about just how special the recipient is. it is an object of desire that can reflect sentiments like love, appreciation, and exaltation.
can you envision yourself donning a pair of awesome pink & white diamond earrings or necklace, perfectly coordinated with a beautiful gown or cocktail dress and designer heels? indeed, beautiful drop earrings, necklaces, or rings with pink diamonds are so pretty! in a few cases, pink diamonds also reflect a nation’s rich & colorful history.
