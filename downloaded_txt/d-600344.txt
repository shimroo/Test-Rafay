 channelings
“when i listen to your channelings, i am blown away. they seem to open up my heart center. [your channelings are] a modern version of the ancient incan whistling vessels explored by daniel k. statenkov.”âjames j.

"the best reading i had was yours. you have access to so much more information then regular psychics have. just using tarot cards seems a bit limited in comparison. i was really impressed with your power, ethics, understanding and kindness." âgenevieve

the lighthouse online





this site has been online since 1994. i've been psychic my entire life and a practicing psychic since the late 1980s. you'll find a wealth of articles about spirituality, psychic abilities, and psychics, with plenty of information on how to apply spiritual and metaphyscial information in the real world.
you'll also find audio files of a small proportion of the many hundreds of hours of channeling i have done since the mid-1990s. some of those files are free to listen to, and some require a small payment to access.
if you want to schedule a psychic reading with me, email marina@sonic.net. it's helpful if you put "i'd like to book a reading" in your subject line.
for now, this site is also hosting catmom.com.







catmom.com





the lighthouse online is also hosting catmom.com. catmom.com started when i wanted to reprint an article on the dangers of clumping clay kitty litters, this side of the site has expanded into several useful and helpful articles.
the big deal about clumping clay kitty litters: clumping clay kitty litters may be related to a wide variety of seemingly unrelated cat health problems, included diarrhea, frothy yellow vomiting, mega-bowel syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney problems, respiratory problems, general failure to thrive, anemia, lethargy, and even death. for more information, read this article.







psychic course





i am no longer offering my course on developing your psychic abilities. i plan to write a book based on the course materials. look for it in 2025. meanwhile, check out athena star press, where you can find books on a variety of topics.

you can buy my book on forgiveness, the forgiving lifestyle: how to forgive everyone (including yourself) on amazon.com.

audio files



in the early 2000s, i held a series of channeling events. i recorded most of the evenings in the series (there were some audio mishaps), and made the audio files available for purchase.
i put the content for the track summaries of the audio files into pdf format and now offer the files and the pdfs as one item. you can find summaries of each evening and purchase the files on this page. that page also has links to much more detailed information on each evening.
the content of these channelings is evergreen and immensely healing on a planetary and personal scale.






readings



see this page for information on scheduling a reading/healing session with me.















hello!
thank you for stopping by. one visitor wrote to say that he almost skipped my web site because, when he saw names of the entities i channel, he thought my site was "just another set of big claims and no substance." however, his intuition told him to give it another chance. he was writing to say he was glad he had stopped and taken a deeper look, because what he found was not the usual new age fare, but instead information that touched something deep within him.
i hope you will find information here that is useful, entertaining,  amusing, and that also touches something deep within you. and if nothing here that is for you, please keep looking, with my best wishes and blessings.
