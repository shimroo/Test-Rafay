welcome to south coast shipyard

located in the heart of the spectacular newport beach harbor is south coast shipyard. we service ​customers as far north as ventura and as far south as san diego.
although south coast shipyard handles any type of vessel, we are renowned throughout ​southern california as the “go to” wooden boat specialists.
our syncrolift®shiplifts and cradle system is a large part of that story but it’s our shipwright staff and their decades of proven craftsmanship and excellence that makes us the leader in wooden hulled vessel repair and maintenance.

mellody v - yelp reviewi always have great experiences every time i visit south coast shipyard. all of the employees there are great and very responsive. from haul-outs to any type of repair, they do it all; painting, woodwork, electrical work, and so much more and the quality is exceptional. when leaving your boat with south coast, you can rest assured that it is in great hands and will be treated with respect, which is something that i can’t say for other companies. it’s also nice to get great customer service, as any concern i’ve had was always taken care of quickly and with extreme professionalism. i trust south coast with all of my boating needs and would highly recommend them!
