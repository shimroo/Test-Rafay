home



alta is an exclusive residential community of 65 contemporary homes in palm springs, california. located beneath the rustic san jacinto mountains in the coachella valley, this community delivers rugged, snow-capped mountain views, and is only minutes from downtown palm springs. across from the stunning oswit canyon, below the south lykken hiking trail, and surrounded by federally-protected land, the views and secluded natural setting are ensured to be pristine tomorrow and beyond. alta homes truly represent the integration of architecture and nature.

we encourage homeowners to be actively involved in our community. we currently have committees for landscaping, communications, and architecture. if you are interested in serving on any of our committees, please send an e-mail to info@altapalmsprings.com.
