they can be made with a traditional innerspring core or using all natural botanical latex (not a blend of natural & synthetic). our mattresses are healthier for everyone in your family including the youngest to those experiencing menopause. no out-gassing of toxic chemicals so you can sleep healthier. this is true of our many bedding products like our mattress pads, comforters, and pillows. you'll find these and more in the earthsake natural bedroom.
 
no wonder the earthsake mattress was rated the "#1 best organic mattress in the world" made in the usa using pure & local ingredients.

do you miss the traditional innerspring tufted style?
earthsake can still make you the classic hand-tufted innerspring style using all organic ingredients and recycled steel innerspring coils for the classic look and feel of an heirloom innerspring mattress: 
 
 
strictly vegan?
you can choose any mattress be made without wool - simply enter your request into the special comments section of your order.  the earthsake vegan mattress is available for the strictest of vegans and our wool is replaced with an entirely plant-based fire retardant for fire safety regulations.  any mattress - at your request.
