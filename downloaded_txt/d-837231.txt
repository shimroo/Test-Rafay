our storythe allens are carrying on the family tradition of hosting visitors in the spectacular wind river mountain range like their forefathers did here in the 1920's. jim & mary started the diamond 4 ranch in 1973. they raised their three daughters christin, holly and jessie on the ranch. now, youngest daughter jessie is continuing the family business. the allens love packing in the "winds" and are dedicated to using the land wisely with minimum impact camping practices. the diamond 4 ranch gets its name from the allen's horse brand which has a history from the days of the open range.
