discovery of once theoretical methyl cation (ch3+) moleculewith els peeters and jan cami







welcome to western’s department of physics and astronomy, where we passionately pursue knowledge about the fundamental laws that govern the universe and all that it contains. our interdisciplinary research investigates how matter, forces, and energy interact and shape objects and environments, from our own direct surroundings here on earth to the event horizon of black holes in the distant reaches of the universe. we are as curious about the practical applications of physics to medicine and the environment as the fascinating physics behind the largest structures in the cosmos!   we bring that passion and curiosity into our student experience. our students are an essential part of our community, and often key contributors to our research. we are dedicated to helping students and young investigators discover their potential by giving them guidance and support to become better scientists, community members, and people. we are excited to work with you at all stages of your career, to help develop your interests and achieve your goals.
