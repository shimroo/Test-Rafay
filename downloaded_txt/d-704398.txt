				aside from the stunning natural beauty of this area, there are many exciting activities and experiences to savour.

the region is noted for its hiking trails, kayaking adventures, whale watching, birding activities, and golf courses; and our pristine beaches offer fun for the whole family.

accommodation varies from oceanfront campgrounds to cosy cottages, friendly bed and breakfasts, and comfortable inns.  you will find something to suit every requirement and budget.

the restaurants and cafes in our area offer the freshest nova scotia seafood.  lobster is our specialty, but don't miss a "feed of mussels" or a meal featuring the wonderfully tasty st. margaret's bay haddock.

shopping includes many small, locally owned gift stores, galleries and craft shops which feature primarily canadian and nova scotian artists and crafts people.

whether your interest is in the great outdoors, history, shopping or simply "taking time to smell the roses", you will find what you need to make your vacation complete... right here along our scenic coast and within our welcoming communities.
