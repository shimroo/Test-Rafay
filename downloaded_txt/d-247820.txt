ordering flowers from our nurseries
orders are sent out all year round other than bank holidays or other public holiday periods such as good friday, easter monday and the christmas period in order to avoid postal delays while delivering your plants fresh.
please note you need to be in to sign for your parcel if over 3 plants or give an alternative option such as a work address. if you give us your mobile number you can be texted by parcelforce with your preferred delivery time. although the online order form gives the option to leave somewhere safe, parcelforce will usually require a signature and will not leave the parcel. two attempts are usually made to deliver but after this the parcel will be taken back to your local post office for your collection. you will need to take the tracking number with you. please bear in mind these are live plants and will not stand being left at a depot for a long period of time.
orders over 3 plants must be received by 12 noon the day before required.
appointments may be made for collection of plants - we are open 10am - 3.30pm monday to friday for this purpose. (closed 1-1.30pm)
all plants are sent out in 9cm pots. the time of year sent out to you will clearly affect how large these plants can be on despatch - many will be dormant until at least mid april. none of our plants will be taller than 30cm, many will be a lot less due to restrictions of packaging, weight and practicality. however they are ready to plant out. young plants will always establish better. heights given are eventual height of mature plant. we aim to turnaround plant deliveries within a couple of working days but you can advise us of your preferred date for delivery if you wish when you place an order.
if your order (over 3 plants) has not been delivered within 48 hrs please contact parcelforce www.parcelforce.com and enter your tracking details given in the email to you when we depatched your order. although on a 24hr service sometimes parcelforce can take 48hrs to deliver although this is rare and is dependant on how busy they are, and is out of our control. 
if there is some damage externally it will be due to the rough handling of rm or parcelforce, not our packing or boxes. even then, it is rare for the contents to be damaged.
