erico motorsports
stop dreaming. start riding.
john beldock wanted a new hobby and decided it was time to give road racing motorcycles a try. a crashed honda was purchased and resurrected as a racebike. throughout that summer, more damaged bikes were purchased to be sold at the races. this eliminated the need to rob regular paychecks to finance the season. that first season yielded a championship in the novice class for john.
