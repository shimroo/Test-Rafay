	 that's red
	 
    





back in the 80's that was the saying in our gang. red meant " not cool". these motherfuckers are cool.








 red is the new cool. now the coolest label of all. the one that started it all.

good group of eight. this is where to  you get your lycra stretched in lincoln ne. this is were you get your balls broke. don't think for one second that you handed me my ass on a silver plater. sometimes the past gets in the way of the now but the future tells the tale of the past. next week your asses are mine.

ha! i just fucking mimic yoda if you're paying attention to the title. i've been hitting the gym the last few weeks to build up some upper body mass, especially in my left arm/shoulder. the gym on east campus doesn't have a/c so they have a chart that gives out the "heat danger" warning in the building. today it was high. didn't feel any motherfucking hotter than my house. i grabbed a bball and went to the courts. shot some hoops for 15 min with 5 min of launching lay ups off my left leg ( the one with the still healing fucking knee).

now the best part of this whole motherfucking story. i go down to do some weights and i need to cool off a bit or there's going to be sweat all over the fucking walls. i approach the desk, where the fan is blowing on low( on low and it's super hot and humid), and say to the cute trainer girl, " i need a fan", with a wink. insert personal trainer smile here. i lean over and turn it on hi.  that's enough chit chat,walk away and go about my business 'cause there's hell to be payed out.

	 roller reward
	 
    


hopslamthe first two of these flow down just fine after an hour of listening to black sabbath, staring at a stucco wall.  i can't believe this beer is still a seasonal, but then again, it might be a touch dangerous if one were mistakenly grabbed for at five am sitting on the river bank.

	 motherfucking hot
	 
    


friday was fucking hot wasn't it? in texas it was. shorts n sleeves n 80 degrees. i commuted in and around fredericksburg all weekend.  i was just one of those lucky ones that got the chance. oddest happening was we came around this corner onto this "ranch" of goats. there on the side of the road a motherfucking scurvy dog nawing on an armadillo. i kept laughing in amazement for i don't know how long.sitting in the cockpit was fucking cool. especially take offs and landings. watching resevoir dogs and easy rider as nitely entertainment was cool. making two grown men cry was cool. i've got some nasty farts. cool.labels: the good the bad and the motherfucking nasty ass
