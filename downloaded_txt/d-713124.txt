welcome 
                          to my movie graveyard! a place where i can dig 
                          up films that belong in categories best described as 
                          old, cheap, classic, cheezy and even pretty bad; and 
                          then visit them once again through the modern miracle 
                          that is dvd. occasionally, films that may be considered 
                          "new" will be unearthed here, but for the most part 
                          i like the classics. and just who am i? i am shadow, 
                          the guy who haunts the place and the caretaker of these 
                          cinematic treasures from ages past. i’m also a 
                          guy who has never really grown up. so grab a bag of 
                          popcorn and join me... 
 
                          be sure to check the update 
                          page.
