                              work in deciphering the etruscan language.
                              this work was originally published in 1981
                              as the "catalog of etruscan words," by mel
                              copeland. the work now integrates the
                              tavola cortonensis and zagreb mummy
                              scripts, which are the most



















                              recent finds. the work shows etruscan
                              conjugation and declension patterns. the
                              first page lists the words and is an easy
                              reference as to where they can be found
                              and where their declension and conjugation
                              patterns may be compared and examined.
                              translation of the various scripts is
                              nearly complete. the work extends to not
                              only translating the etruscan scripts but
                              also new areas of study in the development
                              of the indo-european languages. tables are
                              furnished showing the relationship of
                              hundreds of etruscan cognates to the basic
                              indo-european language groups.

                            boewulf, the rig veda and the indus
                            valley seals (harappa civilization). we are
                            reminded that the wonderful murals in the
                            etruscan tombs have a story, and no doubt
                            those who commissioned the murals had no
                            intentions to have anyone from the world of
                            the living judging them. it is a good primer
                            for those interested in the role sacrifice
                            played within the indo-european religions.

                            koran: since it was dictated by the angels

                            jewish scriptures, torah and gospel (sic.
                            the bible), it cannot contradict the bible.
                            moslem scholars suggest that allah is not
                            the god of the bible, and that the koran
                            supercedes the bible, ideas that are

                            islamist extremists use the koran's
                            scriptures to justify murdering non-moslems,

                            advocate violence against "unbelievers" are
