 faqs








            how can ma help me with my marijuana use?
          









in ma, we know what it is like to lose control over marijuana and not be able to stop using, despite pledges, pleas, and promises. our only qualifications for helping others is that we have stopped using ourselves. if we can do it, you can do it too! it is the support that ma members offer each other that is the backbone of the program's success.








            what happens at an ma meeting?
          









people discuss their problems with marijuana, what they did to recover, and what life is like now. we have found that as a group we can achieve for ourselves results which, as individuals, we failed at repeatedly.








            does attending a meeting cost money?
          









a gold coin is appreciated if you can afford it, but if you can’t, don’t worry! this money goes towards refreshments, rent/zoom account, literature & carrying the message of ma on a district level.








            my child/partner has a problem with marijuana addiction. what can i do?
          









parents and partners of people struggling with marijuana addiction are welcome to attend a meeting or call our information line to learn more about recovery and how to support their loved one.
