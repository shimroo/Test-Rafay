preacher, pugilist, activist, father of four 



father dave is best known for his work with at-risk young people, especially in his use of boxing for those suffering from substance abuse problems and anger-management issues. he is also a 6th degree black belt and australia’s oldest active professional boxer. his progression into martial arts and boxing came out of his attempt to raise funds for his youth centre in dulwich hill, where he was parish priest for thirty years. father dave has been nominated three time for ‘australian of the year’. he is an outspoken activist on social justice and inter-faith issues. he is the proud father of four children.
