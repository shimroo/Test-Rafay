how we startedfamily worship opened her doors on january 15, 1984. however, the call to the pastorate began in the heart of pastor jr damiani 25 years prior, during his music evangelism with the eastmen quartet. family worship center was established by a direct calling of god to be a center for worship & the word.in january of 2020 founding pastor jr damiani passed on the responsibility of lead pastor to his son, david damiani, who has had a calling on his life to spiritually equip believers since the age of 18. david’s 30  year journey to the pastorate took him through many life experiences, and although unconventional, ultimately prepared him to take on the responsibility of leading a church through a lead pastor transition, a global pandemic, the death of the founding pastor (his father) and into this new season of family worship center.














we would love to welcome you to the body of believers who gather at family worship center.





























if it’s not good, then it’s not the gospel.
