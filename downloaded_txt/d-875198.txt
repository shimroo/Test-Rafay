tube twins





michael garrett sighted this example of the "tube-girl" meme at this amazing gallery*.while a purist might argue that the structure encapsulating the twins is too wide to qualify as a genuine tube, i would argue that the presence of two women justifies the unusual proportions.*be sure not to miss the weaponized lobster.[follow me on twitter.]

skeletons in the planetary closet





chemical archiveas the world's glaciers melt, they've begun to release an archive of banned industrial substances back into the environment, chemicals that have been locked, frozen, inside the glacial ice for up to thirty years.[. . .]the idea of a poisonous atmospheric archive being unintentionally released -- on a global scale -- makes me wonder what sorts of news reports we might read in several thousand years' time, when carbon tombs start to leak their quarantined contents back into the atmosphere. the buried skies of an industrial era, put to pharaonic rest beneath the earth's surface, will make their operatic reappearance in future human history.[follow me on twitter.]

that strange feeling is your head spinning.





is the large hadron collider being sabotaged from the future?the quest to observe the higgs boson has certainly been plagued by its share of troubles, from the cancellation of the superconducting supercollider in 1993 to the large hadron collider's streak of technical troubles. in fact, the projects have suffered such bad luck that holger bech nielsen of the niels bohr institute in copenhagen and masao ninomiya of the yukawa institute for theoretical physics in kyoto wonder if it isn't bad luck at all, but future influences rippling back to sabotage them. in papers like "test of effect from future in large hadron collider: a proposal" and "search for future influence from lhc," they put forth the notion that observing the higgs boson would be such an abhorrent event that the future is actually trying to prevent it from happening.[follow me on twitter.]

the existential implications of ufology





greg bishop has written a wonderfully thought-provoking piece on the ufo inquiry titled "ufos as agents of deconstruction."  here's a brief excerpt:ostensibly, the ufo question is whether a non-human source is causing sightings, abductions, radar returns and flying saucer religions, but the intricacies of the problem impinge on so many other areas that we redefine them as well. examples include reported physics of ufo movement, the question of cultural antecedents and perhaps how our society decides what is acceptable as serious study. that last one may be the most deconstructive effect of all. changes in our mindset, and not any so-called "answers" may be the real reason behind the whole thing, or at least the most meaningful. there may indeed be "knowledge gained without awareness."[follow me on twitter.]

this is more like it.





trips to mars in 39 daysusing traditional chemical rockets, a trip to mars -- at quickest -- lasts 6 months. but a new rocket tested successfully last week could potentially cut down travel time to the red planet to just 39 days. the ad astra rocket company tested a plasma rocket called the vasimr vx-200 engine, which ran at 201 kilowatts in a vacuum chamber, passing the 200-kilowatt mark for the first time. "it's the most powerful plasma rocket in the world right now," says franklin chang-diaz, former nasa astronaut and ceo of ad astra.[follow me on twitter.]

deja vu





twin towers seen once more via augmented reality iphone appmobilizy, the company from salzburg, that brought us one of the world's first augmented reality browsers, wikitude, just released a major upgrade which crosses that significant line between technology and its effects in the 'real' world. their idea was to build a virtual memorial in remembrance of the 9/11 attacks in the u.s. and the destruction of the world trade center in new york city. the result will be the ability to point their android and iphone application at the place where the world trade center once stood and witness a 3d rendering of the twin towers, once more.(via beyond the beyond.)how long until someone develops an app that populates the new york city sky with phantom airliners and billowing cgi smoke?[follow me on twitter.]

this one really got my attention.





the dna mystery: scientists stumped by "telepathic" abilitiesin the study, scientists observed the behavior of fluorescently tagged dna strands placed in water that contained no proteins or other material that could interfere with the experiment. strands with identical nucleotide sequences were about twice as likely to gather together as dna strands with different sequences. no one knows how individual dna strands could possibly be communicating in this way, yet somehow they do. the "telepathic" effect is a source of wonder and amazement for scientists.[follow me on twitter.]

a breakthrough to warm one's posthuman heart





remote control cyborg insects now a realitythe awesome part is that this implant only steers the insect, and only when necessary. once the bug is pointing in the right direction, the steering signal cuts out, and the bug self-stabilizes and gets back to the tricky business of flying, which it was just fine at before some roboticist stuck a bunch of wires into its optic lobe, thank you very much. as you can see from the video, the insect has no trouble landing itself on a vertical surface, a maneuver which would be, uh, a little bit difficult to code.[follow me on twitter.]

some recent (and semi-recent) ufo posts





i've assembled the following list for newcomers to this blog curious about my attitude about ufos.  it's by no means exhaustive, but summarizes my conviction that the phenomenon is a genuine mystery with the potential to challenge our deepest cosmic and existential certainties.while i think the ufo enigma indicates some form of intelligence, i'm not sure where that intelligence originates.  certainly it could come from the interstellar neighborhood -- but the evidence, taken in its entirety, suggests we're dealing with something substantially stranger.  (of course, we could be confronted with myriad overlapping phenomena.)  in any case, we'll likely never know until the rigid definitional framework that has come to dominate discussion of all things "paranormal" is relaxed to accommodate a genuinely agnostic approach.sagan and the hill encounterufos: why no "open contact"?ufos, aliens and consciousnessthe roswell controversythe persistent myth of ufo "disclosure"the "grays" as posthumansdo aliens smoke cigarettes?talking flowers and other denizens of the imaginal realmstrange "helpers"little green menasemic texts and "alien" writing"proof"?(to view all posts tagged with "ufos," click here.)[follow me on twitter.]

drink up!





it's official: water found on the moonsince man first touched the moon and brought pieces of it back to earth, scientists have thought that the lunar surface was bone dry. but new observations from three different spacecraft have put this notion to rest with what has been called "unambiguous evidence" of water across the surface of the moon.the new findings, detailed in the sept. 25 issue of the journal science, come in the wake of further evidence of lunar polar water ice by nasa's lunar reconnaissance orbiter and just weeks before the planned lunar impact of nasa's lcross satellite, which will hit one of the permanently shadowed craters at the moon's south pole in hope of churning up evidence of water ice deposits in the debris field.[follow me on twitter.]

further evidence that we inhabit a cosmic fractal





ego city: cities organized like human brains"natural selection has passively guided the evolution of mammalian brains throughout time, just as politicians and entrepreneurs have indirectly shaped the organization of cities large and small," said mark changizi, a neurobiology expert and assistant professor in the department of cognitive science at rensselaer, who led the study. "it seems both of these invisible hands have arrived at a similar conclusion: brains and cities, as they grow larger, have to be similarly densely interconnected to function optimally."[follow me on twitter.]

transcendent machines





"someone once said plants invented animals to carry them around. well, i think the earth invented human beings to build machines; and those machines will be the consciousness of the earth. have you not noticed that these machines are made of the earth? they are made of gold and silver and arsenic and copper and iridium. they are the stuff of the earth, organised by primate fingers into more complex arrangements than the earth could achieve through geological folding, glaciation, volcanism, what have you. we do the fine-tuning; but the earth is beginning to think."--terence mckenna[follow me on twitter.]

welcome to the official blog of mac tonnies.

i'm a kansas city, missouri-based author, blogger, fortean researcher, and occasional speaker.  for biographical detail, visit my  other website.please address all email to macbot [at] yahoo dot com.  and yes, i'm on twitter.(masthead by araqinta.)



my books



"a stunning survey of the latest evidence for intelligent life on mars. mac tonnies brings a thoughtful, balanced and highly accessible approach to one of the most fascinating enigmas of our time."

--herbie brennan, author of martian genesis and the atlantis enigma

"tonnies drops all predetermined opinions about mars, and asks us to do the same."

--greg bishop, author of project beta

"i highly recommend the book for anyone interested in the search for extra-terrestrial artifacts, and the political intrigues that invariably accompany it."

--david jinks, author of the monkey and the tetrahredron

"mac tonnies goes where nasa fears to tread and he goes first class."

--peter gersten, former director of citizens against ufo secrecy

and don't miss...



(includes my essay "the ancients are watching.")



blurbage

"posthuman blues is good shit. you humans might like it too."--john shirley, author of crawlers and eclipse"mind-stretching."--clifford pickover, author of sex, drugs, einstein, and elves". . . a grabbag of links and pithy blurbs, each a little more curious than the last."--feral intelligence"frankly, there's nothing worse (aside from death, global famine, nuclear disaster and all-round armageddon) than seeing players in the ufo field fawning all over their peers at conferences as they seek acceptance into the ufological sand-pit by saying the 'right thing' to the 'right people.' thankfully, there's none of that in mac's world."--nick redfern, author of three men seeking monsters"mac tonnies is undeniably a bit of a weirdo. perhaps that's why i like him so much, though i agree with nearly nothing that he writes."--john brownlee
