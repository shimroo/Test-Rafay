“ senior citizen: a class of people who hold the wisdom of the world.”- urban dictionary 

























the sebastopol area senior center (sasc) is a private, nonprofit organization incorporated in 1969. it is sonoma county’s oldest senior center. we are a progressive organization that wishes to inspire our community to ensure people aged 60 and older will find enjoyment and meaning in aging. we hope to assist people in aging with enthusiasm, good health, curiosity, and social connectedness in the context of the community. our mission is to create and maintain an environment that encourages independence for older adults by providing learning, social, and recreational opportunities to pursue a fulfilling and healthy life. we educate the community about the issues related to the aging process. we respect their wisdom and history, enjoy their humor, appreciate their contributions to society, and address their changing needs with good programs and support. no senior needs to face the challenges of aging alone.



current updates:the senior center,  harvest cafe and the legacy will be closed for president’s day on monday, feb 17th.our fall prevention series starts 3/3!
