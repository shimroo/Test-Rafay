                  you have. we just love them. i just again made the roasted
                  soybeans. i haven't tried cooking the grits yet. i love grits.
                  my husband is in cardiac therapy and always eats the 7-grain
                  cereal every morning. we absolutely love your 7-grain pancake

                  about your products and web site. thanks so much."

pioneers in organic farming 
the early 1960s found wayne and betty paul
                working hard to make a living from their central iowa farm.
                wayne had graduated from iowa state university with a degree in
                agriculture and was now eagerly implementing chemical farming
                methods on the 160 acres south of laurel, ia, which he had
                purchased in 1959. 

                then everything changed. a friend introduced wayne and betty to
                the concept of chemical-free farming, using healthy fertilizers
                and natural techniques for weed and insect control. deciding to
                give it a try, wayne stopped using chemicals...and thus he
                became one of the brave pioneers in what was to be known as the
                organic farming movement. 

                as wayne and betty, with help from their four growing children,
                learned more about chemical-free farming, they became more and
                more convinced that it was the best method of raising food.
                wayne began to look into grinding some of the grains into flour
                and cereal, starting out with basic cornmeal,
                oatmeal, and whole
                  wheat flour. as people found out about these items, the
                family started raising a larger variety of grains and offering
                more products. soon the unique 7-grain
                  cereal, 7-grain flour,
                and 7-grain pancake mix
                recipes were developed -- three items that continue to remain
                best-sellers. 

maintaining the legacy 
                wayne and betty continued to play an active role in the farming
                and business until 2006. their second son, steve, lives on the
                farm with his wife teresa, and continues to handle the flour and
                cereal part of the business. grandson daniel has taken on the
                responsibility of the fieldwork, with help from his wife amy and
                their young daughters. paul's grains is definitely an
                old-fashioned, family-operated business...big enough to have
                what you're looking for, but not too big to lose that personal
                touch. 

                paul's grains products are available for purchase here through
                our website to customers located within the state of iowa. if
