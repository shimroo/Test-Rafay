thank you for putting together [this] ride. we really enjoyed the adventure and experience. we met some wonderful people and got to see parts of florida that very few people are fortunate enough to see! i wanted to especially call out marty and joy. if it were not for the support of those two wonderful people, our experience probably would not have been so great. [they] really helped us enjoy and relax – to take in the experience instead of being stressed out about our skills or getting lost. they also helped to make sure we stopped and ensured dan had hydration, food and a pit stop when needed. they are angels. i also want to call out the ladies at the sag, who again, realized that dan was not doing well and really worked to keep his spirits up and ensure he had enough food/sugar to sustain him throughout the ride.

just finished our c2c trip in st petersburg today. it was an organized multi-day ride with bikeflorida.org. this was by far one of the best organized group rides we have been on. had exceptional weather, great sag stops, hotels were very nice and close to dinner choices. and the organizers/staff were very professional and courteous to all riders. highly recommend bike florida if you’re looking for some multi-day bicycling trips in florida.
john h.2025 new year's c2c participant 



love â¤ï¸ the personnel associated with bikeflorida.org. they really have the ducks together. me and my spouse did c2c with them in 2024, and were extremely pleased with the experience. we will definitely ride with them again. highly recommend.
