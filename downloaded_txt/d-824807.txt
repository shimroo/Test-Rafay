	 the dirty little secret about obamacare.
	 
    


no, it's not about race. it's all about pandering to peoplewho want someone else to pay their bills.health care too expensive?  don't want to pay for what youuse?  just get an insurance company to pick up the tab, they'vegot lots of money. make someone else pay.  have the governmentforce them to pay.insurance companies work by mitigating risk. that is, they playthe odds. they have rules about what they cover based on thepercentages of how many of their insured will need a payout forthat coverage.  when the government forces insurance companiesto cover additional ailments the cost of coverage must go up.health insurance should be about catastrophic illness andaccidents, not about paying for checkups or flu shots.it would be ludicris to expect your car insurance to pay foroil changes and fillups for your car.it really bothers me when i hear someone say "i can't get thatdrug/supply/referal because my insurance won't cover it."wake up! you can get that if you just open your own wallet.now, if you hear someone say that any changes won't costanything, the person speaking is blantly lying. the government,in recent memory, has never required a change in private industrythat didn't cost the taxpayer something.remember, the government has no money of it's own.  the moneyit spends, it takes from working families in taxes andregulations.  worse, when the government presses print new moneywithout taking old money out of circulation, the value of thedollars in your wallet, in your savings and in your 401k go down.it's called inflation.the real story? personally i do not think obama is interestedin fixing anything about america's health.  i think his realgoal is the distruction of the american economy, as evidencedby his lack of understanding of the historical cause and effectof big government meddling in any financial issues.obamacare is just another case of ponzi scheme politics.

	 torture reality check
	 
    


if the cia techniques amount to torture, then the fbi should arrest the half of hollywood that makes horror films. nothing the cia has done is any worse than what is portrayed to our children in the horror films made by the liberals in hollywood.  these detainees have killed or plotted to kill american citizens.  as far as i am concerned, anything short of death is an ok technique for questioning terrorists.
