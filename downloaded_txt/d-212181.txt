a lot’s happened since 1862.if you know anything about corinth, we’re guessing it’s about the civil war or trains.













































in 1862, our city—and nearby shiloh—saw some of the war’s most important battles, as union and confederate troops fought for control of corinth’s critical railroad junction. that year is still a big part of our city’s story, but it’s not all. in the years since, corinth has developed an identity and culture you won’t find anywhere else. corinth has connected mississippi to the country. we’ve made slugburgers world-famous. and, nowadays, downtown corinth offers some of the region's best opportunities to dine, shop and explore.
