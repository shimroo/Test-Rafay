ac/dc record sales jump & no more rnr train clip





the news of the release of ac/dc’s first album in 8 years has sent a lot of new fans out for an educational catch-up and some old ones for a refresher course. on this week’s aria chart, ac/dc are at no. 47 with ‘tnt’, no. 61 with ‘highway to hell’, no. 62 with ‘dirty deeds done cheap’, no. 74 with ‘who made who’ and no. 92 with ‘the razor’s edge’.collectively, the albums sold 3324 units which on this week’s chart was more than what the number 9 album did.it was an interesting choice of titles going over the counter. three of the albums are from the early era with bon scott. ‘the razor’s edge’ features brian johnson and ‘who made who’ was a soundtrack featuring both bon and brian.ac/dc’s new album ‘black ice’ will be released on october 18 in australia and october 20 in the usa.source: undercoverin other ac/dc news. the official ac/dc myspace page has removed the rock n roll train clip from it's music player.  of course you can still listen to the clip on many youtube user videos.

billboard.com: small "black ice" preview





billboard.com has a nice small black ice preview, covering a few tracks:due oct. 20 exclusively in wal-mart and sam's club stores as well as acdc.com, the set opens with the single "rock'n'roll train," a riffy blast sure to please longtime fans. the track goes to u.s. radio aug. 28.  elsewhere, "big jack" nods to the vintage major-key rocker "who made who," while "wheels" is a hands-in-the-air nod to old favorites such as "highway to hell" and "givin' the dog a bone."  frontman brian johnson is in fine form on tracks like "war machine" ("better watch your back and cover your tracks!," he warns), the sparse "decibel," partially sung in his deep, natural voice, and the anthemic "anything goes."  "black ice" ends with its title track, an old-school blues rocker that finds johnson growling, "i'll gouge your eyes out."i would guess that the riffs and sound of the album are along the lines of the bib era.  this would be great.as for me:  i've listened the that 30 second clip about 100 times!
