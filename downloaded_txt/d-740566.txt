projects


algorithms in culture
a foundational concept in computer science, algorithms – loosely defined as a set of rules to direct the behavior of machines or humans – have shaped infrastructures, practices, and daily lives around the world. the cstms research cluster on algorithms in culture explores the implications of their development and deployment in politics, media, science, organizations, culture, and the construction of the self.

partnership with the forum on climate engineering assessment
cstms has formed a new partnership with forum for climate engineering assessment, an initiative of the school of international service at american university in washington dc. together we will assess the social, ethical, political, and legal implications of emerging technologies that fall under the broad rubric of climate engineering (sometimes referred to as “climate geoengineering”).

advancing science for policy through interdisciplinary research in regulation
the university of california berkeley’s center to advance science in policy and regulation (caspr) together with the center for science, technology, medicine and society (cstms) and co-sponsors the innovative genomics initiative (igi) and the forum for collaborative hiv research hosted a workshop on advancing science for policy through interdisciplinary research in regulation (aspirr). this workshop is supported by the national science foundation’s science of science and innovation policy program. the workshop gathered leading experts from multiple disciplines and research areas to examine innovative approaches to incorporating science into the policy making and regulatory processes for emerging technologies.

arts + science in residence
the art+science in residence program will host artists by invitation drawn to collaboration, interested in interdisciplinary art, science and technological dialogue, and open to developing new working methods and research techniques. while the center allows room for variance, residencies typically unfold over two years and include both an exploratory and project-development phase. the program allows for artists to embed within the unique culture of the center and uc berkeley and its environs. the program affords access to a dynamic and diverse community of scholars, visitors, staff, and provides opportunities for cross-pollination with a broad public.
