welcome




this is the personal web site for wesley
                      johnston. i have more than one site hosted on this
                      domain, so please select the one you require:
the northern ireland roads site
                      - this site is in response to my great interest in
                      roads, road building and traffic flow. it is still
                      being constructed, but when complete it will
                      include details of all northern ireland's
                      motorways, dual-carriageways and details of all
                      kinds of new road schemes. 
the ireland story -
                      this site was active in the late 1990s and early
                      2000s but has not been updated since then. please
                      feel free to browse but remember that the material
                      may be out of date and probably won't be updated.
                      i ran it in conjunction with a friend, patrick
                      abbot. 
i am also a partner in
