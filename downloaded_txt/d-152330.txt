...about pine tavernbuilt in 1936, the pine tavern is not only one of bend oregon’s best restaurants, but it’s a tradition for locals and tourists alike. the restaurant is designed with unique characteristics that appeal to everyone, including the giant ponderosa pine tree growing in the middle of the dining area and cozy nooks. located in the heart of downtown along mirror pond, the warm and friendly atmosphere and service is very welcoming. not to mention, the hallmark hot scones served with honey butter and locally sourced produce, meats and ingredients.
