total bs! paris hilton out of jail already!!




paris hilton has not only had her sentence cut short, she is already out of jail! unimpeachable sources tell tmz the deal was sealed yesterday, and that hilton made her exit early early this morning. she was originally sentenced to 45 days in jail, but that was reduced to 23. she served a total of five days -- the normal stay for a violation of this kind. her five days began sunday night and concluded early thursday morning.

the l.a. county sheriff's department will hold a news conference in an hour to discuss what went down. 
update 10:16:  la county sheriff's spokesman steve whitmore says that paris hilton has been fitted for an ankle bracelet and put under house arrest for the next 40 days, after authorities decided to release paris from jail due to medical reasons. she got out of jail just after 2:00 am. 

whitmore says he cannot release details about paris' "medical issue" due to confidentiality, but said that medical officials "constantly examined" her while she was in jail. 

paris will be under house confinement in her west hollywood home for 40 days. after the 40 days are up, whitmore says she will have "fulfilled her debt to society." whitmore made it clear that paris was not released early -- she was reassigned. she is technically still in custody.

us weekly cover - did vanessa hide her party girl past from nick?






on june 3, a british newspaper published several shocking photos that showed lindsay lohan holding a sharp blade to a mystery brunette's neck as she posed provocatively for a camera. the next day the photos hit the web and the identity of lohan's partner in knife play was revealed: former mtv trl host vanessa minnillo, 26.

the shots were taken at musician sean lennon's apartment in the wee hours of june 16, 2006, after a night out at nyc hot spot bungalow 8. but when the news broke, was minnillo's mr. nice guy, nick lachey, completely blindsided by the revelations about her hard partying past?

the answer is likely no. in fact, lachey, 33, had already spent quite a bit of time defending minnillo's wild-child reputation when they first started dating, just weeks before the scandalous shots were snapped.

"a lot of nick's friends were complaining about what a party girl she was," says a minnillo source. "there were many nights in the beginning when vanessa was a total mess and nick didn't know what to do." "vanessa used to be a completely crazy, wild girl," confirms a minnillo pal. "she'd be the girl that would jump on the tables at every nightclub."

so will the evidence of the outrageous episode in minnillo's past jeopardize their relationship? those close to the couple, who recently moved in together, maintain that the scandal won't be a romantic roadblock.

does nicole richie think she's next?






paris hilton's good buddy nicole richie told david letterman during a taping for his talk show on wednesday that she's worried about landing in the pokey, too.

"i'm just keeping my fingers crossed, and, you know, of course, i'm scared also, but, you know, i'm willing to face whatever consequences come my way, and i take responsibility for what i've done," she said.

richie, the 25-year-old daughter of pop singer lionel richie, pleaded not guilty in february to driving under the influence. she was arrested dec. 11 and volunteered she had smoked marijuana and taken the prescription painkiller vicodin, but no drugs were found on her or in the car, police said.

richie already had a 2003 misdemeanor dui conviction. the california vehicle code says if convicted of dui twice within 10 years, a person can be sentenced to between 90 days and a year in jail and have his or her driving privileges suspended. during the "late show" taping, letterman asked richie, who acknowledged previous legal troubles, when she'll learn her fate. "probably the end of this month," she responded. a sympathetic letterman wished her the best, saying, "i hope you don't have to go to jail."

richie starred in the tv reality show "the simple life" with hilton, who has had similar problems. the 26-year-old hotel heiress checked into the century regional detention facility in suburban los angeles on sunday to serve 23 days for violating probation in an alcohol-related reckless driving case.

jessica drops $$$ on clothes






jessica alba reportedly spent $4,300 dollars on clothes in a couple hours over the weekend during a beverly hills shopping extravaganza. tmz initially reported the story:
"during her shopping extravaganza, alba hit up trendy harmony lane boutique twice and charged up ten dresses and five tops in size xs. jess also picked up some institute liberal shrugs and a bunch of vita bracelets and j.rae necklaces. alba was looking for outfits for her upcoming summer travel with boyfriend cash warren."
i am all for jessica trying to look her best, but damn, $4,300 in a couple hours? i guess this could be justified if jessica was buying $4k worth of bikinis or lingerie, and then modeling it for me at my house. but then again, that would just be another normal day.

paris hilton on sarah silverman: she's a bitch!



 


paris hilton may have smiled her way through sarah silverman’s raunchy monologue at the mtv movie awards where the show’s host poked fun at hilton's stint in jail, but she wasn’t laughing backstage. hilton, 26, who turned herself in to serve her sentence only hours after the ceremony ended, was overheard fuming, “she’s a f--king bitch. i hate her.”

but hilton shed no tears as she checked into the century regional detention facility in lynwood, california, at 11:15 p.m. on june 3 to begin her sentence. “she was quiet,” a source tells us weekly. after a medical screening, hilton – in an orange uniform – entered her 100-square-foot cell at 1:30 a.m. on june 4.

at 2 p.m. -- after lunch was placed through a slot in her door -- she called her father, rick, who could hear “clanging in the background,” a source tells us. (she can use the phone for 15 minutes a day.) although she is alone for now, sources tell us she could still get a cellmate.

and there will be no early dismissal: “she’s gonna do 23 days,” l.a. county sheriff public information officer steve whitmore assures us.

jen's new mystery man revealed!






so who was that handsome mystery man jennifer aniston was spotted holding hands with during a romantic dinner over memorial day weekend? the case is solved: it's 36-year-old british model paul sculfor, and the pair already have been dating for several weeks, people reveals in its latest cover story, on newsstands friday. 

"he's a lovely guy," says his friend and former flame, london socialite lady victoria hervey. "a gentleman. simple things, like opening doors, he does all that. he'll think of the woman before himself." the 6-foot-tall former boxer and construction worker has shown up in ads for christian dior and jean paul gaultier, but he may be best known for a british commercial he starred in for levi's, in which he plays a drowned fisherman with three mermaids desperately after him and his jeans. 

sculfor and aniston were first spotted out together over memorial day weekend, when they had an intimate dinner at santa monica's one pico restaurant in the shutters hotel. the pair slipped into the beachfront eatery with sculfor gently rubbing aniston's back as they waited for a table. 

single since she split from vince vaughn last year after more than a year together, aniston, 38, has taken her time getting back on the dating scene. sculfor, meanwhile, formerly dated lisa snowdon (yes, george clooney's ex) for two years. 

when it comes to relationships, sculfor, who now lives in los angeles and is under contract with new york model management, once told britain's the mirror: "it's hard keeping a girlfriend in this business – you end up conducting your relationship on the phone."

tony tells carrie he needs a time-out!





it looks like carrie underwood is joining the ranks of the football widows club! the american idol winner was recently told by her beau, dallas cowboy quarterback tony romo, that he needed a break from september to january 2008 in order to focus on his game!  “tony loves carrie, but football is the no. 1 priority in his life right now,” says a source. 

could it be because the san diego native, 27, was razzed last year for not being on the ball after falling for carrie? the two met when she performed the “star-spangled banner” during the cowboys thanksgiving game in 2006, but he called things off in february.  after carrie was linked with actor jesse metcalfe and singer oli-t., tony won her back.  this time, tony’d better have a ring ready, warns a source!

paris in prison day 2






tmz has multiple inside sources who have painted a bleak picture of day # 2 in the slammer. in three words, "paris is scared."
paris has been crying on the phone, saying she's not sleeping or eating. paris says her cell is "freezing cold." she has three little blankets and no pillow. she's using one of the blankets as a pillow. the room is bright and jail noise echoes through her space. 

sleep isn't the only problem. paris says she has no appetite and has eaten almost nothing. 

inmates actually struck up a chant when paris went back to her cell earlier today. as she walked by they struck up a chorus, "paris! paris! paris!" we're told she smiled and waved. some inmates have been coming up to her cell door, mostly to say hi. one inmate said, "you don't deserve to be here." another made an origami butterfly from a magazine page and slipped it under her door. another slipped a drawing book under her door. the guards, paris says, have all been nice.

she's called her lawyer and family, but found it really hard to talk because there's a recording, "you have one minute left. this call is being recorded."

over again.......jessica and john!





jessica simpson and john mayer have ended their romance – again, and this time for good. possibly. "it has been rocky and it had been rocky, and it reached the end of the road," a source close to mayer said. "it is definitely over – the relationship has ended." 

those on simpson's side confirm that the romance has come to an end, but say the door is always open for the pair to reunite. "they broke up sunday night, but who knows what the future will hold," says a simpson source. "this is the twelfth time they've broken up. their relationship is volatile. last week they felt better than ever. this week, things are rocky. who knows what the future will bring. " 

simpson, 26, and mayer, 29, have been together about a year, though were coy about the relationship until recently. just last month, the couple split, but then only days later appeared to have reconciled after a heavy round of emailing and talking.

"they tried to make it work. they dated for a year," says the mayer source, who adds that the couple's time together in new york and more recently in cabo san lucas, mexico were an attempt "to talk things over." but that was then. now, says the source: "it's over." 

simpson's pal says the singer is "used to" the back and forth with mayer by now. "she love [john] but she has to be true to herself." as for any reason's behind this most recent split: "every relationship has its differences, but with jessica and john those differences were starting to become more and more apparent," says the mayer source.

heidi & spencer's engagement for $$?





celebrity babylon has issued a report that the engagement between heidi montag and spencer pratt, from mtv's laguna beach, is bogus and that they are just in it for the money.
celebrity babylon has learned exclusively that the engagement between pratt, 23, and montag, 20, is a fake, as fake as montag's new chest! "it's an arrangement that suits both of them," says an mtv insider, "they won't be walking down the aisle, they will go through the motions of planning a wedding, and then have a big break-up that will get lots of press. all caught on camera by photographers, of course." when news of the fake engagement broke last month, mtv issued a coy, "we do not comment on the personal lives of our stars." stars? what stars? a couple of young reality show goofs? we have exclusive video of photographers talking about the "set up" photos they arranged with the "engaged" couple! in the old studio system of hollywood, this sort of chicanery was common place, but in this day and age it is shocking -- but not unexpected!
i think the article hit the nail on the head...stars? what stars? if all i have to do to become a "star" for mtv is get some ridiculous implants and date a gay guy, i'm on my way to the plastic surgeon right now!

kat mcphee starts her decline




american idol hottie katherine mcphee has reportedly signed on to star in her first feature film. "the last caller" is an indie dark romantic comedy described as a coming-of-age story about a self-obsessed woman (mcphee) who seeks love, hope and meaning during some random events.
the film has a budget of $8 million and will begin shooting this fall in new york city. 
i love how american idol celebrities leapfrog into attempting to become "actors." i bet all the people that have devoted there life to acting love to be replaced by people off the street that got into american idol and have no acting experience whatsoever. my guess is that kat banged the casting director and agreed to a nude scene in the movie (probably the only worthwhile reason to see the movie). i must admit though, i am curious to see if kat will fall into all the normal hollywood syndromes and begin her stint of drinking, drug usage, rehab, drugs again, rehab again then finally anorexia.

vanessa minnillo's new pictures may hurt career!






the mystery brunette posing sexily with a knife at lindsay lohan's throat in  photos posted yesterday is  vanessa minnillo, who might have a hard time getting a new job because of the risqué party pictures.

one of the photos from last summer shows minnillo pulling down lohan's tank top. another shows her with face upturned, eyes closed and lips parted, as if about to kiss the wild child, who is now 20 and in rehab. minnillo, 26, was host of mtv's "trl" and new york correspondent for "entertainment tonight," both viacom shows, until her contract expired in april. the former date of derek jeter and current girlfriend of nick lachey did not renew with either show.


last week, she co-hosted the miss universe pageant in mexico city with mario lópez without incident. but the beauty is gaining a bad rep in the tv industry for her diva-like behavior at work and hard partying outside the studio.
while friends of minnillo insist it was she who decided not to renew the contract with "et," insiders say her bosses at cbs paramount soured on her when she covered the grammys in february. minnillo was not assigned to the academy awards in march.

when producers flew her to los angeles to cover the grammys, "she was extremely high maintenance," said one source. "she insisted they fly her own hair and makeup people and her personal assistant out with her every time she flew to l.a. she only flew first class and stayed at the four seasons, and then she didn't want to work.

"vanessa wants to be a celebrity, not interview them," said the source. "she wouldn't conduct post-show interviews because she wanted to party. she expected to be paid a full-time salary for a part-time job." page six spotted minnillo at one of the fall fashion shows changing seats for 15 minutes until she was satisfied. she's been known to bark orders at cocktail waitresses and cause scenes when she goes club hopping at night.

in april, page six reported that minnillo had moved in with lachey in los angeles, where she's hoping for a movie career.
a rep for minnillo denied any "diva behavior" and told page six, "she chose to leave 'et' because her contract ended. this is the first i've heard about any bad behavior."

kate and owen split!





kate hudson and owen wilson have broken up! "they're still friends," says the source, adding that the two split just before memorial day weekend. the cause of the breakup wasn't immediately known. 

wilson, 38, and hudson, 28, who starred together in 2006's you, me and dupree, recently had become increasingly open about a relationship that began quietly last fall and developed across many time zones. they were spotted strolling the beach in australia (where hudson was filming fool's gold with matthew mcconaughey), nuzzling at a santa monica restaurant, kissing at hudson's april 19 birthday in new york, and getting cozy on vacation in hawaii. 

last month, hudson joined wilson at the dallas premiere of his comedy the wendell baker story and stepped out with him at a party after the film's la premiere, where the couple held hands, stroked each other's backs and rocked out to classic rock tunes together.

vomit







britney spears was spotted over the weekend vacationing in puerto vallarta where she "accidentally" flashed her thong.
wtf? doesn't she own a mirror? at 24 your ass should not look like that. and the hair, yuck! i guess what sums this up is that you can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can't take the trailer park out of the girl.... no matter how much money you give her.
