“tcu is a lot of fun and they’re super welcoming. you come here and it’s like you
                           never left home.”

the tcu experience: what’s it really like?

it’s where you’ll only feel crowded at sporting events. it’s cheering for the frogs
                              just steps from where you learn and live. it’s having professors who know your name
                              and care about your future. it’s connecting with others and finding your place in
                              the world.becoming part of the horned frog family is your opportunity to dig deeper, live broader
                              and see further. it’s hard work. it’s new beginnings. and it’s seriously fun.
