welcome






"as far as i remember i thought of myself as a guitarist; it was something i was, not something i was to become. my family encouraged and nurtured every aspect of my artistic life.



concert schedule





since my birth, i have felt the guitar to have such a strong unifying force in our family that it impossible for me to imagine how i would have developed outside of my family. we have learned together, played together, lived together and become part of each other. i feel the presence of my father and the embrace of my brothers within the nurturing love of our mother in every fiber of my being in such a strong way that i am sure will continue to bring generations of romeros devoted to the service of music and the guitar."~ pepe romero, july 19th, 2008
