fishing report • april 24, 2024

the river is flowing at 357 c.f.s. water clarity is off color due to the lake turning and spring runoff. nymphing has been the way to go, along with throwing streamers. nymphing with attractors such as egg patterns, leeches, and crystal buggers, accompanied by midge larva, midge pupa, and beatis nymphs has been good. no dry fly fishing is available, due to water color. the streamer fishing has been fair using sink tip lines along with small crystal buggers (olive and black).

infectious
your knowledge, love and enthusiasm of fly fishing are infectious. thanks for your patience in teaching a clumsy leftie. your meticulous attention to making sure that i learned the correct way was impressive. i will enjoy this outdoor experience over the coming years so much more that i ever thought possible.

m. trujillo,
state of new mexico tourism department




first class
i can unequivocally say that you run a first class lodge…from the accommodations, to the fly shop, to the excellent meals. but most of all, the three guides that we as a group were lucky enough to get were the highlight of the weekend for us.

guest




well appointed
our room was very comfortable and well appointed, the food was damn good, and you and your staff made us feel most welcome. it was a great little trip.
