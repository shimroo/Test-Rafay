daniel r waskettwilkin & sons ltd. 






						having had issues in the past i am always hesitant to switch suppliers. however switching my packaging requirements to fieldpax was worth it. not only was the quality better at a cheaper price but the service i receive is unparalleled to others. highly recommended!					


yossi aronsonprime cut butchers ltd 






						i have used verti-pack for netting for quite a few years now. they are always extremely helpful with new projects.
