cabbage patch kid doll history

here's a little history on the cabbage patch kid doll. it was invented in 1976 

by xavier roberts. they were originally called 'little person' and all cabbage 

patch kid dolls were made by hand. xavier roberts started babyland general hospital 

where you could adopt a cabbage patch kid doll. in 1983 coleco toymaker started 

to mass-market with the name of

cabbage 

patch kids.  many variations and speciality types of cabbage patch kid 

doll came out that you could style their hair, feed, and pets like the horse 

were developed.  other sizes like cabbage patch kid preemie and cabbage 

patch kid babies came out as well.


american girl doll  background

the american girl doll is produced by pleasant company and features female 

characters from different historical eras of american history, including 

revolutionary war, world war, native american, and immigrants.  all of my american girl doll clothes should also 

fit other 18" dolls such as our generation.  i use an our generation doll 

as a model for my handmade



american girl doll clothes, and use her measurements as i design new doll 

clothes.

the bitty baby doll is also produced by pleasant company and features female 

characters from different historical eras.  they also produce the



bitty twins doll and the 

hopscotch hill doll as well, and i have begun to design clothes for them.  all of my
