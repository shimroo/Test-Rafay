i‚Äôm so happy my son‚Äôs school decided to choose visual image photography. his school pictures came in a beautiful booklet that can also be saved for keepsake. the photographers that came to the school were very nice and helpful too. i will definitely recommend this photography company to others.camille m., parent
i just ordered banners for the seniors on my son‚Äôs soccer team. not only do they look awesome, they were shipped to me in 2 days. i highly recommend them.

we had a great experience with our son‚Äôs senior pictures at vip in cedarburg; from becky who set up our session and answered all our questions, to the amazing photographer steve. my son is not a fan of having his picture taken, and steve was so good at making him comfortable! the pictures turned out amazing, we couldn‚Äôt have asked for better service all around. thank you!
jenine r., parent
wonderful experience at vip! new facility is nice and love the new location! staff is warm, welcoming, and extremely professional. my senior daughter enjoyed working with ava. ava took her time photographing and put care into every shot she took. excited to see the results! thank you vip for a great experience.

we had our senior photo session a few days after they opened. it was really quick and efficient. we arrived and soon after my daughter was off for her session. she didn‚Äôt have a wardrobe change but we had a gown add on. the new place is clean with good ambiance. there were couches for parents to sit on and wait. we recently received the link for the photos and are very happy with how they turned out. all in all a great experience!

highly recommend vip vernon hills location. we booked my son‚Äôs senior pictures here and they did an excellent job! the facility is fresh and new with a lot of natural light. the photographer was friendly and engaging and my 17 year old said it was fun! will definitely use in the future for full family photos.

we did my daughter‚Äôs senior photos here and it was such a great experience. the studio is huge and the staff is super friendly and helpful. love that the changing rooms have extra supplies to touch up if you need (i.e. hair spray, bobby pins, etc.) the turnaround time on the proofs was also incredibly fast and can‚Äôt wait to see the final product. highly recommend this studio.

i decided to do some dance poses for part of my senior pictures and my photographer was determined to get the perfect pictures. i wanted a picture of me doing a leap and she did not move on to the next pose until she got the best shot of the leap üôÇ very happy i decided to book with vip!!

as the yearbook advisor of wauconda high school, i can say that visual image photography, inc is a joy to work with. their photographers go out of their way to make sure the photos taken are what we, the customer, want. they go above and beyond to make sure to get the best shots. the customer service aspect of vip is amazing. i telephoned at 6 pm on a tuesday night with a request and had an answer and access to the information i needed within a half-hour. another time, there was a scheduling change made by my school that i was not aware of until the night of the event, and our customer service representative came out herself personally to shoot the event because she was available. very few other companies i have ever worked with have provided the customer with such attention and care. everyone at vip goes out of their way to make sure our school is completely taken care of in every aspect from events to sports to senior portraits. i would recommend vip to any school.

wheaton park district turned to visual image photography when we had a bad experience with another company and have never looked back. we first started with our baseball/softball program. they did such a great job that travel soccer, football, cheer, lacrosse, dance recital, swim team, and preschool have also signed on with vip. they are professional, friendly, flexible and excellent photographers. i highly recommend visual image photography to anyone looking for a photography company.
ms. oppenheim, wheaton park district recreation operations manager
when i took over as the director of student activities six years ago we contracted services of three different photography vendors to cover different events. the quality of vip‚Äôs product and services stood out above and beyond those of the other vendors we were working with. noticing the great quality and superior customer service i consolidated all services to vip. switching to vip has been one of the best decisions i have made. i have never fielded a complaint, i have only received compliments. in addition to their superior quality, their customer service is amazing. they are very proactive and supportive of any ideas or suggestions. i look forward to continuing the relationship that stevenson has built with vip for many more years.
