    guided winter rafting on the jordan river

we begin our adventure at graves crossing in the wild and scenic jordan river. you are safely placed into a white water-style raft along with your guide. we gently float down the river, observing the natural beauty that the jordan river valley has to offer.
 see wildlife on your adventure

many on these trips have spotted beavers, river otters, whitetail deer, merganser ducks, red foxes, and many other types of wildlife including the occasional sighting of an american bald eagle or two. the guide controls your raft, so you are free to take pictures and enjoy the sounds and scenery. at the halfway point, you will tie off and enjoy a hot drink and a treat. this is a good time to chat with your guide, your companions, or perhaps with a few new friends that you just met. family-friendly rates are available for children 12 years and under.
