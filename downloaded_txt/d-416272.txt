our carbon footprint

hello. we're teresa petrykowski and sterling udell, and
          this is our home.
        


          we originally began fulltime rving in august 2002 but had to return
          to a more stationary existence after only a couple of years. we never
          gave up hope that we would be able to return to the road, and eventually
          in october 2012 we succeeded.
        

          the tale begins here.
          you can follow our travels, and look at the photographs we've taken
          along the way, by following the links below.
		

          note: since we've returned, we've started
          redesigning this website. as you navigate around, you'll still find
          remnants of the original 2002 design. the archived entries will remain
          in the old format, but the rest of the site will be in a state of flux
          until the new appearance is finalized, and implemented throughout.
