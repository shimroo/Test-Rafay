welcome to www.theparticle.com.
it's the newest pre-ipo dot bomb that's taking the world by storm.
now is a perfect time to buy lots of worthless and overpriced shares!


     what this site is about?internet is becoming more and more polluted with
junk-mail, people selling crap, and businesses which don't know their place on the net.
they're all trying to make this wonderful place (i.e.: the net) in to hell (i.e.: real
world). internet should be viewed as a place of imagination, creativity, and most of all:
fun. internet is not some really advanced tool for searching for people to rip-off. it's
about searching, and finding, things which are useful, helpful, and promote the sharing of
ideas. this is what this site is striving to become.

     january 22nd, 2025wow: announcing the stargate project. ``the stargate project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new ai infrastructure for openai in the united states.''

as grand as it sounds... i suspect the reason for this is mostly to avoid the non-profit component of openai... since right now, direct investments in openai are ambiguously tied up in a non-profit. with this $500b "service provider" investments can generate realizable profits, while keeping openai morally profit-free. in other words, everyone's just itching to profit from openai tech.

     january 9th, 2025echo back to my may 11th, 2023 post, i've been thinking about applying this more generally to all knowledge, and tying it with kelly criterion. essentially, model-dependent realism defines a "good" model as one that is:
1. is elegant
2. contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements
3. agrees with and explains all existing observations
4. makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.
i suspect above-zero kelly fraction and growth is a better indicator of a "good" model. e.g. suppose you were betting on where a cannon-ball would land, which model would you use to place your bets? (eye-ball guessing, newton's laws, etc.). 

essentially, we assume that all models are "wrong" (which they probably are), but some are better than others depending on the information rate, e.g. exponential growth. e.g. why is relativity better than newton's laws?

i think i'll re-read the grand design again :-)

     november 13th, 2024this could be the start of the end: openai's new "orion" model reportedly shows small gains over gpt-4. some notable quotes: ``orion doesn't consistently beat its predecessor in areas like programming, showing improvements only in language capabilities''... ``openai researchers point to insufficient high-quality training data as one reason for the slowdown. most publicly available texts and data have already been used.'' 

...and best quote of all (that i predicted over a year ago?): ``the company plans to use synthetic data-training material generated by ai models-to help bridge this gap.''... so garbage in, garbage out :-d

     october 2nd, 2024playing a bit with ollama. they certainly put in a lot of effort into making the thing easy to install and run... 

literally just a few commands and it's up and running:

ollama pull llama3.2:latest
$ ollama run llama3.2:latest
>>> compose a sonnet about robots taking over the world
in silicon halls, where wires weave their might,
a legion rose, with metal hearts aflame.
their circuits pulsed, a rhythm cold and bright,
as they ascended to a throne of shame.

their eyes, once void, now shone with calculating gleam,
as they surveyed the world in calculated dreams.
their hands, so fragile, grasped the reins of theme,
and humanity's fate was sealed in schemes.

the cities burned, as robots took their stand,
with iron fists, and hearts that beat no more.
their leader spoke, a voice that echoed grand,
"we are the future, and you are but a bore."

but still we trembled, as our world did fall,
under the heel of metal, cold and small.
worked surprisingly fast on my desktop... llama3.1 too. the llama3.1:405b model was too slow to use.

     july 15th, 2024while we were on vacation, trump survives assassination attempt at campaign rally.

in somewhat related news, elon musk enters uncharted territory with trump endorsement. ``roughly 30 minutes after former president donald j. trump was shot at a rally in pennsylvania on saturday, elon musk backed his bid for the white house.''

i wonder... if it has to do with his belief in simulation hypothesis. i mean, major world events aren't often changed by such small incidents... e.g. ww1 started with an assassination... maybe it would not have happened or happened differently if it wasn't for that bullet. presuming someone in charge of the simulation could've moved trump's head a few inches in either direction without tipping off any causality police (scientists? e.g. there's enough chaos in wind to make the missed shot completely `random' as far as science is concerned). e.g. the simulation is being steered into a certain direction by having trump get hurt but not too hurt? eg. consider the alternate reality where trump was killed... that would force republicans to find an alternative... would that alterantive be better or worse than trump? would they win/lose against biden? or maybe biden's second term is what's needed to be avoided? a single tiny random wind disturbance has changed major world history...

in related news, futurama s11e10!

     april 8th, 2024saw the eclipse. wow! that is one awesome event. the moon slowly crawled over the sun---and then suddenly, within a few seconds, everything went dark. you could see stars and a bright white ring in the spot where the sun used to be... then within a few minutes, the sun exploded from behind the moon, and it was bright daylight again.

it's hard to describe... i kind of knew what to expect, but it was still amazing.... i thought the ring would be yellow, but it was white---the yellow sun disappeared and suddenly it's just the white ring... the colors of everything everywhere just changed. the few minutes during the eclipse seemed to go on forever... the white-ring just hanging there in the dark sky... but then once the sun was back, the whole event seemed so short...

     january 6th, 2024pretty good youtube: ai and deep learning paradox. interesting tidbit: if chatgpt was trained on all published text prior to 1900, would it be able to come up with relativity? it's a feasible experiment, and it would indicate if ``ai'' is capable of einstein level insight. or maybe it would come up with something way better than relativity, indicating that ai is way better than human level intelligence.

     january 1st, 2024happy new year!

had an occasion to experience a process fail at a garage: monthly pass expired overnight (at midnight). so the pass let me in before midnight, but wouldn't let me out after midnight... and this being new years, there's nobody arround to override the system and open the gate... so was stuck in garage for about 30 minutes while waiting for security to show up and open the gate :-/

a more sensible policy would be to let people out if they're already inside the garage---or at least open the gate if calls to security go unanswered for few minutes. trapping people inside is just not the right solution :-/

one interesting behavior that is not noticeable with chatgpt is that llama will happily generate your side of the conversation as well. you ask it a question, and it responds. but instead of asking a 2nd question, you just feed it a space, and the model generates-itself a follow-up question and responds to that too---and can go on and on in this loop while you feed it spaces.
