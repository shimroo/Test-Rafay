aqueous technologies













aqueous technologies, established in 1992, specializes in the manufacturing of cleaning and cleanliness testing systems for the electronics assembly industry. aqueous technologies’ equipment utilizes our planet's purest substance, water, for the removal of harmful ionic residues. it is our mission to continue developing environmentally conscious equipment which assists manufacturers with increasing product reliability. we continue our effort to "make the world a better place". just a few short years ago, we introduced zero discharge defluxing / cleaning systems. today, our zero discharge cleaning systems save both water and energy, reducing our industry's environmental impact.
