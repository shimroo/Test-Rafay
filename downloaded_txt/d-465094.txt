★★★★★
professional team of agents
ryan was an absolute pleasure to deal with. he’s extremely professional and zero percent pushy. he went far beyond what he had to do for us to find our property. if it weren’t for him and his relentless efforts, we would have never found and bought our lot.

fantastic to work with!
we love the lemmon team!! rand & eric were fantastic to work with. we had to move pretty quickly for work and they basically sold our home before we even listed it! they took care of everything and were always just a phonecall away for any questions we had. you won’t regret working with them!
