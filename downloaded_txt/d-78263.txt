quentin tarantino on joker: subversion on a massive level

            posted january 14, 2022


quentin tarantino speaking about the joker character (but paraphrasing a bit for clarity's sake):it's not just suspenseful, it's not just riveting and exciting ... the director subverts the audience because the joker's a fucking nut ... yet while the audience in the movie theater is watching the joker they wanted him to kill robert de niro's character. they want him to take that gun and stick it in his eye and blow the back of his fucking head off. and if the joker didn't kill him you would be pissed off. that is subversion on a massive level.
