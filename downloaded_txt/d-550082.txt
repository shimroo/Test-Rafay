about me
if we lose hope and just get used to seeing the gop walk away with victories in the gubernatorial and congressional elections, there would never be a change.
we have to realise that we are fighting not just for us but for our children and their children also. our steps to increase our voter base may seem trivial and irrelevant in the long run but its only through slow accumulation that a major change can be brought about.
so, we need to continue working and realise that our efforts are not going in vain but would eventually lead to better results.

the reason for me to start this website was the desire to have our voices heard. very often, a democrat living in a committed republican state could feel unwanted and think of his vote as useless. analysts too could simply ignore our views as irrelevant to the larger political battle.











changes to nominating process
the 2016 presidential elections for the democratic party, when seen in a retrospect, was a disaster.
while at the time, it didnâ€™t seem like a complete chaos, the smooth road to nomination for hillary clinton was roughened up by a spirited challenge from senator bernie sanders and an ongoing enquiry into her use of personal email servers for official mails.
both challenges initially didnâ€™t seem to amount to much but they turned out to be far more annoying and disrupting than expected.

new era in idaho politics
if the democratic candidate for governor in idaho records a victory in the gubernatorial elections, history would be created. paulette jordan would become the first native-american to become governor of a state in the country.
the 38-year old politicianâ€™s heritage includes ancestry from the coeur dâ€™alene, sinkiuse-columbia, nez perce and yakama tribe.
