old west & civil war era leatherworking


saddles, gun holsters & more
thank you for coming to carrico’s leatherworks. most of the items which we offer are standard items from the civil war, indian war, or old west eras. if you desire a different style, color, or size, please let me know.
please understand that this equipment is handmade not mass produced. please allow time for this. if i have it made and in stock, i will ship it promptly. however, most items take 6 to 8 weeks for delivery.
i use the equipment that i build. i know what needs to be durable and comfortable as well as historically accurate as possible. in this hobby, you will find or have found that there are those who sell horse tack and know nothing about it or make tack that is shoddy in workmanship or passed off as accurate for the period. please ask for references, compare and ask questions before you buy. you will be glad that you did.

i look forward to the opportunity to serve you.
sincerely,
david carrico
