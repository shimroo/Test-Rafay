my name is john tefteller-i have been buying and selling rare phonograph records for the past 35 years. i have a worldwide reputation for my knowledge of rare records, especially blues 78's. 
my personal collection contains some of the rarest records on the planet. my auctions in discoveries magazine featured some 
  of the rarest records on the planet. many have sold for "record" 
  prices. for top quality records, no one can top the world's rarest 
    records!
 i have the world's largest inventory of blues, rhythm & blues and rock & roll 78's with over 75,000 in stock. i also have a fabulous selection of over 100,000 45's from the 1950's and early 1960's in the following categories: blues, rhythm & blues, rockabilly, rock & roll, girl groups, surf and country. 
 i am always interested in buying more rare records! i will pay top dollar for your rare blues and rhythm & blues 45's and 78's in near mint condition. before you sell your rare records to anyone, you should at least talk to me. i consistently pay the highest prices for records for my collection and am more than fair when buying for resale.
