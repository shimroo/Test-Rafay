was with lightspeed for 2 years before moving provinces. support competition in telecoms and consider them or another reseller. they are far cheaper than the main telcos for the same... read more product and i always had great support when needed. bringing your own modem is a nice feature too to ensure you aren't getting a dud. no hidden fees or price increases at all. would happily go back to lightspeed if they serve my area

great internet service at a great price, and local customer support which provides excellent service.

i've been with lightspeed for a few years and i really have nothing to complain about, unlike the larger companies. i've always received exactly what i'm paying for (speeds/unlimited data)... read more and have never recieved any increase in billing. their office is efficient and easy to deal with whenever i've needed to make changes too. i would never go back to the big companies again. highly recommend lightspeed!

 mikhail lenzen 




i've been with internet lightspeed for a year and a half and couldn't be happier. i've never had a problem with the service and when i've had questions, they get... read more back to me within 24 hours. their agents and technicians are based in burnaby so you are not talking with someone in another part of the world. 100% better than dealing with the big communication companies who's customer service is non-existent, plus i'm paying a third what they charge. kudos!

this company processed my new service without delay .i had a small billing issue which was resolved upon calling their accounts department.  self installation worked correctly				
 terry moorby 




i have been with this company for many years (not sure exactly how long but i do believe it to be at least 5 years).  the service they provided... read more has always been very reliable. not only they have never raise my cost, they reduced it by a good $10 per month when they came out with new promotion for better deal for new sign up.  they have always provided me with courteous, speedy (instant) and satisfactory service whenever i had the need to contact them.

lightspeed has excellent staff from sales, to customer service to tech support. the follow up service is so strong. they listen to you, they do their work perfectly and contact... read more you once and twice. they look for the details and they want to be sure you as a customer is totally satisfied. their satisfaction to clients is practical. thanks sal from tech support for the extra miles you did and your patience to fix the issue i was facing.

great service so far (switched a few months ago from shaw). can't notice the difference in speed and the customer service is better and more responsive. highly recommend you save... read more some money on internet with these folks. switching didn't require a on-site visit for my location, just plug in the modem they sent on the switch over-day and basically zero downtime.

i cant believe that it was so easy to start a new internet services by phone. thank you for all your help.

 dann soloman 




dependable, affordable unlimited internet without the needless, seldom-used bells and whistles of the big name providers. been with them for four years. one major interruption when a cross-country fibre optic... read more cable was taken out by a landslide. the odd temporary interruption when shaw (the provider they resell) suffered a local outage (would have happened anyway if we were still with shaw). i've never once considered switching. excellent price, same basic product without the big-boy usage cap to try to force you into purchasing an even higher-priced package.

i've been using internet lightspeed for many years now. i have had very few issues, and they are generally solved very efficiently. technical support has always been helpful and friendly.... read more and the price is really good!

my daughter and her mom had switched to lightspeed.ca and suggested that i do the same when my shaw contract expired which it did.  i tried to get shaw... read more to renew my contract for another two years at the same price which was higher than lightspeed but i figured it would be less hassle to just continue with them.  they refused so i gave them my one month notice that i would not renew my contract.  i contacted lightspeed and took their plan but made sure there was overlap in case of issues. i only had one issue. the first modem that lightspeed sent me turned out to be defective.  they sent me a second one pronto. it was here fast is 3 working days.  i still had my shaw to use in the meantime.  lightspeed got shaw to provision my new modem on the day i received it and i was up and running with about 10% faster speed than i am supposed to get.  no complaints about this! their technical department was very helpful.  although i'm a new customer, my daughter and her mother have been with lightspeed for over nine months with no issues of any kind including outages.  they swear by lightspeed and all of the money they have saved so far.  i look forward to a long relationship with lightspeed.

way more affordable than the other options out there.  no issues really, sometime connection is weak on my phone but that was the case with shaw previously.  decent... read more tech support and the sales people are nice.  moved my service recently, pretty seamless process.  i would recommend in an urban area like vancouver, not sure how it would perform in rural areas. 
 xavier sandoval 




lightspeed internet is high quality in calgary, ab. best price for the low-to-mid tiers they offer, and it's good to support non-monopolistic businesses as much as possible. their tech support... read more is knowledgeable and helpful; as an advanced computer user, it's always a pleasure to phone them (which is very rare). would recommend! 
 parker link 




great customer service and reliable tech support. great for people with standard needs for an internet connection such as home office, streaming, and regular downloads. great value overall.				
 alvaro flores 




very happy to have switched from shaw years ago. we use the cable connection to lightspeed.  the price, speed, and quality is very good. we just moved houses and... read more the switchover was painless. we disconnected the router as the last thing before we left the old address. lightspeed arranged for shaw to come and ensure we had service at the new address on the next day when  we moved in. they arrived at 8:15 and we had internet through lightspeed at 8:30am.  it was very smooth.
