it doesn't take to much historical or political memory or sensibility to understand that we are in a period not only of viruses (covid19) but also of a new authoritarianism that tries to streamline politics, media, economics and culture productions in an endless loop of repeating interconnectivity that produces rather isolated subjects to be quarantined.

9. rainer ganahl’s “please, teach me chinese / please, teach me italian — marx a prato / gucci a prato” at mx gallery 
artist rainer ganahl updates his “commes des marxists” fashion show, which first appeared at white columns in 2013, at lower manhattan’s mx gallery. the fashion performance, which features clothing printed with chinese and italian text, was originally slated to appear in the italian city of prato, which is home to a large population of migrant chinese workers. but museum officials interrupted the show after discovering that ganahl’s work highlighted the sometimes violent clashes between the city’s chinese and italian populations. now, ganahl is reprising the work for one night at a gallery that’s fittingly situated in a part of chinatown that was previously known as little italy.
location: mx gallery, 167 canal street, fifth floor
