what are people saying about us?






"can't say enough good things about my experience with charley's guitar shop. i took my old alvarez for repair of the original electronics. i expected to drop it off and come back in a week or two, but bryant stopped what he was doing and got right to it, right before my eyes. i got an education as well as a repair, and at a very reasonable price. when i need guitar work, this is where i will be going."








 "fantastic place to visit and play a guitar you might love. very knowledgeable staff and some great amps too. some vintage and some new choices to pick from including fender custom shop. a must visit if you love a 6 string."








"i purchased a vintage takamine from here a couple weeks ago. every time i pick it up i fall in love with it all over again lol.  seriously though, it was cleaned up and professionally set up by their awesome techs when it arrived.  there are always amazing treasures you can find at this shop... not to mention the good folks who know what they're talking about that work here."








"to me this place is like an old barber shop. you can hang here and talk for hours! great old store with a great old vibe! lots of history here."








"great people. can't state this strongly enough. they were all great. expert knowledge and took the time to just talk guitars and music and swap stories. selection was really varied with some unbelievable finds and a store full of great deals. worth the drive from wherever you are in north texas. and yes, i purchased to awesome guitars there my first visit!"








"i came in from out of town to have work done on one of my guitars this weekend. the work was completed in record time and the charge was very reasonable.  i was amazed at the high level of customer service and overall professionalism of everyone who i met at the shop.  a sincere thank you to all at charley's, you are now my go-to for my repair needs!"








"came here for a guitar set up. caleb did a fantastic job on my jazz master. had never felt this smooth before! will definitely be back. highly recommend."








"bryant completed a neck reset on my martin, the only reset i've had on this guitar since i bought it new from charley's in '89.  he did a great job!  the neck is straight and true.  bryant is obviously very experienced, capable and he showed me he cares about his craftsmanship through his work on my guitar.  he was really patient while i tried the guitar out and gave him feedback to set up the action just to my liking.  he also turned me on to a polish he uses in his shop, which i've now used with great satisfaction on my guitars.  i feel really good about having bryant take care of my martin."








"charley’s is a great local guitar shop.  the guys that make charley’s a jewel to experience are all helpful and experienced in the world of stringed instruments."








"these guys helped me set up a 50-year-old bass guitar. they did so well by me that i just brought another one. a lot of outstanding -- very high quality used guitars , basses, amps ... but they stand behind everything and will make it right. thoroughly enjoyed going there."








"you will find the knowledge and the expertise  to move your projects foreword. they are about helping the musicians. they have the gear that the working guitarist want and need. that my friends that is lacking in the chain stores. their repair center is the best there is. i will not  take my guitars any place else. from a setup to a neck reset, they're the only ones i trust."








"legendary guitar store known to every famous rocker ever to play in texas, though charley died decades back. i’ve bought guitars, banjos, and mandolins here for twenty years and have never been let down or disappointed. the resident luthier, bryant, has fixed all sorts of guitar problems for me over the years. the owners are honest, caring, helpful, and absolutely expert when it comes to stringed instruments, acoustic or electric. the inventory varies, so prepare for surprises."








"best place in town to get your guitars worked on. bryant russell is a living legend! he gave my tele a full setup with a bone nut replacement in under an hour. pro!"








"guitar heaven. great guys with a big heart always hooking up starving musicians with no-charge extras. perfect repairs and an exotic collection of electrical and acoustic guitars, amplifiers, pedals, and if you stick around you will probably catch a really good story or two.6 stars"








"if you want run of the mill, go to guitar center. if you want products that pros really want, you go to a local guitar store like charley's. coming from nyc, i miss having so many choices for local smaller guitar stores. there are literally none in dallas, just like everything else in tx mostly chain stores. charley's is a quality local business thats been there for a while for good reason. brian is awesome, and had a great chat with him the first time visiting his store. they actually had a guitar pickup i wanted where other stores don't usually carry."








"part of texas' historical music scene. this is where dimebag darrell abbott, stevie ray and jimmy vaughan, bugs henderson, lance lopez and countless other well known top notch axe slingers bought and had their stuff repaired. if it ever closes the city needs to erect a historical marker. service, merchandise and prices are still the best in texas!"
