types of products





non-metallic gaskets non-metallic gaskets are manufactured with non-asbestos material or compressed asbestos fibre (caf). usually composite sheet materials are used with flat face flanges and low pressure class applications. non-asbestos types includes arimid fibre, glass fibre, elastomer, ptfe and flexible graphite.





semi-metallic gaskets semi-metallic gaskets are composites of metal and non-metallic materials. the metal offers strength and resiliency while the non-metallic flexible portion provides conformability and sealability. commonly used semi-metallic are spiral wound, metal jacketed,rubber with metallic insert ,ptfe envelop & flexible graphite with metallic insert,etc.





metallic gaskets metallic gasket is fabricated from one or more combination of metal to the desired shape and size. it is suitable for high-pressure and temperature applications and require high bolt load to seal. common metallic gasket used is ring-joint gaskets, lens rings, corrugated gaskets & metal grooved gaskets,etc.
