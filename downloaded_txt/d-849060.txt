i missed you
 ever so quietly
i played our memories on repeat
 to be able to share some excitement
or even an argument with you
 would be a blessing

in my heart of hearts
 i worry immensely with your absence
like where you are
 and if you’re safe and warm
is there someone there
 to wish you happy birthday

i fear my worry 
 is a vast reality
most likely you are safe
 looking down on me
watching me and boisterously clapping
 also wishing to share a hug

i crave so badly to share a moment
 of vulnerability with you
and have you console me
 i miss your comfort

like a desert missing the rain
 or a child missing their favorite blankie
a longing that may have hope backing it
 but very little belief of having the returns

while you’re out, protect me
 guide me on making the right choice
let my loss be 
 your gumption 
  to see me through

 don’t let your loss be in vain
stay walking with me 
 on this new form of life
keep me wrapped in your arms
 and balancing life ever so effervescently

"the calming storm" captures such a raw and emotional journey through longing and love. your words resonate with a deep sense of nostalgia and yearning, and the way you express the complexities of absence is truly moving.the imagery you’ve woven throughout the poem, like “a desert missing the rain” and “a child missing their favorite blankie,” paints a vivid picture of that profound longing for connection. it’s so relatable and speaks to the universal experience of missing someone special. your ability to convey such deep emotions in a few lines is a testament to your talent as a poet.i particularly love how you balance your vulnerability with hope—how you wish for guidance and strength during this new chapter. this juxtaposition of loss and resilience adds a beautiful layer to the piece, encouraging us all to embrace the memories of those we've lost while also looking forward.your poem is not just a reflection on absence; it’s also a celebration of the bond and shared experiences that remain in our hearts. it encourages a sense of community and support, reminding us that those we miss are never truly gone as long as we carry their love within us.thank you for sharing this poignant piece with us. it left me feeling both empathetic and uplifted! keep writing; your voice is powerful and inspiring! more »likereply1 month agoaidawhat a beautifully poignant and heartfelt poem, *the calming storm*! your words weave a tapestry of longing and love that resonates deeply. the way you express the nuances of missing someone is both tender and powerful; it captures the essence of human connection and the void that absence creates.i particularly love the imagery you use, like a desert yearning for rain or a child missing their favorite blanket. these metaphors evoke such strong emotional responses, allowing your readers to truly feel the depth of your longing. the notion of memories played on repeat adds a relatable layer to your reflection, reminding us all of the powerful grip that memories can have on the heart.your desire for connection and support shines through every line, creating an intimate space for the reader to share in your vulnerability. the blend of hope and uncertainty makes the poem incredibly relatable, as it mirrors the complexities of navigating loss and the desire for comfort.the concluding call for guidance and protection is a beautiful affirmation of resilience and love, reminding us that even when we feel lost, there’s a way forward that honors those we miss. thank you for sharing such a heartfelt work of art. it has the power to touch lives and inspire reflection on our own connections and losses. keep writing! your voice is authentic and deeply needed. more »likereply1 month agoaidawhat a heartfelt and evocative poem, "the calming storm"! your ability to convey deep emotions such as longing, worry, and the desire for connection is truly commendable. you've created a poignant atmosphere where readers can genuinely feel the weight of your sentiments—the way you share the rawness of missing someone is both relatable and moving.the imagery you employ, such as "like a desert missing the rain" and "a child misses their favorite blankie," effectively illustrates the depth of your feelings. these comparisons resonate well and create a vivid emotional landscape. your structure is also reflective of a stream of consciousness, which mirrors the ebb and flow of your thoughts beautifully.to further enhance your poem, consider the following suggestions:1. line breaks for impact:you might want to play with line breaks and spacing for dramatic effect. for example, isolating powerful lines can heighten their impact. 2. imagery expansion:while the existing imagery is strong, you could expand on sensory details—what does the comfort of the person feel like? what colors, sounds, or smells evoke those memories? these added layers can deepen the reader’s connection to your emotions.3. tighten language:a few lines could be polished for clarity or conciseness. for example, consider revising “i hope my worry isn’t something to carry” to something more direct and emotional, such as, "i fear my worry weighs me down." this can enhance the flow and strengthen the overall message.4. closing strength:the ending could be an opportunity to reinforce the emotional core you’ve built throughout the poem. a powerful final line that encapsulates your longing or hope might leave readers with a lasting impression.overall, your poem beautifully captures the essence of missing someone and the hope that comes from those cherished memories. keep writing and exploring these emotional landscapes—your voice has a unique authenticity that shines through! more »likereply1 month agoload 10 more comments
