news

2017-05-20.  volume 3 of 67% inertia posted.  
2016-09-19.  not quite a year has passed.  i posted translations for volume 1 and 2 of 67% inertia.  see the 67 percent inertia site.

  2015-11-23.  here is dogs: bullets and carnage volume 9.
2015-11-04.  my how time flies.  have chapters 10 through 15 if you are interested.
2015-05-16.  been a while.  i started translating 67% inertia and have put up a translation of the first 9 chapters via bittorrent.
2012/04/15 (a bit later) i have hells angels volume 1 and hells angels volume 2 downloads in torrent form up now.  i was sure that i had translated volume 3, but i can only find the first chapter of it.  if you have more of what i translated than i do, please drop me an email (fugu at this domain.)  
2012/04/15 i have been doing a bit more translation (dogs: bullets and carnage mostly) and decided that i want to clean up this website a bit.  looking around, it is in terrible shape.  links are dead, torrents aren't seeded.  i'll try to fix some of that up.  looking through old data, i found out that i have actually lost some translations over time.  so that really is unfortunate.  still, i'll do my best to clean up and make clear download links (that are seeded) for what i can recover and do have.
2011/07/03 huh, i've been remiss in updating this page.  try the forums for more up-to-date info.  
2009/10/12 pretty cool site looking at an amazingly comprehensive history of fan translation: inside scanlation.  i'm really impressed with how in-depth the coverage and history is.  man, the internet is full of all sorts of stuff.  if you have some spare time and any sort of interest, check it out.  there is also a short interview with me.  which reminds me, october 16th, 2001 will be the 8th anniversary of mangatranslation.com.  i guess i should get off my butt and try to get a translation of something out to celebrate.
2009/09/23 not dead yet.  haven't had time for translating recently, but planning to get back into the game soonish.

2005/10/16 web page re-design.  basically i just made some stuff in css, and added some info on project status.  also, i added links to hells angels.  i am going to think about moving this site over to a cms system, but it will probably stay like this for a while.
2005/09/08 dogs: bullets and carnage chapters 2 and 3 translations released via bittorrent.  first release from japan.  
2005/05/xx at some point when i wasn't paying close attention, omanga and kotonoha put out the complete smuggler manga that i helped them translated.  in other news, i've moved away from new york.
2005/04/13 kotonoha, omanga, and mangatranslation.com team up to bring you the second chapter of smuggler, and vorbis, the editor at omanga, has done a very nice re-edited version of chapter 1 of smuggler. 
2005/03/07 kotonoha has released smuggler chapter 1, a dark action/drama piece about a regular joe who falls into the dark underworld of japan.  you can pick up a torrent here or get further information from kotonoha here.  i translated the first chapter, and kotonoha did all the heavy lifting (scanning, cleaning, editing, distribution.)  
2005/02/09 i turned the gallery off pretty much for good.  there is a link to moyism's tenjo tenge gallery, and you can still use the mangatranslation.com gallery on the old server but that might go away in a few months.

    i have set up a few torrent links to make it easier to find some of the harder-to-find stuff.  naked star: west side street (a one-shot from the naked star compilation), naked star: s-song for sapphire star (another one-shot from the naked star compilation), and the december 2004 tjtg "omake" chapter starring dougen, which i doubt will ever make it over here.  finally, a torrent of all the capcom-gals chapters that i've translated to date.

2004/12/30 the cpu fan on fugu.cs.columbia.edu died, and took down mangatranslation.com with it.  i'll be moving mangatranslation.com over to a virtual private linux server at rimuhosting.com, so things should be back up shortly.  since i have to re-import the forum and gallery stuff, it might take a day or two.
2004/10/19 i've been busy, but here is a short one-off oh! great sci-fi manga from naked star or shyueisha's ultra jump megamix volume 1: s-song for sapphire star.  get it quick; it's a torrent, and i don't know how long i will seed it.  and listen to let's talk about spaceships by say hi to your mom while you read.  --fugu
2004/08/17 tenjo tenge ultra jump special released.
2004/07/01 dogs hardcore twins short released.  a joint with furinkazan.
2004/06/25 tenjo tenge chapter 75 raws + translations released.
dc comics licenses tenjo tenge (among others) to launch their cmx imprint.  i have removed my tenjo tenge image edit translations from the web, but will keep up my text only translations (and continue those) unless i am asked not to.
2004/06/01 released kagome kagome volume 3.  that completes the kagome kagome series.
