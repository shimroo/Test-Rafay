welcome to the nostalgic history of home and game computers

this site will offer you information about all sorts
of home computers and game computers from the seventies and eighties. computers today and computer games are much more advanced, but it's nice to go back and look at where it all began. from the altair to the latest dell touch screen laptop, computers have evolved in an exponential and dramatic fashion. their
history, anecdotes about their development and the people behind them, like
ralph baer who invented the magnavox odyssey waiting at a bus terminal and of 
      course nolan bushnell, the founder of atari.  
you can also take a look at my own
cartridges, pong
consoles and my computer
collection, with home computers and game consoles i'm very proud of, like the sinclair zx80, the commodore sx-64 and the
first gdr home computer, the robotron z1013. i also have many interesting home
and game computers for swap. when you see what desktop computers today are capable of such as system z deduplication and virtual tape deduplication it is hard to compare the two.
in other words... welcome to the nostalgic
history of
pac-man, space invaders, and famous home and game computers like atari, commodore and sinclair. the time you had to wait
endlessly before a computer game had loaded, but in which systems hardly crashed
yet.
the history section of my
site will gradually take shape. almost every time you visit this site, you'll
see that a section is added. feel free to
      e-mail me
or sign the
		guestbook
with any suggestions and
remarks.
