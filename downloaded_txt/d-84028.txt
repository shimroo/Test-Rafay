great experience ordering the aurora lightpad max 



i ordered the aurora lightpad max and received it quickly. there was something wrong with the cord and brick converter. after calling alaska northern lights, they immediately resent a new light and included a ups return label. quick and easy. the light is awesome and i’m amazed at the brightness and power. kudos for a job well done.

educational section 



what is seasonal affective disorder? 



when we don’t get enough natural sunlight in our lives, light therapy serves to keep our body’s internal “circadian” clock in sync, so we are alert and awake in the day, and ready to sleep at night. our health, mood and behavior are affected in the winter when the quality and quantity of sunlight is lessened. a direct consequence can be seasonal affective disorder (sad), winter depression, or sleep disorders.recommended by doctors for over a decade, we, at alaska northern lights, build the best light therapy lights – the northstar 10,000™ and the aurora lightpad max™. with no dimmers or blue light gimmicks, the northstar 10,000™ and aurora lightpad max™ are designed for effective light therapy at a comfortable distance for 10,000 lux. both of our sad light boxes use broad spectrum bulbs, without harmful uv rays. the bright light (think sunny window) helps make our boxes of the most effective sad light boxes on the market. proof of its effectiveness is shown by a return rate of less than 2%.we offer a 60 day, true 100% money back trial period, and seven year warranty. after years of perfecting our spectrum lights and sad light boxes, we stand behind what we sell.please take the time to look around our web site. if you have any questions about our light therapy boxes, please don’t hesitate to call 1-800-880-6953 or e-mail us at – info@alaskanorthernlights.com.
