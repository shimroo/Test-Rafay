 dutch oven cooking table grill
 now you can use the grill for part of the meal and dutch ovens for other part of the meal all on the same table.  this is an adjustable bbq
                grill that mounts on the side of the cooking table.  you don't have to sacrafice the racks to use this grill either.  first you remove one of 
                the side racks.  mount the post part of the grill then replace the side rack.  this allows you to maintain full use of the side racks.  then you
                place the grill on the post.  the grill can raise and lower to cook as desired.  included with the grill is a drip pan that catches grease and ash
                to keep your cooking table clean. the size of the grill is 16" x 18"  the cost is $89.95
