chairs and sitting





click any image to enlargeaside from the times we turn them into tables by randomly piling objects on them, chairs are made for sitting. and sit in them we do. these are paintings of occupied chairs as well as empty ones. so, as you sit in your chair in front of your computer, or relax in a chair with your phone, scroll through and enjoy the pictures.

casting a centrifugal pump body






once again, we head to the sub-continent to visit an industry. this time a foundry casting a pump body. as usual, safety standards seem to be lacking. the two guys wearing sandals as they carry a cauldron of molten metal across a debris littered floor is particularly harrowing.

jacques carabain

transiting the panama canal






a couple on a circumnavigation pass through the panama canal on their catamaran to get to the pacific ocean. aboard they have their parents and a few hired locals to help handle the lines. they also have a pilot to help them navigate the canal. it is an interesting up-close look, from the deck of a small boat, of the passage through the locks and waterways of the canal.

farming














        click any image to enlarge
      




  these paintings focus not on bucolic images of farms, but rather on the
