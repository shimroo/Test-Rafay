principle and founder
stephanie moore hager

design involves not only the shaping of one or two key areas, but the creation of a series of well-executed focal points. the balance between the desired aesthetic and the functional needs of a particular space is the highest goal. design can effectively transform a blank canvas into a space of distinction with the edgy, dramatic sophistication of work and play so appealing to today's young professional market.
