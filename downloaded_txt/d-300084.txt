    at universal labeling systems,

everything we are goes into everything we do.



    welcome to universal labeling systems



   at universal labeling systems, we are labeling machinery. since 1984, we have been a leader in pressure sensitive labeling machines. no one designs and builds more
custom labeling machines than uls. all labeling machines are designed and built in the usa at our st. petersburg, florida facility. your made-to-order labeler is sold and supported through a worldwide network of authorized distributors. from low volume table top labeling machines, to label and print & apply label applicators, to high volume zero down time labeling systems, our
labeling systems are designed, manufactured, and tested with one purpose in mind…you and your labeling needs.

  




   come explore the universal labeling systems difference. from round products labeling, front & back labeling, carton labeling, and every unique, custom labeling application under the sun, we can help. let us find your labeling solution, customized to your labeling needs, and made specifically for you.  for more information on some of the machines we build check out our
blog page.

and at universal labeling systems, we do more than talk as our performance guarantee states: “all labeling machines manufactured by universal labeling systems carries a 30-day performance guarantee. if your labeling machine does not perform as stated, we will take your machine back and reimburse you in full.” since 1984, we continue to honor this pledge.
