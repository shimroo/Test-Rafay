garden photography commissions
because i am a passionate gardener myself i understand and appreciate not only the garden that i am commissioned to photograph but also how much it means to you and how to interpret what you have created.















portraits in the garden
let me portray the real, relaxed, natural you. no artificial poses, no pressure and all the time we need. you will soon forget that you are being photographed. for individuals, couples and small families.















nude portraits in the garden
a truly liberating experience for individuals and couples. my nude portraits in the garden are created in my own garden. the garden is beautifully secluded and therefore ideally suited to my work.
