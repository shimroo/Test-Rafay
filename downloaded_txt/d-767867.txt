"we purchased both the land and home from farrell.  i can not say enough about them. "

the process was straightforward, and there were no surprises! by january ‘22, the site work was complete, and our home was delivered. by april ‘22, the co was granted-we closed and moved in. it was exactly what we imagined and contracted for. every step of the way. farrell was on the ball-communicated-educated us-coordinated projects by others (propane tank delivery/granite countertops install etc.) and was responsive to our needs and questions, all within budget and on schedule. the farrell crew/trades were always working-respectful and helpful. i would recommend farrell without hesitation to anyone looking for a home! thank you to the entire farrell crew for making our retirement home exactly what we imagined! — lisa r.





"my husband and i had the pleasure of building our first house with farrell homes. "

“we worked with nick, who answered any questions we had and made us confident in our decision to move forward with the building process. throughout the entire experience, we were in frequent communication with nick to ensure our home was exactly how we envisioned it to be. we were able to customize and add our own style to various aspects of the house. whenever any questions or concerns came up along the way, nick and the crew were easily accessible to take care of us. overall we could not be happier with our house and would recommend farrell homes to anyone looking to build their future home.“— monica g.





"we cannot recommend these folks more!"

“a lot of people who build mention how stressful the process is. nick and butch, and the other team members at farrell homes made the entire building process as stress-free as they possibly could. before, during, and even after the building was completed, nick s. always found time to talk with us if we had questions or concerns - even check in to see how things were going. my family and i still see the farrell family in the community, and they always make it a point to say 'hello.'“— kevin o.





"farrell homes is truly a family-owned business that cares about their customers."

“we built our home in 2015.  nick could not have been more helpful.  anything we needed help with or questions we had, he was there for us.  i have recommended countless people to go to farrell homes and work with them.”— leon g.





"if you are planning on going with a modular, farrell homes is the one to go with!"

i started planning my home with nick at farrell homes at the onset of the pandemic. he was honest, patient, and very responsive to all my questions. the process was relatively easy, and the house is perfect! every worker from farrell was professional and did a great job. connor in the office has been awesome and worked with me every step of the way.— janine s.



























































why go modular with farrell homes?



experience the luxury of concierge-level service and elevate your home-building journey








            built to last
          










our factory-built homes are made with quality materials to withstand interstate transportation - making them even more durable than traditional stick-built homes built on-site. the individual modules are constructed with precision so that when assembled, they fit together on your foundation to create a structurally sound and durable home.








            win-win for your wallet
          










modular homes are cost-efficient, and homebuyers can benefit from cost savings as manufacturers can purchase materials in bulk at discounted rates and pass on the savings. the controlled factory environment ensures materials are used efficiently. it reduces construction time by protecting your build from the natural elements, which results in a higher quality build and more cost savings down the road. plus, the lightning-fast construction time can also save you money on temporary housing or rental costs while your home is being built.








            endless flexibility
          










whether you want to change the color of the cabinets, add a kitchen island, or want a completely different layout and floor plan, we’re ready to bring your vision to life. think of our modular homes as a blank canvas you can modify to suit your unique tastes and season of life.
