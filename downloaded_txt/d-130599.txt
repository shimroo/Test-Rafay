 about the paralympic games 


the paralympic games are the largest global sporting event for athletes with disabilities and have taken place every four years since the inaugural edition in rome, italy, in 1960. in 1976, the first winter games were held in ornskoldsvik, sweden and featured 198 athletes from 16 countries.

                                    following the 1988 games in seoul, republic of korea, and the winter games in albertville, france in 1992, the paralympic and olympic games have been held in the same city. the next paralympic games will be held in la in 2028 followed by brisbane in 2032. the next winter edition is milano cortina 2026 with the french alps to follow in 2030 and salt lake city in 2034.

 paralympics history 


sport for athletes with an impairment has existed for more than 100 years. it was not until after world war ii, however, that it was widely introduced. the purpose of it at that time was to assist the large number of war veterans and civilians who had been injured during wartime.
on 29 july 1948, the day of the opening ceremony of the london 1948 olympic games, dr. ludwig guttmann organised a competition for wheelchair athletes at the stoke mandeville hospital in great britain. sixteen injured servicemen and women took part in archery at the inaugural stoke mandeville games, which later became the paralympic games.

 what is classification? 


classification is the cornerstone of the paralympic movement; it determines which athletes are eligible to compete in a sport and how athletes are grouped together for competition. in para sports, athletes are grouped by the degree of activity limitation resulting from the impairment. this, to a certain extent, is similar to grouping athletes by age, gender or weight.
classification aims to minimise the impact of the impairment on athletes' performance so that the sporting excellence determines which athlete or team is ultimately victorious. ensuring that athletes are classified prior to competing is crucial to safeguarding the integrity and credibility of the competition.
