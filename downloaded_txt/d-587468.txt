“i was 18 when i arrived at kyle’s place. i had nothing – no id, no plans for the future, just the clothes on my back. i had one goal: to get my younger sibling out of foster care to live with me, but that seemed impossible. at kyle’s place, i learned skills for dealing with past traumatic experiences, like when i was homeless and sleeping under a bridge, how to positively handle conflict, and ways to share my feelings.  i celebrated my 19th birthday surrounded by loving and supportive people. thanks to the life skills i learned at kyle’s place, i re-enrolled in school and got a job. my experiences taught me the importance of giving back to my community. today, i volunteer at the salvation army and share my story. it’s incredible to actually have other teens look up to me. through it all, i’ve made it!”— journey to dream graduate
