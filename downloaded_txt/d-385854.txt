farewell & best wishes from dr. getty
dear loyal clients,
for the past seven years, i have had the pleasure of getting to know all of you and caring for your wonderful furry family members. i have been truly blessed to be a part of your lives and i have enjoyed every part of my experience at the animal hospital of streamwood (ahs). as such, it is bittersweet that i need to write this letter. my husband has been given a wonderful opportunity to pursue a new path in his career that will take me and my family to the west coast. i will be leaving animal hospital of streamwood in early september of this year for this relocation.
