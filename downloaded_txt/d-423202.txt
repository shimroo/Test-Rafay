the other day and more to come





the other night my wife sam and i watched the bucket list which we both found most enjoyable. nicholson and morgan freeman did outstanding jobs with their roles as aging cancer patients. terminal illness. we are born terminal i read somewhere twice. it is just a question of when we die.a few days later i was talking with my brother who lives in mn about how he liked the movie as well.we went on to discuss aging in all its glory. i made a comment that it is hard to go from being a thoroughbred (youth) to being a plow horse (40 something).he said that at least you're still a horse and not glue. hmmm.
