my order was perfect
just received my order today and wanted to let you know that i am impressed with the plants you sent.  they are beautiful and very healthy looking.  and 2 are much larger than i expected.  
i had asked for overnight delivery because of the extreme heat, and they arrived this morning so i was able to bring them in a lunch today.  they are safely unboxed and sitting out until i get back home tonight.  
i'm hoping i can take good care of these and get them to bloom for me.  
i will recommend you and also hope to order from you again.

great group of orchids
thank you for such a great group of orchids in my order which i received yesterday. beautifully packed - everyone was safe and sound. the plants are in great shape. i have just given them their first misting. thank you again - i already have a second list for my next purchase. interested especially in borneo orchids as i was born there and grew up there. thank you again!

unique orchid
if your interested in unique orchid (other plant collections)- then this is a nursery.to visit. they request appointment beforehand, primarily because one can get lost in the maze of aisle walkways in the midst of hanging and benched plants. mr. andy and the rest of staff are great, polite and very welcoming. if you seeking insight of plant culturing, as well as unique acquisitions... this is a place to schedule a visit.

lovely plant with a nice new growth
my order was delivered and just had a good soak. lovely plant with a nice new growth. i have a new greenhouse space with plenty of light which should suit it well. i've come to depend on you and andy's for excellent quality, unusual species and reliable fast shipping with topnotch customer care. thanks very much and god bless! p.s. all the brazilian miltonias i got from you last year are doing great - i'm looking forward to flowers this fall.
