i had a great experience with boleman law. i was freaking out about the whole process. you would call or show up with a zillion different scenarios trying to find what was best for my situation. the lawyers and staff were approachable and extremely knowledgeable. they never turned me away without an answer. they spoke to me in a manner that was easy to understand in a calm fashion that kept me at ease. i would highly recommend boleman law.
