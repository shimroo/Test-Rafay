great selection of cigars. prices reasonable and even lower than most on many brands. the fellow that helped us was very helpful and nice. convenient location and plenty of parking. also has an adjoining lounge with a nice bar and beer on tap. i will return in the future.

best cigar shop i’ve ever been to. i’d give a 100/100 if i could. this is now a must-stop every time i’m at the beach. i’m from lexington kentucky and they have their prices beat by almost a half. the workers are nice and friendly. had a great chat with the man behind the counter. i wish i could have spent more time but i was on my bike and it was about to rain. my favorite thing about this shop is the commercials tv 33 has of this. only bad thing was i wanted to meet nick and get his autograph but he wasn’t at the store at the time. i’ll be back though before i head home. never forget, smoke em if you got em!

																					ben w											                                    




jonesing for a cigar at the beach & checked out nick’s cw… big cigar shop with smoke area next door… cigar selections in alphabetic order under glass… the entire shop is a humidor, which is a bit different… plenty of ashtrays, humidors, lighters & other apparel on sale… gentleman working was nice and knowledgeable… appreciate the fact that they were open on a sunday. i’ll be back b4 the week is up… thanks for smokes…

																					chris c
