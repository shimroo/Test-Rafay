                    bike events




						cycling for everyone! beginners, families and regular and sporting cyclists - we provide enjoyable and well-organised rides of various lengths - many offer the chance to raise money for charities.
						
						the rides are fully-supported with clearly-signed routes, marshals, medical cover, cycle mechanics and pick-up vehicles, and many finish with a social event, with music, refreshments and beer tent.
						
						it was great to run some successful and enjoyable events in 2024 with the approval of safety advisory groups and british cycling. these followed social distancing and other guidance and were a valuable experience in running covid-safe events. our covid-19 measures are here

						bike events look forward to bringing you more great cycling days out in 2025. to help us with our planning for next year, please feel free to send your suggestions by email we look forward to hearing from you.
						
						stay healthy and stay active!
