we are canada's national association of christian lawyers and law students.as christian legal professionals, we are heirs to a tradition of legal thought that bears on many of the most pressing questions facing our culture and profession. we also understand that the practice of law is a vocation: a calling from god. we believe it is our responsibility to work with others to pursue what justice requires in a free and democratic society.
