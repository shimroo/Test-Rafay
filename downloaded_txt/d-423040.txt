understanding payid and its impact on online casinos 
posted on december 23, 2024 by admin 


payid is changing how we handle transactions in online casinos. it offers a quick, safe method to deposit and withdraw funds. this section explores how payid works, its benefits for casino transactions, and the involvement of the new payments platform and the reserve bank of australia.
how payid works
payid simplifies the way we transfer money. instead of providing lengthy bank details, we can use a simple identifier like an email address or a phone number.
this system connects directly to our bank accounts, allowing us to make immediate transactions.
when we choose payid at an online casino, the amount goes straight from our bank to the casino’s account.
this process eliminates delays and ensures we can start playing almost instantly.
with payid, we retain a level of privacy. this keeps our sensitive bank information secure.
the benefits of using payid for casino transactions
using payid for casino transactions offers several advantages. first, we enjoy immediate deposits. this means we can play our favourite games without waiting.
second, withdrawals are fast. when we cash out, the funds return to our bank account quickly, often within minutes.
another benefit is security. payid transactions do not require us to share our bank details with casinos. this reduces the risk of fraud and protects our financial information.
furthermore, payid is widely accepted among australian online casinos. this growing acceptance makes it easier for us to choose a payment method that suits our needs.
new payments platform and the role of the reserve bank of australia
the new payments platform (npp) is crucial for enabling payid. launched in australia, npp allows for real-time payments between banks.
the reserve bank of australia plays a key role in this system. it oversees the npp to ensure that it operates smoothly and securely.
as banks in australia adopt payid, we gain more options for fast and safe transactions.
this platform not only enhances our online banking experience but also supports the growth of online casinos in australia. by integrating payid, casinos show they value our need for speed and security in transactions.
discovering the best payid online casinos
when we look for the best payid online casinos, there are a few key factors that will help us make an informed choice. we need to focus on what to look for in a payid casino and understand the advantages of using instant payid deposits.
what to look for in a payid casino
finding the right payid casino involves several important factors. first, we should check if the casino is licensed and regulated. this ensures safety and fairness in gaming.
next, we must examine the variety of games offered. a good casino should have a wide range of options, including pokies, table games, and live dealer games.
key features to consider:

payment options: make sure the casino supports both deposits and withdrawals with payid.
bonuses: look for generous welcome bonuses and promotions that add value to our gaming experience.
customer support: reliable support is crucial. we should be able to reach them easily if we need assistance.

by focusing on these factors, we can identify the best online casinos accepting payid.
the advantages of instant payid deposits
using payid for online casinos offers several advantages. one major benefit is the speed of transactions. deposits are made instantly, allowing us to start playing right away.
another key point is security. payid uses bank-level encryption, ensuring our personal and financial information stays safe.
benefits of payid:

convenience: we can make payments easily using our mobile phones or computers.
low minimum deposits: many casinos have a minimum deposit as low as $10, making it accessible for all budgets.
no fees: most transactions are free of charge, meaning we keep more of our winnings.

these advantages make payid an appealing option for our online gambling needs.
navigating deposits and withdrawals with payid
payid offers a convenient and secure way to manage our deposits and withdrawals at online casinos in australia. understanding how to navigate these transactions can enhance our gaming experience and ensure we make the most of this payment method.
understanding deposit and withdrawal limits
when using payid at casinos, it’s important to know the deposit and withdrawal limits. most casinos set minimum deposits at around $10. this amount is designed to be accessible to all players.
for withdrawals, the minimum is generally the same. in fact, many casinos allow us to cash out winnings quickly. while limits can vary by casino, most payouts are processed almost instantly, often in under a minute.
we should always check each casino’s terms to confirm their specific limits and processing times.
how to choose payid as a payment method
to choose payid as our payment method, we need to ensure that the casino supports it. many australian online casinos do, allowing us to deposit money securely.
when registering, we can select payid during the deposit process. on the transaction page, we’ll need to enter our unique payid. this is a simple email or phone number linked to our bank account.
we should also consider factors like transaction fees, which are often very low with payid. it’s crucial to read the fine print and make an informed choice.
bank account to payid: linking process
linking our bank account to payid is a straightforward process. first, we need to log into our online banking portal. from there, we can find the payid setup option, usually located in payment settings.
we will then choose the option to create a payid. we can link it to our bank account using an email address or mobile number. verification steps may be needed to confirm our identity, which adds another layer of security.
once linked, we can use our payid at any casino that accepts it for deposits and withdrawals. this makes transactions quick and hassle-free, enhancing our overall gaming experience.

finding new online casinos australia in 2023 
posted on may 19, 2019may 24, 2023 by admin 


new australian online casinos 2023
finding a new online casino in australia 2019 is not so easy, most information portals report almost exclusively about the big and successful casinos that have been established for years. new releases and unknown brands come much too short, which is why i would like to be the exception in this article and introduce new online casinos for 2019, which convince all along the line and are in no way inferior to the old hands. with my recommendations, i do not only put a value on an excellent software with a broad game offer – i look in particular also on the security and respectability of the point. this is especially important for newcomers. especially new companies have small start-up difficulties every now and then. with the small mistakes often cannot be spoken of fraud or rip-off, it is just sometimes still the mentioned sand in the transmission.
what should one pay attention to when choosing a new australian casino?
in the following, i would like to deal with some aspects that a casino player should pay attention to, especially when deciding on a new provider. good aussie online casinos work close to their customers and provide their players with advice and support around the clock.
i recommend to the readers in principle to pay attention to the imprint of the provider. inform yourself about the company behind the online casino and make sure that there are no negative reports via google, for example. most online casinos today are run by huge corporations that are even listed on the stock exchange and have enormous annual sales.
the next look should be at the license. where is the online casino registered and what license does it have? ideally, the provider should be registered in a european country. for example, gambling licenses issued in great britain, malta and gibraltar are considered safe.
there are now several independent institutions that regularly check online casinos for fairness and data security. one of the best known institutions is ecogra. ecogra issues the respective providers with appropriate seals of approval, which are prominently displayed on the website. basically, it is true that a casino with the ecogra seal is to be classified as absolutely serious and safe.
another vital aspect is customer support, which is a decisive quality feature. entertaining games are waiting at all providers, but the differences in terms of service vary widely. excellent customer support is characterized above all by professional competence, friendliness, helpfulness, and also speed.
also, the bonus programs differ quite strongly from provider to provider. they all provide bonuses, but quality and fairness vary enormously. in principle, serious online casinos also link fair sales conditions to bonuses that are actually realizable. every provider should present the bonus conditions openly and in a transparent form.
every good online casino has to provide its customers with a wide selection of secure deposit and withdrawal options. a good distinguishing mark for a serious online casino is the speed with which it pays out winnings. nowadays, payouts (depending on the method chosen) should be made within 24 hours, especially if they are made via e-wallet.
how do you recognize dubious online casinos?
i have already mentioned what to look out for in a new casino, and this means that if the above mentioned aspects are not fulfilled, caution should be exercised with the respective provider. if you are a new player and you are not sure about your business, you should keep your hands off this casino.
from my point of view, it is recommendable to test the different online providers first with a small amount. also, make one or two payouts before you invest substantial sums.
why is it worth choosing a new australian casino?
why should a casino player choose a new provider when there are many established addresses on the internet? this question is absolutely justified and yet there are also arguments in favor of the newcomers.
many new online casinos, for example, come with a completely new range of games. the playtech or microgaming software can be found in hundreds of casinos and as good as this software may be, as an experienced player, you won’t discover many new things.
the selection of games in these casinos is almost identical. new online casinos that rely on other, less well-known software inspire with new and innovative features or at least with games that are not available from 100 other providers. another argument is, of course, the welcome bonus. especially as a newcomer to the highly competitive online gaming market, you have a hard time. for this reason, many new casinos are focusing on particularly lucrative deposit bonuses for new customers.
the problem is: how should a player know which new online casinos in australia are good in 2023?

it’s now clear to everyone that the australian casino evenings can be really exciting. if you now ask a search engine about “australian online casino,” you will get umpteen different hits. the offer is immense. but are these platforms legal? anyone who wants to gamble must be regulated in an eu country and have a license in an eu country. classic licensing countries include malta, curacao, and isle of men. these are well-known tax havens in the eu but are subject to european laws. if the license exists and the gaming operation is monitored/regulated accordingly, there is nothing to prevent participation. but not all hits from google and co are equally good. your first glance should always be directed at legality and seriousness. if the basic prerequisite is fulfilled, then dedicate yourself to the optics, the web appearance. does the site look appealing and clear? now take a look at the range of games. which manufacturer provides the games? are there all the games you like to play? do they run on your computer/tablet/ mobile phone? is there a live casino? what about bonuses? not only the size of the bonus counts but also the conditions you have to meet to be able to cash out any winnings. it is also important that you can deposit real money or withdraw winnings in several ways as free as possible with generous limits. last but not least, support is a criterion that can make the difference between “good” and “very good.”
too many facts at once? let’s go into detail.
we at leftbooks.com only list legal and reputable new online casinos. all dubious platforms fall mercilessly through the rust. thus you save yourselves the search for a valid license and the regulation in a european union state. we usually start our reviews with some sober facts. what is the name of the new online casino? how long has the new online casino existed? what are the positive and negative highlights of our test that we noticed? after that, it’s time to get down to business. we focus on the following points:

bonus programs – are they particularly innovative?
software / games
payment methods
support

new online casino bonus programs – what is good/bad/ new?
because it never hurts, we take a little out to provide clarity. we start by explaining a term that will make it easier to understand: bonus or sales terms. all bonuses that are paid out are subject to these conditions. you have to invest the bonus or the whole starting balance often enough in games. the winnings that are still in the player’s account after this total turnover can also be paid out. if such a condition in the terms and conditions of the new online casino is that a bonus received must be wagered 40 times, then multiply the bonus you have received by 40. only if you have invested this sum in games with funds from the bonus total, you can achieve real or cashable winnings. if the condition is that you must wager your total deposit including bonus 30 times, add the deposit and bonus and multiply by 30. this is the minimum wager that must be exceeded with your total balance. you have only limited time to “clear” the bonus. how much exactly is revealed on the information pages about the bonuses? thus the operator avoids that you secure yourself large bonuses and step immediately to the payment.
in summary, the harder the bonus conditions are to meet, the worse this is for you as a player. what is the trend of the new online casinos? larger bonuses and harder bonus conditions? or will the bonus amounts become smaller and easier to unlock? hard to say.
with bonuses, the variety could hardly be greater than it is. the best known bonus is the one available at all online casinos, old or new: the welcome bonus. in a way, it is the entry aid for newcomers or an argument that should entice new registrations. in all cases, it has one thing in common: it is a deposit bonus. this means that for the first deposit(s) of real money into your account at the new online casino, you will receive bonus payments free of charge. so you start the gambling adventure with more credits than you have deposited. often you will receive a percentage of your deposit(s) as a bonus on top. sometimes you have to follow a deposit plan to get the maximum bonus. if you don’t belong to the class of very eager players, you’d rather limit yourself to a simple bonus that isn’t too high. otherwise, you will not meet the wagering requirements and will not receive any of the bonuses.
soberly summarized: not every welcome bonus that looks like a lot is suitable for every player. think about what makes sense to you. the times in which there was 100% dusting for up to 100 euros, which was unleashed with 20-fold conversion, are over. in the meantime, you have become much more creative and versatile.
so-called no-deposit bonuses are less common. the newcomers to the genre are also rather stingy here. these can be obtained without payment, for example, as a reward for registration. you get a small credit in the form of play money or free spins. you can keep the winnings if you have unlocked them according to the wagering requirements. there is often an upper limit for the payout of winnings that you make with this bonus. after all, the gift should not be unexpectedly lavish. details can be found in the casino’s terms and conditions or in our ratings.
our opinion: this bonus is usually small, but it is a nice little gift for which you don’t take any risks. you can only win with it. especially a new online casino could attract new customers.
vip programs are also sought after. regular customers belong rewarded. we see that also in such a way. generating new customers is one of the operators’ goals, inspiring customers in the long term, and keeping them is another. there are vip programs for this. every game you play helps you to collect experience points. the more points, the higher your rank in the new online casinos, the more goodies you get. these are bonuses and free spins, sometimes also prizes in kind and cash prizes. there are no limits to your creativity.
our conclusion: a good new online casino should show that loyalty has value. consider how often you will play if this vip program is relevant for you.
other promotions are like sand by the sea. some platforms have their own action for almost every day of the week. be it for tournaments, single games,… in that point, there is nothing that doesn’t exist. our reports give an overview of what the individual portals offer.
these actions bring colors into the casino life. who attaches importance to it, should pay attention to the fact that there are appropriate actions. who prefers straightforward play, can neglect this criterion confidently.
