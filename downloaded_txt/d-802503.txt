why we give 














						"nature is vital to humanity. we are proud to support the friends of the fort worth nature center & refuge and their beautiful new boardwalk — and all it will provide to fort worth residents, visitors, and the flora and fauna that reside there."					
holli daviescommunity development regional manager, facebook 











						"bison and bobcats, wetlands and warblers, flowers and foxes, trails and trees. that’s why i support the friends and the nature center. our city park deserves the volunteer and financial support of friends who want this unique space to be enjoyed by our kiddos, friends, and, most importantly, those who don’t know these places exist."					
adelaide leavenspresident, meta alice keith bratten foundation 











						"at h-e-b, we believe in supporting organizations that are passionate and have a great mission and vision to educate our children, adults, and the greater community about the wonders of nature. we believe the friends of the fort worth nature center & refuge is a great example of those ideals and passion. h-e-b is very proud to be a supporting partner with this outstanding non-profit."					
richard mcdonaldcorporate director of environmental affairs, h-e-b 











						"at my home in lakeside, we are surrounded by nature and can explore and learn about wildflowers, trees, insects, birds, and other animals. when i discovered the nature center, i was intrigued with the programs available for families and soon became a docent. what fun it was to help children share the excitement of nature’s many wonders! that made me a lifetime supporter of the friends."
