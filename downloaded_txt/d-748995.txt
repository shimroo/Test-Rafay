​the party ended at 5am, november 19, 2023 – nearly forty years and more than 10,000 nights from when it all began. the final chapter will surely be written by the essayists, the journalists, and memorialized in tribute events and documentaries but the magic that happened at 954 w. belmont will never be recreated. it couldn't be. it was a remarkable tornado of talented performers and staff, inspired friends and customers, a crazy location and a lot of dreams. the expenses of increased security, insurance and licensing, equipment, rent and more cannot be overestimated and we could not imagine morphing the bar into a bottle service, vip area venue. so the doors are locked. the music is silenced and our dreams are now memories. we hope you made some memories with us and that you smile when they visit you. the first ads in 1983 announced berlin as the neighborhood bar of the future. unfortunately, the future is now and it's time for us to go home.
 

 












from your friends at berlin






 
as shirley mooney (the co-creator of berlin nightclub along with best friendtim sullivan) has said and so say we all, thank you jim and jo for all you have done to keep berlin alive for so many years.​at this time jim and jo have no comments left to make, but for now, please immerse yourself in the berlin chicago nightclub archive and relive, reminisce, grieve, smile and share with the rest of the members of what many of us called, “church”.​
 

 






dance. celebrate. love. together
berlin was chicago's critically acclaimed, pan-cultural, late nite music & art club​featuring an eclectic mix of alternative electronic music, live performance, and themed events.
