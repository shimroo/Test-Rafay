a message from kenny's family












turkey hunters and friends,
many have heard but many others of you may not know that we lost kenny on november 20th, 2011, after his courageous three-year battle with cancer. throughout, and until his last day on this earth, he loved us, he engaged life and all those around him, and he inspired with an attraction that pointed to his faith in the lord.
he had a most special place in his heart for two groups of people: his students and his fellow turkey hunters. "i have been involved with several thousand young men and women and with many of their families; they have influenced me greatly; what a privilege it has been."
morgan's turkey callers are continuing to be made according to kenny's wishes, designs and his earlier direct instruction. kenny's son kenneth and a trusted and expert woodcrafter worked with kenny and are continuing to craft kenny's turkey callers, instruments whose sole purpose is to call turkeys to the gun.
-the morgan family
