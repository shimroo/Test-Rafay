what you're saying



































when i recently placed an order for two fireplace draft stoppers and a whole house fan cover, i was hoping to save some on my gas heating bills this winter. i am writing to tell you that your products are amazing. i live in northeast ohio and we have had exceptionally cold weather this fall and winter so far. i installed your draft stoppers and fan cover and have just received my first months gas bill. it is $189 less this month than the same month last year. this savings has already paid for the cost of the products, and you have no idea how thrilled i am. these are such simple ideas that have had a huge impact. i will be recommending your products to everyone i know.

the battic door attic stair cover is something that we’ve needed since we moved into our home. our house is heated by electricity, and so energy costs are an obvious concern for us. when we first moved in, we decided to have our local electric company come and give us a free energy audit. one of the top concerns voiced by the audit team was the significant heat-loss and cooling-loss we’d most definitely experience from our heated or cooled air leaking out through our fold-down attic stairway door. we immediately purchased the battic door. it popped into place easily, in just a few minutes. when we need to access our attic space, it removes quickly and easily. upon leaving the attic, we just lower the battic door into place. we hope to see some significant energy savings on our next electric bill! everyone with a folding attic stairway should buy a battic door!

just to let you know! i received your clothes dryer vent seal, i was impressed with how fast the delivery turn around time was! i had the clothes dryer vent seal install in about a haft an hour after i received it, i have been checking the drier's filter vent (inside the dryer) for about a week and i must say, the cold air has been cut down next to nothing, the room is warmer! and when heating a house with electric heat, one is always looking for ways to save money, and your clothes dryer vent seal is one of them!!!
