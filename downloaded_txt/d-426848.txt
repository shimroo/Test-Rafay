oloc mission statement
oloc represents lesbian elders in a spirit of inclusiveness to promote lesbian visibility. we come together to preserve our herstory, to confront social injustice, and to give and receive support for our later years.


oloc vision statement
oloc is an inclusive, multicultural, rainbow of lesbian elders working in community for social justice, maintaining a lesbian focus.








oloc in action
we are an international network of old lesbians in our 55th year or older, and our supporters, working to defy ageism in our communities and our country. we use education and public discourse as our primary tools.our international network is directed by a steering committee with the help of local chapters and many volunteers.we hold biennial gatherings allowing us to come together to share experiences and ideas.we are dedicated to preserving and enhancing the lesbian voice as well as increasing lesbian visibility in a world that stifles lesbian culture and threatens to erase it.
old lesbians organizing for change: an international community of lesbian elders stands with all involved in the work for racial, economic, and social justice, including protesters all over the world calling for accountability in every country.


oloc works for change by supporting:

comprehensive immigration reform
elimination of violence against women
enactment of universal single-payer healthcare for all
an end to corporate “personhood”
an end to any curtailment of voting rights
the black lives matter movement
the say her name! movement
the civil rights of all indigenous people
efforts to achieve net zero co2 emissions
efforts to reduce climate crisis impacts that fall disproportionately on the poor and vulnerable
reproductive justice for all












diversity is the practice of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds, different ages, class structures, cultural backgrounds, geographies, physical abilities and disabilities, and religions. 


equity means being fair and impartial and that the resources are distributed based on the tailored needs of a specific audience. equity recognizes that some communities will need more—or different—access compared to other communities.  


inclusion is the practice or policy of improving equal access of opportunities and resources for people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized. also, the practice of behaviors and social norms that ensure people feel welcome. 





we’re excited to share that oloc has earned a 2024 gold seal of transparency with candid (formerly guidestar)! now, you can support our work with trust and confidence by viewing our#nonprofitprofile: guidestar.org/profile.






dialogue etiquette

for oloc, diversity is the practice of including or involving lesbians from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds, different ages, class structures, cultural backgrounds, geographies, physical abilities and disabilities, and religions. we are committed to an environment where all lesbians are nurtured and cared for and will not be intentionally harmed or disregarded.
for all oloc communications and events, we are committed to relating within our differences while holding respect and regard for each lesbian’s humanity. we envision leadership as caring for the whole. and the whole must include all oloc affiliates and guests.
dialogue etiquette consequences
for all oloc affiliates, we agree:

we each are supported and encouraged to speak up when we are feeling harm or disregard. additionally, we have the expectation that any facilitator shall pause and address the harm or disregard.
we each agree to interrupt, disrupt, ask to pause when we each see the possibility of a lesbian experiencing harm or disregard.
the lesbian offering feedback (e.g., her lived experience) is offering the impact of what she experienced—not necessarily someone’s intention. regardless of intention, we understand that this is her experience, and that impact is what will be addressed.
we each agree to being interrupted, disrupted, asked to pause by a lesbian who is experiencing harm or disregard.
we each agree to seek support when i have experienced harm or disregard.
we each agree to seek support and education when i have caused harm or disregard.
