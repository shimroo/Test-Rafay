 mission dolores has always had a central place in the religious, civic, and cultural life of san francisco. misión san francisco de asís was founded june 29, 1776, under the direction of father junipero serra and is both the oldest original intact mission in california and the oldest building in san francisco. today, the mission dolores parish comprises both the basilica and the old mission.true to its origins, the basilica parish of mission dolores reflects the remarkable diversity and vibrancy of modern san francisco. located at the crossroads of the city's mission district, castro district, the lower haight, noe valley, and upper market street neighborhoods, mission dolores parishioners come from an enormous array of cultures, places, and backgrounds to worship together.the old mission's religious, historic, and architectural significance makes it a unique and memorable destination for visitors to san francisco. we welcome all to come visit the birthplace of san francisco. for old mission visitor information, please click here.we invite you to explore this website to learn more about the people, community, and history of mission dolores.we are a welcoming catholic community called by god to live out the message of christ in love and service to all people.

   and jesus came and said to them, "all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all that i have commanded you; and lo, i am with you always, to the close of the age." matthew 28: 18-20 (rsv-ce)
