why use dummy components?



dummies save money! in cases where only mechanical characteristics are required, dummy components 
can be used instead of live, functioning components.


a practical dummy component® is the exact mechanical equivalent of a live component used only 
when the physical properties of the components are required. these components can cost as 
much as 80 percent less than live components, making the ideal for testing of solder processes, 
machine setup lead-free conversion, thermal profiling, solder training and other process 
evaluations where only the mechanical characteristics not the functioning components are required.
