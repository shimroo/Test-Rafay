hillside, new jersey – february 11, 2013 – wizkids games, a subsidiary of neca, announced today plans to release an all-new fantasy miniatures product based upon the popular and long-lived world of mage knight. the first game to utilize the extremely versatile and innovative combat dial system game platform, mage knight boasts over a dozen releases, including an award-winning board game based on the property.

wizkids games announces the just released mage knight board game is sold out

due to this overwhelming response, a second production run of the game is assured. we are also excited to announce plans to release the game in german, czech and other languages as details are finalized. please check back to wizkidsgames.com or your distributor for updates on language plans and availability of reprints.

two of my favourite mapping software has just been updated!  fractal terrains 3 and astrosynthesis v3.0!
the most amazing update for fractal terrains 3 is the option to export to google earth!  as well as faster refresh and draw time!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
so what is new in fractal terrains 3?

cc3, google earth, cosmographer 3 and 16-bit png export.
screen rendering on mulitcore processors is twice as fast or more.
the complex mathematical operations used in fractal terrains are up to 20% faster.
performance scales better with the number of processors available on the system.
the interface has been improved with a variety of themes.
added texture-based climate shader which works on sea areas.
added normalize tool to manually fix problems with painting in earlier versions that could cause black areas to appear on the world.
many niggles and bugs fixed and export libraries updated.

price: 32.95 (27.95 for download only)
fractal terrains 3 is perfect as stand alone or if you own campaign cartographer 3 and any of the add-on software you can export your maps to scale!  this is a huge time saver if you are making several different overland maps to scale!

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
astrosynthesis allows you to create an entire galaxy all in 3d!  star coordinates, system generator, planet maps, animations, search functions and so much more! you can even choose to use the built in planet generator or profantasy’s fractal terrains!
so what is new in version 3?

new integrated orbital display
multiple star system display
flexible system generator
terraforming
fixed-number star system generation
on the fly surface map generation
3d models
background images
anti-aliased graphics
natural language search
sector date and time tracking
travel calculator
video recording / movie making
new storage engine
automatic updater
better windows 7/ vista support

price:  $34.95 us (download only) or $20.00 to upgrade
i have been using both programs since they first came out and i have been pleased to purchase every upgrade that has come out since.  if you play any space faring game such as gurps, serenity, traveller, rifts, or any other type of game then these programs are for you!  i even use astrosynthesis for my fantasy campaign as i use it to figure out the position of the planets and stars!
are you a wargamer instead?  i also use astrosynthesis for campaigns in my warhammer 40,000 games.  astrosynthesis is perfect for generating the systems that we play over, distances and travel time then export to cc3 for local maps with cosmographer 3.  the possibilities of these two products is almost endless!
i would also like to add that both companies have amazing customer service.  i’ve never had a problem with them answering questions that i have had in the past.
get over to their respected web pages and read more about these amazing products!

world works games relaunch!

we’re just getting started!
worldworksgames is nearing its 10th anniversary and as astounding as that number is to those of us who’ve been around since the beginning, what’s more exciting is just how far we have left to go. this decade long journey saw wwg setting many new standards, occasionally fumbling but always pushing the limits of where we could take the medium and the market. the journey has taught us that the road isn’t just long, it never truly ends and each new place we visit is more amazing than the last. put simply; worldworksgames has finally come of age and we want you by our side as we explore new paths.
we can’t say the above without mentioning the incredible nature of the community which has formed around us over the past decade. bar none, the worldworksgames community is one of the friendliest, most supportive communities out there. you simply won’t meet a better group of people and we are constantly humbled by how fortunate we are to have you along with us for the ride.
at home with worldworksgames 

to us, the wwg website is about much more than the same old, tired e-store experience you’ve seen a million times before. to us, its always been a place to hang your hat, talk with like-minded friends and explore the potential of the hobby together. though we’ve worked very hard for the past year to ensure an intuitive shopping experience, our focus moving forward will be on the community, how to make it stronger, more supportive, more inspiring and it will never truly be finished (so watch the wet paint!). this is a work in progress fueled by you!
new store features
reduced prices!: over the years we’ve seen pricing trends change dramatically while the market found its feet. to that end, we’ve adjusted pricing catalog wide to help you stretch your hobby dollars to the max! food and clothing are just as important as gaming goods…we realize that!
robust catalog filtration tools: you can now browse our catalog by category, genre and product line. we’ve broken our products into distinct product lines, with detailed descriptions for each, to help you make an informed purchase decision each step of the way!

free kitbashes!: product owners now have completely free access to fan modified kitbashes associated with each core catalog purchase. kitbashes remain available for purchase to those who do not own or for whatever reason do not wish to own the model set from which they were derived. (more kitbashes to be added and updated from our archives as we move forward).

easy downloads with “collections”: we’ve created an all new “my home” area which includes 3 handy visual collections tools. my collection, my kitbashes & my freebies offer you a visually intuitive listing of your purchases and complimentary contents. simply scan to the product image of your choice and hit “download”. doesn’t get any simpler than that!

public profiles: the single best way to promote community growth is to promote community members as individuals! with public profiles, users can opt to share details about themselves, their builds, their product reviews, their hobby and their level of support in general. we have additional enhancements coming to the public profiles area which will offer tighter integrations to other areas (forums/galleries) and connect users in unique ways, to inspire, to forge friendships and offer guidance. you can also use public profiles to check in on your favorite designers to see what they’ve created in the past and what they are working on right now!

countdowns: after a product hits a specific level of completion on our “in the works” meter on our homepage, you can expect a countdown to start which exactly marks a products launch date on our store.
news & social networks: worldworksgames will be fully supporting regular updates to facebook and twitter feeds as well as regular rss support and a newly streamlined newsletter format. keeping up to date with wwg has never been easier!
expanded faq / tutorials area: we’ve expanded and consolidated our tutorials, support materials and information into an easy to browse listing.
more friends on the way!: you can expect to see some fresh faced designers around worldworksgames as we continue to expand our catalog and product range (you may even know a few of them). you will also see unique features from time to time with a focus on maximizing your table top gaming experience!
much more to come!
we aren’t done yet! the truth is that the new worldworksgames store has many planned features waiting in the wings for implementation. we have broad improvements to community features, a richer user experience and support structure, additional shopping tools and much more on the way! our goal is to provide you with the best online shopping experience and community experience possible for tabletop gaming related goods, both digital and otherwise.
like we said; we’re just getting started!
