is your contractor's license in
				  good standing?yes. aussie roofing has been licensed by the state of
				  california since 1983. new corporate license #823443 since december
				  2002.
are your roofers full-time
				  employees, or are they sub-contracted or day labor?my roofers are
				  full-time employees. i've had these same crews since the early
				  1990's.
do your roofers have workers
				  compensation insurance? is the policy in good standing? yes, and the
				  policy is in good standing.
do you have contractor
				  liability insurance? (many roofers do not have this insurance. it is very
				  expensive, but very important!)yes, we carry $1 million
				  coverage.
what about permits? does your
				  roofing company pull the building permit?yes. it's included in the
				  price.
can the customer pay the supply
				  company directly for materials? yes you can. we have current accounts
				  with all our suppliers, and they are willing to receive payments from our
				  customers, if requested.
what warranties do you
				  give?we give a 5-year or 10-year installation warranty from aussie
				  roofing, covering leak repair and defects in installation. the material
				  manufacturer will give their own product warranty for the longevity of the
				  product. some of our manufacturers back our work with an additional
				  labor warranty:

gaf-elk: composition shingles
						& flat built-up systems

what types of roofs do you
				  install?all kinds. see the products
				  page.
do you clean up the job
				  site?yes. daily and upon completion.
do you replace all
				  flashings?yes.
what about gutters?we
				  recommend gutters on most roofing jobs, but this depends upon your
				  circumstances, age of gutters, etc. normally when a roof is ready to be
				  replaced, the gutters are nearing the end of their useful life. it's more cost
				  effective to replace the gutters when the roof is being installed, and saves
				  disturbing the perimeter of your new roof at a later date. see our
				  seamless gutters page for more
				  details.
what about skylights?if
				  you are considering a skylight, the time to have the work done is when
				  reroofing. we install velux
				  skylights, o'keeffe's
				  and other popular brands.
what about sun
				  tunnels?sun tunnels are a less expensive skylight system. we install
				  "the original sun tunnel" by
				  velux.
will you give an address list
				  of all houses you have roofed under your current contractors license? (the
				  best judge of a roofer's experience is the homeowner who has already been
				  through what you are now considering. check references!)we have references
				  going back to 1983. any and all of them are available upon request.
