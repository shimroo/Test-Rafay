central asia & caucasus tours



tailor-made private tours and small group packages

do you dream of visiting central asia and the caucasus but don’t have a fortune to spend? do you prefer a down-to-earth experience over five-star luxury? if so, orexca’s excellent value-for-money group or private tours are the ideal way for you to explore this fascinating, yet untouched, part of the world affordably – but without compromising on the experience or your memories.


from the madrassahs of uzbekistan or the sparkling lakes of tajikistan, to the yurt camps of kyrgyzstan, the monasteries of armenia, or the wineries of georgia, we can take you there. our tours are specially designed for you to save money while enjoying a more authentic experience as you stay in homestays or family-owned guesthouses; eat where the locals do; and use local transport.

samarkand and khiva



we very much enjoyed the excursions. the trip to khiva was a bit difficult because we needed to leave very early and our flight was returing at 23:00 pm. it was tough becasue the weather was cold - 6. but the quality of the tour was excellent, the guides and drivers were very nice. many thanks for your kind attention, we really appreciated it! best wishes for a happy new year.
