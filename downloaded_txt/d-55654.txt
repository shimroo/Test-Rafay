we take pride in our course  





our golf course, practice facility and golf programs get high marks from our members. our tom jackson designed 18 hole championship layout is rated as one of the best in the upstate. the course meanders through a beautiful natural setting that brings streams and our signature lake into play on several holes. the course stretches to over 7,000 yards and offers six sets of tees to challenge golfers of all skill levels.
