legal aid of western missourijustice for all



legal aid of western missouri provides free civil (non-criminal) legal assistance to people who need it most and can afford it least.
every day, missourians are denied the basic rights to which they are entitled under the law simply because they can’t afford an attorney. we’re on a mission to change that!
the availability of free civil legal aid can make all the difference to our neighbors who are fighting to stay in their homes, escape domestic violence, secure veterans’ benefits or address many other legal challenges that go to the heart of their security and well-being.
we serve 40 counties in missouri where approximately 300,000 individuals and famility experience poverty — most of whom you will never meet or even know. but they are a lot like you. they have families, hopes and dreams. they are your neighbors. they live in the communities you call home.

our success stories shine a light on the sorts of civil legal issues our clients face and show how your support impacts your neighbors and your community. it’s hard to play in a game where your opponent has the gear and you have nothing. without you, none of this would have been possible. your support does make a difference.

our clients say it best!don’t just take our word for it.“everything legal aid provided me with helped me to understand my rights and what i’m able to do.”
“my attorney was so nice and solved my problem. i didn’t have any money and would have been in a big mess without legal aid.”
“your organization restores hope to the hopeless and confidence to the less privileged.”
“i know if it hadn’t been for my legal aid attorney, i would have never won my case. she’s given me a chance to live again. thank you from the bottom of my heart.”
“my volunteer attorney was not only professional and knowledgeable; her manner was kind and her pace slow. her calmness helped me focus.”
“in my life, i haven’t had many people i know fight for me, so for a total stranger like my paralegal to do so — it let me know that good people are still out there!”
“legal aid about saved my life! i tell everyone i meet how lucky joplin is to have this service available to us.”
