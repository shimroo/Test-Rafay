northborough power choice
 


 

the town of northborough is developing a consumer-friendly electricity program called northborough power choice. the program is an electricity aggregation, which is a group electricity purchasing program for northborough residents and businesses. through northborough power choice, the town will use its collective buying power to lock in long-term electricity supply prices that will not change seasonally. while northborough power choice will not be able to guarantee lower prices compared with national grid’s basic service prices, the town is committed to working toward providing prices that are competitive and stable.when the program launches, electricity customers in northborough will see a change in the price that is used to calculate the supply services portion of their national grid electric bill, which is the part of the bill where we pay for the electricity we use. national grid will continue to deliver electricity to northborough and handle billing without interruption.before launching the program, the town must develop an aggregation plan and submit it to state regulators for review and approval. a public presentation was delivered about the draft aggregation plan for northborough power choice on february 12, 2024, and the plan and sample opt-out mailing materials were made available for public comment from february 12 until march 13, 2024. they remain available for public review below. northborough power choice documents:notice of filing (pdf)final aggregation plan - filed with dpu 10/29/24 (pdf)sample opt-out mailing documents (pdf)hard copies are available by visiting:town clerk's office - 63 main streetnorthborough free library - 34 main streetsenior center - 119 bearfoot roadresourcesletter from department of energy resources (doer) (3/22/24)powerchoice questions and answers (4/5/24)dpu enhances municipal aggregation process (7/9/24)dpu enhances municipal aggregation process - press release (7/9/24)guidelines for municipal aggregation proceedings (7/9/24) learn morefor additional information about northborough power choice and answers to frequently asked questions, please visit the new program website at northboroughpowerchoice.com.
