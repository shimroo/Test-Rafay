dmca takedown & the digital millennium copyright act







by michael roberts


what is the digital millennium copyright act (dmca)?


the digital millennium copyright act (dmca) is a copyright law of the united states that merges two 1996 treaties of the world intellectual property organization (wipo). provisions are made therein to heighten the penalties for copyright infringement on the internet. it was signed into law by president bill clinton on october 28, 1998 after passage by a unanimous vote in the united states senate on october 12, 1998. title 17 of the united states code was amended by the dmca to extend the reach of copyright while limiting the liability of on-line service providers for copyright infringement by their users.


the dmca’s principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and indirect liability of internet service providers and other intermediaries. it was adopted by the european union in the electronic commerce directive 2000; the copyright directive 2001 implemented the 1996 wipo copyright treaty in the eu.

use and abuse of dmca take-down demands


digital millennium copyright act takedown demands can be an effective tool for the removal of unprotected, defamatory and fallacious speech from websites and from search engines for search results displayed as a result of searches on a particular subject, person or business. for the most part, search engines and internet service providers are protected from liability for tort such as defamation and harassment as a result of another law called section 230 of the communications decency act (if defamation is provided by a 3rd party). this can be incredibly frustrating for victims of the abuse of this safe harbor, particularly in instances where malicious and fallacious reports have been posted on websites such as ripoffreport.com, thedirty.com and cheaterville.com. in such instances, victims can take advantage of a dmca take-down demands to both the websites displaying the offending material and the search engines. a word of warning though; if you direct such a take-down demand to websites with low value speech and poor social responsibility records, then you are effectively “telegraphing your punches”. in such instances, stealth might be your best friend, as such, it might be tactically and strategically prudent to limit your dmca takedown demand to the search engines only. let’s face it, if it is not on google it may as well not exist no matter how damaging the allegations.


the safe harbor provisions of § 230c of the cda do not extend to copyright violations in most instances, although there are provisions for reasonable notice to be given to the offending internet service providers. search engines such as google might ignore take-down demands for defamatory search results linking to defamatory website, such as ed magedson’s rip off report, pursuant to the immunity granted to them through § 230c. however, if such a demand is made on the basis of copyright breaches, you may submit a similar take-down, but based on copyrighted material such as photos, images, quotations, or other copyrighted material owned by you, or another party willing to support you in your take-down efforts. if you elect to submit such a take-down demand, i would caution you to completely avoid the defamatory context because it may invite deeper scrutiny by the receiving party such as google.  consequently, it may be rejected on the basis that the dmca take-down demand is determined to be a disguise for relief from defamation, which as mentioned does not attract liability to the search engines because of § 230c.


(note:  if the copyright demand is for a photograph, then it must be made by the person who actually clicked the shutter!  if you are actually in the photograph, then you are not the owner, unless you used a self-timer or tripod, or if you paid a third party to take the photograph in which case you can claim ownership of the photo based on “work for hire”.)


dmca takedown demands can be directed to google through the following web form; you are welcome to contact rexxfield if your problems persist, but for the most part, unless the problem is catastrophic and a clear and present danger to your livelihood is evident, we suggest you try this form first. there’s no need to spend money on our services if you can achieve results by yourself unless the problem is severe:


google dmca takedown form

if you do not have a copyright breach vector, you might try the same form if the offending webpage is defamatory or harassing. we have seen limited success with this form on that basis, but do not hold your breath.




thank you mr. roberts for this great articleinternet libel statutes in the u.s.a.

cops use dating site to lure guy who beat up his girlfriend during breakup





by angela matua


cops from the 114th precinct were able to find and arrest a violent criminal in astoria, ny using non-traditional bait – the dating site plenty of fish, the precinct’s commander reported on tuesday night.

on dec. 5, 2016 at about 7:20 a.m., officers received a call about an assault in progress in astoria. the victim told them that, while attempting to break up with her boyfriend, he punched her in the face with a nail in his hand. the woman suffered a laceration near her left eye, according to deputy inspector peter fortune, commanding officer of the 114th precinct.

cops were unable to find him, but they took a complaint report and kept the investigation open.

officer otto pereira, a member of the domestic violence unit, took on the case. during the investigation, pereira found out that the suspect had six criminal contempt charges for violating an order of protection from the same woman.

it was also discovered that he had checked into a drug rehabilitation center after the assault.

for weeks, it was impossible for police to know here he was being treated because of patient confidentiality laws. a break in the case came when the victim alerted police to a dating site profile he created on plenty of fish.

the free online dating site has more than 90 million registered users, according to its website.

pereira advised the victim to make a fake profile to lure in her ex-boyfriend into a meeting.

“surprisingly, after several days the perpetrator took the bait,” fortune said.

on jan. 25, the victim also called the suspect and convinced him to meet her at a bar in manhattan. while the victim stayed at the precinct, a female officer went to the location to act as a decoy and the nypd warrent squad was also there.

the suspect was arrested at the bar. the nypd worked with district attorney richard a. brown’s office to “enhance the case,” fortune said. they discovered that the suspect, who is in his late 30s, had 42 previous arrests. because of his arrests and six criminal contempt charges, the victim is now remanded in jail on an attempted murder charge.

officer pereira was honored with the cop of the month award for january during the feb. 28 114th precinct community council meeting “for his professionalism in which he conducted this though investigation,” fortune said.

conman uses online dating to scam 15 women out of $360k





by cheyenne roundtree for dailymail.com
a conman scammed hundreds of thousands of dollars out of 15 women after he posed as a billionaire businessman on big-name dating sites.

john edward taylor stole up to $360,000 from several women across the united states after pretending to be a wealthy businessman and an oil tycoon, a fbi report claims.

the 46-year-old allegedly would use dating sites such as eharmony to trick women into relationships in order to steal their identities and gain access to their bank accounts.

john edward taylor, 46, scammed at least 15 women out hundreds of thousands of dollars, the fbi claims

taylor, who also went by jay taylor, was operating his scam for the past five years, according to the complaint filed in new york in june 2016, according to nbc new york.

when a woman - who taylor charged $60,0000 to an american express card in her name - confronted him, he threatened to send sexually explicit photos of the woman to her employer, the fbi said. 

taylor allegedly wrote in a message: 'have fun at [work]. i'm sending them all.'

he had obtained his victim's social security number when he pretended that he wanted to order furniture for her so he could open a store credit account.

he would meet women from cities such as new york city and atlanta through a host of online dating sites such as eharmony, match and seeking arrangement, the complaint stated.

the conman would also trick his victims of their money by 'forgetting his wallet' at hotels or shelling out cash for expensive office rentals once they believed they were hired by him, nbc new york reported.

to another victim, taylor allegedly said he was robbed at gunpoint and needed to use her credit card to buy things and spent $17,000.

taylor was arrested at country club in yardley, pennsylvania and police believe he was living out of his car during the scams.

he faces up to 30 years in prison for charges of wire fraud, bank fraud, aggravated identity theft, and threatening interstate communications.

do they fit the checklist on predators?





the other type of emotionally unavailable man is unavailable due to his relationship (or relationships) with another woman (or women). these guys are never really committed to a woman. they don’t see any relationship as necessarily permanent, including marriage - even if they give lip service to being “deeply committed” to the woman they are with at the moment. in truth, however, they don’t truly value their intimate relationships or take them seriously, because they are merely “playing,” even though engagement or marriage hardly seems like something to “play” at. they don’t take their relationships seriously because on some level - even if subconsciously - they know they can find someone else who will get involved with them if their current affair ends. what else would cause someone to repeatedly play his future like a crap-shoot without really fearing the outcome?…it is probably because women keep attempting to get close to him that causes him to keep moving from partner to partner or to keep adding partners. he is uninterested in experiencing or is unable to experience deep feelings of connection with anyone. check!…what is dangerous about emotionally unavailable men is that they are not authentically emotionally responsive. they are emotionally avoidant.…some of these men may have a sexual addiction that fuels their pursuit of rapidly revolving, superficial relationships. perhaps his sexual addiction takes the form of chronic and compulsive pornography use, a pattern that will diminish a man’s normal human responsiveness.… be aware that [this type of man] will come across to you as a devoted father and husband or as an upstanding citizen of his community. never discount the possibility that your emotionally unavailable man may have multiple hidden lives (always the case if he’s engaging in clandestine extramarital affairs) as well as being an emotional predator. for example: emotional unavailability, plus life he keeps hidden from you, his wife or his girlfriend, plus the keen sixth sense of an emotional predator, plus a sexual addiction - help these pathological men thrive at attracting serial superficial relationships.if he is a sexual addict as well he will have a hidden life of endless porn watching, masturbation, voyeurism, and even using prostitutes. many times these men will cover their perversions with heavy involvement in community politics, their church or synagogue or doing volunteer work. and they will make sure this cover is very visible so no one suspects. sexually addicted predators will not stop at you, they will go after your friends as well. they think nothing of telling your friend that you mean nothing to them and that you are possibly “imagining” the relationship. they will tell their wives the same things about you or any other woman they know insisting “she’s jealous of us and is obsessed with me.” they are masterful jugglers of time and people.…a woman’s availability itself is a deciding factor… “any port in a storm” will provide adequate distraction from the reality of his life.womanizers also look for women who will believe their stories about their home life. very few of them tell women how happy they are at home, how wonderful their wife is, and how they just really want to have extramarital sex with no strings attached. no, that usually isn’t the story line. the story line goes: “no one has ever really loved me, and certainly not my wife. she nags… doesn’t appreciate me… hates sex…”women take this hook too often. …they will be able to make him “finally feel loved… listened to… appreciated.” his need is not “once and for all to be loved” as much as it is to get laid, be amused and be distracted.a womanizer may be highly verbal about his relationships. he may share personal information in such a way that women mistake his sharing for emotional intimacy… he knows well enough that women are empathic to tales of empty and sad relationships… an interesting point is that almost every woman who told us her story about getting involved with an emotionally unavailable man said it happened at a time when her self-esteem was low. [she] was coming out of a relationship situation that had damaged her self-esteem (such as being abused or even going through a divorce). women accept far more during times of low self-esteem than they do when their self-esteem is sound. a belief that she doesn’t deserve a whole, satisfying and healthy relationship is a reflection of how low her self-esteem is. if a man gives a woman who suffers with low-self esteem a little attention… then too often she willingly falls [for him].the emotional predator is as bad as it gets. he qualifies as the pinnacle of poisonous and pathological… he could, in fact, be called the “emotional psychic.” that’s because it’s his ability to intuit and sense a woman’s emotional vulnerabilities that places her at risk. webster’s defines predatory as “having a disposition to injure or exploit others for one’s own gain"; it defines predator as “one that preys, destroys or devours.” that’s a good summation of this man. who but the most pathological among us would set out to exploit, prey on, destroy or devour?he will hone in on your vulnerabilities and read you. if he likes what he reads, he will follow up by luring you into his scary and dangerous life.predators have a natural ability for reading women who are lonely, needy by nature, emotionally wounded or vulnerable. the predator also has his antennae up for women who… have unfulfilled needs in their lives. …he figures out how he can squeeze into the vacant space in your life and what you need to hear in order to allow this to happen. …[they] “sense” which woman will make the best target for them. they don’t know why they have this gift or how they acquired it. …they have been working women over since childhood. a predator’s intuitive sixth sense is untaught. …an adult’s skills can’t compete with his abilities to scam, con and conquer. …emotional predators also fall into the mentally-ill category, usually under the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. most also have hidden lives. when you couple a predator’s natural instincts with a lifetime of skills honed by successfully conning, exploiting and injuring women, you have a man who is nothing short of extraordinarily smooth and capable of horrific dangerousness. predators’ motives vary. but you can be sure a predator wants something from you. that is the entire reason for the relationship. …there is something in you that he wants. maybe “all” he wants is your utter adoration or for you to exalt his ego. …maybe wants what you can provide to help establish his image so he will marry you (’good family man’). or maybe …he’s most interested in the pursuit and conquest of a woman… if he is a sexual predator, you are a target, whether it be for consensual sex or rape - depending on whichever way it plays out or whatever mood he is in.a predator does not “need” the relationship. early on… the predator is deliberately romantic. predators are shifting chameleons who can be all things to all women. predators are smooth as silk. …predators are listeners who will give up very little information until they are sure it will align with your history. …his selection is based on his need and your vulnerability. he knows it’s a matter of matching need with need. the more he knows about your needs, the better he can meet them. he has a nose for vulnerability, so women who have unmet needs “smell” especially good to him. he seeks women who need men who can “sense and know” them on almost a spiritual level. since he is good at this, he will appear to know you well - and quickly.


they like women who had absent fathers, angry mothers or neglectful and abusive husbands. knowing that many women are trained to believe that people are basically good at heart, predators will present themselves as men of honor and virtue…. but because he is a chameleon, he will listen closely to see if you also need a mentor, an adviser on some topic, a spiritual leader, or a male friend. during counseling sessions i’ve had with men who are emotional predators, some have verbalized their targets. one said, 
“i look for naive women. i like a certain vulnerability to her - that she trusts humanity without asking for proof. maybe she’s been hurt a lot so there’s a “woundedness” to her. that vulnerability makes them believe you, because they need to believe you.” 
another said, 
“i like the women who have been pounded down by men and those with childhoods that weren’t so good. they are particularly easy.” 
it is important to understand that each predator has developed his own unique style. he has a “type” or two of women he prefers because with those types he has mastered the approach, the dating, and the ‘end.’ he doesn’t have to think very hard if he just uses the profile he’s had success with. one predator may prefer recently divorced or divorcing women because he succeeds at playing that angle with them.… these guys can show a woman they definitely “get it.” they show you all the attention that the jerks you’ve been with haven’t. they say all the right lines that the men in your past could never verbalize. they are brilliant and insightful about what you need. they seem to know exactly every pain you have suffered. with more skill than a carnival psychic, the emotional predator can hone in on your every need, sympathize with you in such a way so that you believe you’ve met your long lost soulmate and sweep you off your feet… he’s… more insightful than a therapist. he “knows” you the way no one else ever has. this guy moves fast. he’s got to - before you figure out what his m.o. is. every woman should be suspect of the relationships that seem to be traveling in the fast lane on the super-highway of emotional intimacy. a predator needs to keep you so euphoric with compliments and lover’s talk that you aren’t listening, or paying attention. he is dripping with sincerity and clinging to every word you say. a predator wants to consummate the relationship with you right away, because time is against him.to move the relationship along and be indispensable to you, he must act helpful, comforting and generous. since he is working against the clock, he must find out what you need and then meet that need.while listening to you and observing you, he will glean a lot of information about your hobbies, interests, spiritual beliefs and value systems. he is the original identity thief. he uncovers and uses for his own purposes everything he can about what makes you - you. he will find you amazing, beautiful, bright and talented - like no one he has ever met before. he will align how he portrays himself with your needs and also your interests until you feel like you are looking at your twin.finally, another way predators succeed with women is by preying on their compassion. once a woman is in the grip of a predator, anything can happen.[once a woman sees their stories] for the crock they are and bust them for their fake opinions with them, they will try and turn the table and make it seem it was the woman who had emotional problems!(the original was written in the male gender; your predator may be female)

the cyber-lothario







are you writing to someone who is romancing you off your feet? does this guy seem to know just what to say or write that gets you a step or two further down the garden path?

perhaps more dangerous than the notorious internet rapists and murderers are the cyber lotharios. maybe you know one. smooth as silk. seduction is his native language. 
more dangerous, because these guys (well, there are girls too, but i am more familiar with the guys) are good.

these guys are the internet equivalent of a bill clinton, if bill clinton hadn't gotten caught. they are the cyber version of handsome -- they write beautifully, know just what you want to hear and tell you. they pour it on, and for a thirsty (abused, lonely, sick, divorced or just unsuspecting) woman, it is nectar from the gods. 

these fellows post on dating/ reunion/ single parents/ penpal sites indefinitely, waiting for the unsuspecting newbie(s) to the site. you might contact him, he might contact you, but like an expert salesman, he knows a pigeon when he sees one.

then slowly, softly, but determinably, he has his way with you. 

how do you tell if you have one of these guys on the wire? what if he is a really nice guy, really meaning every word he says?

well, one clue would be if you find yourself agreeing to or even doing things that you never would if you were in your right mind. particularly if that has to do with sex. or maybe money. 

these guys make manipulation feel like a warm bath. they profile you subtley, making it seem like they are "interested" in you and actually "care" about you. (they don't.)you just slide right in and it feels delicious.but there is a certain vagueness or inconsistency, particularly about past relationships, and perhaps about future plans. ("i love you but i can't be with you....", "i have decided we can never be together", saying "i love you" before they have met you and spent substantial time with you - and not in bed either!)these guys may reassure, but they also will leave themselves a way out. 

how can you tell? 
well, one thing you can do is ask for a relationship history. then pay attention to how he responds, as well as what he actually says. 

does he groan and moan about doing the job? is he grudging in what he tells you?

or is he open and serious, understanding what you are asking and why? 

does he seem to have trouble remembering his own history, what her name was, what order the different relationships came in?

does he offer some information but leave a lot of blanks in what he says?

is he reluctant to divulge, or does he sound like he is fudging?

or does he hold up one old girlfriend or two as the "one who got away" or the most "incredible sex/ relationship i ever had"? (making you feel inadequate or that you have to do things you're uncomfortable with to measure up!)

does he make you feel like number one; then over time - talk about the other number ones who left 'poor' him?

does he say he broke it off, then a few weeks or months later say she broke it off?

does he say "i never should have married my wife" (if he admits to being married) or "the divorce is almost final"?

does he get upset when you say you are going to run a background check on him?

does he seem to be moving you fast towards a romantic getaway?

maybe he makes plans for the two of you to meet, and reserves only one room.

or does he hedge saying he can't control himself and doesn't know if you should meet?

is he heavily sexually suggestive and titillating? do most chats turn to sex?

does he ask questions like "what are you wearing?" or "are you alone?" 

even though a new and legitimate relationship can be highly sexually charged, a guy who is seriously interested in you and a possible future with you will be protective and understanding of you and your feelings.

if you feel antsy, pay attention. if your hormones may be doing your thinking, put on the brakes. better to let this dangerous clark gable type swim away than to be left flat and busted.

it's not your fault






i feel so stupid -i should have known -i didn't listen to my instincts -it's all my fault



just some of the things the victims of an internet predator say.....


one of our discussion group contributors and a victim themselves - recently wrote the below to a reader who was blaming herself and was chided for her obsession to get to the bottom of what her apparent cyberpath was.



it was so powerful we asked and got permission from this contributor to reprint her response here (edited for clarity). everyone should read it and heed it.

there's no fault when dealing with a cyberpath. remember "predators hunt the wounded" - eopc



this contributor says:
let's get focused on him - the internet "friend" you say is not a cyberpath - because it was with him you interacted with and he's the cause for all the stress and suffering you are going through nowadays.

it's more than obvious (and i want you to take me seriously) this guy is not so wonderful as you think and say he is. an emotionally stable, honest man, who is looking for a serious relationship or even a friendship over the internet, will not create a profile on a sex site (such as adultfriendfinder or eroticy to name a couple) and won't try to find possible real/ serious partners on a sex site!.

you had a profile there because as you said, your marriage wasn't good. i understand. when we are in emotional pain we can do stupid things. but believe me, even on a seemingly innocent site like penpalworld, or reunion sites like classmates.com and the online dating sites, recovery sites, single parent sites, facebook, you can find idiots, posers, players, etc. (the predator stories on eopc will tell you just that!!)the possibility of finding them on a sex site is higher (sex addicts, narcissists, sociopaths, users and abusers love the internet and they place themselves on these sites just waiting for the next victim). a sex site can be the ideal place. they will find lots of people to communicate with, to chat occasionally, to have cybersex with and nothing more than that. casual, no strings. the difference is that on a sex site, they don't need to lie as much as they do on a dating or e-friends site.

this type of man - the one you e-tripped upon - when they feel someone is starting to get emotionally attached to them, they will do everything to get rid of you or drive you crazy. emails will go unanswered, generally with the excuse they are busy, sick or whatever their imagination can make up. or they answer emails with short lines like "i don't know what to say/ tell you" or "thanks" or "we will talk later."

they're either never online on skype, etc. (they are - they just appear to be offline - blocking those they're not interested to chat with). or they are there - putting on their away or busy messages or just plain ignoring you & purposely hurting you by putting these messages up. (usually busy with other women!)



they make it all your fault! 

they will even tell you they are busy working if you try to im them anyway. these guys are emotional vampires and mental sadists.


when something like this happens, its clear, they are not really interested in any type of genuine communication. i know by experience (although on a different level) it's time to say "bye bye - have a nice life."

unfortunately most of the times we can't. we have feelings - they don't. we would not do that to someone and can't understand why they are doing it to us. we blame ourselves for the situation and we wonder over and over, what have we done so wrong, to get such cold treatment. actually, we did nothing wrong.

however, they've allowed us to put them on such a pedestal that we can't see the real truth. we think they' the best thing in the world, better than sliced bread.

we idealize them and they knowingly allow it without telling us the truth.

so, i know what you feel and empathize with you, but he is not 'a great guy' and it wasn't your fault.you just didn't know the best way to deal with him. the best would've been ignoring him, but gradually he made himself an obsession to you, always in your mind, a fruit of your desire. your need for emotional connection made him into something he wasn't and it's not your fault. he could have responded to you and said something but he didn't. he let you dangle there confused... (this is a seduction method used by cyberpaths remember?)

keep them in suspense: what comes next the moment people feel they know what to expect from you, your spell on them is broken. more: you have ceded them power. the only way to lead the seduced along and keep the upper hand is to create suspense, a calculated surprise. people love a mystery, and this is the key to luring them farther into your web. behave in a way that leaves them wondering, what are you up to? (from lures of the online predator))
you are a sensitive caring person who doesn't just use and drop people when you are done using them - even online. he is.

and here you go blaming yourself. "it was my fault", "i shouldn't have said this and that", "i shouldn't have done what i did", etc... ok, you sent him some e-mails, even a love letter... all of us victims have done things like that. maybe because on the chats he was sweet, he called you "princess", but unfortunately it was just words he didn't mean.see how he avoided giving you his address? he doesn't want any type of contact with anyone except for "discreet sex encounters."that's not the actions of a nice guy.this isn't a normal person.keep that all in mind.the e-mail he sent you was 100% bullsh*t. i'd bet money he wasn't going to 'get married.' i also doubt he was 'in love with' someone. guys who are really "in love" don't go on sex sites looking for a little fun.he said that to get you out of the way and then to scare you he mentioned he would call the police if he heard from you again. this isn't the behavior of a nice guy. (typical predator move - now the victim is a "stalker" because they want & deserve answers! )he probably has many friends from the sex site he exchanges e-mails with, many others to chat with, many to have cybersex with -- both he and they: without any emotional attachment. that makes him "busy" and obviously he is not on a sex site for genuine romance.i'd also bet he was busy with other women online (you know what i mean).understand this situation isn't the way you have pictured it in your head: that others are good and you're a bad person for letting it get this far. this isn't true. don't beat yourself up this way.a good and nice guy would have interacted with you differently. the e-mail would have been different. he'd have been straight and honest with you. he'd have told you he wants no emotional involvement and just wanted sex. problem is this guy most probably uses and abuses women. it's obvious. he thinks women are objects.notice how that female friend of his told you if you had met him in person, you could see how flawed he was "in heart, mind and body". she gave you the accurate picture.he is not a nice guy, much less principled. he is another jerk on a sex site! there are thousands like him.although you don't think so, it's a good thing you didn't remain friends with him. he would have caused even more damage to you. at any moment he would have revealed his true personality and you'd see the idiot he is -- then you would have been reeling.i know, i have been there. study his motives and see how he is an idiot with a oversize ego who thinks women are good for only one thing: sex.sorry but he is a jerk, not you! stop blaming yourself!

man arrested for murdering and dismembering woman he met online







usa -- the man suspected of murdering a woman he met online has been ordered held on $2 million bail.

a king county district court judge found probable cause tuesday to hold 37-year-old john charlton for investigation of second-degree murder in the death of 40-year-old ingrid lyne, a mother of three from renton whose partial remains were found in a recycling bin in seattle's central district on saturday.

during the hearing, prosecutors revealed new details of the crime, including the fact that investigators believe lyne was killed in her own home, dismembered in her bathtub, and transported in her own car to the location where her remains were dumped.

king county deputy prosecutor jennifer worley said seattle police crime scene investigators "found bits of human flesh and blood in bathtub drain" in lyne's home, where they also located a 15-inch pruning saw.

lyne, a nurse at seattle's swedish medical center, has three daughters, ages 12, 10, and 7.

according to probable cause documents, charlton told detectives that he and lyne had been dating for about a month and that he had spent nights at her home on previous occasions. he said he and lyne returned to her home friday night after attending a mariners game.

"charlton claimed that he had been so intoxicated on friday night that he could not recall how he and lyne returned to her residence after the mariners game, or what transpired when they got there," the documents said. "he said he believed they had sex, and said lyne was acting 'weird', but could not or would not provide further details."

charlton said he was unsure how he left lyne's home, "claiming that he assumed she must have driven him back to seattle, where, he claimed, he slept on the sidewalk," the documents said. "charlton said that he didn't think lyne had plans with anyone else that night."
charlton said he spent the following saturday and sunday night at the home of an ex-girlfriend in lake stevens.


police said that during the interview, charlton denied having any injuries but that detectives "observed abrasions on his forehead, an injury to his lip, and to his chin. he also had scratches to his chest area and an abrasion on his left hand," the documents said.


the documents added that charlton has a criminal history in six states that includes convictions for aggravated robbery, felony theft, grand theft motor vehicle, fourth-degree assault and third-degree larceny. he also has arrests for burglary.


lyne's mother, jorga bass, texted charlton on saturday asking where she could find her daughter, who was not at home when lyne's ex-husband, phil lyne, tried to drop off their kids, who lived with their mother. but ingrid lyne's purse and cell phone were in the apartment.

he responded, "my name is john. i thought she was with her kids today?"

bass replied, "when did you see her last? she's not here, her phone is here and driver's license and purse but she's not, please respond, i've called 911."

"911?" charlton responded. "what's going on? we went to the mariners game last night but we didn't stay the night together because she has her kids today ... not sure what she had told you about me and our relationship."

"she's missing," the mother said. "what time did you see her last. a police officer needs to speak to you as you may be the last person who saw her. please call [telephone number]."

when charlton did not respond, she texted, "can you please call me? i know your name is john charlton so please call me."


in her final text, bass wrote, "please john, did ingrid say anything about someone coming to see her after you separated from her last night. we can't find her or her car. as i said her phone and id and purse are at her house but she and her car are gone without a trace. any help would be appreciated. we are desperate. she would never just go off and leave her family."


she apparently received no response.

charlton's next court date is thursday, which is also the deadline for prosecutor's to file any charges.


gordon hill, charlton's public defender, said at a court appearance tuesday that no forensic evidence had linked any particular person to the crime.


hill also said no time of death was established in the certification of probable cause that overlaps with time charlton was with lyne.


court records show the suspect's parents once sought a restraining order against him, saying they feared for their safety because of their son's drunken outbursts.


the records show that the parents of john robert charlton filed for the temporary protection order in 2006.


ray and joann charlton said their son tried to provoke a fight with them when he was drunk and abusive.


the petition was later dismissed at the parents' request.


a lengthy criminal history


john robert charlton was convicted of a 2009 felony theft in montana, negligent driving in washington state in 1998, and a second-degree felony for aggravated robbery in utah in 2006. court records also show a battery charge in idaho in 2009.


seattle police have said they believe the human remains are those of lyne, who was reported missing on saturday. she worked as a nurse in seattle.


friends say she had planned to go on a date to a mariners baseball game friday night with someone she met online.


seattle police found lyne's suv in downtown seattle on monday after taking the 37-year-old charlton into custody.


body parts discovered in recycle bin


on saturday, seattle police say three adult body parts — including a foot — were found in a homeowner's recycling bin in seattle's central district just after 4 p.m.  investigators later identified the remains as being those of lyne.

o'toole said the king county medical examiner's office will officially confirm the victim's identity.

in cooperation with the renton police department, a search warrant was served in their jurisdiction, and evidence was recovered, including telephone calls, that helped police identify a suspect.

police said, based on that evidence, charlton was arrested in connection with lyne's murder and booked into the king county jail for investigation of homicide.


neighbors quickly became worried


the last time neighbors say they saw lyne was at her mailbox friday before she headed out for her date with charlton. friends say the two met online and had been dating since last month.


in renton, lyne's neighbors say investigators were in the neighborhood all weekend.


getting choked up at times, edward franceschina earlier shared his concern over the disappearance of his neighbor ingrid lyne, who he says he saw more as a daughter.


“i don’t know; it’s not good,” said franceschina. “the purse, the telephone and everything was in the house.”


franceschina said he last saw the renton mom on friday afternoon checking her mail before heading to a seattle mariners game. when she didn’t show to pick up her kids saturday morning, her friends raised the alarm.


lyne was a nurse at seattle's swedish medical center.


detectives believe the body parts had been packaged and placed in the bin near 21st avenue and pine street sometime late friday or on saturday. the bin had been emptied of recyclables friday.

police say they searched other bins in the area but found nothing of note.

"i kept praying i was just overly sensitive because of my years of being in a relationship with one narcissist after another. even now i find it difficult to fathom how you can give so much of yourself to a person and have them so totally wipe it all away as if it never happened with no remorse & go on their merry way leaving a path of destruction and lies behind them. 
realizing someone you have known for so long, spent so much time talking with, did it all just to mind control and then use you is horrifying. the grief is no ordinary grief. 
after distancing himself from me, he can now tell stories, all of which are factually twisted, with the spin (telling people i am harassing him!) to make him look the victim. it's nothing less than soul murder." -- target of jeff dunetz/ gridney/ yidwithlid

"...for the first time in our relationship, i began to cry. i realized he was a total fraud. he said he "was looking for the right girl" in his dating profile. i thought, "how could he say that when he told me i was right for him?" i had changed myself at his direction and was at the point of exhaustion... i was horrified by the fact he used the same exact language in the profile as he did online! ...he threw me away, all the while blaming me for not being "good enough." how could this person call himself moral ... when he was a complete liar. -- target of brad dorsky

[he] included everything that was missing from my life, as if he could read my thoughts and make my wishes come true. i can see now he really studied me well and became "my perfect mirror." he knew exactly what to say to make me feel good; especially after being in an abusive marriage for so long with no attention from my husband. this man "love bombed" me and i didn't even know what hit me! -- target of keith clive

"being lied to is a hurtful thing. being conned by someone you love is a devastating thing. you find that the facade .... was lies on his part; and how empty & meaningless [you were to him]. it hits below the belt and it scars you emotionally, financially... you become a laughingstock... 

some say i am obsessed with this man, but in reality, i am obsessed with getting justice done. there can be no closure on this until that happens. even then i will never trust anyone whole heartedly with my love, my life or my money again. ...all i wanted was to be loved, and he turned that into a crime that suited his needs." -- target of william michael barber

"every one of us who have suffered at the hands of a [ ]cyberpath has a tale to tell, some of them shockingly heartbreaking. yet so called "friends" have the audacity to say "put it behind you and move on"?? yeah, right! say that to us when you've walked even ten yards in our shoes. you can't even begin to imagine what we've been through. the use, abuse and total manipulation we've suffered at the hands of somebody we trusted and lavished with love & devotion, is more difficult to come to terms with than anyone could ever grasp." -- target of dan jacoby

"for me it's never been about vengeance. this is about justice.” -- tina meier, mother of megan meier

"while doubters may still find it dubious that on-line romance could ever take the place of a real relationship, the husbands & wives of net-addicts are discovering that cybersex can pose a direct threat to their marriages. "...we went through it and a little while later [my cybersex partner]messaged me and said, 'if i message you again & ask you if we had sex, say no, ok?' i said, 'sure, why?' she said her husband is very jealous and comes on-line when she's on, to make sure she isn't netsexxing."

....pearl's husband was not as lucky. "my ex-husband, lee, would vanish into the basement every night for hours, saying he had brought home a lot of paperwork from the office. we missed a lot of parties and family events, but i never questioned it. i felt sorry for the poor guy, working so hard to give me and the kids some extras. then, one day when i was cleaning out the room, i found a sheet of paper under the desk with a love-letter printed on it." pearl was even more traumatized when she turned on his pc and found a sub-directory filled with hundreds of love-letters from different women, addressing her husband as "prince charming." "the prince lost his castle," pearl says sourly. "i changed the locks on him and filed for divorce."

carl salisbury, an attorney at killian & salisbury in east hanover, nj, who specializes in electronic law, notes that cybersex-related suits are showing up increasingly in american courts. "there was a case in maryland where a macdonald's franchise had an email system," says salisbury. "one of their employees was having an email affair with another employee, who was married. the manager screened their email and showed it to the married guy's wife!" when the married man sued his manager and macdonald's for breach of privacy, the courts ruled that the manager was within his rights to view employee email. and, as the cyber-population booms ...we can expect to see more irate spouses filing for divorce with on-line infidelity as grounds. "it's inevitable that we're going to be seeing more & more divorce cases as a result of cybersex," says salisbury. "there's such an enormous amount--and variety--of activity going on the net and the web, and the variety increases literally every day." -- how to have cybersex - gloria g. brame

"one would expect after 3 years of no contact with stone he would get the hint: leave us alone.

stone is nothing but an amusement now. seeing stone rant and rave to himself on facebook/blog sites, where he replies to his own replies of replies... it brings a slight wry smile to your face knowing that he can't get to anyone now, knowing that stone is tearing himself apart from the inside out trying ever so desperately to get an audience... someone to validate he is the victim... someone to acknowledge he exists.

even his one and probably only friend kevin carey takes the mickey out of stone; what makes it funny is stone is oblivious to it. however, as a leading uk psychologist has pointed out, there is no cure for stone's illness, no pills, no surgery and, no amount of psychological analysis or psychiatric treatment can cure him. the only treatment for stone, is not considered humane in these modern times and is akin to the treatment of a rabid dog. the only hope is for stone to get a new victim, someone that offends his inverted morals or (his lack of) moral subconsciousness.

stone's ranting would have you to believe that [victim 1] has "bilked" the government for £millions of welfare money while [victim 1] has sexual relationships with every married man in the uk & france, "up to 4 married men a day" - and sends stone' subtle signals that only stone can interpret', which stone has labelled "gas lighting". somehow stone sees the "gas lighting" as proof that [victim 1] still has a desire to have a relationship with stone. "subtle signals" is all that stone has, as stone openly admits that he has not received any emails from [victim 1] since feb 2008 when [victim 1], in a very polite manner, told stone to piss off and leave her alone.

these "subtle signals" - or voices in stone's head - have led to a combination of 4,259 emails (to date) having been sent by stone to [victim 1] and [victim 2] in the last 3 years: that's 3.8 emails a day, every day, day after day after day..., continuously for 3 years. that's not counting all the thousands if not tens of thousands of emails stone sent to third parties trying to get [victim 1] and [victim 2] put in jail.

not bad going for a blind man.

the voices in stone's head have led him to believe that [victim 2] is the world's most prolific hacker. according to stone [victim 2] is in control of russian mobsters, has infiltrated government servers to remove evidence and has hacked the fbi (to plant evidence). stone says that [victim 2] has complete control of the tor proxy network and other proxy networks. stone would have anyone that reads his crap believe that [victim 2] has complete control of his computer and internet connection, thus controlling all his email/blog/user accounts.

stone phoned [victim 2]'s work with "evidence of hackery", stone not knowing that [victim 2] had pre warned his employment of his cyberstalker. as stone read off his list of evidence, he was on speaker phone, the whole office were muffling their laughter... stone is now responsible for bringing humour to [victim 2]'s friends and a lot catch of phrases: "don't do a stone on me now", "let's stone-alize him/her" and "i'm going to get all stone on your arse."

the "prolific evidence of hackery" that stone has gathered trying to convince himself and the world, just so happens to coincide with a 14-month period that [victim 2] was being treated for a brain tumour - surgery, recovery and subsequent physiotherapy. yessssssssss, of course, [victim 2] was in icu with his laptop hacking stone's computer on a daily basis.

dealing with stone is like walking barefoot in the park... in one horrific moment you realise you have stepped on dog faeces, you close your eyes preparing yourself to look down and, when you do, it just confirms that the essence of stone has just squeezed up between your toes. as you clean stone out from in between your toes you can't help but to laugh...

yes, stone is a lunatic; the wires in his brain are not crossed, they were just not connected to begin with. it brings a smile to one's face knowing that in the twilight of stone's years the only purpose in his life is his obsessions. one could imagine stone on his death-bed... "ohhhh the lights have dimmed, [victim 1] is sending a signal," and "wait wait, [victim 2] is hacking my pillow case."

"text-based relationships are very deceptive. people know only the good stuff, and none of the bad. the missing pieces are filled in based on hope, not on reality."dr. s. king; pacific graduate school of psychology in palo alto, ca

"i know one thing, that exposure works!" - kristen rhoad,  victim of phil haberman

"when there is a question of who is telling the truth? see who has to gain by lying or bending history.  usually the truth teller has to expose a vulnerable part of themselves, which takes courage and honesty." - law professor, fordham university

"one might reasonably expect that the 3,500 mile ocean between gary stone and his victim would prevent him from attacking her. but he hunts her down - one minute like a love-sick puppy and the next like a rabid wolf - and his aesthetically-challenged face pops up on every website she visits.

stone has relentlessly stalked his victim on the internet for over 3 years now. during that time he has wrongly and repeatedly reported her for "welfare fraud" to innumerable authorities, including the fbi, the dwp, us immigration, scotland yard, the first minister for scotland, mi-6, and even mi-7... which exists only in james bond movies!

when stone found online links to his victim's involvement in a volunteer group in her local community, he emailed the leader of that group making false, outrageous accusations that she posed a danger to children, in a misguided attempt to blacken her name.

in recent weeks stone found online photos of his victim making a success of her volunteer work; he then stalked each and every person photographed with her and spammed their various facebook pages with his incessant drivel. naturally none of these victims read beyond the first paragraph of stone's word salad before clicking "delete and block this user." it provided mild amusement among the victims for about as long as it takes to wipe bird crap off your windshield.

as a former nurse, fired for harassment and insubordination, stone chooses to describe himself as a "retired nurse" on facebook. he uses his alleged nursing qualifications to prop up his ego, and has the audacity to email his victim's endocrinologist (a world-renowned professor in his field) with advice on how to treat her as a patient! stone relishes taunting his victim about her illness, and regularly provides his own wild diagnoses and recommendations about her medication.

in all of these attacks on his victim, stone really seems to expect to be taken seriously, when in fact he is making a global laughing stock of himself. stone's ramblings provide enough material for an entire conference on pathology, projection and pathos.

instead of stone announcing to the world (on facebook) about his colonoscopy, he should try trephination and stick the camera where his brain should be. [the first image here refers to the stone of madness: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trepanning]

but stone the energizer bunny knows no bounds!" -- victim 1 of gary stone
