notice
debkafile (english and hebrew) - founded in 2000 as one of the internet’s earliest news sites – is closing down, following the passing of its founder, the journalist and writer, giora shamis.
as chief editor, giora brought to debka his wide-reaching and special take on world conflicts, security, terrorism and intelligence, as well the experience of long service with prestigious media, such as the economist, bbc and us and world report.
our warmest thanks belongs to the wide and varied audience that frequented debka-english and debka-hebrew faithfully over more than two decades.
