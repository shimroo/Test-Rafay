latest album 'dreams'






















                    order now







wonderfully elegaic', 'beatific' and celestial’ - 'some of the most transcendent recordings released to date by the real tuesday weld' (concrete islands)


















'bone dreams blood'the first single from dreamstrtw bass player and moviemaker ( @drowning cowboy films  ) don brosnan made this strange and lovely fairytale film for the track 'bone dreams blood', a celebration of those we have loved and lost in london






























antique beat  + dream swing


















welcome to a little otherworld of music, films and songs created to evoke 'the way the future might sound when imagined in the past.'  we are called a 'much loved and lauded london alt. pop-art-pop band, poised forever on the brink of international obscurity".. and i suppose it's true: after 10 albums, myriad eps, millions of youtube plays, multiple tours and many collaborations with animators, film makers and other artists, we remain a cult band, outsiders on the edge of things. and that is fine - if you are reading this, i imagine it's probably because you're a bit of an outsider too. we keep going because of the amazing love and support we have received from supporters, friends and fans. if you are one of them -  welcome and enjoy this little magical world.x stephen coates
