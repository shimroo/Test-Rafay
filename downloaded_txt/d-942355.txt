family policy matters


3:45pmsaturday





 



3:45pmsaturday


founded in 1992, the north carolina family policy council is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and education organization dedicated to the preservation of the family and traditional family values.

they are engaged in a battle to retain the judeo-christian values that are the foundation of western civilization. these are the same values which supported the establishment of the united states and which are embodied in the ten commandments and in the founding documents of our nation.

from their daily blog posts, to our weekly “family policy matters” radio program, to their quarterly magazine family north carolina, the council strives to equip north carolina citizens with the information they need to understand the most pressing issues of the day.

their aim is to provide resources that enable citizens and policy makers to be fully informed on issues that impact the family. they take their message directly to where it impacts you.

once educated about the issues, citizens are equipped to become a force for good in their communities. to that end, the council works closely with individuals, churches, and other organizations to encourage participation in their policymaking process.
