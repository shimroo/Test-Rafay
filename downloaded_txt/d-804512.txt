comic con prep...





got started on my primary "special project" for this year's cci art show-- drafted a pattern for a "usagi yojimbo 25th anniversary" amulet bag... need to get the beads still. not sure if i want to do the background in black (hard on the eyes to bead...) with a red uy (per the sticker stan made) or white with black "ink" to make it look more like a "sumi-e"....scanned in stan's sticker... adjusted the colors... uploaded it to "easy bead patterns 2.0" software... corrected/adjusted the "pixels"... all in all, about a 2 hr process.

condor con 2009





i set up my table at the condor con art show this afternoon-- 80 pieces, which is less than usual. after setting up, i realized i had forgotten the bid sheets... and since the idea is to sell some of these pieces, i had the option of going home and fetching the beautifully (?) mail-merged and neatly printed out ones that were sitting in front of my computer, or hastily fill out 80 new sheets.... didn't need to think toooo long. it would have taken longer to fill them out, than a round trip home, and the thought of paying for parking twice (and for the gas) was barely considered compared to the risk of terminal writer's cramp. dear, sweet glen wooten, the art show director, is very patient with this sort of thing.... and the parking attendant didn't charge me for the quick in & out stop, so he's officially a sweetie, too.

homework project





this is an art project done in liu of an essay on "appreciation of buddhism" for the ministers' assistant program of the buddhist churches of america (http://www.buddhistchurchesofamerica.org/).i'm not sure how long it took to make-- doubtlessly, a lot longer than an essay would have. i still need to mount it properly, but first need to get another "calligraphy board"-- i messed up the one i was going to use for backing when i drilled the holes to wire the hanging bar to it.project stats: i designed the pattern; base fabric done in peyote stitch using 11/0 seed beads, 54 beads wide by 75 or so rows (not including hanging loops). bead appliquet/enhancements done with 15/0 seed beads. "thread" was fireline "crystal", 8# test. bamboo skewer for hanging bar. will be mounted on a japanese calligraphy board-- probably using adhesive "dots", since the wiring attempt was a failure, and the board on a washi "frame" used to display such boards. update: the glue dot thingies didn't work, either.... beadwork is too heavy. will probably sew it directly to the washi "frame".

first place winner-- bssdc member challenge





"too precious" necklacethe "challenge" was to use a baggie of beads-- mostly seed beads-- in various bright "jewel tones": sapphire, fushia, teal, and purple seed beads, and a few other smallish beads. the theme was deep jewel tones. http://sdbeadsociety.org/members/challenges.htmi added amethyst, apatite, citrine, and peridot gemstones (mostly chips/mini-nuggets), additional glass and paua beads, and the utterly, too precious hello kitty acrylic beads i got from chris prussing (http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5569264). the clasp is bali silver with a faceted amethyst.faq answers: no, this one is not for sale. yes, i wear it. to work. no, i don't have instructions-- i kinda made it up as i went along, and really can't say exactly how i did it... other than that each strand is a different length of strung beads, brought into a single strand to which is attached the clasp. i have no idea how much it cost to make, or where i got anything except the challenge beads and the hello kitty beads.... and i don't think chris has anymore of those (she has some very cool beaded beads, though...).

about me




kaytee


i live in san diego, ca-- married with two kids, two dogs, a beta and three  goldfish. also have a lot of "plant puppies" and probably enough crafts "stuff" to stock a small store....
i've been doing "crafts" most of my life. of course, just because i learn a new craft, doesn't mean i dropped any of the others... at least, not permanently.
my work tends to be “eclectic”—a polite way of saying “weird” in some cases. sometimes, i will do a “series” of related projects, but, in general, no two will be exactly the same… sometimes not even both earrings in a pair…. i am drawn to large, complex structures and bright and/or contrasting colors, and will mix a variety of materials— gold and silver, glass and stone, plastic and pearls…. 
however, i can work “small” and simple, and often experiment with color and materials combinations in these simpler pieces. the ones that “turn out nice” are added to my inventory— memory wire based jewelry, hair accessories, purse charms, etc. (the others are broken down for their parts).
