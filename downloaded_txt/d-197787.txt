tell congress: support the tax credit for union-made electric vehicles made in the u.s.







				tell congress: support the tax credit for union-made electric vehicles made in the u.s.
			

the tax credit of an additional $4,500 for union-made electric vehicles made in the u.s. is a win for uaw members, unorganized autoworkers, and the entire labor movement. the provision:supports the high standards in wages, benefits, and safety that uaw members have bargained for in the auto industryincentivizes nonunion companies to stop spending millions on union busters and to allow their workers to form their unions freelyencourages u.s. auto manufacturers to bring back jobs they offshored

information regarding dependent verification







				information regarding dependent verification
			

march 27, 2021letter regarding dependent verification:i have received several questions regarding the letter of dependent verification, the main issue is about privacy of information on federal 1040 tax form.  the attached is a letter and this is a second letter that provides a better explanation regarding the different ways you may provide verification as well as protecting your private information, especially the figures and amounts on your 1040 tax document form.  in brief if you send in your front page of your 1040 federal form you can white-out or black out all figures that relate to money as well as your first five digits of your social security number.  please leave the last four.   this verification of legal depends is required as a legal obligation that the uaw retiree health care trust is obligated to perform periodically.  hope this helps clear up some of the confusion.  please pass the word to other retirees on your email list or one's that you come in contact with.in solidarity,chuck mcdonald, chairmandependent verification letter

facts concerning union members and project 2025

there is a lot of discussion around project 2025, what it is and what it says. as union members, the plans outlined in project 2025 should concern us all. it calls for draconian actions that would make the american dream much harder to achieve for working class americans.
