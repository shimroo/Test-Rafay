 i am so glad we made a home at fbcnn. we have created a mini family through our sunday school class and i have met my closest friends there. they understand what it is like for new military families to be away from all they have ever known and love them as if they were their own family.” — christina and jeff taylor









 i began attending fbcnn 36 years ago, when i was 12 years old. fbcnn is my church because the people of fbcnn are my family. it is place i can go and feel safe, loved, and accepted.” — carol caldwell








 throughout my many years as part of this church, i have seen this church family faithfully obey god’s commission to teach his word and share his love, locally and in foreign lands.”  — ruby gilbert
