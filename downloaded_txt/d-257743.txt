  "union properties has been a great company to rent from! even from move in my property manager called to check and make sure that move in went okay! any time i have  maintenance needs they are very quick to respond, and always make sure to let any 3rd party maintenance companies that come by aware of my cat so she does not escape! even if i can’t immediately get into contact with my property manager there usually is still someone i can speak with to help answer any questions i may have. i would strongly recommend going through this company if you’re looking for a place to rent!"
