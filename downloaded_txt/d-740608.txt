hermann-grima house














this restored french quarter home built in 1831, includes a federalist architectural façade, original operating open-hearth kitchen, urban slave quarters, and expansive courtyard. the urban enslavement tour at hermann-grima house, looks at the experiences of those who were enslaved in an urban setting, how that differed from those enslaved in rural settings, and how the contributions of people of african descent have shaped new orleans. condé nast traveler voted it one of the best tours in new orleans and the only tour listed from a museum. we believe that nothing tells a story like a home. in addition, the property’s 19th-century carriage house is home to the the exchange shop, originally founded in the 1881 by the woman’s exchange and one of the oldest women-led non-profits in the south.hours open 6 days a week: 10am to 4pm*check our social media for last minute closurestour times: wednesday through monday; closed tuesdays10am, 11am, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm (*no 12pm tours)*reservations encouraged

crosses, coffins, and catafalques:  the business of mourning in 19th-century new orleans



sep 9, 2024




this blog post will discuss the ways in which mourning practices in america and new orleans reflect traditions from around the world; the commercialization of mourning, which was primarily geared towards a christian audience (white or free people of color); and profile a few local businesses were involved in this trade, and what types of goods and services they supplied—from transportation to personal accessories to tombs.

thanksgiving in nineteenth-century new orleans: preaching the case for and against abolition 



nov 20, 2023




thanksgiving is a festive occasion in new orleans today, but in the nineteenth century, southern states resisted the holiday. thanksgiving was a “yankee” holiday in the minds of southerners, partially because its story originated in 1621 in plymouth, massachusetts, marking it as a regional celebration. but even more so, the south saw thanksgiving as a challenge to the institution of slavery.

mardi gras for enslaved and free people of color in nineteenth-century new orleans



feb 23, 2022




pre-lenten festivals, such as the famous carnavale of venice, italy, the carnivals throughout brazil, latin america, and the caribbean, and of course, new orleans’ mardi gras, are often described—and idealized—as “festivals of inversion.” historically, as moments in which the populace were invited to indulge themselves in the earthly pleasures they would soon give up for the forty-day period of lent preceding easter, pre-lenten carnivals also quickly became moments for “permissible” social transgression—men could dress as women, women as men, the rich masquerade as poor, and the poor crowned as kings and queens for a day. while this kind of role reversal—what scholars have termed “social inversion”—undoubtedly has been a central part of pre-lenten festivities throughout their long history, many historians recently have sought to bring more nuance to the discussion of carnival. particularly when so many of the most famous pre-lenten festivals take place in former slave-holding colonies of the americas, it is likely that the participation of enslaved people and free people of color in these carnival celebrations differed considerably from the dominant narrative throughout the celebration’s centuries-long history.

urban enslavement in new orleans tour: the development process



jan 21, 2022




learn about the development process for the latest offering from hgghh. voted one of the best tours in new orleans by condé nast traveler!a century after the first enslaved africans landed on the shores of virginia, enslaved persons arrived to a newly founded french colony, la nouvelle orleans, in 1719. by 1830, the population of enslaved persons made up one third of new orleans’ total population. urban enslavement in new orleans greatly influenced the crescent city’s status as one of the most african cities in the western hemisphere, and these contributions are ever-present through the city’s celebrated culture.

the books and cooks of nineteenth-century creole cuisine



sep 3, 2020




over the course of the nineteenth century, cookbooks, often authored by women, became increasingly popular throughout the united states, including in the south. an 1839 article from the daily picayune commented on the trend: “once, our smart damsels and grave madams gave us sentimental confectionary in the form of novels; but now they give us the science of gastronomy, that comes home to our bosoms three times a day.”
