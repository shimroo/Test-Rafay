the cooperative learning institute is an innovative nonprofit institute established in 1987 to advance the understanding and practice of cooperation and constructive conflict resolution.  we have two missions.  the first is to advance the theory and research on social interdependence (i.e., cooperative, competitive, individualistic efforts) and constructive conflict among individuals, groups, organizations, communities, cultures, and countries.  the second is to educate individuals in the nature of cooperation and constructive conflict resolution through the use of cooperative learning (formal cooperative learning, informal cooperative learning, and cooperative base groups), cooperative schools (cooperative teaching teams, school-based decision-making, cooperative faculty meeting), constructive controversy (academic controversy to increase quality of learning and decision controversy to increase quality of decision making), and peacemaking (problem-solving negotiations, peer mediation, violence prevention).  our dual missions closely links theory and research with practice.  we are committed to conducting basic and applied research on social interdependence and constructive conflict resolution.  we are committed to developing, evaluating, and implementing state-of-the-art methods for cooperating, competing appropriately, engaging in constructive controversy, and using integrative negotiations and peer mediation to resolute conflicts constructively.  we emphasize making our conceptual and practical models and methods easily accessible to interested parties throughout the world.  the institute is organized into two divisions.an introduction to cooperative learningthe most recent cooperative learning publicationscooperative learning in practice
