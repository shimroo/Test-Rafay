my name is bill rigby and i would like to welcome you to battlefield hog chapter. our club consists of about 100 members, most are riders, some are passengers. our sponsoring dealership is battlefield harley davidson.

we are a diverse group of people who love to ride and have fun. our calendar is always busy with local rides, weekend overnight rides and week long trips. we get together for anything from ice cream to nice dinners out . we have done ghost tours, corn mazes, comedy shows, picnics, car shows, bike rallyâs, scenic overlooks, movie nights, cruises, fundraisers and more things than i can list. if you can think of a place or event, we can make a ride or get together out of it. to sum it up we love to ride, eat and have fun!

i recommend you come see us at our monthly chapter meetings and get to know us, we are a very friendly group of people from all walks of life. you can do as much or little as you want, there is no pressure or expectations. we offer member orientations and invite you to attend one of these. they offer a personal insight on how we function and ride as a group safely. we pride ourselves on maintaining a safe riding environment and only have two requirements. they are âride and have funâ!

what is hog?


h.o.g. is the harley owners group, a group of harley-davidson motorcycle riders and enthusiasts. there are two separate h.o.g. memberships: the national h.o.g. and the local battlefield chapter.








why join the harley owners group?

how does the membership process work?

how can i be involved?


there are really two questions here, first, should you get involved? then, how?the answer to the first question is an easy yes! you will get much more out of your chapter membership if you get involved in chapter activities. the relationships you will form with other folks in the chapter are key to your experience. after all, riding is great, but riding with friends is even better!
