tatamagouche centre is located in mi’kma’ki, the traditional and unceded lands and waters of the mi’kmaq. tatamagouche has been a historical and contemporary sacred gathering place for the mi’kmaq since time immemorial. since this land has been a sacred gathering place for the mi’kmaq for thousands of years, it needs to come under the stewardship of the mi’kmaq again. the name tatamagouche is derived from a mi’kmaq word which roughly translates to “the place where the water is barred by sand.” the land is our first mother and provides a spiritual connection to ancient mi’kmaq ways of knowing and being.
