original 
instrumental music 
arrangements
donationware mp3 
recordings
this
website

presents
over
500
mainly 
percussion
based
arrangements
of
classical 
pieces
with
fresh
colours
from
new
world 
instruments assembled in exciting ways. 
many
of
my
recordings
feature
combinations
of 
a
balinese
gamelan
orchestra,
marimbas,
steel 
drums
and
vibraphones.
these
combinations 
have
worked
particularly
well
with
ragtime
and 
other
piano
music.
more
surprisingly
the 
addition
of
ocarinas
and
flutes
for
orchestral 
pieces
including
symphonies
have
produced 
consistently
effective
results
for
all
but
the 
slowest
movements.

a
complete
set
of 
beethovenâs
nine
symphonies
have
now
been 
recorded  and published 
here
.


quality
the
digital
recordings
of
these
arrangements 
were
compressed
into
mp3
files.
they
are 
sampled
at
48k
hertz
and
encoded
at
192k
bits 
per
second
-
slightly
better
than
a
cd.
they
are 
suitable
for
use
with
all
your
mp3
players 
including
ipods,
ipads,
iphones
and
android 
devices
and
can
readily
be
added
to
your 
collection
by
means
of
the
relevant
software 
such
as
itunes
.
but
as
with
most
music
they 
benefit
further
from
good
quality
speakers
or 
headphones.



donationware - how it works
copyright: we retain the copy right on 
our arrangements for public performance 
or any other commercial application but 
grant you the right to download it free of 
charge for your own personal use.  
donation: if you enjoy the music i would 
be grateful if you would make a donation 
to the charitable trust fund run by 
croydon whitgift rotary club.








this project was inspired by emerson lake and 
palmer, wendy carlos and evelyn glennie
amongst others - the percussion arrangements
belong to a feel good electronica musical 
genre - more than old wine in new bottles - 
they are original recordings which repay active 
listening. for example our recordings of 
symphonies 
show how new world instrumentation 
can shed new light on even the greatest classical 
creations - bringing them to life in fresh and 
exciting ways whilst remaining true to the original 
spirit. this is  born out with our interpretation of 
numerous 
concertos
 and two symphonies by 
dvorak including the famous 
largo
.
