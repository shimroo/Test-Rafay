indigenous peoples and land acknowledgement
it is with gratitude and humility that the deerfield river watershed association acknowledges that we are learning, speaking, working, and gathering on the ancestral homelands of the mohican, pocumtuc, and western abenaki people, who are the indigenous peoples of this land in which our watershed lies. we pay honor and respect to their ancestors as we commit to taking active measures to conserve, protect, preserve, and enjoy the treasured resources of these lands.
