keeping your project on task and budget 



one of the most common ways for a building project to get off budget is by not staying on schedule. when it comes to the building industry, material shortages can delay your timeline and lead to overages. at howard lumber company, we go to great lengths to maintain an efficient on-site delivery experience, expert custom millwork, and quality window and door sales to help decrease your delay time and increase your bottom line. 















customization and tradition 



if the south is known for something, it’s hospitality and tradition! when building, it is the little things like custom moulding and trim that make a huge difference. preserving the tradition of vintage building practices and customization is something we are very passionate about. lumber and molding products are easy to come by; true artistry and craftsmanship are not. at howard lumber company, we are committed to restoring our past and carrying that tradition through to the future.  


























local history and presence 



we have been proudly serving the augusta area since 1930 by providing a custom experience for our community. we don’t just operate in augusta; our families live here. our company believes in a good old-fashioned handshake and a reputation that precedes itself. when you work with us, you are family. 















 







quality lumber products and services you can believe in 



there is a reason augusta sash & door has been in the custom millwork industry for as long as we have: we have a reputation for excellence. although we believe in doing things the traditional way, we also understand that convenience and efficiency are a must in the lumber industry. our company strives to use innovative equipment, tools, and products for the sustainability of our community, the building industry, and the environment.
