community testimonials 










						"the care and support i received at the buckingham were exceptional. thanks to the skilled nursing team and my commitment to staying active, i’m now walking independently again and couldn’t be more grateful for my recovery."					


jill b.independent living resident 






						“the team is taking wonderful care of all of us! good food, cheerful workers, many of whom stay on the premises 24 hours a day, impromptu fun activities and residents who help each other at every opportunity. i have lived here 12 years and wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”					


dorothy m.independent living resident 






						“the team in the memory care community truly care and do their best for the residents. the memory support residents are always out of their rooms during the day, there's lots of activities and the outdoor area is safe and beautiful (and huge!) and available to the residents at their desire. i would recommend to anyone looking for a safe and pleasant memory care experience.”					


adult child of memory support resident 






						“i highly recommend the buckingham. one of my parents had the misfortune to be in several disappointing skilled nursing facilities over the last year. once we came to the buckingham, it was such a relief. they provided exceptional care, especially their pt services. the food was wonderful, too. if we ever need skilled nursing again, there is no question that we would return to the buckingham.” 					


adult child of skilled nursing resident 






						“everyone, both the team and residents, are friendly and make life at the buckingham a great place to live. lots of activities for every level of interest and abilities. friends for dinner every night. assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing are just down the hallway — no need to travel to another building. best decision we could have ever made.”
