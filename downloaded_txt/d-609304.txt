general joseph 
              martin chapter mission statement 

(from general george washington)
"you have worn yourself 
              out with fatigue and hardship, but we know not how to spare you.  
              you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your 
              country which you probably can never do under any other 
              circumstances.  the present is emphatically the crisis which 
              is to decide our destiny."
