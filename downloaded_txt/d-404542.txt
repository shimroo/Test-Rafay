											why is my cockatiel plucking his feathers?
									 	

when your cockatiel plucks his feathers
your cockatiel can go from beautiful to bare if he gets into the habit of plucking his feathers. plucking goes beyond preening or molting. if your cockatiel is creating bare spots, take him to an avian veterinarian. your vet will check for diseases that cause feather-plucking. if it's not a physical problem, you'll still need to observe your cockatiel closely. at the same time, don't give him any attention when he's plucking. only pay attention to him when he's being a good bird. in addition, your vet can give you advice on any dietary or environmental changes your cockatiel may need.

											what do keets love to eat-can you name at least #4
									 	

feeding parakeets
parakeets are usually good eaters and enjoy a variety of foods. feeding parakeets a healthy diet can be fun and easy. whole grain cereal, orange slices, whole grain bread and broccoli are all treats my parakeets enjoy.

											what kind of perches work best for keeping my parrots toenails trimmed
									 	

perches that keep toenails trimmed
parrots do not like to have their toenails trimmed and most parrot owners do not like to trim. it is easy to trim too high and cause bleeding which creates problems of its own. we have found that the sandy perches are by far the best perches to have to maintain trimmed toenails. the more time your parrot spends on a sandy perch the better. these perches are actually manzanita branches covered with a sand mixture. we do not recommend the concrete variety as they will absorb the moisture from the birds feet. sandy perches come in several different applications ( cage perches, shower perches, chain swings, feeding perches, etc. ) to offer your parrot an opportunity to spend more time during different activities. this is deffinately a win - win for parrots and parrot owners. for more information on sandy perches, go to www.parrotsupercenter.com

											how can i keep my parrots toenails trimmed?
									 	

perches that keep toenails trimmed
there are several kinds of perches made that will keep your parrots toenails trimmed. stay away from those that are made of concrete. they tend to get cold and they break very easily. we recommend perches made by sandy perch. they are made from covered manzanita branches and are very durable and lightweight. these parrot perches work very well and our birds love them. sandy perches come in several colors,shapes,and styles.

											will frequent bathing help my bird through the molt?
									 	

frequent baths
make sure your bird gets plenty of baths during the molt. the old feather sheaths will come off easier and your bird will be more comfortable.
