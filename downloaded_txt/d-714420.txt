dear nancy, 65” x 77” mixed media  on canvas  2023



san diego-based contemporary fine artist



allison’s work offers multiple perspectives, discordant vocabularies, and malleable boundaries.  her art is informed by particles of our urban and natural landscape along with culture found in the everyday.  she is interested in how different “histories” of painting can co-exist in a single image.  this chaotic quality doesn’t always make sense, but it becomes and apt visualization for today’s open-source culture of sampling and recycling.

 mixed media



allison’s mixed media work is made up of fragmented images. these fragments create a universe that is seemingly random and difficult to decipher.  lines between the organic and man-made become blurred and a larger narrative is evoked.  fragments acknowledge interpretive ambiguities and open the work to sequences of spatial and temporal lapses.

shaw’s cove, 64” x 77” 2023





















































small collages
















untitled, 6” x 6” 2023



allison’s small collage pieces are metaphors, making the abstract concrete and mystifying the mundane. these pieces are essentially like a sketchbook where ideas and processes are quickly generated without any overthinking. memory and fantasy synthesize and unravel like a half-remembered dream.

 paper
















work on paper provides a quieter way of working.  while still employing fragmented images, paint, ink and graphite, the paper work uses negative space and creates a calmer aesthetic.  allison tends to bounce between the different ways of creating her work, often all at the same time.
