extensive new and used inventory
when you decide to buy a car, one of the first things you need to consider is whether to buy a new or used vehicle. the good news is that there are advantages for each. buying a new toyota means you can customize your car to your liking by selecting the exact features you want. it also means that you know your car's driving history is clean without any unknown issues. new cars are also covered by the manufacturer's warranty, giving you peace of mind when it comes to making repairs in the first few years of ownership. 
buying a used car also has its perks. for one thing, there are far more used cars on the market than new, so you have a much more extensive selection. we carry used cars in many makes and models at keith pierson toyota, so your options are practically limitless. used cars are also usually significantly cheaper, as the previous owner has already paid the steep price of depreciation, allowing you to get more for your money compared to buying new. 
whether you choose to buy new or used, our inventory has just what you're looking for. our new vehicles include every model of toyota on the market, so you can rest assured you'll be getting a quality-built car that will withstand the test of time. our used vehicle inventory includes a wide variety of cars, trucks, suvs, and vans that are sure to match your style and budget. as a driver in the jacksonville area, you deserve the best, and that's what you'll find sitting on our lot here at keith pierson toyota. 
first-class service department
our friendly and reliable customer service continues even after you drive your vehicle home. our service department at keith pierson toyota is your one-stop shop for all your car maintenance and repair needs. whether you're bringing your car in for routine maintenance or having something more serious done, you'll find comfort in the fact that some of the most highly trained service technicians in the country are handling your car. since our dealership is conveniently located in jacksonville, our quality services are easily accessible from any location in and around northern florida.
if you like to take things into your own hands and work on your toyota yourself, our service department is here to help. you can perform many routine maintenance tasks at home, such as replacing windshield wipers, brake pads, and batteries. if you're replacing these items on your own, you want to make sure you're getting the best quality parts for the job to ensure your toyota continues running smoothly. 
buying from us means you'll get genuine toyota parts, giving you peace of mind that the part you're getting is just right for your vehicle. these parts are crafted specifically for your make and model and are guaranteed to provide you with the same quality your car possessed when it first left the lot. use our online tool to shop for auto parts today.
knowledgeable finance team
the process of buying a vehicle can be overwhelming. that's why our friendly finance team is here to help answer any questions you might have when financing your vehicle. our goal is to guide you through all the steps of the financing process in a simple and transparent manner to ensure you can secure the right loan for your financial situation. our team can answer your questions if you're unsure whether buying or leasing is better. it doesn't matter if your credit score is sky high or you're trying to gain footing; our team is here to help. 
one of the first things you'll want to do when purchasing a new car is to find the value of your old one. our online tool can help you figure out how much your current car is worth. once you have this information in mind, you can use it to help you set your budget for your new car. the value of your old car can be used to offset the cost of your new purchase, so understanding exactly how much you'll be getting is a critical part of determining the price range for the search for your new car. 
once you've made the exciting decision to purchase your new car, our finance team is here to help you get approved for your loan. you can save time by filling out the application to get preapproved before stepping inside our dealership. filling out this application beforehand saves you precious time once you're at the dealership and itching to drive away in your new car. once you choose your car and are ready to drive away, all you'll have to do is finalize the paperwork that you've already started.
