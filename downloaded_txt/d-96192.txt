amy alkon:  "should have known better than to speak my mind on politics." my question to amy: "why should you?" you have the right to speak your mind on politics just like anyone else. if people don't want to be your friend because they don't hold the same views, what kind of "friend" could they possibly be?

apparently, men will spend about twice as much as women this valentine's day (via instapudit):men will do the bulk of the shopping this year, the survey found. the average male is expected to spend $168.74 – nearly twice as much as women – on clothing, jewelry and greeting cards, among other things.i wonder if this is because valentine's day to women is more like super bowl sunday for men? but did the women give gifts, help, free snacks etc. yesterday to their partners? this seems only fair.

	 the rage behind a woman's stare
	 
    


yes, this is the headline of a washington post column   (you may need a subscription to view it) about--you guessed it--women who do too much (thanks to the reader who emailed the article):like our love, women’s anger — the simmering rage toward our families, our mates and assorted males that can turn even the calmest woman’s expression into the death look — is always there. even when it’s the last thing on our minds....surprised by my sudden bitterness, i asked, “why do we keep doing so much with so little help?” “because no one else will do it,” ilena snorted. “because we can’t live in a house that looks like a cyclone went through it,” i added. because we’re the wife, we agreed. the mom. the girl.millions of death-look-wearing women ask, “what can i do?” yet few embrace the obvious answer: “stop!” stop with the cleaning, the arranging, the cheerleading, the shopping, the whole relentless shebang. some who do stop see their homes’ disarray devolve into a chaos that’s unbearable — for them, not their families..i wonder what a male death look would look like? a desperate look that says "stop with the body guarding, fixing the faucet, mowing the lawn, earning much of the living, the light-bulb changing, the honeydo list....  and on and on."but we'll probably never know because what men do is not valued by most female journalists and the white knight males who support them in their sexism. in addition, men keep their anger against women to themselves as complaining will only serve to get them tagged as a misgogynist or whiner. this needs to change.labels: men's issues

	 is nagging a marriage killer?
	 
    


wall street journal (via newsalert):it's more common than adultery and potentially as toxic, so why is it so hard to stop nagging?...nagging—the interaction in which one person repeatedly makes a request, the other person repeatedly ignores it and both become increasingly annoyed—is an issue every couple will grapple with at some point. while the word itself can provoke chuckles and eye-rolling, the dynamic can potentially be as dangerous to a marriage as adultery or bad finances. experts say it is exactly the type of toxic communication that can eventually sink a relationship.labels: relationships
