the tale of genji
























the tale of genji
welcome to the tale of genji site, aimed at promoting a wider understanding and appreciation of 
the 11th century classic japanese novel written by a heian court lady known as murasaki shikibu. it also serves as a kind of
travel guide to the world of genji.



ishiyamadera temple - where murasaki shikibu may have written the tale of genji.

written 1,000 years ago, 
the tale of genji has 54 chapters and over 1,000 pages of 
text in its english translation. it is generally considered to be the 
world's first true novel, and was certainly the first psychological 
novel ever written.
if you are planning a trip to japan, visiting some of the places 
featured in genji monogatari is a good way to 
start. these pages contain photographs of many of those places, and 
others mentioned in other literature of the time.
