bird friends of lake murray & san diego

















welcome to bird friends of san diego county. this site has evolved dramatically
		over the last eight years. it started with just a few birds photographed at lake murray
		and now consists of over 300 species that can be found throughout san diego county, as
		well as some additional species found elsewhere in the united states.
		

		each bird page below contains a brief description of the bird, where the bird has been
		seen, and one or more photos. some pages also contain a sound clip of the bird. please
		note that some photographs may indicate that they were taken at another location outside
		the county. these photos are only used if i have seen the bird within the county, but
		wasn't able to get a photo of it at the time. san diego has hundreds of different birds
		that visit/live here and this site is updated as often as possible. if you would like to
		be notified when new birds are added, then please join the mailing list.
		

		please  sign my guestbook with any comments you may have.
		you may also view the guestbook. if you have any
		questions, suggestions, find mistakes, or have recently seen a bird around the county that
		is not listed below, please feel free to
		
		send me e-mail.     -scott streit
