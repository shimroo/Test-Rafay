welcome to gauntlet press
welcome to gauntlet press, a specialty press devoted to publishing signed limited edition collectibles and trade paperbacks. while many of the authors we publish fall into the horror, dark fantasy and sci-fi genres we don’t confine ourselves to any particular genre.
we’ve published the likes of ray bradbury, richard matheson, f. paul wilson, poppy z. brite, stephen king and in 2013 we completed a ten-volume set of rod serling’s twilight zone scripts.  read more
