 clear creek distillery®

clear creek distillery was founded in 1985 with a vision to use the bountiful fruits of the pacific northwest to create fruit-based spirits that rivaled the best of their european counterparts.  using old-world techniques and sourcing ingredients from the local orchards and fresh water springs of mount hood in the oregon countryside, clear creek became one of the first craft distilleries in the united states.















clear (unaged) brandiesthe clear fruit brandies of france also known as eau de vie, which translates to “water of life”. most european countries have a local term for the clear, bone-dry brandies distilled from the regional fruit. usually bottled at around 80 proof, these spirits are typically served at the end of a meal, or between courses, as the perfect digestif. these fruit brandies are traditionally un-aged to maintain the wonderful intensity of the fruit. the heart of clear creek’s product line is our fruit brandies, which are all made according to old world techniques traditionally used in europe. we use only pure, whole pacific northwest grown fruit. our flagship pear brandy takes 20 lbs of pears to make one 750 ml bottle.our unaged brandies include: pear brandy, pear in bottle, blue plum (slivovitz) brandy, cherry (kirschwasser) brandy, douglas fir brandy, and raspberry (framboise) brandyawards & accoladesgold – bartender spirits awards (2021)gold – best of the northwest, sip northwest (2016)

























barrel aged brandiesmany of our fruit brandies do not benefit from the barrel aging, so we leave them water clear and unchanged.  apple and grape brandies are the exception to this rule.  they mature beautifully in french oak barrels, which give them additional depth and complexity. our aged brandies include: 2-year apple brandy, 8-year apple brandy aged 8 years, and oregon brandy (aged 2 years)















liqueursclear creek distillery liqueurs can be enjoyed after dinner served neat in a cordial glass, in cocktails, with champagne for a “kir royale”, or over good vanilla ice cream. the applications are limitless. they are truly delicious.our liqueurs include: cranberry liqueur, cassis liqueur, cherry liqueur, loganberry liqueur, marionberry liqueur, pear liqueur, and raspberry liqueur













grappagrappa is the clear brandy distilled from pressed grapes, also called pomace. these pressed skins, stems and seeds of grapes (a winemaker’s leftovers) are shoveled by hand into the pot stills. the clear spirit distilled from this pomace is the grappa. like wine, grappa can vary widely depending on the quality and variety of grape and the techniques used to make it. in italy it is traditional to serve grappa at the end of a meal where it is thought to aid in digestion. our grappa includes: grappa muscat













vodkaclear creek vodka is 100 percent fruit-based—fermented and distilled from 14 different varietals of non-gmo apples grown in the pacific northwest—and cut to 80 proof with glacier-fed spring water from mt. hood. distilled using a 46-chamber column still, clear creek vodka is not flavored, but offers the perfect combination of minerality and brightness accented with mild notes of crushed apple blossom.
