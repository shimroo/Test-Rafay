everyone knows how to do something. whether it's playing a guitar, gardening, carpentry, knitting, painting with watercolors,
                                             caring for an iguana...we've all acquired certain skills in our lives, and it's only right that we should want to share the
                                             results of our hobby and also share what we've learned about how to do it well.

on this site, i'm going to talk about my own skill or hobby. i'll give a bit of history on the subject itself, as well as
                                             some background on how i got involved in it. i might also include some instructions on how to perform my hobby, as well as
                                             any tips or tricks i've acquired through the years. and, of course, i'll include lots of pictures of the results of my hobby
                                             or of me enjoying myself doing it.
