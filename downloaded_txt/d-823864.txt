absolutely wonderful.
perfect house with every amenity accounted for. lovely touches often not included in rental homes like candy in the dining room, tissue boxes in every room, many garbage bins inside, post-it notes and postcards on the desk, plenty of hooks for hanging towels, kitchen towels, and a very sweet outdoor shower. the owner was friendly, accommodating, and clearly loves the property - it's not just a cash cow for them. i hope every guest enjoys and respects the property as much as we did. we will definitely be back. *one note - no bedspreads included, so be sure to bring or rent those or blankets.

our 2024 family reunion in cape may
the saltwood house could not have been a better location for annual family reunion. we had a fabulous time with relations coming from michigan, virginia, pa, ny and paris. the house is well-taken care of and in a great location in cape may. loved the m&ms and the york peppermint patties left for us too! have already rebooked for next year!

like home away from home
the saltwood house was absolutely amazing! we loved spending time rocking on the comfortable porch! the house was pristine and had every amenity possible! the location of the house was perfect- 1/2 block to the beach and features on-site parking!!!! we definitely recommend this beautiful house! we will be back!!!
