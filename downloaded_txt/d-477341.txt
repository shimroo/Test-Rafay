published  / by administrator


taig r8 and er25 ,er32, er40 and er50 headstocks now available
are you looking to upgrade your taig mill or lathe? glockcnc.com now offers upgraded headstocks to modify you taig. they work on the micro mill, micro lathe and taig-turn gang lathe. they will also be introducing their own 5c which will be more robust than oem 5c from taig tools. mainly because glockcnc will over much higher grade bearing options, such as abec7 and abec9. they will also offer larger bearings to avoid the “squish” that can happen with the oem bearings.

glockcnc is a full dealer for both taig and sherline, so you can get everything you need from them. they are also a dealer for tormach tts (although they aren’t a dealer for the mills or lathes from tormach). their primary products are upgraded spindle arbors mounted in their own heavy duty headstock and motor upgrades.
the motor upgrades offered for both taig and sherline are 750 watt and 1200 watt brushless industrial duty motors/drivers. their mounting system looks pretty solid. it’s my understanding that they will also be offering a wider variety of belt options. currently, the only belt option is what fits the sherline directly. they offer pulleys with that groove size to fit the oem taig spindles. it sounds like they will offer an option to fit 5/16″ linked-belts and a timing belt option.
spindle are sizes range from er25, er32, er40 to er50 for the er collet type. they also offer r8 spindles. those are great for use with the tormach tts system. take a minute and check them out.

metal stamping business

published  / by administrator



there are particular items that have actually to be produced only through metal marking: base weights, brackets, balance clamps, brake flanges, conveyor flights, bushing seats, engine bases, flywheel shrouds and friction plates. there are also various type of metal stamping consisting of: deep drawn marking, electronic marking, fourslide stamping, medical marking, progressive die marking and brief run stamping. the most commonly used type is the progressive die drawing wherein a metal sheet is drawn through a series of passes away and stamping is done by all the dies at the same time, hence substantially reducing the time it takes.
to a small degree, metal stamping is gradually replacing other metal forming processes like die casting, forging, producing and machining. the metals utilized in metal stamping can be more difficult than those used in other processes, hence making the end item more powerful.
in some cases, the sheet is likewise pre-plated prior to the stamping process, and then the product is cleaned up to eliminate excess metal marking oils and films. the item is then heat treated to make it more powerful given that it is still in the soft state after marking. metal marking likewise involves other metalworking processes like piercing, blanking, drawing and forming on the exact same makers.
stamping presses have particular force, speed and precision for providing a particular shape to the metal. there are two kinds of metal marking presses: hydraulic and mechanical. these are offered in a substantial range of capacities, sizes, stroke lengths and operating speeds.

metal marking is the procedure of shaping and cutting metal alloys into particular forms, specifically to be used as components for big equipment or structures. metal stamping is a very economical and productive way of producing numerous kinds of metal products on a large scale.
in metal stamping, the metal sheets are placed in a die or a press tool that has a specifically developed cavity that offers the preferred shape to the metal sheet. the upper part of the die links to the press slide while the lower part connects to the press bed. a particular element referred to as the punch pushes the metal sheet through the die, thus carrying out the real shaping operation. after pushing, the metal is plated with gold, tin, nickel or palladium to avoid corrosion.
in metal stamping, the metal sheets are placed in a press or a die tool that has actually a specially developed cavity that offers the preferred shape to the metal sheet. the metals used in metal stamping can be harder than those used in other procedures, hence making the end item more powerful.
metal stamping is the procedure of shaping and cutting metal alloys into specific types, particularly to be used as parts for large equipment or structures. metal stamping is a productive and extremely cost-efficient way of producing many kinds of metal items on a big scale.

guide to best reciprocating saw blades

guide to best reciprocating saw blades & re-sharpening them
a reciprocating saw is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of cutting tasks, including wood, metal, plastic, and masonry. the type of blade you use will depend on the material you are cutting.
in this article, we will discuss the different types of reciprocating saw blades available and recommend some of the best blades for specific applications. we will also provide some tips on how to choose the right blade for your needs.
the first thing we will address is sharpening reciprocating saw blades
until now, there wasn’t a quick and easy way to re-sharpen worn teeth on reciprocating saw blades. why is this important? because carbide and bi-metal blades can be expensive to buy.  yet they likely have enough blade teeth material left on them to be reusable. some professional quality carbide blades are $45 to $70 for just a three pack. if you can sharpen the dulled teeth even just once on those blades, you’ve cut your cost for the blades by half. you can now sharpen steel, bi-metal and carbide blades pretty quickly. seriously consider investing in a tigers teeth blade sharpener. they hold the patent on the design, so they are the only game in town. fortunately, they have priced them at about the cost of buying a good quality cordless tool. by the way, one of the best feature is that, they use cordless tool batteries that nearly everybody already owns.
the tigers teeth blade sharpener offers several single point grind wheels to sharpen different saw blades…this includes both reciprocating, circular saw, and oscillating saw blades. it’s main grinding wheel is designed to sharpen an entire row of teeth for oscillating blades. there’s too much to really cover on what the sharpener can do. you’re best bet is to simply go to the website to read more about it: https://tigersteethblades.com/collections/sharpeners

types of reciprocating saw blades
there are three main types of reciprocating saw blades:

bimetal blades are made of a combination of high-speed steel and carbon steel. they are a good general-purpose blade that can be used for cutting wood, metal, and plastic.

carbide blades are made of tungsten carbide, which is a very hard material. they are ideal for cutting through tough materials such as metal, concrete, and masonry.

fleam-ground blades are designed for making precise cuts. they have a thin blade that is ground to a very sharp edge.

best reciprocating saw blades for specific applications

wood cutting: for general-purpose wood cutting, a bimetal blade with 14-24 teeth per inch (tpi) is a good choice. for cutting thicker wood, a carbide blade with 8-12 tpi is a better option.

metal cutting: for cutting mild steel, a bimetal blade with 10-14 tpi is a good choice. for cutting harder metals such as stainless steel or cast iron, a carbide blade with 6-8 tpi is a better option.

masonry cutting: for cutting concrete, brick, or block, a carbide blade with 4-6 tpi is a good choice.

pruning: for pruning branches, a fleam-ground blade with 5 tpi is a good choice.

tips for choosing the right reciprocating saw blade

consider the material you will be cutting. as mentioned above, different types of blades are better suited for different materials.
consider the thickness of the material you will be cutting. thicker materials require a blade with more teeth per inch.
consider the precision of the cuts you need to make. fleam-ground blades are best for making precise cuts.
consider the budget you have. carbide blades are more expensive than bimetal blades, but they will last longer.

conclusion
reciprocating saw blades are an important part of any reciprocating saw toolkit. by choosing the right blade for the job, you can ensure that you get the cuts you need quickly and easily.
here are some additional tips for choosing and using reciprocating saw blades:

always wear safety glasses when using a reciprocating saw.



safety glasses for reciprocating saw



make sure the blade is properly installed in the saw.
use the right blade for the material you are cutting.
do not overload the saw.
allow the saw to cool down after extended use.

by following these tips, you can help ensure the safety and longevity of your reciprocating saw and blades.
