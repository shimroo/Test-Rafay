        all products are ce approved. 







inductive
          proximity switches (barrel round) ac type
electric inductive proximity switches are
        non-contact electronic sensors. they consist of three components -
			oscillator, trigger and output.

magnetic
          float switches
magnetic float switches are custom manufactured to
        user specifications and are available in a wide choice. 
        read more



capacitive
          proximity switches
used in - level control, presence control, level
        control of bulk solids and many more procedures. 
         read more












switch
          mode power supply (smps)
these are the switching regulators offers higher
        efficiency then liner regulators. 
        read more




intrinsically
          safe proximity switches
the products manufactured by us meet the standard
        specification and the individual component pass through stringent
        quality performance.
        read more












inductive
          proximity switches connecter type 
are used as the complete solution for no-touch
        object detection
        read more



inductive
          proximity switch (2 wire dc)
we are offering inductive proximity dc switch and
        inductive proximity ac switch. these switches can be used where extreme
        conditions.
         read more












brake
          interlock system
one of the major activities which everyone in the
        aircraft industry 
         understands as to be a challenging 
         task is that of refueling the aircraft. 
         read more



power
          packs & relay cards
the power packs that we provided are generally
        current converters which convert any form of current whether it is ac/dc
        to the desired range of other.
         read more












magnetic
          flow switch
the operation of the device is very simple as it
        monitors the flow and transmits back a signal to another device.
        read more



lubrication
          timer
lubrication timer is an automatic
        electronic device which is used in different industrial machines for
        providing efficient lubrication to the parts in the time fixed in it.
        read more












magnetic
          coil
an electromagnetic coil is an electrical conductor
        such as a wire in the shape of a coil.
