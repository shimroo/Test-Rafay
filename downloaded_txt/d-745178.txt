                damned near 85 years...
            


                    the original wanker's corner saloon & cafe was opened shortly after the repeal of prohibition in 1933. the head of wankers kept collecting more and more antiques, junk, knick-knacks, americana, australiana, movie posters, and many unidentifiable objects. that space became too crowded and a move to a larger building was inevitable. wilsonville was selected for its charm and accessibility.
                

















wankers is a collection of items from every time and every place.

                been here for a happy hour before but decided to take a friend (visiting from england ... they find the wanker thing funny) for breakfast. the portions were large, the food was good and the staff was friendly!
