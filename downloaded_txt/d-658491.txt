know god.
jesus’ life, death, and resurrection form the foundation of an incredibly attractive and deeply meaningful worldview. most students haven’t considered this worldview, and aren’t sure whether they can trust it. joining a bible study will help you to see and explore the christian worldview for yourself and help you build habits to cultivate your life with god.



get to know god






 











help others.
there are 1.2 million students in new york and new jersey on more than 317 campuses.  each one of them is loved by god. tragically, most students are unaware of this. you have the opportunity to help other students bring their full selves, make friends, know god, and help others, by hosting a bible study.
