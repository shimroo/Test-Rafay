 source page: the war of the rebellion a compilation of the official records of the union and confederate armies 




this month, werelate looks at the source page of  the war of the rebellion a compilation of the official records of the union and confederate armies. the war of the rebellion compilation was the first general publication of the military records of the american civil war, with the goal to "embrace all official documents that can be obtained by the compiler, and that appear to be of any historical value."
by an act approved on june 23, 1874, congress made an appropriation "to enable the secretary of war to begin the publication of the official records of the war of the rebellion, both of the union and confederate armies," and directed him "to have copied for the public printer all reports, letters, telegrams, and general orders not heretofore copied or printed, and properly arranged in chronological order."
the war of the rebellion volumes are a compilation of primary source materials in printed form. they contain records that were written at the time the events described were taking place. the volumes contain reports of battles, military operations, correspondence, orders, reports and responses of both the union and confederate armies. 

this source page, is a good example of the type of page that can help you in your research of your ancestors. (learn more...)
