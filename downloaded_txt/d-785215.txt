careers in the classroom
are your students curious about life after university? we have resources the can equip your students with what they need in order to launch their careers. integrating career education into curricular spaces enables faculty to lead students to identify skills, reflect on how classroom or program-level knowledge benefits their careers and prepares them for the employment process (co-op, work-integrated learning, post-graduation).










learn more about integrating
career education into curriculum


















earn while you learn
co-op is one option through which you can pursue your career path. you can explore jobs, gain valuable work experience and earn money while completing your degree. the centre for career development collaborates closely with co-operative education and the centre for work-integrated learning (wil) to offer innovative academic courses and career-building programs and materials.

preparing for a professional school interview? join us for some practice to build your confidence!
you will rotate through a series of stations and answer interview questions including current events, ethics, critical thinking, health topics, collaboration and personal reflection. some stations will be partnered to simulate a live, synchronous interview with an interviewer and others will be solo to simulate an asynchronous recorded interview. following the simulation, we will facilitate feedback, discuss your observations about the process, and share anxiety management strategies.

the university of waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the neutral, anishinaabeg, and haudenosaunee peoples. our main campus is situated on the haldimand tract, the land granted to the six nations that includes six miles on each side of the grand river. our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the office of indigenous relations.
