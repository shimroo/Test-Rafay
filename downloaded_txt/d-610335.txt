viability scan
this is an ultrasound examination that is usually carried out at 7-10 weeks of pregnancy. 


nuchal scan
this scan is carried out from 11 weeks + 3 days to 13 weeks + 6 days. the scan is usually performed transabdominally but in a few cases it may be necessary to do the examination transvaginally. 


anomaly scan
this is a detailed scan at 20-24 weeks of pregnancy. 


cardiac scan
during the nuchal scan (11-13 weeks), the anomaly scan (20-24 weeks) and wellbeing scan (30-34 weeks) we routinely examine the fetal heart and connecting blood vessels. 


cervical scan
this is a transvaginal scan to measure the length of the cervix (14-37 weeks). 


wellbeing scan
this ultrasound scan is usually carried at about 32 weeks of pregnancy. 









    












  



  
non-invasive prenatal testing




  





non-invasive prenatal testing analyses cell free dna in maternal blood and gives a strong indication of whether the baby is at high or low chance of having trisomy 21 (down syndrome), trisomy 18 (edwards syndrome) or trisomy 13 (patau syndrome).





the test identifies 99%, but not all, of the babies with trisomy 21, 98% of babies with trisomy 18 and 90% of babies with trisomy 13.
if you decide to have the test you will be asked to sign a consent form by one of our doctors or an appropriately trained member of our staff. we will then draw a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm. this may cause some discomfort but the sample is usually taken very quickly. sometimes there can be some bruising after a blood sample is taken.

invasive tests




  





chorion villus sampling




chorion villus sampling (cvs) involves the examination of chorionic villi (placental tissue). both the baby and placenta (afterbirth) originate from the same cell and so the chromosomes present in the cells of the placenta are the same as those of the baby.

amniocentesis




amniocentesis involves the examination of cells in the fluid from around the fetus (amniotic fluid).
the cells in the amniotic fluid originate from the baby and so the chromosomes present in these cells are the same as those of the baby.
