music 
      students should know how important ear training is for their development. 
      also experienced professionals still need to stay in shape, especially 
      with the rhythm. even those not interested in music should realize that a 
      "tone-deaf" ear will somehow affect their personality as a whole. the very 
      first requirement for a musician is to be able to imitate sounds. you hear 
      sounds in your imagination or from the outside world. you should be able 
      to replay those sounds using your voice or an instrument, and this is the 
      real task for any player or composer. technically this is what making 
      music means. musicianship starts here. a professional musician, especially 
      one with the perfect pitch may consider this as childish. in fact even a 
      pro should strive to improve the ability to memorize and replay 
      sophisticated rhythm patterns. this contributes a lot to better musical 
      phrasing. 
      
      it doesn't make sense for someone to learn how to read music or play a 
      musical instrument, and not be able to imitate sounds with the voice or 
      the instrument. 
      
      of course, music comes from the soul, it is not a mere juggling with 
      sounds, but too many times players from a lower spirituality platform look 
      better just because they have "a good ear", and a common misconception is 
      that this cannot be improved. the author of this program has plenty of 
      experience and i can assure you that the attentive ear can be improved to 
      the highest levels, even for someone considered tone-deaf. it requires a 
      lot of practice and discipline, of course.
