   celebrating black history month at coh



   

 at cathedral of hope, we honor
black history month as a sacred time to celebrate the immeasurable contributions of black individuals to faith, justice, and the collective journey toward liberation. the legacy of the black community—shaped by courage, resilience, and a deep-rooted faith in god—reminds us of the divine call to pursue justice and equality for all. from the spiritual foundations of the black church to the transformative leadership of figures like rev. dr. martin luther king jr., black history teaches us that hope and love are powerful forces for change. as we reflect this month, let us recommit to being a community that uplifts, celebrates, and stands in solidarity with our black siblings, striving together for a world where god’s justice prevails.
hope for all colors (formerly coat of colours) is an advocacy group that brings together black people, people of color, and all allies. we seek to decrease the cultural divide and increase a multicultural presence within our communities through spirituality, service, and social connections.



    we are a church 
of groups not 
with groups.
