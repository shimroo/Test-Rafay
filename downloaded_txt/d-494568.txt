sairath bamazing experience
amazing experience" this was the first thing we did after landing in fort lauderdale and i must say it was the best start of our vacation. if you are planning to take this, i would recommend going with the dinner and show. the experience is amazing.




juan pearrichsuper nice experience
it was a beautiful trip on the boat around the river and going to the entrance of port everglades. it's 1:30 hr trip with the super narrative of a ship personnel natasha.
in the boat you got offer drinks, beer, soda and chips. also the car parking is free. you need to ask for the ticket to get paid at the toll booth.
nice trip ... recommended!




jason pricethis was a great trip!
arlene the commentator was excellent. they had a good variety of drinks. arrive early so you can get a front row seat!! they load 30 minutes before push off time. you will see lots of beautiful homes and big yachts 🛥 would highly recommend.




shelsea saint-fleurnice boat ride!
i took the 90 minutes cruise ride and really liked it! the animator was really lovely and funny and made the experience so much nicer.the drinks were not that expensive and were really good!i recommend this cruise to everybody!




brenda bianchiloved it.
we did the tour with another couple and loved it.  boat ride was relaxing and the guide was knowledgeable.  the dinner was surprisingly good.  there was a nice variety show after dinner and it was very entertaining.  we felt it was an great deal and worth more than we paid.
