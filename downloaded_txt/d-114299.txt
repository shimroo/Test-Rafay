            leonard wins chubb classic for first pga tour champions victory

by the associated press


justin leonard won the chubb classic for his first pga tour champions victory, overcoming a slow start sunday with a back-nine charge on tiburon’s black course. leonard birdied five of the last seven holes for a 4-under 68 and a four-stroke victory over billy andrade. the 52-year-old texan won in his 45th start on the 50-and-over tour, his first victory since the last of his 12 pga tour titles in the 2008 st. jude championship. after playing the first 11 holes in 1 over, leonard birdied the next three. he scrambled for par on the par-3 16th, then got a 30-footer to catch the right edge for birdie on the par-4 17th and got up-and-down from a greenside bunker on the par-5 18th.

at least nine people have died in the most recent round of harsh weather to pummel the u.s., including eight people in kentucky. president donald trump approved a disaster declaration for the state on sunday. kentucky gov. andy beshear said hundreds of people were rescued from sudden flooding. beshear said many of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. much of the u.s. was also facing biting winter weather. the northern plains faced life-threatening cold, and strong storms led to one death in georgia. heavy snowfall was expected in parts of new england and northern new york. read morelatest blast of winter weather leaves at least 9 dead, including 8 in kentucky

crocodiles, monkeys, tigers, zebras and dozens of other taxidermy animals will move to new homes after concerns about arsenic exposure forced the closure of the south dakota museum where they had been displayed for decades. the sioux falls city council approved the gifting of the specimens to the university of notre dame, the oddities museum and the institute for natural history arts. testing in 2023 revealed arsenic present in 80% of the specimens. the museum then closed until officials could sort out the menagerie's future, which included passing state legislation last year. all 152 specimens will have a new home. none will be disposed of.
