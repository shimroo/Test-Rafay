"weston hurt gave the strongest performance of the evening as giorgio germont, alfredo’s father. hurt was obviously given the vocal gift of a gorgeous baritone, which is golden, weighty, and clear. his performance was faultless — stylistically on the money, dramatically committed, and displaying a vocalism that was perfectly even from the top to the bottom of his range." opera news
