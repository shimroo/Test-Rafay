pca 
                    worldwide was established in 1997.
to 
                    promote the profession of the caddie. through the years we 
                    have faced many challenges and have brought awareness and 
                    recognition to these unsung hero's and have discovered the 
                    many hardships and benefits this occupation has bestowed on 
                    those who worked as a caddie during their lives.
golf 
                    is the greatest game of all. 
                    the profession of caddying is the best tool to teach life 
                    and social skills
                    to those who have taken the initiative to work as caddie.

                    since 1997 the pca worldwide's vision has not changed. we 
                    are the only worldwide caddie association open to all caddies 
                    working or retired and those who would like to support this 
                    wonderful profession that has given so much, to so many over 
                    the past 500 years. we will continue to honor the caddie, 
                    their accomplishment by recognizing those individuals who 
                    have made a difference in the lives of others by recognizing 
                    them in the pca worldwide caddie hall of fame. we will continue 
                    to pursue products and services that make sense to improve 
                    the lives of caddie and the game.
