amsoil and racing

            many oil companies produce specialty racing oils for elite groups and do not offer them to the general public. 
			for instance, several popular oil manufacturers produce racing oils offered only to nascar racers.  amsoil 
			receives inquiries as to why the company does not offer "special," higher-quality or nascar oils.
			however, all amsoil synthetic motor oils are already formulated to a higher level than competitors' oils, 
			and amsoil dominator synthetic racing oils are no exception.  they provide maximum performance and superior 
			protection to all racers, regardless of their level of competition.  the same amsoil dominator synthetic racing 
			oils that are used in the engines of amsoil corporately-sponsored racers such as scott douglas and brady smith 
			are available to everyone.
			every professional race car in the world uses synthetics, and most of them have been using amsoil for 
			decades.  many have a lot of money at stake with their "big oil" sponsors, who want you to believe that
			what is advertised on the car is what's running in the engine.
			indy car racing legend bobby unser spoke at the amsoil 30th anniversary convention.  unser is a 3-time indy 
			500 winner, has 25 overall indy car wins and is a 13-time pikes peak hill climb winner.  he told the audience 
			how his race car differentials could not survive more than one race up pikes peak without needing to be 
			rebuilt, until he started using amsoil lubricants.  this experience in bobby's early years of racing began 
			his long relationship with amsoil synthetic motor oil and lubricants in all his race cars.  bobby 
			went on to say that "amsoil is the best synthetic lubricant made, the standard to which all others are 
			judged." hear it from bobby himself in the video below.

extended drain intervals mean less waste oil, less pollution, a cleaner environment
"improperly disposed used oil," according to the environmental protection agency, "is the largest single 
			source of oil pollution fouling our nation's waters. according to the american petroleum institute, it amounts to 
			"up to 200 million gallons of used motor oil... dumped every year down sewers, drains or in the ground." api 
			reminds us, too, that, "a single quart of oil can foul thousands of gallons of water."...
