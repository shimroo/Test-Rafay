            extensions            








                 
                virtually all architects have worked on a home extension at some point in their career. increasing the size of a property is perceived as a sign of success and a materialisation of social aspiration. in the climate emergency, extensions also help to increase a building’s useful life, demonstrated to varying effect by the projects in this issue. in large parts of the world, homes are built and gradually extended by residents themselves. whether planned by an architect or not, these extensions persist and crop up as residents’ lives change. as nancy kwak observes in the keynote essay, ‘this kind of self-help activity is the most important way in which cities have grown in the last 80 years’. read the full editorial

            good rooms + ar house            








                 
                what is a good room? for this issue, the architectural review asked architects, curators and writers to describe a good domestic setting – real, remembered or imagined. for some, the room is one designed by álvaro siza or jean-françois zevaco; for others, it is one depicted in an artwork, from a berliner zimmer in an 1845 painting by adolph menzel, to a pavilion painted in a 14th-century chinese scroll by ni zan. a few offered reflections on the absence of satisfactory living spaces in subdivided apartments or the disappearance of the living room in london’s overheated housing market. good rooms are also recognised in the ar house awards, now in their 15th year and continuing to question the possibilities of the house’s form and programme. read the full editorial
