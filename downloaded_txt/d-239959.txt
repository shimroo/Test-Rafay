sunset view is unbelievable!

… we found this little slice of heaven. the staff were beyond accommodating, the views in the morning were breathtaking …








california vacation

we were greeted with friendliness and professionalism… we are not simply told where the room was, but escorted and shown the room…. and what a room. absolutely beautiful…a perfect place to unwind…-mark b. 








wonderful classic hotel

…located on the bluff overlooking point arena cove with a view of the ocean. the new owner is doing a wonderful job remodeling and upgrading the hotel. our room was spacious, clean and had a lovely view.the hotel is close to the historic point arena lighthouse and has a hiking trial which winds along the bluff all the way to the lighthouse (about a two hour hike). we highly recommend the wharf master’s inn for a peaceful getaway in a beautiful section of the california coastline.-david








it’s all about service

… we wondered about all the rave reviews mentioning great service. now we know why! … the rooms and location at wharf master's inn are lovely … we felt like this is the way a hotel should treat its guests. i hope we'll be back someday.-barbara
