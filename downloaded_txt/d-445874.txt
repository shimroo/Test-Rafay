silverwood curriculum 
silverwood’s educational philosophy is grounded in experiential, project-based learning. we believe children learn best by working with their hands; creatively playing outdoors; and learning from teachers who love to teach. engaging with their environment, peers and mentors, silverwood students move through our school guided by these principles.



explore our classrooms






 











a 17-acre outdoor classroom
silverwood’s classroom buildings occupy a small part of our large, wooded campus. outdoor learning is a critical component of the silverwood experience.  whatever the weather, our students are outside. utilizing our outdoor shelters, or the overstory of our forest, teachers lead children in science, art, first peoples studies, history, play, nature walks and more across our campus.
