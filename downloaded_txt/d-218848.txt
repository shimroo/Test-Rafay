	 huffington post: hexavalent chromium, 'erin brockovich' chemical, found in tap water of 31 u.s. cities
	 
    


yummy!  cancer is fun!    :|

"hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium-6, first gained notoriety  when the film "erin brockovich" highlighted the plight of hinkley,  california, where the groundwater had been contaminated.  now the first  publicly available national survey on the contaminant from environmental  working group reveals that hinkley isn't alone.
laboratory tests commissioned by ewg have discovered that the  chemical is present in the tap water of 31 out of 35 u.s. cities tested,  or 89 percent.  norman, oklahoma; honolulu, hawaii; and riverside,  california returned the highest levels of contamination."
