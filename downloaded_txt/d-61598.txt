steps to success

future students




									picking your program
								

you will be surprised that you can choose to study one of over 70 programs at ivy tech. and the best part? they are all very focused on a career goal, so you know what your outcome will be. some of the most popular or surprising areas of study are:

nursing
smart manufacturing & digital integration
business administration
cybersecurity
engineering
agriculture

depending on the program you choose, you will earn a certain type of degree or credential. two-year associate degrees give you the skills and knowledge you need to start a career in a field where workers are in high demand. your two-year degree can also have you halfway to your bachelor’s degree at a four-year college you transfer to. certificates and workforce certifications, on the other hand, are shorter-term options. some of them can be completed in less than a year, providing you with an industry-recognized credential quickly.
not all programs are offered at each of our locations, so you will want to make note if it’s available near you. our website gives you many details about each program, including the various degrees and certificates available, what types of jobs you would be qualified for, and even your potential income.
need help determining what program is best for you? call us at 1-888-ivy-line (1-888-489-5463) from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily or email the admissions office at the location most convenient to you.

									navigating financial aid & fafsa
								

worrying about how you’ll pay your tuition should never keep you away from improving your career options with an ivy tech education. there are many types of financial aid available to our students, and we want you to find the best fit for your situation. getting financial aid can help you pay for college now and finish with little or no debt or a more manageable payment plan.
financial aid options
ivy tech offers students many ways to find aid that doesn’t have to be paid back. this gift aid includes grants, scholarships, and work study programs.

grants - a grant is tuition money given to students based on financial need.
scholarships - ivy tech offers hundreds of scholarships worth more than $7 million. scholarships are based on a number of factors, including financial need and/or academic achievement. many of the scholarships are tied to a certain campus. you must complete the fafsa and fill out just one scholarship application per year.
work study programs - you have both federal and state work study programs to consider as a way to help pay for your education. these require you to work a certain number of hours per week.
loans - this is money that you borrow from a bank, credit union, or other organization that you are required to pay back once you’re done with school. the payment you make back will be the amount loaned plus interest that is charged over the course of the loan.

starting with the fafsa
the fafsa (free application for federal student aid) is the starting point for all financial aid opportunities, and you must fill it out every year. it’s actually easier to fill out than you might think. this page will help you know what information to gather and the steps to take when filling out the form.
