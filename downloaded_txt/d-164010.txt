  about us
an american concept, started way back in 1983, that pushes the original concept to the limits. high-torque, high-rev engines. slot car handling. overwhelming brakes. high performance aerodynamics and styling. bullet-proof drivetrains. real world ergonomics. just plain high-tech stuff. all together. synergistic. each part of the system functioning individually to improve the capabilities of the vehicle as a balanced whole. each system functioning totally to create results greater than the sum of the parts. something good made much, much better.
