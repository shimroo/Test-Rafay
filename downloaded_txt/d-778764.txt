citizen voice 







most of us want our lives to mean something. given the chance, we would make the biggest impact possible, especially on behalf of those who need our attention and our protection.
citizen voice is a new and growing nonpartisan movement of people who do more than care—they act. together, we’re inspiring, informing and involving citizens on behalf of our neighborhoods, our communities, our regions and our world.
citizen voice…involving citizens…protecting the vulnerable.

check out citizen voice’s growth!
