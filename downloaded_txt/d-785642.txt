i am nearly ready to replace my ancient cell phone and (grandfathered) prepay plan of many years with a smart phone. i am tired of carrying both a pda (serviceable old palm zire 31) and a phone with me. and, ok, i want internet access when i want it. i have been researching until my eyes bleed, and they only thing i'm absolutely convinced of is that all service providers suck. i'm leaning towards a blackberry (curve or bold) or an iphone.so, i humbly ask of you: what cell phone do you use, especially if it's a smart phone? what provider? do you like them and why? heard any raves or horror stories?thenkyew for your time

the hopeless race to move thousands upon thousands books from the basement before the library is closed due to rising flood waters is heartbreaking. moving said books alongside seemingly half the community who turned up to help is... amazing. sometimes i really love this fucking town.

everyone thinks their own cat is the best. you're supposed to; if you don't, you're doing it wrong. mr. yellow tail had some excellent qualifications. he was mellow and friendly, talkative and playful, demanding and astonishingly low-maintenance. aizuchi's mom is of the opinion that he learned to talk by listening to the birds in his younger outdoor days. once indoors, after he stopped being such a nervous nelly and leaving the room every time someone turned suddenly or sneezed, he revealed himself to be the finest companion anyone could possibly ask for. we have been royally spoiled.we love you, buddy.

today's tally to this point:slept late: goodstill snowing: prettysnow still accumulating: not so greataizuchi  leaves to meet his parents, in town for their yearly eye exam, and take them to the hospital. i get a call: the car is stuck just outside our (detached) garage. i gear up and traipse across the back lawn and around the garage to meet him. shovel, push, shovel, push, push, push, shovel, push. not going anywhere today. more shoveling and pushing ad nauseum just to get the car back in side the garage. two heavy snows within a week and my back still hasn't recovered from the first one, when we had to shovel like mad before going out of town for holiday family visits. i notice, though, that this snow is perfect. beautiful and more perfect than i have seen in a long time.we make a big snowman. i fill the bird feeders, and aizuchi  pulls me around the yard on his old sled. we call it a day.today's tally to this point: awesome.

i love science fiction. at its best i find it inspiring, fun, challenging, powerful. i stumbled on two sf-related links today that interested me greatly.this bit of fluff is only lightly sf, but it's just too fun not to spread thither and yon. it made my day better.this deals with people who make and read sf, and is an infuriating piece of fucknuttery.oh, and this is where i wish i was this weekend. but i'll settle for a weekend with friends and good weather (fingers crossed).

subject:moving sucks. friends are good.
security:public
mood: exhausted

so. fried. yesterday was moving day, when we left our house of five years for another house in the city right next door. i'd been fretting for days, as in my mind's eye the new house got smaller and smaller until i was certain that we'd barely have room to turn around, much less fit all our stuff. i made a lot of cusses packing, lemme tell you. weeding is definitely in order.luckily, my memory was faulty and the house is indeed larger than a breadbox. we definitely have too too much stuff, but we can work on that. the move itself, though... that could have been an absolutely hellish experience. we are very lucky that many friends (importantly, good natured friends) showed up to help us out: awelkin and bryon, manzabar and ariesna, luke, sarah, diana and john, ivar and lisa, tim and wendy, jim and lucy, and latecomer laura (who stuck around today and helped us begin to muck out the old house). even with 75+ boxes of comics and a ridiculous amount of books et cetera, using the amazing line-o-friends we were able to fill and empty the truck quickly so that some of the fellows could go fill it again while the rest of use ferried boxes around the house. i was both impressed and deliriously grateful. speaking of grateful, thank you, weather, for not sucking! i was wearing a t-shirt and no jacket for most of the day.the cats reacted differently to the move. we cleared out the library first and shut them in it while we unloaded the old house. tail was a bit upset and bewildered, but kia was very vocal and adamant on getting out as soon as possible. once they were in the new house, though, tail -- an experienced traveler -- had figured it out and was taking everything in stride, while kia wanted nothing more than to hide. tail has been exploring constantly while kia tonight has finally stopped running back under the bed after ever short sojourn out. the old house is emptied out and pretty well cleaned up. we have yet to clear the old garage of some remaining house items, garage stuff, and things destined for the trash or for goodwill. the new house will i think take a very long time to come together, but all the major items of furniture are placed and unpacking has begun. most importantly, we like the place. i sure as hell hope we don't move again any time soon.

subject:linky halloween
security:public
mood: tired

had a good halloween this year. i've been really tired for awhile and so not very plan-ny, but at the last minute decided to tweak what i'd worn on talk like a pirate day. which was good, because not too many people dressed up at work this year, so every costume counted.continuing to build on the halloween momentum, aizuchi and i left work a little early to carve up a pumpkin donated to us by the lovely tsvet and sarah. finishing in time for trick-or-treating to begin, we were able to hand out candy this year to nearly all the spooks. we didn't take a count but i think we had a few dozen visitors, many of whom were quite young. no really outstanding costumes; several vampires and pirates, plus one ipod silhouette. a couple of kids gave respect to aizuchi's (bright blue) hair.once the lights were out we watched the latest torchwood episode and got to bed almost at a decent hour. and finicky mr. yellow tail ate his canned food for once, meaning he got the good-for-his-kidneys supplements we always add. i count the day as a success.
