    more about us
  










 


at cmds, our mission drives everything we do, from our academics to our athletics program. that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre thrilled to officially introduce gabe, our new guardians mascot! ü¶Å

gabe‚Äôs name holds deep significance, embodying the christ-centered values that cmds upholds. as a symbol of who we are, gabe inspires our students to lead with integrity, play with heart, and live with purpose. üíôüíõ

we are excited for gabe to join us in cheering on our school spirit, celebrating our achievements, and reminding us of our shared mission every day. welcome to the team, gabe!




 


our cmds families partnered with @mytownmiracles to bring thanksgiving to local families in need. our students and families collected enough items to fill 25 boxes with all the essentials for a thanksgiving meal‚Äîplus the kitchenware and tools to make it possible.

but this effort went beyond just collecting food. by involving our students in hands-on ways, we made this experience both meaningful and personal. a special thank you to our cmds alumni that currently attend ecs, who returned to campus to help pack the boxes‚Äîit‚Äôs always a joy to welcome you back!

we are so grateful for our families‚Äô generosity in making this mission a success. let‚Äôs continue to spread warmth, joy, and gratitude as we head into this holiday season!









our annual cmds thanksgiving chapel was a wonderful reminder of how we are each called to be grateful for all that the lord has done. students from each grade contributed to our worship: from sharing original psalms, to reciting scripture, to leading in our pledge of allegiance and prayers, they all played a special part in offering praise to god. ‚Äúgive thanks in everything, for this is god‚Äôs will for you in christ jesus.‚Äù 1 thessalonians 5:18










our jk feast was a heartwarming celebration filled with songs reminding us of all we have to be thankful for. students wrapped up the day by serving their families a delicious thankful stew, prepared with love. jk, we are so thankful for you! üß°










our sk students and their 6th grade buddies teamed up to create and deliver thanksgiving blessing mix to the cmds faculty! watching their friendships blossom is such a joy, and we are so thankful for these sweet buddy relationships. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô










2nd grade completed their domain unit on ancient greece and greek mythology. students chose their favorite greek god or goddess, then did research to learn interesting facts they could share with their classmates and parents. great job, 2nd grade! üá¨üá∑










our early childhood students had an exciting experience ‚Äúvisiting‚Äù england in their global preschool studies class! students toured london on a red double-decker bus, learned the art of proper tea party etiquette, and imagined life as a king‚Äôs guard. they also visited the iconic london bridge and built replicas of stonehenge! üá¨üáßüíÇüëë










today in chapel, we learned about how god sees and cares about our tears. 1st-6th grade students have been making ‚Äúbottles of tears‚Äù in bible class this week as a reminder of this comforting truth. some 3rd grade chapel helpers showed us some scenes from the life of jesus where we see our savior himself crying tears. how comforting it is to know we have a tenderhearted savior who draws near to us when our hearts break! we are so thankful for our verse of the week, which reminds us that one day ‚Äúhe will wipe away every tear from our eyes‚Äù revelation 21:4.





 


we are so excited to launch the homefield advantage campaign! our vision is to build a more sustainable, long-lasting space for our students and families to enjoy year-round. 

imagine an improved field with new backstops, playgrounds, & picnic areas where children can run, play and feel safe as their families relax and revel in the warmth of our cmds community. 

at cmds, our mission goes beyond education. we are committed to growing christ‚Äôs kingdom by creating spaces where children not only learn but are shaped in their faith. every classroom, every field, every interaction is an opportunity for our students and their families to experience the love and presence of christ. 

this heart for christ-centered community is why the cy‚Äôs field project matters. with your help, we can ensure that our outdoor spaces continue to provide a welcoming environment for children to play and families to connect year round. this is more than a field ‚Äî it‚Äôs an investment in the permanent spiritual and communal fabric of cmds. 

we all want our children to build meaningful, successful lives, supported by joyful & enriching communities. we want them to win. we might as well start with the homefield advantage.

choosing primaryan elementary school‚Ä¶
invests all of its resources in the development of young students. at cmds, we are solely focused on cultivating an authentic elementary experience.gives parents time to get to know their child. strengths, learning style, personality and interests are developed during a child‚Äôs formative years, and that knowledge makes it easier to choose a middle school.preserves childhood. our environment provides a safe place for students to take risks, explore their god-given talents and discover their likes and dislikes. they are not exposed to too much, too soon.offers opportunities for young students to lead. at cmds, 12-year-olds are the big kids on campus. so at an early age, our students are taking the lead in the school musical and campaigning for student council.















choosing co-eda co-ed school‚Ä¶
is reflective of the real world. our boys and girls learn how to work with and respect each other, which better prepares them for the years ahead.provides opportunities for friendships between boys and girls. middle school can be awkward enough, so a co-ed primary experience produces more grounded children who are comfortable interacting with each other.fosters leaders. boys and girls are given the same opportunities to collaborate and solve problems together. therefore all are emboldened to lead their peers.teaches to the individual child. we break through the stereotypes typically associated with how boys and girls learn differently. cmds teachers know each child as an individual and customize activities to reach every type of learner.















choosing cmdswhat sets cmds apart‚Ä¶
our teachers. cmds is a destination workplace, and our dedicated teachers go beyond the 8-to-3. they love on their students, embodying the school‚Äôs nurturing atmosphere, while also challenging them in the classroom.our academics. active engagement is more meaningful than worksheets. our inquiry-based, hands-on curriculum is designed to foster all the things that set children up for success. our steam initiative propels students to seek out rather than receive information.our encore classes. our encore program expands and complements the core cmds curriculum. students never spend a whole day with one teacher in their homeroom. they are instead immersed in an elementary, liberal arts-style experience.our graduates. cmds graduates matriculate to a variety of memphis-area schools, so after 6th grade, they automatically have friends all over town. beyond that, our pursuit of educating the whole child ‚Äì academically, spiritually, physically, socially and emotionally¬≠ ‚Äì leads to well-rounded students who are ready for their next chapter.
