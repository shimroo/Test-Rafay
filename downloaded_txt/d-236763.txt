diabetes awarenessof the more than 28 million people in the us with diabetes, about half will develop neuropathy, a loss of feeling in the lower extremities. this nerve damage means an open sore or injury on the foot may go unnoticed until it becomes infected, which can eventually lead to the need for partial or full amputation of the foot or lower leg. in fact, diabetes is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-limb amputation. take a step in the right direction by having your feet checked regularly by a podiatrist. when you add a podiatrist to your health-care team, he or she can provide you with important information so you're able to better manage the effects of diabetes on your feet.
