artist barbara  rogers releases her first book benefiting the university of arizona---available now at sarnoff's art

barbara rogers:  the imperative of beauty, the first book  to document tucson artist and educator barbara rogersâ life and work in  detail,â  is designed and produced by  marquand books, an award winning publishing house specializing in the design  and production of fine art books; and distributed by hudson hills press, the  premier source for books on 20th century art.â  this 224-page book includes 150 color plates  and 25 black & white images.â   thirty-percent of the profit from the sale of the book will be donated  to the barbara rogers graduate fellowship in painting at the university of  arizona school of art to provide support and encouragement to the artists of  the future.â â â  
the imperative  of beauty traces rogersâs  earliest influences and education, the shift in her practice following  hurricane iwa, and her work since that time, which has grown increasingly  complex and ambitious. three essays examine the evolution of her work.â  art historian, paul eli ivey explores the  work up until 1985; new york writer and critic, carter ratcliff, sees her work  moving from turmoil to serenity; and museum director and curator, marilyn a.  zeitlin considers her approaches to beauty and the tradition of ornament.â  interviews in the artistâs own voice reveal  the relationship between rogersâs life experience and her art. the book not  only documents the progress of an individual artist but also reflects the  trajectory of women working in the arts in the latter part of the twentieth and  the early part of the twenty-first centuries, and the challenge facing an  artist working in the american west outside the worldâs major art centers.
while much of contemporary art practice has avoided  outright beauty, barbara rogers has unabashedly embraced and explored it.â  âi want to remain vulnerable to beauty,â she  says. âi want to be stopped in my tracks by something i call beautiful that i  have never noticed or seen before.â

fine art   supplies in the modern society and digital age â 

by henry sarnoff
art   is as basic to the human experience as talking, laughing, or any other form of communication. it allows us to reach beyond any geographic limitation and even touch those in some distant future!! artwork that pre-dates any known civilization is still preserved on rock walls even after many thousands of centuries of history have passed. art is our basic expression of who we are as individuals and as a culture. artists throughout time have always found ways to express a particular point of view through the creative use of materials found in nature such as botanical or mineral pigments, hand-made cotton papers, and natural hair brushes. art has evolved with science and technology right up to virtual art and digital   printing. sarnoffâs offers everything you need to share your vision from the worldâs finest manufacturers, some of which have been producing materials for artists since the 12th century!
visionary artists have always sought better ways of making their dreams a reality. sarnoffâs is proud to offer museum quality fine art materials. hand crafted fabriano papers have been a favorite to this day.â  watermarks can be found in artwork and letters of some great artists of the period, such as michelangelo   buonarroti. sarnoffâs offers a full complement of the worldâs finest art supplies including legendary fabriano, arches papers, winsor   & newton, and many others. 
any   serious discussion about artistâs brushes must include kolinsky sable. kolinsky sable brushes   offer unmatched performance for water colorists so several manufacturers offer   them as part of their flagship line. windsor newton series 7 brushes were   created at the behest of queen victoria.
gustav sennelier established his art supply company in 1887. his oil   paints, pastels, and pigments have been a favorite of iconic master artists ever   since then. the sennelier client list reads like a whoâs who of top artists seen in museums and serious collections all over the world. sennelier remains one of the only companies that provide natural pigments that artists can use to create their own paints. many other brands of supplies and artistâs materials have been used throughout the history, we proudly offer them all.

sarnoff artist materials is the leader in providing classic fine art supplies in the southwest. we offer the worldâs best materials for professional and expressive artists. whatever you can dream, we can help you create.
