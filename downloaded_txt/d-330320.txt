original filipino (tagalog) child lullaby






i can very well still remember how my one and only daughter have come to be the sweet singer that she is today. one reason i would like to believe is that because as a father, i always sing her songs and lullabies and i can very well remember still a lullaby we were able to create out of sheer visit to the zoo in manila. this lullaby centered on a pet duck and a rat. i would like to put the full lyrics here and if i find time, will also put up and make an exclusive video of this tagalog lullaby we both made with my loving wife ana in manila zoo back in 1998.

ulan ulan pantay kawayan bagyo bagyo pantay kabayo






i remember back when we were kids, the title of this short note is a very popular pinoy poem song for us by our parents - mothers and fathers. it is a popular saying whenever rain pours on the roof and the rainy season is here in the philippines during the merry rain months of may-november.

yes, it rains and when it pours, it usually floods in metro manila. resorts all over the country have a hard time earning from their pools and hotel accommodations like that of a friend who owns a resort in batangas and today, typhoon santi is on and it's already october, a little less than 80 days before christmas and i still can't comprehend why typhoons still visit during this time of the year. never the less, we have come very well acquainted with these ber months as we, pinoys call it and now, halloween is fast approaching.

tagalog poem for nurses taking nle






nle ang tawag nila
sa exam na kailangan ay pasahan pa
ngunit di ba alam ng nakararami
na ang pinoy nurses ay hirap ding pumasa

oo maaari ngang ganun ang inyong akala
na madali lang ang sa nle ay pumasa
pero sa awa ng panginoon
karamihan ay pasado taun taon

sa inyong mga hindi naka hit
sana sa susunod ay inyo nang madawit
maisama ang pangalan sa board passers list
at maka move on, magtrabaho sa mga poea jobs abroad list

mother's day short poem





moms, they do know most everything
from clothes to the house, the kitchen to the garden
yes they are the ones we came to know
to see, to feel for and to love

this day, it's their day so what now?
what can we do in return
for all the caring, the fun and laughter
for all the ups and downs that you were there

mom on this day, mother's day
i can only give you one best
for which i have always had in me
love. i love you mom.
happy mother's day to all moms

healing of the heart: a poem for analie aguirre casuncad on valentines day





i've been writing my own poems for quite some time now and i must admit that this has been a habit since college days. the fact that i do means so much to others but to me, it means just like regular breakfast which we can't really skip if we have the money to spend. here goes for my love analie aguirre casuncad on valentines day.

while she watched healing galling tv 5 program, i came to realize why not write a poem for my ana and so here it is. hope you like it sweetie!

donaire vs narvaez live fight takes off sunday








sunday october 23, 2011 will mark another history in time for the donaire vs narvaez live stream fight will happen. the venue? it will be madison square garden boxing arena in wamu theater.

for those who have doubts that the filipino flash will win over this new and undefeated opponent in the boxing ring, them you better watch how nonito will demolish omar narvaez this weekend. i'm pretty confident that there will not be much display of skill in the middle of the ring but for sure, donaire will take out narvaez.

if you want to catch up with the live fight, then you will have to either watch it online or on television. if you want to see it on tv live, then you have so many options. first you can subscribe to your local cable to tv provider and next, you can try to get accommodations from a restaurant that offers free watching with a lunch order.
