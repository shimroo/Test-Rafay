welcome















the chicago based folk duo of jacquie manning and rich prezioso say it has taken them years of careful indecision to develop a repertoire they describe as "celtic to cowboy." superb musicianship and showmanship, award-winning songwriting, and a strong sense of tradition has made them, as dirty linen magazine once said, "one of the most polished, inventive, and entertaining shows on the circuit."

weâve actually been talking about doing this for at least two years.  nothing like a new routine to give you that much needed kick in the butt...
whatâs patreon?  itâs a great way of bringing you our music without all the driving.  you can think of it like a subscription.  for as little as $2 a month (doesnât that sound like the standard come on...) you become a patron, and in return we give you stuffâvideos, previously un-released studio and live recordings, short stories, and who knows what else.  weâre starting out âsimplyâ with a free video of jacquieâs song âsimple truthsâ recorded in the cabinoâthe "detached family roomâ she built in our backyard.  and if you become a patron you'll also get the never released studio version of david tamulevich's wonderful song "simple faith"--a long time favorite.
but wait thereâs more!  weâre also giving you âforever blowing bubbles,â a story from jacquieâs someday book, "extraordinary days in an ordinary life,"
we know itâs a lousy time be be asking for money, so weâre going to let you decide what this is all worth to youâall of our membership levels will get you the same stuff.  
thanks, enjoy, stay safe and hope we see you soon!
