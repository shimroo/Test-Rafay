the conservation and survey division (nebraska geological survey), the natural resource survey component of the school of natural resources, is a unique, multi-disciplinary research, service and data-resource organization established by state statute in 1921. the division's mission is to investigate and record information about nebraska's geologic history, its rock and mineral resources, the quantity and quality of its water resources, land cover and other aspects of its geography, as well as the nature, distribution and uses of its soils.
