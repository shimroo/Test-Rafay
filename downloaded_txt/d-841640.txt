enjoy an entertaining and free pdf book on physics,
the science of motion:
   
download the 5 free pdf volumes of 
the motion mountain physics textbook.  the 2021 edition, a beautiful 
ebook in a single zip file with ca.  520 mb, is in full colour and 
contains many films, stories and facts: every one of the over 2000 
pages is wonderful and captivating.







explore the motion of plants, animals, lightning,
satellites, charges, light and empty space itself! be fascinated by
molecular
motors, black holes, the beauty of nature and the simplicity of how it
works:
explore the principle of cosmic laziness – least action –, the maximum
speed,
the largest distance, the highest power, and gauge symmetry, the symmetry
that
explains electric motors, radioactivity and quarks!
a summary of the five volumes, and thus 
of all physics, takes just 9 lines.

the original english edition has been improved for over 20 years.








the free pdf volumes of the 2021 physics textbook
edition 
–  the paper volumes are a pretty present by the
way – tell about the race to make images floating in mid-air with
lasers, tell about the sound of falling batteries, tell about how to
measure images on the eye's retina in living humans, tell about the sounds
deep inside the earth, show the possibilities of very long baseline
interferometry for testing general relativity, include the new definition
of the kilogram and the other si units, list the effects of weightlessness
on cosmonauts, show how to multiply with fingers, explain how physics helps
with basketball, and present many other stunning images, facts and stories
about the motion of things, shadows, light, stars, planets, black holes and
quantum particles.






find out what fireworks, mobile phones and butterflies
have in common, how muscles work, how colours appear, how levitation is
possible, why we can see the stars, and which problems in physics are still
unsolved.  enjoy many wonderful puzzles about nature.  read about the great
advances in our understanding of the processes that surround us.  learn how
the story of the universe shapes our night sky, the sun, our landscape, our
bodies and all the atoms that make it up.  find interesting experiments to
repeat.  explore the power of the concepts that are used in physics.
if you are between the age of 16 and 106, you will enjoy
reading
these free physics books.  these videos show why.
whether you learn or study physics at school, university or college,
whether you are just curious about physics and want to learn about it by
yourself, or whether you want new ideas for teaching physics, you will
enjoy this free textbook.  if you want more motivation and an overview of
the wonderful stories and adventures that await you, read this section.



entertaining and surprising on every page, the five
free physics pdf files tell about

vol. i: sport,
raindrops and
animal life: mechanics, gravity and heat.

vol. ii: moving
empty space
and the sky at night: relativity and the structure of the universe.

vol. iii:
lightning,
lasers and nerves: electricity, optics, the brain, language and truth.

vol. iv: colours and the quantum of change: quantum
physics
and light quanta. 
vol. v: pleasure and
the stars:
biophysics, nuclear physics and radioactivity.


free download of
volume i - fall, flow and heat         (260 mb).


free download of 
volume ii - relativity and cosmology         (50 mb).


free download of
volume iii - light, charges and brains         (80 mb).


free download of volume iv - the quantum
of change         (38 mb).


free download of
volume v - motion inside matter: pleasure, technology and stars       
  (85 mb).


the motion mountain physics textbook is written for pupils, students,
teachers and anybody curious about nature: the text is full of telling
anecdotes, captivating riddles, unusual tables, astonishing photographs and
beautiful films.  it has been downloaded over 500 000 times.  it is a fun
pdf book that expands your curiosity and your studies. 




fun leads to fascination. numerous fun 
facts are found in the book, purveying the charm of physics.
the book makes the reader discover that precise observation,
description and thinking are worth it.  nature is beautiful and full of
riddles and wonders.  precision is important in learning, research,
teaching and business.  distinguishing truth, mistakes and lies, the
possible and the impossible, the thinkable and the
