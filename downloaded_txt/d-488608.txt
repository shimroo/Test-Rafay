sun 18th july, 2010.
        i've added another ceilidh chart, 
        comparing the number of ceilidhs per month this year to last year.
        this chart updates dynamically as ceilidhs are added to the diary.
mon 5th july, 2010.

 
        i've added a new ceilidh charts page that shows interesting insights into
        ceilidhs over the years. i'll be adding more charts very soon, but the first one is up. they all update automatically
        as time goes on. there's a permanent link to the charts page on the diary page.
        you can also click on the little chart image to get to it, such as the one on the right.
fri 18th june, 2010.
        i found some nice pictures and videos
        online from a recent assembly rooms ceilidh with the
        thunderdog ceilidh band. euan & stefan are looking
        good in the 
        first video,
        doing the dashing white sergeant as a four ;-) note: you can view the videos in high definition by
        clicking on "hd" at the bottom right of the video player.
fri 18th june, 2010. whatever happened to the cutting edge?
        the cutting edge band is one of my favourites. 
        i've not heard of them playing at any public ceilidhs since the 
        caledonian brewery decided they'd rather store beer than run ceilidhs. however, they have been
        spotted as recently as jan 2009, as this youtube
        video shows. for me they represent the best of modern, up-to-date ceilidh sound.
        have a listen - they really are good! it starts as the familiar traditional dashing white sergeant 
        but keep listening as they progressively become more and more samba. absolutely fantastic to dance to!
        i just wish they'd be booked for public events. 
        for any ceilidh organisers reading this: please book this band!
thu 10th june, 2010. 
        added an rss feed to the 
        ceilidh diary. now you can be
        notified in your newsreader when a new ceilidh is added. you'll need a
        news feed aggregator but there
        are so many to choose from these days. most browsers can display news, or you can
        use an online reader such as google reader
        or, my personal favourite, 
        feeddemon.
sun 6th june, 2010. 
        mikescommunity 2.0 is now live! testing was very successful so the old site was retired and 
        replaced by this one on sunday 6th june 2010. please send your comments about the new site 
        and your suggestions on what you'd like to see here, etc., to mike by clicking on
