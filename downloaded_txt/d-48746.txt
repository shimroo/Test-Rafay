different options to improve that area of our yard. bay area rhino court quickly rose to the top of our list because the product was durable, good looking, cost effective and could be installed relatively quickly. it has now been just over a year since our rhino court was installed, and we couldn't be happier! whether we're playing basketball, volleyball, or pickle ball, we have a blast together on the court. the product has held up really well, and i can't recommend it highly enough to anyone searching for a way to upgrade their yard! the company's owner, farrell was great through the entire process, and he has even come through for us recently. unfortunately, we lost a part for our net that connects it to the basketball post, but farrell helped us out by finding the part and getting it to us quickly. my family is so appreciative for his assistance through the purchasing and installation process and the continued top-notch customer support. read less   lisa mims    gavin
