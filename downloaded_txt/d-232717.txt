about us






welcome to the new school










the new school is a strange and wonderful place. here learning is not classes, or homework, or tests. learning is raising questions; finding ways to get answers;  and getting them.  learning is trying out new skills and honing old ones.  learning is about becoming attentive, self-aware, self-directed, articulate, and effective.learning is becoming a responsible adult. read more . . . our methodsmelanie j. hinerfounder of the new school



childhoodeducation is each child's personal achievement.  adventure, challenge, triumph, defeat, work, play, risk, struggle, and insight flower into the adult a child becomes.at the new school each child is both gardener and blossom.


















































our philosophy






the new school has a child-centered philosophy based on the beliefs that every person desires to learn, and that to become a responsible adult, children must have the liberty to practice being responsible.
