                became the most recent inductee to the international rock-a-billy hall of fame in jackson.  the induction came during the golden anniversary
                of sun records banquet at jackson’s garden plaza hotel.

melson in his comments

                the emotional attachment with people.  melson
                said that when he loved and expressed it in music the audience did too, sharing those life
                moments and emotions.  and when our heart
                broke their hearts did too, either by sharing their own heartbreak in our music or feeling
                our heartbreak through our the songs.
