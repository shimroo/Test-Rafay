american gypsy

america is home to one million gypsies, or rom, whose rich culture has long been mysterious to outsiders. a flamboyant romani leader invites us into this world when it comes under threat. in a quest to defend his honor, he leads us through the history of his people to civil rights courts, vegas casinos and beyond.

“a fascinating window… confronts the prejudice and misperception that the roma face in this country.”
