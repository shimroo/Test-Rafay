cpsc approves new federal safety standard for infant support cushions to prevent infant deaths and serious injuries 

the u.s. consumer product safety commission (cpsc) has approved a new federal mandatory standard to improve the safety of infant support cushions in order to protect babies from injury and death. by a 5 to 0 vote, the commission approved a new rule that addresses suffocation, entrapment, and fall risks

cpsc is aware of 79 infant deaths and 124 injuries between 2010 and 2022 associated with infant support cushions, with most injuries and deaths occurring among infants younger than 3-months old. the majority of these deaths involved the infant support cushion being used in or on a sleep product, including an adult bed or mattress, a bassinet, crib, play yard or on a couch, futon or toddler bed. 
babies can turn over and roll out of infant support cushions without warning. to keep your baby safer while using infant support cushions:  
                              
                            
- never use infant support cushions for infant sleep or naps. if your baby falls asleep, move your baby to a crib, play yard, or bassinet.
                            
- stay near and watch your baby during use.
                            
- only use an infant support cushion on the floor. 
                            do not use on beds, sofas, or other raised surfaces. 
- do not place infant support cushions on soft surfaces or in other infant sleep products, such as cribs or bassinets, or anywhere a baby sleeps. 
                            
- keep blankets and other soft items out of and away from the product.

baby walkers have caused injuries and deathsso why are they banned in canada but not in the u.s.?
                            safety experts, including the american academy of pediatrics and consumer reports, are calling for their ban 

hazard: sit-in baby walkers you can buy all over, including via third-party sellers on amazon and secondhand on facebook marketplace, have been linked to pediatric deaths and thousands of injuries. theyre considered unsafe by the american academy of pediatrics (aap), which has called for a ban on the manufacture and sale of them in the u.s. since 2004, walkers have been banned in canada, and experts in europe, australia, new zealand, and other places have also called for a ban.

cpsc says target, walmart, nordstrom, and babylist commit to stop selling weighted infant products 

hazard: cpsc has a clear warning for safe infant sleep: dont use weighted blankets or weighted swaddles for your babies. this matches the warnings from the national institutes of health (nih) that weighted products can pose dangers for babies, and from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) that [w]eighted products such as weighted sleepers, weighted swaddles, weighted sleep sacks, and weighted blankets are not safe for infants.  
                              
                            
there are multiple infant deaths in these products. as the co-chair of the american academy of pediatrics (aaps) task force on sudden infant death syndrome (sids), dr. rachel moon, explained to the washington post: when babies are first born, their rib cage is not rigid, and so it doesnt take a lot of pressure to press on it and create obstruction there. it makes it harder for them to breathe, it makes it harder for their heart to beat properly if theres pressure on there.

loss research project: would you be willing to share your thoughts on your journey post child-loss and how marketing has helped or hurt you along the way?
the project involves interviewing loss moms to see how marketing has hurt or helped them after loss (e.g., think of those formula samples that just keep coming and retrigger feelings of no longer having a child). the study goal is to find out if there are things that loss moms want from companies or anything that can be done to ease the pain and better honor one's child.
