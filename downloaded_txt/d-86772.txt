a note from “uncle” joe sciara
welcome to our pizzeria family

read more about uncle joe's journey






























since 1968, i've had the honor of welcoming millions of new yorkers and tourists from around the world into uncle joe's, one of long island’s oldest pizzerias and red sauce joints. we're not just a pizzeria, we're a gathering place where stories are shared, laughs are loud, and the pizza is always piping hot. this place was built on a hearty mix of tradition, quality ingredients, and a dash of that secret uncle joe's love. so sit back, take a bite, and become part of our flavorful journey that's been over half a century in the making.
