pirooz's e-newsletter: #1 - master shots and filming chase scenes





 how would you film a chase scene? could you make it better than this please?have you been using master shots in your films? have you seen any cool ones lately?i've been thinking about chase scenes a lot lately. they're a funny business, but they're also a signal that you're watching a proper film. so, do they need to have all these moves like we see from the master shots series? do you really need to do all that?maybe, you only looked at 30 seconds of each of the videos above. maybe, you went through each one. either way, i'd suggest you film a chase scene this week and post it. find out if you can make one that's better than the ones above without nearly being as complex. could it be as simple as making it clear what one character is after and why? do we need to stress this from the onset? would that make the chase scene more important? or do we not need to know at all why one person is chasing another? if the chase is complex and uses all the shots above, then it's a good chase scene, right?i'm not so sure. i will make a chase scene this week and post it up. i might make it live action, animation, or both. let's see what happens from this experiment.maybe you'd like to post your experiments in the comments as well. i look forward to what you discover. pirooz_____________________this is an unpaid filmmaking announcement to offer you tips on how to make your next film even better. if you'd like to be removed from this monthly e-newsletter, then simply reply with the words: "this is not the e-newsletter i'm looking for."

20 posts to make you popular in 2018








1. you run any distance with a pretty backdrop.

2. brunching and a foodie picture.

3. a political posting extremely to the left or right based on what your current friends would support.

4. behind the scenes of any type of photo, film, or production seeming shoot -- even if it's a no budget project with friends who will never release any portion of said film or even talk about the experience again.

5. picture of your pet showing it's belly or falling off a table or kissing another pet or falling asleep on said pet, especially if it's animals who are diametrically opposed i.e. "dog and cat", etc.

6. shot of you and your partner in a romantic destination with a caption that makes it seem like you have no problems and will be together forever.

7. shot of a younger child, related or unrelated to you, that is doing anything really.

8. any outdoor sporting event where you sit in the stands uncomfortable from the extreme weather, uncomfortable seats, or desire to be home instead, but force a smile like going to sporting events is actually enjoyable and worth another person's jealousy.

9. a shot of your office, view from your office, or view from a place near your office, or a view you manufactured because you have no view but walked out of your way to another building with a better view to rub the fact that you have this falsely constructed view makes you better than the rest of the world.

10. an announcement of your latest achievement, whether that's an anniversary, publication in a magazine, production company you started last weekend, premiere of your latest film, tv series, play, music video, or recital.

11. a doodle or drawing you did in a half hour while waiting for the internet guy or while you were supposed to be doing other work or because you decided to take up painting again after a ten-year hiatus.

12. you singing a classic standard or doing an original bravely and off key, but you've had several depressing postings in a row, so you get sympathy for the effort and encouragement to get back into it.

13. you doing any new age fad and taking a picture in portrait mode on your iphone to put the yoga mat, mediation candle, zafu, hand-picked organic goods just slightly out of focus.

14. a post about the dangers of the internet or pointing to a video that offers some doomsday warning akin to sarah connor from terminator.

15. a shot of you asking make-up or skincare advice, while also doing a new updo, make-up, or skin care tutorial.

16. a shot of you in something that shows off your slim body or symmetrical face if you have either of those, while you are posing in front of a fountain, ocean, sandy beach, reef, or cove, with a cocktail or beer close by -- even though these are just props and will be poured out or left for the beach patrol.

17. a video of loved ones opening gifts, especially if someone is young or old and seem like they've been forgotten by society until your kindhearted gesture made them become seen again through your posting with so many likes.

18. a meta-shot of you taking a selfie in a mirror with mood lighting in place and a skimpy outfit or with pouty lips that say "i'm alone with no one to play with", which is also the accompanying text to this image.

19. a picture of all the books, dvds, records you will consume, although you only read three pages, listen to one side of a record, and watch everything on netflix.

20. video of you doing any handiwork around your home -- even if this handiwork involves no work other than picking up a drill and tightening a screw -- as long as the power tool is on and whirring when said video begins, you will have the appearance of being very crafty.

stars & cars








los angeles is such a strange city. i was just talking to a friend, when i noticed peele from kay & peele sitting having a coffee -- and then thom yorke bumped into me on the sidewalk. that seems pretty crazy to me - such a stark contrast (between me and them) and so many stars simultaneously that i'm literally knocking into them. but that's the funny thing -- sometimes i might talk to folks, but more often than not, los angeles is a deeply silent city, where people rarely start-up conversations with anyone.

the only place i find conversations easiest is with lyft drivers.

cars are somehow still these intimate spaces where you can unveil yourself to a certain extent and hear about a driver's history with the russian mafia, the latest gadget for holding a steering wheel, or the long-story-short of a famous musician from iowa/utah/ohio who drives on the side for fun.

the future of hollywood





i spoke to my films students about this last week...

why hollywood as we know it is already over

will ai be the future? will films cease to exist and can i simply use cgi from beginning to end? will i finally be able to put brando in one of my films?

yes, yes, and yes.



2021


i do believe facebook will be one of many locations where we watch films, but what we consider a film will shift into something more authentic and participatory.

you'll see art house cinemas gain a new following. people will show up to bars and get a dose of a dj, film clips, a comedian, and a podcast -- all in one go. 

2023

mini lalapaloozas will become the norm. 

microbudget features will become popular for a year or two, as the need for content grows and technology and usability meet.

then, this will peter out


2025

users will make films of varying lengths. in some cases, these will not resemble films but a mix between cgi, photography, voice-over, and a peeping tom look into someone's life. 

everyone will be able to animate and create effects to various degrees. 



reality and non-reality will become synonymous.

drones will be able to follow users into any situation, and the need for fancy cranes, jibs, steadicams, and dollies will be obsolete.
2028

everyone will be able to make a certain type of film, and these will be the shared elements on sites, such as facebook and twitter. 

user content on youtube will get so good you won't be able to tell what is done by a production company versus a 17 year old kid in rochester. 
2032


physical skills, such as dancing, singing, or acting will seem as antiquated as painting or chamber orchestras.

2035

coding and programming will be the new arts. designers will come up with complex algorithms that will create virtual environments that can be entered and shared with other users. 

(imagine it like a westworld, but there's no need for robots. everything will be virtual.)

2041

physical touching and the exchange of fluids will seem crass. users will seek pleasure and intimacy in virtual environments and not need to leave their cubicles. 

a counterculture will grow that encourages the opposite. they will be seen mostly like nudists twenty years ago and will represent 1-2% of the world's population.
2047



memory implants and corrections have been surgeries attempted for years now, but new breakthroughs in brain mapping have allowed for a manipulation of brain receptors to be aligned with programming so the latest craze will be virtual experiences that coincide with memories and dreams that can be controlled extracted, amended, deleted, and shared.

the dream where everyone hated me








i had a dream last night that i was living in this house where everyone hated me. at first, i didn't know why, and i had to spend a lot of time trying to uncover the plot. finally, it was revealed that i laugh at everyone.

"really?" i asked.

"yup," one of the dream residents said. "as soon as someone walks away, but they're still within earshot, you laugh at them."

"really?"

"yeah."

i sat there dumbfounded. i knew i was in a dream, so i started to think it might be because i thought i was better than people, or maybe because i was underwater in some other way by being drunk or other things. i was still trying to solve the riddle when a group of the dream residents surrounded me and started calling me naive and stupid and other horrible things.

"i've never liked you," one of the dream residents stated very matter of factly.

"yes," another agreed--who looked strangely like daniel craig--"and when you did that scene with the knife the other day, that was dangerous. you could have killed the actor--"

"i don't think any actor was in danger--"

"it was dangerous," daniel craig resident said and started walking behind the group that was now in a half semi-circle around me.

that was when i noticed my cameras in boxes on the ground in a closet. they were boxed and being shipped off.

"those are my cameras," i said and pointed at the boxes.

"jeez," the matriarch of the house said, "you're staying with us and you don't want to share?"

"huh?" i said.

"we share everything--"

"but you didn't even ask me if you could rent these out. you've already sent them."

"man, this guy is so selfish," the matriarch announced to the group. "we don't know if we can be around a person like this."

"yeah," daniel craig piped up from the back.

"okay," i said. "i'm sorry. i usually ask people to borrow things."

"ask?" the matriarch shouted. "we do not ask!"

i woke up later and lied in bed for a bit. i remembered how dariusz rawa, a shaman, used to tell me that sometimes a dream was just a dream, and how other times there was something more to them. in fact, i might be confusing this slightly, because i now remember clearly dariusz standing over me--like he always was--saying, "the first thing think about in the morning is the first thing you need to do."

so i lied there with my dream and realized that i was and wasn't all the things the dream residents accused me of. i can be selfish, naive, and off-putting. i can also be the opposite of all those things. i can be quite selfless, wise, and charming. it really was a question of being superior. the dream residents had an agenda. they thought they were better than me from the onset and were looking for ways to oust me from the group. this has often been my relationship with groups. i hang around on the outskirts just looking and get pushed back a hundred feet for any reason that's suitable.

often, i find this same scenario in life. i might want something or to just be able to accomplish something good in life, and i'm met with suspicion or a pushing from someone who wants to exert control because they feel threatened or confused because my actions might have disrupted expectations. but i don't make films or art for success alone. my priorities are the creation and its evolutionary process. that's the joy for me. and working with a team. success is usually an after-thought and much more of an artistic experiment in trial and error without the financial or connected means to move a product like those in power do.

i realize now my dream is an affirmation that i'm doing okay. if the dream residents don't like me, then i must be doing something right. i don't want to live in a house with no rules where everyone shares everything and has no boundaries. rules are okay for me.

i also realize that the "dream residence" was similar to a hippy commune and that people who are super liberal are just as bad as people who are extremely conservative and constricting. the extremes make for a bad environment, because it's just as bad to be made to go to the back of the bus for your skin color as it is to be guilted into thinking a certain way because someone has an agenda.

these days facebook shows us people's daily agendas. everyone is posting on topics that are important to them. this is to be expected. but, oftentimes, folks want to start battles to get other people to agree with their agendas or platforms.

"why don't you like this post?" the agenda pusher might ask. "why don't you share this campaign?"

but i'm not here in this world to share everything. i'm just making things and trying to be helpful and good and myself. i can't help it if i'm genuinely naive sometimes. i also can't do anything if i seem that way because i don't agree with an agenda so much so that i disconnect from other human beings.

i'm here to make things and be with humans.

if i'm not invited to the parties, that's okay. our parties usually happen on film sets and writing sessions anyway. it's in those exchanges that i come alive.

then i walk the streets in la, and i talk to strangers, and i find that i'm not alone. we're working the night shift at a gas station, or running a magazine rack, or performing our hearts out at a theater, or driving home from a long day's work, or sitting at home on a computer reading the screen--and all the while knowing that we're all at the party, and it'll only take a moment to reach out to a complete stranger and say hello to have a genuine moment, where you might talk about working a shitty job and how everyone probably just comes to this magazine rack to buy water and smokes.

"yup," the guy running the magazine rack says. "usually cigarettes and snacks."

"well, i got my snacks," i tell him and hold up my coffee, protein bar, mints, and one liter water.

he smiles and peaks around to the front of the store to make sure a girl's not stealing out front. she turns to him. holds up a magazine, and says something unintelligible.

i open my starbucks frappacino, drain it, and then the salesman offers to throw away the bottle.

"you from la?" i ask.

"glendale," he says.

"armenian?" i ask.

"mexican," he says.

"what's your name?"

"jose."

"i'm pirooz," i say and shake his hands.
