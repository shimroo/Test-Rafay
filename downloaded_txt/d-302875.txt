monday first things - teachings of the holy fathers 




17/2/25, 06:00 amposted by fr. gregory
know that grace always precedes temptations as a warning to prepare. as soon as you see grace, tighten your belt and say, the declaration of war has come! watch out, you man of clay, where the malicious one will wage the battle.monastic wisdom: the letters of elder joseph the hesychast

scripture reading for the coming week 




16/2/25, 06:00 pmposted by fr. gregory
"this is the cause of all evils: the ignorance of the scriptures. we go into battle without arms, and how ought we to come off safe?" -st. john chrysostom, homily ix on colossians.in order to help increase the general knowledge of scripture in our parish family we present here for your edification the scripture readings for the coming week. at least one gospel reading and one epistle reading are assigned for each day of the year (although during great lent the readings are from the old testament). hearing or reading only those readings appointed for sunday merely scratches the surface of the great spiritual wealth that the scriptures provide us. some of the readings are easily understandable  others are less so. as orthodox christians we do not make private interpretation of scripture, but rather consult the fathers of the church for their explanations to aid us in our understanding. those wishing to have access to such explanations are asked to contact fr. gregory or inquire in the kiosk for further reading in this regard. bibles may also be acquired in the kiosk.monday: i john 2:18-3:10 & mark 11:1-11tuesday: i john 3:11-20 & mark 14:10-42wednesday: i john 3:21-4:6 & mark 14:43-15:1thursday: i john 4:20-5:21 & mark 15:1-15friday: ii john 1:1-13 & mark 15:22-25,33-41saturday: i corinthians 10:23-28 & luke 21:8-9,25-27,33-36ïîíåäåëüíèê: i èîàíí. 2:18-3:10 è îò ìàðêà 11:1-11âòîðíèê: i èîàíí. 3:11-20 è îò ìàðêà 14:10-42ñðåäà: i èîàíí. 3:21-4:6 è îò ìàðêà 14:43-15:1×åòâåðã: i èîàíí. 4:20-5:21 è îò ìàðêà 15:1-15ïÿòíèöà: ii èîàíí. 1:1-13 è îò ìàðêà 15:22-25,33-41ñóááîòà: i êîð. 10:23-28 è îò ëóêè 21:8-9,25-27,33-36please find below several very nice articles on how to read the scripture from an orthodox point of view.by st. justin (popovich)by bishop kalistos (ware)
