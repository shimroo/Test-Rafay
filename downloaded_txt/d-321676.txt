(my passion and hobby)

my labrador retrievers are for conformation,
hunt tests, obedience, public service, bird hunting, agility, and lovable
companions. i believe that labrador retrievers should possess the 6 ts: excellent
temperament, trainability, english type, correct bite/detention - teeth,
a strong topline and a correct tailset with an otter tail which are the
foundation of the labrador retriever breed.

 when god had made the earth and sky, 
      the flowers and the trees,  he then made all the animals,
 the fish, the birds and bees.  and when at last he'd
      finished  not one was quite the same.  he said i'll
      walk this world of mine  and give each one a name. 
      and so he traveled far and wide  and everywhere he went,
 a little creature followed him  until it's strength was
      spent.  when all were named upon the earth  and in
      the sky and sea,  the little creature said, "dear lord, 
      there's no name left for me."  kindly, the father said to him,
 "i've left you to the end.  i've turned my own name back
      to front  and called you dog, my friend."  - - - author

  a righteous man cares for the needs
      of his animal, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.  proverbs
