news













the cleveland press was a daily newspaper that was published in cleveland, ohio, from 1878 to 1982. the paper was known for its in-depth coverage of local news, sports, and politics, as well as its pulitzer prize-winning investigative reporting.
at its peak, the cleveland press was one of the largest and most influential newspapers in ohio, with a circulation of over 250,000 readers. the paper covered major events in cleveland’s history, including the city’s rise as an industrial powerhouse in the early 20th century, the great depression, and the civil rights movement.
the cleveland press was also known for its sports coverage, particularly its coverage of the cleveland indians and the cleveland browns. the paper’s sports writers were renowned for their ability to capture the excitement and drama of the games and to provide readers with in-depth analysis and commentary.
despite its success, the cleveland press faced financial difficulties in the 1970s and 1980s due to rising costs and declining circulation. in 1982, the paper was sold to the rival cleveland plain dealer, which absorbed many of its staff and assets. the last edition of the cleveland press was published on june 17, 1982, marking the end of an era in cleveland journalism.
