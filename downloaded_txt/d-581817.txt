about the rowe center
since its inception in 1924 as a summer camp for youth and young adults, the rowe center has existed as a place of acceptance, learning and growth for individuals of all ages. in the 1970’s the rowe center expanded into year round adult programing, and in 2020 the rowe center expanded online. 
regardless of how we go about fulfilling it, our mission has remained the same: to make the world a better place. to provide a container for a wide variety of ideas and experiences. to create an environment that is safe and welcoming while encouraging individuals to look deep within themselves and explore sometimes uncomfortable topics.
