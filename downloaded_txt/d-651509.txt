graphitewhile i’m better known for fiberglass rods, i also really enjoy designing, building, and fishing great graphite rods as well.  like any other material used to make a fly rod, graphite has both positive and negative attributes.  the key to optimum performance is taking full advantage of graphite’s positive qualities and keeping the negatives ones in check.

fiberglassfor over a decade mcfarland glass rods have been considered by many to be the finest glass rods ever produced.  since i built my first glass rods over 20 years ago i have been constantly experimenting with tapers and different glass materials to push the envelope of what is possible in a fiberglass rod.  i have taken my knowledge and experiences from working with bamboo rods and tapers and applied these concepts to glass rod design.
