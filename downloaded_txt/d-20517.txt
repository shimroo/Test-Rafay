   testimonials

i would highly recommend ashford management services to any rental property owner.  i am always skeptical about dealings in the business world, but from the beginning the agents of ashford showed that were looking out for my best interests and earned my trust.  i have friends who are experienced landlords, and they tell me that a significant percentage of would-be tenants in the valley are scam artists, so i would never advise inexperienced rental property owners to conduct their own screenings or property management – it’s just too risky.  i never had any trouble with the tenants screened by ashford, and, because of their expertise, could not have asked for a better investment property owning experience.  real estate is the best investment out there, and the peace of mind i got from using ashford was very much worthwhile.

i have had a couple of property mgrs through the years and they all promise the world. ashford is the first one that delivers more than they even say they will. excellent customer service, knowledge, called me back on a saturday night to tell me my tenant's rent came in when it was late and love the online log in for owners and direct deposit. really impressed with these gals!

i have a rental property in maricopa since 2008.  i have had other property manager in the past that i have worked with on my property.  however, this is the only time that i am pleased and impressed with the professionalism, honesty, trustworthy, and good working property manager and the "i will take care of it." and "i am on top of it" attitude from any of the property management until kim fearon took over.  i can go on and on with all the tasks that kim has put her dedication and commitment to test.  she surely passed and have gone beyond it all.
