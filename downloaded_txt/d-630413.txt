technology is wonderful

coins and a handle mean never worrying about osi layers
except when you’re trying to pay for your parking space and you’re confronted with an endless supply of this shit. â i mean, really, is there something wrong with just being able to pay for something? â hello mr. meter, i have money. â not quite the thing i want to deal with on a friday night after a rather heinous week in the office. â making matters worse, the rest of the pay kiosks were widely scattered around the garage and were mostly in the same unconnected condition.
nice job, white plains. â nice job.

nick swisher is your baseball jesus

posted on 4/14/2009 by matt 

nick swisher, man of action
in a very ugly loss to tampa last night, yankee rf/1b nick swisher was called on to pitch the 8th inning.â  despite not having pitched since high school, the crafty lefty managed to retire the side after allowing a walk and a base hit.â  he had good velocity, changed arm angles, and even struck out former all-star gabe kapler on a high fastball.
i’m not sure what you can say about nick swisher that hasn’t already been said.â  the man is versatile, a good influence in the locker room, and swings a mean bat.â  when he was called in to pitch, he had already homered once in the game and gotten within a foot or so of at least a double only to be robbed by carl crawford on an outstanding jumping catch.â  ever the class act, swisher doffed his batting helmet to crawford as he trotted back to the yankee dugout.
regardless of how the game resolved itself (poorly is an understatement), swisher is an asset to this team.â  how you place nady in the field ahead of swisher on any given day is completely beyond me.â  he’s fantastic.
in fact, this is my new idea:â  on any day where you need to rest swisher, do it in the field.â  seriously.â  park his ass on a patio chair in right field with a mai tai and a boombox playing molly hatchet.â  i guarantee this is worth at least six runs versus a replacement player.

absolutely horrible.
this (screenshot from mlb at-bat on my iphone) just doesn’t convey the awfulness of the situation.â  click the picture for a more detailed story.

social phenomenon part xxvii

posted on 2/23/2009 by matt 

why is it that people who have not bothered to acknowledge my existance for years at the office all of a sudden seem to think that the best time to smile and wave at me is when i’m carrying about 80 pounds worth of printer?

xbox avatars

posted on 11/19/2008 by matt 

sorry i haven’t posted in a long time, haven’t had anything to talk about.
so the new xbox experience hit today, and i’ve been playing with the avatar feature.â  so far for myself, this is the best i’ve been able to come up with.
not terrible i suppose, but they don’t give me a lot of good hairstyles to work with.â  this just makes me look like i’m going bald, and hey, no.
now if only they had more hawaiian shirts and a bloody shovel accessory…
