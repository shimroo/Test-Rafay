wierman field 
		at the elmwood park zoo was officially put to rest by vandals. a 
		new beginning began on april 26, 2008, when the new fields were "officially" dedicated and 
		renamed sullivan "heels" gelet field. the women's field was named patty 
		simons field after the fist women police officer in norristown's long 
		history who passed away in september, 2007. the new sign is shown above.

i also have a 

national

    softball history web site along with a page on 

asa

    of pa softball history too. take a look at these two sites if you are

    interested in softball outside of the norristown area. in the asa of pa

    history page, there are listings of some of the best tournaments of

    yesteryear throughout the state and included are most of the burr robbins,

    norristown officials and triple s tournament results. this was back in the

    day when the best teams from pennsylvania, new jersey and delaware would

    travel to norristown to compete in these old prestigious tournaments which

    were annually held at wierman, latshaw, allenwood and the bridgeport

    memorial park fields. it wouldn't be surprising to see over 1000 people

    attend these tournaments which usually spanned two, sometimes three weekends

    to eventually crown a champion. a lot of the times, an mvp was named along

    with an all-tournament team and sometimes they even concluded the

    festivities with a home run derby. and it wasn't abnormal to have 30-40

    teams entered in each tournament. pictures were taken and big write-ups

    appeared in the times herald documenting all the results. those were the

    good ole days....
