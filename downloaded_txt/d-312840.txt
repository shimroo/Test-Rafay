 welcome to horsewhisperer.
horsemanship is a lifetime journey for every single one of us.
thank you for your interest in frank bell and my company dances with horses. i’ve spent several decades and countless intense hours working with challenging horses. the horses that have fallen through the cracks and have confounded other seasoned trainers have been my focus. almost without fail i’ve been able to turn them around and have them trusting the human again by using a very simple and straightforward approach that begins with indulging the horse, simply giving to them using touch. finding those secret spots that all horses love- the v under the jaw, dock of the tail, and withers are examples of places that will melt most horses. once the horse begins to relax and trust again, then we move through my program that culminates in riding a trusting eager partner.
my approach worked so well time after time with the most difficult cases so i formally created a logical sequence of exercises that anyone can learn and thousands have, known world-wide frank bell’s 7-step-safety-system. since that humble beginning, a following has developed that employ this system with every single horse every single time regardless of age or issue. i have detailed my system in my foundation video- discover the horse you never knew and in my gentle solutions book.
safety is my obsession and should be yours as well. and for those with children riding horses, safety must be number 1!
documentary- a day in the life of a horsewhisperer–
i invite you to explore my website thoroughly to understand this evolved approach.
safe riding always,
frank r. bell
