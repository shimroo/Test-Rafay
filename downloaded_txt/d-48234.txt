jeff lewis, everyone's favorite obsessive compulsive houseflipper, is back on bravo's "flipping out," returns tuesday, june 17 at 10 pm et/pt





"my goal is to cut down my 'flip outs' from 15 a day to a maximum of five," says lewishe second season of bravo's popular docu-series "flipping out" returns on tuesday, june 17 at 10 p.m. et/pt with everyone's favorite obsessive-compulsive house-flipper, jeff lewis. it takes a special kind of personality to handle flipping a number of multimillion-dollar houses at one time, but lewis, one of los angeles' most colorful creative renovators and real estate speculators, pulls it off and turns a six-figure profit on every property.with the soft market teaching flippers new lessons as home sales decline, there's never a dull moment for lewis and his intriguing cast of characters. lewis makes his living with the help of a group of diverse and often disgruntled employees he counts as friends. these include an assistant who moonlights doing voiceover work, a house assistant, a housekeeper, and his former "trash man," who has been promoted to house manager. add to the mix his business partner and former boyfriend, his various therapists and lewis' visits to a shaman, and it's clear that this intriguing cast of characters lives as one big dysfunctional family.like most families, lewis' extended family has its share of issues, which results in the occasional confrontation and even a firing or two. aware of his "flipping out" tendencies, lewis is trying to turn over a new leaf, exercise patience and treat his staff with dignity, but each day comes with a new barrage of problems - including dealing with suspicions of his staff, that leads him to install a nanny cam on site. as jenni says "it's a long process." lewis also must contend with market fluctuations, since three of his projects have yet to flip, driving him to expand his business and pick up property renovations instead. lewis is forced to work for others (which he hates), but in his own inimitable style takes on massive multimillion remodeling jobs.the staff:jeff lewis - "watching season one really opened my eyes and forced me to do a lot of self-reflection. i'm seeing a therapist now, every wednesday at 10 a.m. and not by court order. it's helping.  my goal is to cut down my 'flip outs' from 15 a day to a maximum of five."jenni (executive assistant) - on lewis: "he's crazy, but a lot of geniuses are crazy." jenni is usually seen wide-eyed with disbelief. ever the optimist, she tries to protect her co-workers from lewis' rants.chris (house manager) - lewis' former trash man and jenni's husband has been promoted to house manager. on his relationship with lewis: "i think i've been fired five or six times, but i think i'm capable."zoila (housekeeper) - zoila proves to be the rock in lewis' crazy world. never fazed by his rants, she is there for his every need. lewis commissions an original abstract portrait for zoila as a special birthday gift, but not being an art connoisseur, the gift doesn't go over well.ryan (former boyfriend and current business partner) - ryan tries to be the calm one in most situations, but lewis seems to find something to disagree with him about.

cartoonist berkeley breathed helps america’s most wanted





what’s the connection between the sunday comics - and a killer?sketches by pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist berkeley breathed to help america’s most wanted solve murder mystery saturday, april 7, on foxsunday morning, millions of newspaper readers will eagerly open the comics section to read the latest adventures of "opus" by pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist berkeley breathed. but breathed hopes that a lot of people take a look at another drawing he recently created, a picture of a crime scene drawn exclusively for the saturday, april 7 (9:00-10:00 pm et/pt) edition of fox’s america’s most wanted. the drawing is part of amw’s effort to help solve a cold-blooded murder in austin, tx - a murder that hit close to home for breathed.in the late 1970s, breathed was part of a vibrant community of young artists in austin who contributed photographs to a calendar project known as "the book of days." the community was rocked by tragedy in april 1979, when a talented musician named michael cahill was murdered during a burglary. on the same night, someone also broke into the apartment of a "book of days" contributor who lived in cahill’s building. when members of the community began comparing notes, they realized that many contributors to the calendar had recently been burglary victims, among them breathed. someone had turned "the book of days" into a list of targets. police believe the same person killed cahill.no suspect was ever identified, but breathed and the other artists touched by this crime have never given up hope that cahill’s murder will be solved. now, they’ve turned to america’s most wanted, in an effort to breathe new life into the 28-year investigation. "i haven’t been involved in many crimes or touched by many crimes," breathed tells amw. "when it happens, there is definitely a desire for closure. nothing is more annoying than murderers getting away with it."breathed took a break from preparing for the april 2007 publication of his latest book, "mars needs moms!," to create a drawing for amw producers of the scene at his austin apartment the night he became a burglary victim. he hopes it will help jog someone’s memory, and lead police in a new direction. "i don’t have any pictures from that period, but i do have the mental images," breathed says. "i thought the best way to do it was to put a sketch down. it’s how i do everything now. give me enough time, i’ll turn it into a photo-realistic rendering and give it to the police."

"she’s a great looking girl with incredible potential, but she doesn’t have any oomph, no fire," nigel said. "you are so strong, so beautiful, but for some reason the judges don’t feel that fire and that passion" tyra said to diana, before eliminating her from the race to become america’s next top model.in addition to a $100,000 contract with cosmetics giant covergirl, this year’s prize package for the winner of the cw’s america’s next top model will include a contract with elite model management and a cover and six-page fashion spread in seventeen magazine.the eighth cycle of the hit series america’s next top model on the cw follows 13 young women as they attempt to prove they have what it takes to make it in the high-stress world of modeling. banks, who created the show, also serves as executive producer along with ken mok ("making the band") and anthony dominici ("the amazing race").

officer and a gentleman is the new the bachelor - premieres april 2nd





andy baldwin - a real-life "officer and a gentleman," plus a doctor and an accomplished triathlete - challenges himself to find true love when the bachelor: officer and a gentleman premieres, monday, april 2 on abcthe tenth edition of abc’s popular romance reality series begins with a special rose guaranteed to bring the claws out: u.s. navy lieutenant andy baldwin, m.d., 30, an undersea medical officer for a special operations dive unit stationed in pearl harbor, hawaii - a real-life "officer and a gentleman" - faces the most exciting mission of his life -- finding true love -- when the tenth edition of abc’s popular romance reality series, the bachelor: officer and a gentleman, premieres monday, april 2 (9:45-11:00 p.m., et), on the abc television network.andy, an accomplished triathlete and winner of recent humanitarian awards for his work in laos last summer -- on a military mission where he treated over 600 laotians in remote mountain villages -- grew up in lancaster, pennsylvania, where he was valedictorian in high school and a competitive swimmer who made all-american. he was even named espn’s national scholar athlete of the year in 1995. the navy offered him a full rotc scholarship, which he took and went to duke university, where he was a varsity letter winner on the men’s swim team and began training for marathons, all while taking a pre-med course load and earning a degree in biology, with a concentration in genetics. after graduating duke with honors, he enrolled in the university of california-san francisco school of medicine and was a surgical intern at naval hospital san diego, where he graduated in 2003.in this premiere episode, "1001," a yacht anchored off los angeles becomes andy’s private refuge, while the women take over their own house. and so the handsome doctor begins his marathon run to find the woman of his dreams. when the bachelorettes arrive to party and meet andy, they are quick to find out that the competition starts immediately - right as they get out of their cars. this time it really is a "first impression" rose that andy must deliver to one lucky lady as she arrives, and it’s enough to send daggers flying between the 25 new bachelorettes.as the party begins, andy lets slip that it’s his birthday and the news spreads like wildfire around the room. one woman shares a special bonding moment with the bachelor when she reveals it’s also her birthday. what will two other bachelorettes cook up when they sneak off to the kitchen to whip up something for andy’s special 30th birthday?the bachelorettes pull out all the stops to impress andy: one female body-builder challenges andy to a push-up contest, an acrobatic bachelorette is so taken by the bachelor she literally does back flips for him in her evening dress in a must-see demonstration, and yet another woman treats lieutenant baldwin to a patriotic serenade of "the star spangled banner."the pressure mounts as the evening goes on and sparks fly between two tipsy bachelorettes when one falls down. andy must eliminate ten of the 25 women the first night, leaving 15 to compete for his affections. in the end, one woman explodes in a tirade when she misses out on the last rose.a list of the bachelorettes will be released shortly.in bringing the iconic romantic movie "an officer and a gentleman" to real life, the women during the course of this season’s "bachelor" must be prepared to participate in a high energy "boot camp," complete with a "drill sergeant," plus triathlon events (swimming, biking and running) and race car driving. with andy’s true humanitarian spirit a large factor in his life, the bachelorettes will also participate in a charity event for an inner city school in los angeles. many other adventurous dates will test the ladies’ perseverance in pursuing their romantic objective, along with fun, exciting and exotic dates that will elicit real and raw emotions.as in the past, women will continue to be eliminated each week, but if, at any point along the way, a woman should decide that she’s no longer interested in the bachelor, she can reject his invitation to continue dating. some lucky women will meet his family, and he will visit their hometowns for a slice of their life in an effort to determine the woman with whom he is most compatible.at the end of the journey, the bachelor may quite possibly have found true love. but the big question is: after all of this, will he pop the question, and will she say yes?
