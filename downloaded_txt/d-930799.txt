what makes a cedrus sauna the best? 
not only do we produce more of this safe, healing light, we   do it at a better wavelength. this allows your body to absorb more far infrared   in less time and at a lower temperature than any other infrared sauna. this is   made possible by our patented heater design found only in a sauna built by full   spectrum international inc. 
only a cedrus sauna is   covered by a lifetime warranty giving you the peace of mind of knowing the   investment in your health and well being is protected 100%... as long as you own   the sauna. again, only found in a sauna built by full spectrum international   inc. 

what makes infrared better? 
infrared heat is a direct, warm, penetrating heat. 
                              all living beings radiate infrared heat. with this type of heat you get the same feeling as warming up to a fire, lying out in the sun, or when you get a hug from a really warm person. not only does this therapeutic type of heat feel better, and is easier to breathe in, but it is much better for your health. 
traditionally, people have had to rely on hot air currents or convection heat in saunas at a very high temperature to make them sweat. temperatures can go up to 220â°! that makes the air very stuffy and very hard to breathe in. some people have not even been able to sauna because of the feeling of suffocation. but now, with a cedrus      sauna, you can enjoy a 
                              sauna with therapeutic infrared heat. infrared is a direct, therapeutic heat that heats you instead of the air. you can take a sauna at a much lower temperature, around 120â°-140â°, therefore you do not feel suffocated. because people are able to use this type of sauna for a longer time, they are able to reap greater benefits than through the high temperature saunas. 
for many years physical therapists have actively used infrared heat for medical treatments such as sore, achy, and injured muscles. the heat is usually applied directly to the body with an infrared heat lamp. 
full spectrum international inc. has taken this heat energy to a new level with their cedrus saunaâs far infrared heaters. this is known as radiant heat, or long wave, far-infrared heat, that can penetrate into 
                              the skin about an inch and a half, to two inches deep. this amplifies all the health benefits you would get from a traditional sauna. this  radiant, infrared heat, is  the same heat many doctors, physical therapists, chiropractors, and massage therapists recommend.
cedrus saunas are also energy efficient. the cost
                              to operate one is only  pennies per hour. since 
                              the heaters heat you directly at a lower  temperature, the life 
                              span of the heaters is considerably longer. 
                              a cedrus sauna sets up very easily and quickly, without requiring any tools, plumbing or special wiring. they simply plug into a 110 outlet.
cedrus sauna health benefits include: 
relieves daily  stress - for many of us our daily lives are very stressful. relaxing in a cedrus sauna will sooth your nerves and relax tight muscles.
relieves pain - cedrus saunaâs far infrared heat relieves pain by dilating blood vessels and in- creasing circulation. medical studies have shown  far infrared heat to be    successful treatment for arthritis, rheumatism and muscle spasms.
boosts immune system - cedrus sauna can help with   fighting  off viruses, infections        and bacteria.
burns calories - you can burn up from 300-900 calories in one sauna session!  heating of the tissues also enhances metabolic processes.
strengthens cardio 
                            system - when taking a sauna in a cedrus sauna, your heart is pumping to increases blood flow, causing per- spiration production to cool itself improving overall cardio fitness. and because of the lower infrared temperature, it is much safer.
 improves  
                            circulation cedrus saunas enhance     circulation which oxygenates the tissues. blood circulation speeds up the process of bringing nutrients to your cells and helps with the removal of  toxins and wastes.
improves skin -
                            cedrus' deep pen-etrating heat helps get that youthful glow.
