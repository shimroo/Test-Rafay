welcome to hotelguide.networks' directory of hotels and hotel reviews for tallahassee, florida!

tallahassee is nestled among the rolling green foothills of the appalachian mountains in a region known as the big bend. it offers an array of sports, museums and theaters. it is home to the state capital and also the florida state university seminoles and the florida a&m (famu) rattlers. dotted with small lakes, as well as proximity to the gulf of mexico, sports fisherman from all over the world are attracted to tallahassee, which is an excellent stop on the way to any florida venue, as it is the information clearinghouse for all of the state's destinations.

florida comprises a number of different living and cultural styles, from southern rural to contemporary metropolitan, and tallahassee is definitely aligned more towards the leisurely veranda, spanish moss and magnolias pace of the old south, like the rest of the panhandle. air conditioning is as prevalent here as anywhere else in florida, but many of the older lodges and bed and breakfast houses still function without air conditioning as they were originally built to, with open windows, whiffs of night blooming jasmine and foliage everywhere.
