team communication







why do you play primetime?








primetime's organization is unmatched. when you register for a primetime event you know that there will be coverage and exposure at every court. no one else does it like primetime.










not only is primetime highly competitive and well run, but it is also affordable. in seven years of primetime events, we have have never had an issue. they are the standard. 










the atmosphere is incredible. our players love competing at primetime events and feel they are competing at the highest level. we chose primetime because we know that the needs ofd our players will be serviced. 










primetime is not only the biggest exposure events in texas but the country as well. our players traveled from colorado springs to compete on the biggest stage in front of coaches from a variety of states.
