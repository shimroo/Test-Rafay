home page for willard van orman quine, mathematician and philosopher who held the edgar pierce chair of philosophy at harvard university from 1956-2000. over the last half century his literary output was prodigious in such areas as mathematical logic, set theory, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of logic.  his best known works include "the ways of paradox", "mathematical logic", "set theory and its logic", "quiddities", and his most influential "word and object".  his style is not only eminently lucid but lively and elegant.  professor quine was born june 25, 1908 (exactly half a year away from christmason "anti-christmas") and died december 25, 2000 (christmas).  his ashes rest beside his parents' remains in the glendale cemetery, akron, ohio with portions scattered in cambridge ma, harvard ma, and meriden ct (with his wife, marjorie).  the last paper he presented was three networks: similarity, implication, and membership in boston (august 1998); it was published in proceedings of the twentieth world congress of philosophy (#6).

"quine has made many contributions to logic, but in his philosophical writings he focuses on meaning and existence - the age old concerns of philosopher-man - and he thus continues the traditions begun  by the ancient greeks.  because he is america's most influential living philosopher, many of his concerns have become major concerns of his contemporaries." [from essays on the philosophy of w. v. quine r.w. shahan and c. swoyer, editors, university of oklahoma press, 1979]

extensive visitor comments regarding his philosophy may be read in the w. v. quine guest book and you may sign into (email) the guestbook:  to post your comments

published in march 2019 and edited by robert sinclair: in this book, w. v. quine's science and sensibilia: the 1980 immanuel kant lectures (history of analytic philosophy) book details, price, and availability from amazon.com are published for the first time in english.  these lectures represent an important stage in the development of quine's later thought, where he is more explicit about the importance of physicalist constraints in his account of the steps from sensory stimulation to scientific theory, and in further using them to assess the extent to which mental vocabulary is defensible. taken as a unit, these lectures fill an important gap in our understanding of his philosophical development from his 1973 work the roots of reference to his later work.  the volume further contains an introduction that outlines the content and philosophical significance of the lectures. in addition, several essays written by leading scholars of quine's philosophy provide further insight into the important issues raised in the lectures.

working from within: nature and development of quine's naturalism by sander verhaegh. the book offers a novel interpretation of quine's naturalism and a reconstruction of his early development based on a study of the w. v. quine papers at houghton library. moreover, the book includes transcriptions of five previously unpublished papers, letters, and notes that shed new light on quine's philosophical development.

mathematical logic comprehensive book review in bactra:  informal logic is an inescapable part of life as a human being with a plugged-in brain, and not a vegetable or a raving lunatic; even post-structuralists and critical theorists may be observed, off-duty, saying ``that can't be right, because...'' formal logic is a notoriously dry subject, initiated in the west by the prince of pedants, aristotle. mathematical logic, which has emerged only in the last hundred and fifty years, is well known to be abstruse and terrifying, and has made the logician into a creature mathematicians view in much the same way others view mathematicians, i.e. a repository of incomprehensible knowledge. when, in 1995, the bertrand russell e-mail list attempted to list all those who had read all three volumes of whitehead and russell's principia mathematica, they came up with less than two dozen names; two of those people died while the list was being compiled.....

novels / movies

boyd, william. 1998. william boyd's novel "armadillo" begins with a quote by quine. the book was recently made into a movie by a&e in collaboration with the bbc (2002) - eric thrane.
mccarthy, cormac. 2022. cormac mccarthy's novel, "stella maris". in this passage, the principle character in the novel a woman is speaking with a psychiatrist in the mental institution from which the book takes its title...stella maris. a child prodigy who breezed through post-graduate mathematics in her early teens she has committed herself voluntarily  to stella maris. she seeks no therapy and will not even allow attempts. she just feels more at home around the inmates than she does "on the outside". here you go...

thatâs impressive. how much money had you inherited? 

my share was something over a half million dollars. i thought the violin was a good idea. even if i did worry about leaving it in my room.
i used to keep it under the pillow. for a while i actually kept the money in a shoebox in the closet.

you had the money in cash? 

yes. when my brother found out he made me rent a safe deposit box.

you didn't consider investing it? 

weâd inherited the money and we didnt owe any taxes on it. but we couldn't prove that. it was buried in my grandmotherâs basement.
she told us where it was and that we were to have it. but of course there wasnt any documentation for it. sheâd buried the money in her
basement. our grandfather had. it was in twenty dollar goldpieces. stacked in lengths of lead pipe. 

this is turning into a fairly curious tale. 

people do curious things. 

christieâs. you bought the violin at auction? 

yes. i bought it through bein & fushi. in chicago. they weren't really even in business yet. but they acted as my agents. they wouldn't
have had an instrument like that in stock. no. they didn't have any stock. they were a brand-new company. 

i can see how you would be concerned about it. 

when a cremona is stolen it can be stolen forever. one more of a handful that might never be found. iâd thought about painting it. some
sort of water soluble paint that would be easy to get off without damaging the finish. paint it gold, maybe. put it in a cheap case. but
i thought about the quotation that quine cites. save the surface and you save all. anyway i knew i couldn't bring myself to do it. 

whoâs quine? 

heâs a philosopher. some say the greatest living. 

do you? 

maybe. of course he thinks he understands mathematics. can't seem to leave it alone. 

but thatâs a quote, you said. 

yes. itâs in the frontispiece of one of his books. 

does he give an attribution? 

yes. sherwin-williams. 

the paint company. 

yes. 

youâre joking. 

no. iâm not. neither was quine. well. maybe a little. maybe quite a bit now that i think about it.

poems / limericks
	
quine limerick (via jason zarri) by the late timothy sprigge probably in early 2001 as a verse in his history of philosophy limerick saga:

         a man from ohio now dead
         would lurk in the fields, so it is said,
         so that when others screamed "rabbit"
         he could indulge in his habit
         of shouting "gavagai" instead.


poem on quine ... [ cold link "https://drip.colorado.edu/~tromey/poetry/quine.html" last seen march 2, 2005]

         there's a piece of text
         he loves; he cherishes it,
         runs thought's thumb
         over its folds. it slots
         into itself, or his mind
         does, expending itself
         helically downward, following
         the natural flow of the
         words. deeper now into
         the depths he goes,
         pondering its every line,
         tracing its hidden referents
         with invisible fingertips.
         every whorl of his prints
         silently points to this poem
         which in part reads,
         "his mind nimbly traverses
         the tumbling of infinity",
         and he realizes what they
         meant when they said
         that every poem
         was written for him.

         willard v. quine had a plan
         to put analyticity under the ban
         he scotched the two dogmas, and fought ever onwards
         to show modality was a sham

ohio state university, columbus, ohio; june 7, 1957 (lld)

i now have the honor to present for the honorary degree doctor of laws, willard van orman quine, edgar pierce professor of philosophy, harvard university.

willard van orman quine was born in ohio and received the degree of bachelor of arts from oberlin college, the degree of master of arts from oxford university, and the degrees of master of arts and doctor of philosophy from harvard university.  after holding fellowships for study in europe and after being a member of the society of fellows at harvard university from 1933 to 1936, he began his teaching service at harvard university.  he is edgar pierce professor of philosophy at that institution and was chairman of its philosophy department from 1952-53.  in 1942, dr. quine was visiting professor at the university of sao paulo, brazil, and during the year 1953-54 he was a fellow of balliol college and george eastman visiting professor at oxford university.  during the present year he is a member of the institute of advanced study.  among the numerous honors and recognitions his professional colleagues have bestowed upon him are the presidency of the association of symbolic logic, and the presidency of the eastern division of the american philosophical association.  in 1955 oberlin college conferred upon him a doctorate of literature.

besides being a co-author of three books, the author of numerous papers in professional journals, many of which have had more impact upon scholarship in philosophy and logic than most books, professor quine has written five books and has two more in progress.

professor quine's creative work has earned him world-wide recognition as the successor of frege, whitehead, and russell in a period of logical discovery and development never before equalled in the history of philosophy.  like his worthy predecessors, professor quine has sought an integration of mathematical logic and certain related metaphysical themes in philosophy.  his many books and articles testify to his brilliant synthesizing spirit of logic and philosophy which represents one of the foremost intellectual movements in our day.

in recognition of his scholarship in the field of logic and for his contributions to the literature of philosophy, i now present willard van orman quine for the honorary degree, doctor of laws.

mr. president, i have the honor to present, as a candidate for an honorary degree, willard van orman quine, edgar pierce professor of philosophy at harvard university.

distinguished for his contributions to mathematical logic, professor quine has achieved new standards of clarity and rigor in philosophical reasoning.  his formulation of the problem of ontic commitment in the terms of quantificational logic has given philosophy a new locus for the examination of ontological issues.  through his penetrating analyses of analyticity, synonyomy, propositional attitudes and other fundamental concepts he has brought philosophers of all convictions to a critical re-examination of their basic principles.

in recognition of his outstanding service to philosophy, mr. president, i request, on behalf of the division of humanities, that you confer upon willard van orman quine, the honorary degree of doctor of humane letters.

temple university, philadelphia, pennsylvania; june 1970 (littd)

(by sidney axinn) - in a moment of world history when man too rarely reflects upon the tumultous events of this twentieth century, he has contributed immensely towards the understanding of man and his condition.

a distinguished scholar and writer in the field of philosophical studies, he has earned pre-eminence in the study of philosophy of logic throughout forty years of dedication to teaching, research, and writing.

his numerous honors and distinctions include the george eastman visiting professorship at oxford, the gavin young lectureship at the university of adelaide (australia), appointment as a fellow of balliol college and in the institute of advanced studies, and his service with distinction as edgar pierce professor of philosophy at harvard university.

i am privileged and pleased to present a distinguished colleague for the honorary degree of doctor of literature --.

livy reports thatr attus navius cut a whetstone in half with a razor; a sharper razor of the spirit, however, was invented by william of ockham, the 'invincible doctor', and though only as an 'inceptor', not a master, he honed it here in oxford.  the cutting-edge of logic has been tempered anew in our time, and our guest to-day has taken possession of the instrument to shave off every abstraction as though it were an infection.  he is a new 'nominalist' who rejects universals.  he even attempts the shaving of plato, although plato would have greatly approved of one so far from 'innocent of geometry', a skilled dialectician and pursuer of mathematical reasoning.  as natural scenery, it is not verdant vales, banked with rustling boskage, that delight him, but desert landscapes.  so too in philosophy he would have things plain and solid, no suggestion of 'more things than are drempt of'.  for him, being is not to be perceived or to be thought, but to be the value of a variable.  however he allows that some entities should be multiplied, his own books for instance (from a system of logic, 1934, to nos. 11, ontological relativity, and 12, philosophy of logic, 1969), and his knowledge of languages and etymologies.  when he is your guest, do not apply ockam's razor; he is not a water drinker.  he writes copiously, at once like an angel and like an american, with a roman ruthlessness, a patrician elegance, and the subtlety of zeno.  his origins are dutch and isle of man (where by way of etymology, his name means son of john, mcian), and his birthplace, akron, ohio, provides an omen, like sappho's apple, 'top of the topmost, and the applepickers have forgotten it; no, not forgotten, but they could not reach it.'  but he classes himself more modestly; if a cricket eleven of logicians were to be chosen from all past time, he would not figure except as captain of the second eleven.  i present to you willard van orman quine, professor of philosophy at harvard, eastman visiting professor here (1953-4), fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences, and of the american philosophical society, corresponding fellow of the british academy, a notable philosopher and pioneer in symbolic logic, for admission to the degree of doctor of letters honoris causa.

professor quine, like parmenides of old, has so successfully triumphed over the thorny problems of logic that he can express in ordinary language ideas of great complexity.  i admit him to the degree of doctor of letters.

complaining of the limitations of the traditional language will get me nowhere.  but even cicero's pen, i think, might drag if he had to deal with the topics of modern philosophy, which so often appear to be involved with the meaning and distinction of words that someone has wittily said that nowadays ontology recapitulates philology.  but the man himself, whom we now desire to honour, we can outline without obscurity.  it is generally agreed that he is one of the most eminent philosophers of his time, in interests and methods a true successor of the great bertrand russell; and that his influence has never depended solely upon his own adherents.

as a young man he observed plato's injunction, non-mathematicians keep out and after taking his degree in mathematics at oberlin college devoted himself to logic under the most celebrated masters both of his own country and of europe.  that technique he has applied with such great finesse in other departments of philosophy that where his predecessors have distinguished various classes of propositions (of which those of mathematics are given pride of place while those of metaphysics are regarded as worthless) he stresses the unity of science and metaphysics.

the appeal of his teaching owes much to the elegance of his style, and to the terse and deceptively simple and proverbial quality of his maxims, scarcely to be imitated even in latin without some inquination of the language:  no entity without identity, for example, or  to be is to be the value of a variable.  as in language he reckons that the jungle should be cut back, so too as a keen traveller he is said to be especially fond of those parts of mexico which others find distasteful and inhospitable deserts.  he has an easy control of foreign languages, and has himself written books in portuguese.  but he teaches that nothing can be translated into another language without some indeterminancy of meaning; that if you are reading this speech in english you cannot know whether i am talking about the man himself, about his sundry parts, or about the universal, quinehood.

but without more ado let me present the man himself,

willard van orman quine, your lucid and penetrating treatment of philosophical and logical issues has exercised an influence unsurpassed by the work of any other living american philosopher.

your philosophical inquiry has formed the questions of this generation.  your criticism of empiricist dogmas turned analytic philosophy in new directions and was a major force in moving american philosophy to the forefront in the anglo-american world.

during your decades of unchallenged eminence, you have remained the fair, measured, and temperate scholar who generously offers opinion and comment to young philosophers and others whenever they seek your counsel..

kyoto prize, kyoto, japan; november, 1996 from kyocera's inamouri foundation
we watched the magnificent ceremony in kyoto early november 10 as it unfolded across the internet.  the elegant hall, music, and flowers all created an ambiance to reflect this special event.  for us the experience was an interesting study in contrasts with the traditional japanese music and dress being complimented by the latest technology that enabled us to watch the ceremony as it happened with color still images every 15 to 60 seconds and a continuous sound feed that crackled in a muffled way much like an early short wave radio.  we watched from home on a laptop computer with data pouring through the internet and over the slow telephone line to our house.  the gold medal and purple ribbon were an impressive sight even half way around the world!  the royal prince and princess added an element of tradition impossible in this country while we joined in spirit with president bill clinton's "delight to congratulate willard van orman quine" on an intellectual life dedicated to the betterment of humanity.  we were pleased to hear the acceptance speech and see early family photographs as a life of research was recognized in a very special setting.  the beautiful children's choir and symphony provided a fitting closing. - doug (son)



pronunciation of quine
the manx name 'quine' is pronounced exactly as a native english reader should guess.  unfortunately, because the name is so rare, most people get it wrong because they don't trust their instincts (the name is not spelled 'quinn' nor is it pronounced that way).

the name may be phonetically represented as: /kwi:n/
the "q" sounds like "kw" or the beginning sound of quick, queen, quarry, and quarter.
the wordname rhymes with: dine, fine, line, mine, nine, pine, sine, tine, vine, and wine
so overall the name sounds like: "kwine"

quine and the dictionary of american regional english (dare)
dare is a multi-year project of the late professor frederic cassidy - a close friend of quine since high school days.  all 5 volumes have been published and they are a wonderful source of information about the regional differences in english across the united states.  this continuing monumental effort of research and documentation was a passion of quine's.  memorial gifts to help continue the work may be made to dare / university of wisconsin foundation, 1848 university avenue, p.o. box 8860, madison, wi 53708

dictionary of american regional english: volume i: a-c (published february 1986) amazon.com review: william safire calls it "the most exciting linguistic project going on in the united states," and i'd have to agree. dare is a corker (thing of remarkable quality or strength)... 

dictionary of american regional english: volume ii: d-h (published september 1991) amazon.com review: volume 2 is every bit as excellent as a-c, and as thought provoking. it's sad to have lost words like faunch (to rant, rage, or fret)... 

dictionary of american regional english: volume iii: i-o (published december 1996) amazon.com review: we dare fans who've been hemmed in by the hs for too long can celebrate; volume 3 has arrived. finally one can troll i-o, collecting gems like jug-handle, kyoodle, lip battle, meech, numpy, and ouchy (treat unfairly, mutt, argument, cringe, dolt, and irritable)... 

dictionary of american regional english: volume iv: p-sk (published december 2002) amazon.com comment by william safire, new york times magazine, december 8, 2002
[this] is the penultimate (one more to go) volume in the set that no library can afford to absquatulate. 

dictionary of american regional english: volume v: sl-z (published march 2012) amazon.com comment dare readers now have the full panoply of american regional vocabulary, from adam s housecat to zydeco. volume v is filled with words that reflect our origins, migrations, ethnicities, and neighborhoods. whether we are talking about foods, games, clothing, family, animals, or any other aspect of life, our vocabulary reveals much about who we are.


quine in dictionaries
"quinean" is a word in the oxford english dictionary, supplement, 1987

quinean - adj. "of, pertaining to, or characteristic of willard van orman quine or his theories"

"quine" is a word in the the philosophical lexicon, eighth edition: 1987, daniel dennett (editor), american philosophical association, 18 pages

quine
- v. "(1) to deny resolutely the existence or importance of something real or significant. "some philosophers have quined 
classes, and some have even quined physical objects." occasionally used intransitively, e.g., "you think i quine, sir. i 
assure you i do not!" (2) n. the total aggregate sensory surface of the world; hence quinitis, irritation of 
the quine."

"quine" is a word in the new hackers dictionary
quine  /kwi:n/ [from the name of the logician willard v. quine, via 
douglas hofstadter] - n. a program that generates a copy of its own source text as its complete output.  devising the 
shortest possible quine in some given programming language is a common hackish amusement.


here is one classic quine (of several at the web site):

  ((lambda (x)
  (list x (list (quote quote) x)))
  (quote
  (lambda (x)
  (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))

this one works in lisp or scheme.  it's relatively easy to write quines in other languages such as postscript which 
readily handle programs as data; much harder (and thus more challenging!) in languages like c which do not..  some 
infamous obfuscated c contest entries have been quines that reproduced in exotic ways.
using a completely different approach, mrcredsalex (closed blog https://mrcredsalex.blogspot.com) claims to have invented the shortest quine ever: nothing.  nothing. that's it. there's nothing in the program. so the program prints nothing. and if a quine is printing the code of the program, then: code is nothing. we print nothing. so what we print and the code is the same thing.
mike garrity reports (local copy
 a "quine" variation which is something even trickier. when you run the program, it prints out the source for a program in a different language. if you run that program, it'll print out the source for a program in yet another language. so on and so forth, until the eleventh one prints out the original text! go check it out on yusuke endoh's blog.
the longest "chained" or "relay quine" that i know of (thanks to alex quine) is presented at the yusuke endoh "mame" web site and is diagrammed to the right.



"quine" has three definitions in the urban dictionary 
(july 28, 2012) deriving from willard van orman quine's writings

definition 2: quine a program that upon execution will reproduce its own source code. 
definition 3: quine verb, to distort beyond recognition. origin: in philosophy "to quine" used to deny existence of entities that cannot be individuated or identified (after ontological methodology of w.v.quine).
definition 4: quine
forum acronym: quote is not edit. refers to the situation when intending to edit your post you misclick and quote it instead, resulting in two identical posts; thence the second post you replace with 'edit:quine'  used at sa forums.

professor donald davidson, one of the most significant philosophers of the xx century, was born  march 6, 1917 in springfield, massachusetts and died august 30, 2003 in california.   he studied english, comparative literature and classics in his undergraduate years at harvard.  in his sophomore year at harvard, davidson attended two classes that made a lasting impression on him.  these two classes on philosophy were taught by alfred north whitehead in the last year of his career. davidson was then accepted to graduate studies in philosophy at harvard, where his teacher was willard van orman quine.  quine set davidson on a course in philosophy quite different from that of whitehead.  subsequently, davidson did his dissertation on plato's philebus.....  philosophy of donald davidson, 1999 (at a discount from amazon.com). "he served as slusser professor of philosophy at the university of california, berkeley from 1981 to 2003 after having also held teaching appointments at stanford university, rockefeller university, princeton university, and the university of chicago. davidson was known for his charismatic personality and the depth and difficulty of his thought. his work exerted considerable influence in many areas of philosophy from the 1960s onward, particularly in philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and action theory. while davidson was an analytic philosopher, and most of his influence lies in that tradition, his work has attracted attention in continental philosophy as well, particularly in literary theory and related areas. [wikipedia]" he died august 30, 2003 in berkeley, california.

professor daniel c. dennett, the author of darwin's dangerous idea (simon & schuster, 1995), is distinguished arts and sciences professor, professor of philosophy, and director of the center for cognitive studies at tufts university. he received his b.a. in philosophy from harvard in 1963. he then went to oxford to work with gilbert ryle, under whose supervision he completed the d.phil. in philosophy in 1965. he taught at u.c. irvine from 1965 to 1971, when he moved to tufts, where he has taught ever since, aside from periods visiting at harvard, pittsburgh, oxford, and the ecole normal superieur in paris.

 professor burton dreben taught at harvard university from 1956 to 1990, and was the edgar pierce professor of philosophy from 1981 to 1990 (and edgar pierce professor emeritus until 1999). he has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including a fulbright fellowship (at oxford university), a junior fellowship (harvard university), and a guggenheim fellowship. he is a fellow of the american academy of arts & sciences. he also delivered the sherman lectures, university college, london; the lovejoy lecture, john hopkins university; the skolem memorial lectures, university of oslo; the brian o'neil memorial lectures, university of new mexico; and was special lecturer at the university of western ontario as well as the university of california at berkeley. "dreben became known for his close reading and detailed comments on the draft writings of his harvard colleagues w. v. quine, john rawls, hilary putnam, stanley cavell, charles parsons, and warren goldfarb. quine often thanked dreben in print for his advice and corrections."

of similarity; our sorting of things into kinds
according to "https://divcom.otago.ac.nz/sirc/geocomp/geocomp98/17/gc_17.htm"
it was kant, not w.v. quine - jqb

sp asks (feb 19 2001): where did quine write life is a burgeoning, life is a quickening
 actually both of the above quotes are part of a longer text:

      life is agid, life is fulgid.
      life is a burgeoning, a
      quickening of the dim primordial
      urge in the murky wastes
      of time. life is what the
      least of us make most of
      us feel the least of us
      make the most of.

first observed in quine's writing log in november 1946, best known as life is agid.  life is fulgid., sent as to the editor as lines on life for mr. moorhead, and renamed (by the editor) methods of logic when published in hugh s. moorhead (editor) the meaning of life: according to our century's greatest writers and thinkers.

mj asks (apr 15, 2002): where did quine write to be is to be the value of a bound variable?
on what there is page 15 in from a logical point of view.  russell marcus wrote (july 18, 2005) to say that this criterion was also discussed in both: quine, w.v.o. 1939a. "designation and existence." reprinted in feigl and sellars (1949) and in quine, w.v.o. 1939b. "a logistical approach to the ontological problem." reprinted in the ways of paradox.

is in philosophy of logic

rg (and others) asked (july 13, 2002): where did quine write philosophy of science is philosophy enough
mr. strawson on logical theory page 151 in the ways of paradox (rev. and enlarged ed.)  
(originally pub. in mind. 1953).  the full sentence is: such solutions are good just to the extent 
that (a) philosophy of science is philosophy enough and (b) the refashioned underpinnings of science do not 
engender new philosophical problems of their own.  (thanks to roger gibson, may 26, 2003)

je asks (oct 26, 2002): where did quine use the phrase "slum of possibles"?
in the essay  on what there is  (on page 4) which was originally published in  review of 
metaphysics  in 1948.  it is most commonly accessed through the popular book of essays entitled  from a logical

(july 18, 2005) where does quine say, "to call a posit a posit is not to patronize it."
russell marus reports that it is found in word and object page 22, section 6

tb asks (august 22, 2005 - question #334 in wvq guestbook): where does quine say, ""... the web, all our beliefs are justified by all our beliefs, they are connected by an explanatory network..."."?
two other people were seeking the same answer through google more than a year ago.  the broader context appears to be:
in the web, all our beliefs are justified by all our other beliefs, they are connected by an explanatory network, and changes in one place can require changes elsewhere. thus all belief is connected to observation in the world. are any beliefs immune from this process?  some beliefs do not depend on observation for their justification, in fact no observation whatever could show them to be wrong. beliefs of this type are said to count as a-priori knowledge: their justification is independent of experience, a-priori knowledge is contrasted with empirical knowledge which does depend on observation for its justification.
according to (closed website: href="https://www.answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=353409) and https://www.quotationspage.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2050&sid=a326cacd4a61b375f5276192f341545e

jw asks (march 28, 2006 - question #337 in wvq guestbook): i have a note attributed to "quine" which states: "the implicit assumption of mutual understanding." however, the source does not provide a reference to quine. source material: beach, f.a. 1979. animal models and psychological inference. in: human sexuality: a comparative and developmental perspective. h.a. katchadourian, ed. univ of calif press. berkeley. can anyone provide the original source of the quine quote?
i'm finding a related (but more complete) quote in several references - douglas quine:
a/ "the less a science has advanced, the more its terminology tends to rest on an uncritical assumption of mutual understanding." (quine, 1936, p. 90) cited in: of minds, brains, and behavior-a review of uttal's (1998) toward a new behaviorism: the case against perceptual reductionism behavior and philosophy, spring 1999 by machado, armando
b/ "the less [a field] is advanced, the more its terminology rests on an uncritical assumption of mutual understanding." (w. v. quine) cited in: https://www.sequenza21.com/2005/03/cults.html
c/ "the less a science is advanced, the more its terminology tends to rest on an uncritical assumption of mutual understanding." -- willard v. quine in "word and object" cited by: dan augustine - ds.augustine at mail.utexas.edu - austin, texas at https://ml.islandnet.com/pipermail/dixielandjazz/2003-march/008343.html
d/ "the less a science is advanced, the more its terminology tends to rest on an uncritical assumption of mutual understanding." -- willard v. quine (1946, page 84) cited in: https://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:nybzveugyhyj:murphylibrary.uwlax.edu/

%2520research/chapter%252003.rtf+%22assumption+of+mutual+understanding
%22+%2bquine&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=9 
david lyndes posted this comment in 2008 and now some 60 of his colleagues have posted variations on it:

"i recall an exchange in print (a fest-schrift, around 1980) where someone quoted shakespeare's 'there are more things on heaven and earth, than are dreamed of in your philosophy' at quine. quine responded something like, 'possibly, but my concern is that there not be more things in my philosophy than are in heaven and earth.'
the full shakespeare quotation and citation is "there are more things in heaven and earth, horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy." [william shakespeare, "hamlet", act 1 scene 5].
can anyone find the exact quotation from quine and the citation? (september 21, 2010)
prof. charles parsons found the original source (may 2, 2012) and it is colleague prof. nelson goodman who wrote:
you may decry some of these scruples and protest that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in my philosophy. i am concerned, rather, that there should not be more things dreamt of in my philosophy than there are in heaven and earth. in fact, fiction, and forecast (1st ed., cambridge, mass.:  harvard, 1955), p. 39.

prof. michael papazian (professor of philosophy at berry college in rome, ga) and andrea lowry were searching for the exact text of quine's statement that logic really came into being in the eighteenth-century; that logic wasn't really logic until after the eighteenth-century. in the end, they were also the detectives who found [january 28, 2010] the exact text "logic is an old subject, and since 1879 it has been a great one." and source [methods of logic (1950 edition) p. vii].  this is an especially elusive quotation as it only appears in the introduction to the first edition of the book!
robert frodeman said (may 7, 2012) i can't remember where i read that quine once, in response to a question, said that he could not imagine why the general public would be interested in his work
douglas quine responded (may 11, 2012) perhaps a step in the right direction comes from roger gibson s obituary for my father: 
wvquine.org/wvq-obit4.html in which he says:
 
so why is it that so many americans have never heard of willard quine? first, the man in 
the street rarely reads analytic (i.e., scientific) philosophy so quine's brand of philosophy 
isn't for everyone. in an article he wrote for newsday titled "has philosophy lost 
contact with people?" quine put the point as follows: "think of organic chemistry; i 
recognize its importance, but i am not curious about it, nor do i see why the layman 
should care about much of what concerns me in philosophy." 1 the truth is, quine was 
a philosophers' philosopher. most of his writings are aimed at an audience of professional 
philosophers and logicians, and so, many of his writings have a forbiddingly technical 
content.

w. v. quine web page review 
review of this w. v. quine web page appeared in  newsletter on philosophy and computers volume 97, 
number 1 (fall 1997) of the apa newsletters.  reviewed by: william j. rapaport, department of philosophy and center for 
cognitive science, state university of new york at buffalo.  suppose you wanted to find some information on the web 
about a philosopher. you might begin by trying to find his or her home page, if it exists. this can be done most 
efficiently using "ahoy! the home page finder". failing that, you might try using a search engine, say, "yahoo! arts: 
humanities: philosophy: philosophers". for willard van orman quine, neither of these options yields much useful information.
 alternatively, you might use many search engines to find as many pages as you can that discuss quine, and then save links 
to them. one way to do this easily is via the "go2net metacrawler"; a search on the phrase "willard van orman quine" 
yielded many sites, including the one under review.  this is apparently the idea behind "willard van orman quine", set up 
by his son, douglas boynton quine. what he seems to have done is to search the web for any and all pages that discuss 
quine and put them on his quine home page along with other material that a quine afficianado might find interesting, 
including some items that only he would have access to....
