        first launched in 2000, ecology asia now features over 1000 species of vertebrate from southeast
        asia comprising around 300 species of reptile, 150 amphibians, 450
        birds, 230 mammals and 125 fishes. all have been photographed in, or at
        the margins of, native habitats. most images are my own, with around 10%
        contributed by enthusiastic friends.

        the website has an easy, logical navigation structure for those who want
        to quietly explore its contents, and a simple but effective search
        engine.

        species write-ups try to include wide-angle images of a range of 
        habitats, to give the reader a 'sense of place'. 

        in this niche website 'southeast asia' includes 11 
        nations that lie between china to the north and australia to the south
        i.e. brunei, cambodia, indonesia, laos, malaysia, myanmar, philippines, 
        singapore, thailand, timor-leste and vietnam. the nation state of papua 
        new guinea is included here too.

        i spend quite a bit of time in northern parts of peninsular malaysia
        these days. as a retired geologist, i find the varied landscapes here impressive,
        particularly the hard-to-access karst limestone hills. the regions
        straddling the malaysia-thailand border still appear relatively rich in wildlife,
        although this is often elusive.

        if you are a visitor to the malay peninsula, i hope you find my
        not-for-profit, ad-free website a useful introduction to the fauna of
        the region.

        enjoy !!
