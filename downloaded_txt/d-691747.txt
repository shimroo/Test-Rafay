debute under a ton gig was a success!!!! 
i just wanted to thank everyone that came out on saturday 2/11 to show your support, i do believe i can speak for all of us when i say we had an absolute blast! we are fired up to be back out there on friday 3/31 and hope to see you all again. i personally am the happiest i've been with a band and the people i'm playing with that i have been in years! i'm having such a great time. thank you all. 


update:  01/10/17

as for the band, we have decided to keep the name under a ton since this is truly just a continuation of that for tom with us as the previous members have left and started their own band little nikki's radio, feel free to check them out and show them some support as well. we know we are looking forward to going to see them and hang with them as well.

as for the newest version of under a ton, we have an all new website and more dates and clubs on the way. come on out and say hi and have a good time. i look forward to seeing you.

it's been one year today since i've done my first gig with the breakdown. it's also time to announce my departure. i will still be playing until they find a replacement, so be sure to come out to some shows. it has been a great time as well as an awesome opportunity; however it is time for me to move on. these guys really brought my playing to another level that i would not have been able to achieve on my own.
