welcome to flamig farm
home of the big backwards eggs sign

greetings and welcome to flamig farm,  home of the big backwards eggs sign in west simsbury, ct. we hope our offerings bring you joy and brighten up you life whether it’s visiting our farm animals, celebrating a birthday,  laughing and singing as you go take a hayride or capturing a once in a lifetime photo of  a loved one’s first pony ride.
not  long ago farms were a common part of most people’s upbringing and lives were enriched in a way that only farm experiences are able to provide.   we want your life to be enriched in at least some little or perhaps a big way from what we have to offer.  learn more about our farm »
