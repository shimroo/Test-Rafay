new: if you intend to submit a non-human or exempt study, you might be eligible for an instant auto-determination without submitting a study to the irb. to get an instant determination, please use the non-human/exempt auto-determination tool. if the study is eligible for non-human exempt auto-determination, you will have an instant approval to begin the project. if the study is not eligible for the auto-determination (which is evident almost immediately after answering a few short yes/no questions), you’ll need to submit it through myirb.
