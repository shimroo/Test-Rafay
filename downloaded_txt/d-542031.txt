sustainably produced packaging
the swox tubes are made from plastic that is derived partly from the renewable raw material sugarcane instead of fossil fuels. by using ethanol produced biologically in brazil from sugarcane, the co2 emissions from the production of the tubes are not only reduced but also co2 is absorbed, thereby reducing the greenhouse effect.
