progressiveschool
since 1949

westland is widely respected as a pioneer in progressive education. we believe in a learning environment that is community oriented, noncompetitive, and child centered. our social studies–based curriculum is integrated and hands-on. at the core of our mission is the belief that the most effective learning takes place within a diverse school community.

collaborationschoolsince 1949

cooperative learning and collaboration are foundations of our school. outside the classroom, children see their parents as essential community members who are also learning and contributing. from the beginning, westland has been a place not just for children to learn and grow but for families to learn and grow as well.

democracyschoolsince 1949

active citizenry, equity, and inclusivity are at the heart of westland’s mission. our social justice and anti-bias curriculum invites students to notice differences and understand the impact of differences in society. students engage with the greater community of los angeles to experience citizenry in action. by making change within the school they learn what it means to be a purposeful community member.

joyschoolsince 1949

john dewey wrote, “to be playful and serious at the same time is possible, and it defines the ideal mental condition.” at westland, work and play coexist on a campus that is scaled for children. fields, gardens, a pond, pathways, and play yards invite wonder. the environment is warm, child centered, and connected to the outdoors. children engage directly with their campus as they care for it and learn from it.

contextschoolsince 1949

children are given the time and the space to think. to be children. to work. to play. to ask their questions and take part in finding the answers. our social studies–based curriculum is integrated with math, language arts, science, art, music, and woodworking. children are empowered to be self-motivated and to experience learning as connected, exciting, and lifelong.
