our storyour culinary philosophy is pride without pretension. all of our foods are made from scratch using raw products; we bake our own breads and desserts, smoke our meats purely over hard wood, and hand-cut our own steaks and seafood.hank’s began in a shack in harrisonburg in the late 1980’s.  a small restaurant soon followed, serving up barbecue and southern cuisine. we added catering to our service offerings and opened our location in the dayton farmers’ market in 2000.in 2002 we expanded our operation with hank’s grille & catering in mcgaheysville.  starting with an open charcoal pit (and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears), we have steadily improved and grown.  we’ve also built our catering business from the ground up and we’re proud to be known for excellent food and value.


























what people are saying



“our experience at hank's was wonderful. we both had the grilled salmon on a salad, cornbread, and local wine. it was very delicious. we did try the barbecue sauces with our salmon too and they were also very good. the cornbread is awesome and that alone would have been worth the trip for me! our server was very attentive and friendly. the entire staff there is inviting.i highly recommend giving hanks a try! great food and top notch staff!”~ tracy z.
