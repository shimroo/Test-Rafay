a brief history,

rockin in the cradle of liberty, wfil,philadelphia, non-stop music, the pop explosion, the
helping hand marathon. these are just a few examples of what made wfil, so famous in the late 1960s, and in the 1970s. hello, i'm ron turner, and welcome to my small piece of cyberspace. wfil was such a large part of my life , that i found it appropriate to dedicate some web space to it. if you grew up in the delaware valley area, i'm sure you remember " famous 56". who could ever forget george michael welcoming us to a friday night? the morning antics of dr. don
rose, and lu-lu belle? not to mention, the unforgettable voice of "allen stone,
wfil,
news". and of course, who could ever forget jim o'brien. 

the "pop explosion" was born on september 18,1966. wfil, was up until then, a "middle of the road" station, playing standards, with a little rock and roll mixed in. but on that fateful morning in september, wfil began its' journey to become one of the greatest stations in the nation. with a tight format, great personalities, and fantastic jingles, wfil took over the number 1 spot in philadelphia radio, a spot formally occupied by
wibg. the list of greats that graced the microphones of wfil is much to long to list. the ones' listed here, had a lot to do with the success of the station. unfortunately, sooner or later, all good things must come to an end. in 1977, wfil changed formats, to reflect what management felt was the needs, and desires of the philadelphia listening audience. disco, and fm stereo, were taking over at the time. wfil switched to an early type of a/c station. this , however, didn't work either. next, it was time to try a country format. "philly
56 country" was born, and lasted for a year. then came various other formats, until one night, on september
2, 1983. at 6pm, the "boss was back"! famous 56 had been reborn. it seemed like a great idea at the time. the radio market in philadelphia was boring, to say the least. why not bring back "famous 56"? it was a gallant attempt, but just wasn't the same. the glory days of wfil could not be recreated.
now in 2022, wfil is now broadcasting a religious format, and is now owned by salem
communications in lafayette hills, pennsylvania.



behind the scenes
in addition to the air talent, there were many
folks behind the scenes that helped make wfil the success that it was. one of
the most important was a man by the name of jerry donahue. jerry was production
director at wfil for over 30 years.  it seems that everyone who worked with
jerry over the years has a story or two to tell. all of which end with a warm
smile and a fond memory. even though jerry is no longer with us, his
contribution to the history of wfil is one that will live on forever.

what happened to the wfil
  double - decker bus??
then....

1993

this was taken in 1993 by vince, of wams/wrje.
  the bus was located in a field on route 50, in easton, md.

what happened to the "other boss bus"?here
is a great story sent to me recently by gary bowker.....
in 1984 i worked for borkon truckarama on
route 73 in maple shade n.j. in the back right hand corner was a big red double decker
bus. as i walked up to the bus i could clearly see the "wfil" logo 
and as i entered i saw a small sign with "boss bus #2  i remember
seeing boss bus #1 and #2 and the mustang on the old albums. one day i asked the
manager about the bus. whoever owned it after wfil, owed jerry borkon owner of
 borkon truckarama some money. he did not have the money and mr.borkon took
the bus he just put the bus in the back and forgot about it.
                  
one day the manager asked me to go out back and cut it up into pieces with the
torch. i really did not want to do this. it's a part of philly history. but i got to
do what they tell me to do so i spent 2 days cutting it up into pieces. it was in
real bad shape...no glass, the steps were rotted out (found this out the hard
way) i wish i took some pics back then. i remember looking into that bus
thinking of all the fun people had in it.
