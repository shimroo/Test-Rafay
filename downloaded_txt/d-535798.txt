do you know these important facts about
                            the causes and treatments of eczema?
what is eczema?
medical explanation below provided by  webmd
eczema is a skin condition caused by  inflammation of the skin.
atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczemawhile the word  "dermatitis" means inflammation of the skin, "atopic"  refers to an allergic tendency, which is often inherited. although atopic  dermatitis itself is not caused by an allergy, eczema sufferers have a higher  risk of developing other allergic conditions (like asthma or hay fever).
typically, eczema causes skin to become itchy, red, and dry -- even cracked and leathery. eczema can  appear on any part of the body.
eczema  is a chronic problem for many people. eczema  ismost common among infants, many of whom outgrow it before adulthood.
what causes eczema?

                            eczema seems to run in families. certain  genes can make some people have extra-sensitive skin. other factors that may  cause eczema include:

stress
contact with irritating  substances such as woollen and synthetic  fabrics and soap
heat  and sweat
cold, dry climates
dry skin

what  are the treatments for eczema?
there is no known cure for eczema; therefore, treatments aim to control the symptoms by reducing inflammation and relieving itching.
good skin care is a  key component in controlling eczema.  for some people with mild eczema,  modifying their skin care regime and making a few lifestyle changes may be all  that is needed to treat eczema. other people with more severe eczema may need  to take medications to control their symptoms.
non-drug treatments for eczema include:

mild soap and moisturizer. it's best to use a  mild soap or soap substitute that won't dry out your skin. gentle soaps, a good  moisturizer (in cream, lotion, or ointment form) helps conserve the skin's  natural moisture and should be applied immediately after a shower or bath, as  well as one other time each day. some people with severe eczema may benefit  from taking baths with a small amount of bleach added to the water.
short, warm showers. people with eczema  should avoid taking very hot, or long showers or baths, which can dry out your  skin.
reduce stress. take steps to reduce  stress. get regular exercise and set aside time to relax.









listen: having painful and embarrassing skin rashes is horrible. and unless you do something about it â you could be waiting months or even years for the rashes and scars  to heal.

forget expensive and harmful pharmacy drugs!

the big drug companies donât want me to say this. but from my own experience (and thousands of my  customers) many people with skin problems donât see any improvements after using expensive pharmaceutical drugs,  steroids, or body altering antibiotics.
big companies donât  make monster profits from selling low-cost natural remedies, and so they sell  more expensive, chemical based products. these products are not always  effective and could even be potentially dangerous  and may cause nasty side-effects.
we canât compete  with their huge advertising budgets and marketing executives. we rely on this simple website and our  happy customers to spread the word by recommending freederm hc to their  family and friends (and we hope you will, too!)
why is freederm hc so  effective? the secret lies in  our special blend of these all-natural ingredients that makes freederm hc more  effective than some âover the counterâ products.

"after one and half
                        days it was actually improving!"
 







 

 







 
"we are thankful that our son did not suffer for months and months (although his eczema was severe) before discovering your cream.â we tried various creams, lotions, andâ ointments, but none seemed to really help and we did not want to use straight hydrocortisone on his delicate skin.
when the freederm cream arrived, we eagerly read the instructions and applied the cream on his entire body.â his cheeks were oozing, cracked, and red.â his forehead, ears and neck suffered the same and the rest of his body was full of eczema to a lesser degree, but nonetheless itchy and irritated (as seen in the photo).
after one and half days, he was actually improving!â my heart was relieved.â i must note that the flare ups come and go and freederm surely keeps it to a minimum. as time has passed however, i have seen the quality of his skin only improve. also, using freederm cream has become less frequent. i am thankful for this product and have already recommended to several people."

"in a week her arms, legs, all of her was cleared up & has been for about two months now"
 







 

 







 
"hi, my name is nancy and my daughter is emily. she was born with eczema. and after using medicine after medicine absolutely nothing worked. when we took her out into public people would stop us and ask, "what did you do to her? is it contagious? why haven't you done anything to help?" it was so frustrating. 
it was my chance we ran across freederm hc on the internet!â within days you could see a difference and in a week her arms, legs, face, back, all of her was cleared up & has been for about two months now. 
if she starts to breakout we just put some freederm on the spot and by morning its all gone. i am very thankful to you and god that we found this cream.â i am sending some before and after pictures of her.
thank you sooooo much!"

"i was completely clear in two and a half days"
 







 

 







 
i wanted everyone to know there is help available for people with eczema. i suffered many weeks with eczema, going to many doctors. all the creams did not help me at all. my husband went to the internet and found a miracle cream called freederm eczema cream. i was reluctant, but it was worth the try since nothing had worked. we ordered and received the cream on december 5th, 2003. i have to tell you that i was completely clear in two and a half days. i remain clear to this date as of jan 14th, 2004. i have told many people of this great product. my dermatologist says it worked!!!
thanks so much,

"sooo happy to have finally found something that works"
 







 

 







 
two whom it may concern:
all i have to say is that i'm shocked!!!! i can not believe the difference. i have suffered from this awful skin problem for about 6 years now, with nothing ever working like freederm! everyone that i see on a daily basis has noticed the difference. my co-workers, my boyfriend, my mother, they have all told me how wonderful my skin looks. i'm sooo happy to have finally found something that works. i've been to countless dermatologists, i've done expensive laser treatments, with nothing accomplishing what in 2 weeks this amazing product has been able to do.
thank you,

her wedding was just 5 days away ...
 







 

 







 
"never before have i been so excited about the prospect of using an eczema cream! after reading the testimonials and seeing the improvement in other sufferers, i decided to try it for myself. with five days until my wedding, i used the cream dutifully and to my enormous relief my skin cleared up completely! no specialists, dermatologists or doctors could suggest anything to treat my skin. i even spent five nights in hospital with eczema-related complications, but as you see in the 'before and after' shots, my skin is clearer than it has been in five years."
