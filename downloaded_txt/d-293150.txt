we are a small show home. i have been breeding just yorkies for excellence since 1992.
showing is our hobby and yorkies are our commitment. 







  
 
puppies 

          are available occasionally, breeder referrals gladly given at all other 

          times. we are happy to take inquiries. 
our dogs are well socialized, happy, healthy members of the family.

             






  our dogs are definitely not kennel 

          dogs, and consider themselves humans that live in the house with us. 
we are dedicated to the health and happiness 
          
          of our puppies. 

  







these puppies are home raised with 

            love, not in a kennel environment.


we aim to breed yorkies that shine 

            either in the show ring or just in their owners eyes.






 we breed our 

            dogs to the akc breed standard and to 

            be the healthiest yorkies possible.

        of my yorkie kids are identified and protected by microchip

 where 

        we are located: 

          we live in baraga, michigan which is in western 

          upper peninsula of michigan on the shores of lake superior. baraga 

          is also in the middle of the keweenaw 

          bay indian community, in which i am a tribal member, hence the name "ojibwa yorkies".


          
          baraga is about a 10 hour drive northwest from detroit, 9 hours north 
          
          of chicago and 8 hours northeast of minneapolis, (see distance 
            
            map). the local airport here is in hancock, mi and northwest air lines is 
          
          the only carrier. we average about 200" of snow in the winter and 
          
          the dogs always enjoy playing in the snow. the average temperature in the 
          
          summer is 75 degrees & the dogs love to swim and chase the waves in lake superior.
