	 directv vs. dish network deals - decide which is best
	 
    



when you are looking to make a choice between directv and dish network, it can be a difficult decision. as more and more people replace their tv aerials for satellite dishes, and make space for a new satellite tv system, competition for customers has meant that the best deals from the top satellite tv providers are hard to separate. let�s make a comparison of their latest offers and see which one gives best value for money.dish network is a subsidiary of echostar and together with directv, they lead the pack when it comes to number of subscribers to their satellite tv systems. throughout the last few years, they have matched each other blow by blow, each one trying to win the next game in this long-running match. this competition of course means good news for new customers. dish network and directv offer free equipment as part of their deals, this means that a new customer can expect to get a multi-room system with dvr free of charge.in terms of equipment quality, dish network and directv are hard to split. the same goes for their customer service. in recent customer satisfaction surveys, both have come out well. so far then these two great rivals match each other, how is a new customer going to make a decision? programming packages on the other hand are where they are different, and rightly so. there is no point in the two networks providing the same channel choices. it is in terms of range of entertainment and pricing that a tv customer can make a decision.when it comes to programming it is possible to separate the deals that dish network and directv are offering. which one offers the best deals? it really depends on your idea of entertainment. if you are looking for range of packages and channels and better overall price, then dish network is the deal to go for. if on the other hand sport or local channels are important, then directv might be the choice. choose wisely though because you will need to sign up for a year or more and you want to make sure that you have the right package. remember that is always easy to add packages later if you decide that you want additional channels. if cost is the main driver, it is difficult to beat dish network. even if the difference in cost between dish network and directv doesn�t sound too big, the savings start to mount up when you calculate how much you would save over one year.in summary, both directv and dish network deals provide the consumer with bargains, discounts and specials. these change week by week and the top deal this week will not necessarily be available next week. it is always worthwhile doing some internet comparison shopping to find the one that is right for you. as long as you find a nationwide installer and equipment warranties, get rebates on programming packages, you can�t go too far wrong.labels: directv vs. dish network, dish network deals, dish network offers

	 the history of the radio flyer company
	 
    



the wonderful toys produced by radio flyer have been a staple of childhood memories for over 85 years. through the years, this popular toy company has continually improved in production and features, expanding their product line to entertain the children of each era.the first radio flyer wagons were handcrafted by the 16 year old founder of the company, antonio pasin. these original wagons were made of sturdy wood using only the most basic wood-working equipment. by the beginning of the 1920's, radio flyer followed the automotive industry's lead and began manufacturing its signature wagon with steel. the first line of products, named the liberty line, included wagons, tricycles, and scooters, all made of innovative steel.as the american economy slumped during the era of the great depression, radio flyer remained strong. the company was showcased at the 1933 world fair in chicago and used simple advertising campaigns to promote their little red wagon. in the mid-30's the now world famous company introduced a second line of coaster wagons, the streak-o-lite. the streak-o-lite was modeled after the sleek style of the zephyr trains, featuring control knobs and headlights that really worked.between 1942 and 1945 radio flyer, like many other american manufacturing companies, ceased production of their well known toys and spent their time manufacturing steel products needed by american troops during the second world war. radio flyer was awarded by the us army and navy for their high achievement in producing the much needed war materials. the company's notability for their war efforts boosted confidence in their products. the radio line of the forties included three unique wagon styles combining steel and the original wooden construction and a sleek steel scooter.by the middle of the century, radio flyer was a household name. the economy was steadily rising and products of the baby boom era were enjoying radio flyer specialty wagons inspired by popular television shows like the mickey mouse club. the company even introduced a line of garden carts to aid suburban housewives with their yard care. america's love of radio flyer continued to grow through the sixties as the company celebrated their fiftieth year.with new logos and new product lines, radio flyer gracefully turned fifty. a new line of toddler walk-behind toys were introduced and the revolutionary scat racer ride-on toy became the envy of little racers everywhere. the next major shift in product line introduced the ski sled. this sleek sled was capable of carrying adult riders and featured a hand brake for added safety.over the next few years radio flyer's line of products continued to expand. those who enjoyed radio flyer toys as a child were now grown up with homes and children of their own. for these loyal customers, radio flyer introduced it's all grown up line of outdoor furniture and heavy duty wheelbarrows. with the nineties, radio flyer added plastic wagons to their product line and offered many of their classic wagons and toys with new all-terrain tires.today, radio flyer is the world's leading manufacturer of not only wagons, but tricycles as well. the company and their creative toys have had a place in the hearts and homes of both the young and old for almost ninety years and now holds a place in the toy industry hall of fame as well. radio flyer's imaginative creations will continue to grow with the times and remain a mainstay in childhoods everywhere.labels: americana, pasin, radio flyer, radio flyer wagon, radio flyer wagons, radio steel, red wagons

	 satellite descrambler makes a clear picture
	 
    



a satellite descrambler is a satellite card that contains specific software for authorized satellite users to access a clear, digital satellite picture that they usually pay a monthly subscription fee for. this is the piece of technology designed by companies to deal with the increasing problem of unauthorized users hacking the signals.without the appropriate descrambler the user will only receive the scrambled signal from the satellite. an authorized user is given the appropriate descrambler in order to enjoy whatever satellite programming they ordered.the price for the satellite descramblers varies. some people pay up to a few hundred dollars while other satellite television providers charge more for programming, but add the software for free. doing just a little bit of research and homework can allow you to know what to expect. the channels that will actually be available through the descrambler will depend upon the package that you have selected and the specific satellite system.if you are looking at a satellite tv system, then there's no question you will need to purchase or acquire a satellite descrambler of some type. there are two types of satellite tv signals available for consumers to access: free to air (fta) and premium. to simplify, anything that is premium and pay-per-view you need a satellite descrambler for. anything else you don't.satellite tv is beamed through a signal from a satellite to a satellite dish and then passed via a cable to the receiver which is usually next to your tv. the job of the receiver is to convert the radio frequency signal from the satellite dish into audio and video signals that you can feed into your home television equipment, i.e. the tv shows.the signals for satellite shows are intentionally scrambled, which is why people without subscriptions get white fuzz, because a satellite descrambler is needed to "decode" the intentionally scrambled picture to make sense of it all.satellite descramblers will allow a wide range of shows to be available for a consumer's attention, but the satellite providers need to pay for the huge expense of the satellites, which is why a monthly subscription is charged for your satellite tv. the descrambler is the tool that allows the shows to actually come in. they are also the tools that prevent individuals from watching satellite tv for free.one way to think of a satellite descrambler is like an interpreter. the mixed up signals are a foreign language you have never heard of, and have absolutely no way to figure out. but with the sofware acting as an interpreter, the "gibberish" comes into clear focus in a language you can understand and comprehend.that's what a satellite descrambler does: it literally unscrambles a scrambled signal so you can enjoy quality television in your own home.labels: descramblers, satellite, satellite descramblers

	 which is better dish network or direct tv?
	 
    



dish network and direct tv both offer fabulous satellite tv entertainment. choosing a television provider is a big decision and there are many choices to make. it is possible to get bogged down in determining who is the best provider and who give the best values. though it is clear that satellite television has many advantages over cable television, there is no clear winner between the two satellite television companies: direct tv and dish network. both companies have many different benefits to offer customers and depending on your exact situation, either company might be the right choice for you.one of the most important aspects of choosing a television provider is the number of channels they can offer. with either dishnetwork or directv, you can get packages that provide over 250 channels. this makes either satellite tv company a good choice for a wide variety of entertainment that includes children's programming, news, movies, sports, and more.with dish network satellitetv , your package options include america's top 100, america's top 200, and america's top 250, which include 100, 200 and 250 channels respectively. all packages have sirius satellite radio stations and basic channels like espn, mtv, qvc, and cnn. the larger ones include more special channels such as espnews, the outdoor channel, soapnet, and the golf channel. premium movie packages including hbo, starz, showtime, and cinemax are available either individually or with the america's everything pak, which includes over 250 channels plus all four premiums. dish network also has a special small package, called dish family that has about 40 channels for a very low price. dish network tends to offer slightly better deals.with directv satellite, the main package options come in a 140 channel, 185 channel, and 250 channel variety. the 185 channel package, choice xtra has two additional options that can give you dvr service or dvr service and high definition television programming. premier is the over 250 channel package that includes dvr service in the package. unlike dishnetwork satellite, direct tv's 250 channel package has premium movie channels included. these premiums are the same as in dish network: starz, showtime, cinemax, and hbo.when it comes to specialty coverage, dish network and direct tv have different selections. dish network has a lot of foreign language programming including four spanish-language packages, packages in over 19 other languages, and many individual foreign language channels. directtv satellite does not have quite as many choices, though it still has a respectable 13 language accounted for, including many spanish channels.for high definition television (hdtv) entertainment, dish network has more choices. dishnetwork's selection is now up to 31 channels including many channels that are exclusive to the high definition format. dish network lets you add the hd programming package to any package and it includes premium hdtv channels including showtime, hbo, and starz. direct tv also lets you add their hd programming package to any base package or it can be purchased in the choice xtra plus package. however, there are only 11 hdtv channels to choose from. either company can provide local channels in high definition if they are available in your area.though direct tv has fewer hdtv choices than dish network, directv has a larger sports selection. this makes it the choice for die hard sports fans. direct tv has the popular nfl sunday ticket, but both companies offer other sports subscriptions like mlb extra innings, nhl center ice, and mls direct kick. directtv satellite offers its sports pak as a part of the premier package. dishnet satellite doesn't have their multi-sport package as part of any larger package, but it can be added to their programming packages.depending on the type of television you tend to watch most, you will find that either direct tv or dish network will make a better company for you. though, with whichever one you choose, you'll get high quality satellite television service that will provide good television entertainment.customer satisfactiondish network satellite tv is ranked at the top in customer satisfaction among all the cable television & satellite tv providers.direct tv is ranked second in customer satisfaction among all the cable television & satellite providers.direct tv vs dishnetwork --- the bottom lineboth directv and dish network offer top-of-the-line satellite tv equipment and all-digital programming for the best picture and sound available. both companies are currently offering special hdtv and dvr deals. tired of cable tv hassles?

	 everything you need to know about satellite tv!
	 
    



why satellite tv?satellite tv is beamed directly to the little satellite dish on top of your house, or it may be hanging off the balcony, or even inside, pointing through a skylight or window. it's dependent on whether you own the house or not. it is preferable to drill holes and mount the satellite dish but this not possible if you are renting.does satellite tv fade out in bad weather?the satellite tv providers would like us to think it doesn't, but it can in extreme conditions. it's the same as cable, which also gets most of its feeds from a satellite. but believe me, if it gets that bad, the satellite tv reception will be the last thing on your mind.  how much does it cost? honestly about the same as cable, unless you're one of those cheapies who only have the basic deal with 15 channels. the first 125 direct tv channels will cost around $39.95 per month, plus a little tax in many states. most deals are very similar and can only be separated by the free giveaway they provide that month.can you install it yourself?of course (not!) just like you can restore the '68 ' corvette in the garage. you know, the one that's been in there since you had pimples? actually, it's not much harder to install satellite tv than to put those kid's toys together on christmas eve! most of the companies even translate the japanese for you.how about portability?yep. it does seem like we all move a lot more than we used to. unless you move to alaska, hawaii (like you're really going to watch tv there!), or some foreign country like new jersey, they will be glad to keep taking your money. many will even re-install the equipment for free.  can you get free installation? if you like to shop, there is always a deal. it may take a lot of digging. just let you fingers do the pounding on the keyboard. everything can be shopped on the internet. even satellite tv.what about hooking it into my phone line?don't skip plugging in the phone jack. for some services, like ordering your very own personal movie, if you don't have it plugged into a phone line, it costs an extra fee every time you order.how about putting it on several tv's?sure, you can even get satellite tv into your shower, with the right stuff. anything is possible, well almost. it usually costs about $4.99 per month per set.what's with the access card?satellite tv figured out a way to keep us all honest. without an access card, you don't get access. after all, unless they're on public tv, those actors don't work for peanuts!how does this 'interactive' service work?on certain channels (which usually have a little 'i' on them, for some reason), you can interact with the feature showing, or even with the commercial. just like the guy in the chocolate factory, i guess. it will even give you additional entertainment and electronic shopping.what about internet through satellite tv?no problem. the consumer is king. you ask and the satellite providers provide. be sure they translate the instructions for hooking that up, though.we've certainly come a long way from the wire antenna that had to be pointed in just a certain direction to pick up your favorite station.labels: direct tv cheap, directtv offers, directv distributor, dishnetwork, free sat tv, satellite tv
