wotton is a charming country town, steeped in history, nestled in the southern cotswold hills. close to gloucester and bristol, cheltenham, cirencester and bath. and not far from the m4 (j18) and m5 (j14). for those enjoying a slower mode of transport, the cotswold way national trail passes through the town, and along the main shopping streets, which are packed with small family run shops selling a large range of goods. the town also offers a wide range of services and places to eat.
wotton is a hospitable, thriving and lively place, with a variety of historic listed buildings. many visitors fall in love with this ancient town, which still embodies many of the features of small town life that sadly have disappeared from bigger places. life has a gentler (but still stimulating) pace – explore for yourself – but be warned you may find you do not want to leave.
