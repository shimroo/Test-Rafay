cromohs is a peer-reviewed, open-access electronic history journal published in english, and over the last two decades has established a solid reputation for scholarly rigour. with a marked international outlook, it aims to encourage methodological debate arising from original and creative dialogue between scholarly traditions, and to promote innovative approaches to archival research. cromohs acts as a focal point and forum for challenging and fresh scholarship on fourteenth- to nineteenth-century intellectual, social and cultural history in a global perspective. it seeks to move beyond a strictly regional and eurocentric approach, with a preferential view towards histories of transcultural contacts and connections. articles relating to muslim societies (fourteenth-nineteenth centuries) are most welcome. more generally, cromohs strongly encourages contributions engaging with extra-european cultures and societies. cromohs invites theoretically informed work from a range of historical, cultural and social domains that interrogate cross-cultural and connected histories, intersecting the history of knowledge, emotions, religious beliefs, ethnography, cartography, the environment, material culture and the arts.
