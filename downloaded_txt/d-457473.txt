"stevens aviation uses the hartzell propeller service center for our propeller overhauls because of the turn time, price, experience and the ease of doing business. quality is still your best buy."
mick waltz
service manager, stevens aviation inc.


"jet air has been using the hartzell propeller service center for over 5 years and to date we have not had a warranty or workmanship issue.  keeping the propellers turning is what the customer expects along with the feeling of safety and trust. the overhaul turn time is continuing to be reduced without jeopardizing the quality of the product.  the personnel in piqua, ohio go above and beyond to get propellers back into our hands so we get our customers back flying. with any component that we install on our customer’s aircraft, the quality of the product must be to the highest standard. “failure is not an option.” hartzell propeller service center gives us that quality. when the propeller overhauls are due, we recommend the hartzell propeller service center to our customers."
joseph megna sr.



"the hartzell 3-bladed scimitar prop has really enhanced the ga8 airvans, in our experience providing smooth and improved climb performance with a significantly improved noise footprint. most recently, we have appreciated the prompt and effective support of hartzell when an unexpected hitch on prop overhaul had our c208b grounded at a peak time. rapid delivery of a new replacement propeller was exemplary and lead to our company exploring 4- and 3-blade hartzell propeller options for reduced noise emission important in our operation."
richard rayward



"i depend on my hartzell propeller to help me do the job…without fail. i have been running the hartzell propeller for over 14 years. i have never been let down by this prop…in any way! it has been reliable and maintenance free for all 14 years, other than a fresh coat of paint! the performance i get from the hartzell propeller is truly second to none. couple this with its 100% reliability over the past 14 years, and you have a winning combination. my sponsor depends on me to be at the shows on time and ready to perform…without my hartzell propeller mounted up front, i don’t think i could deliver with such confidence and reliability. with so many aspects in the airshow business to worry about…its nice to know that my hartzell propeller isn’t one of them…its always been ready...and has never let me down. i take great pride in flying american made. i have met and worked with the people of hartzell propellers…each and every person there takes the same pride in the design, manufacturing and support of their props as i do flying behind it. as the lead pilot of “the 4ce” formation aerobatic team, i need to have 100% trust not only in my teammates, but in my hartzell prop to run smooth and reliably…with only a couple feet of separation between our planes, there is no room for “second best.”
matt chapman
aerobatic performer, matt chapman airshows


"my hartzell propeller is simply bulletproof. there are few aviators who rely on their prop more than me, and with a hartzell, i have the ultimate confidence that it will never let me down. the fact is that the hartzell propeller gives me the ultimate in performance and reliability."
michael goulian
aerobatic pilot, goulian aerosports
