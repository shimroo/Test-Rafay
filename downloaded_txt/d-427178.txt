in memory of tracy carr
 

 














 
orion hunter elite recently lost one of our most beloved coaches in our organizational history.  coach tracy was a wonderful family man and never missed a practice or game as he loved being a coach and mentor to his daughters melissa and tiffany as well as their many friends.  he was an assistant softball coach for orion hunter elite for almost 10 years coaching teams comprised of players from 10 to 18 years old.  coach tracy was the ultimate servant-leader, as he always put everyone else above himself, which was evident in his 20-year government career, his lifelong service to the community of windsor, and the countless hours he spent helping athletes achieve their dreams on and off the field.coach tracy was an “encourager”, who not only believed in every player, but also helped instill confidence and self-belief in each of them.  he was trusted by the girls he coached and mentored, and reinforced the need for practicing hard and giving 100% effort, 100% of the time.  coach tracy was well respected and highly thought of in the softball community by high school, travel ball, and college coaches as well. coach tracy helped lead orion hunter elite to many wins including a 12u national championship.  but nothing meant more to him than guiding and helping his softball players reach their goals of playing in college.  100% of the players tracy coached were able to live out their dreams of playing in college and all of them attributed part of their achievements to tracy’s encouragement and drive for success.  coach tracy never met a stranger, and the instant you met him, he made you feel like the most important person in the world.  each of his players felt the same way and knew that if they were not having their best day, coach tracy would be there to pick them up and provide the words of encouragement they needed.coach tracy’s dedication and loyalty to orion hunter elite and the fastpitch softball community as a whole will never be forgotten as his memory will live on forever.​
