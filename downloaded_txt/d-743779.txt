race, class food and the future of the city: a manifesto




by renina  jarmoni always want to know where people will go and what will they eat. last december i was in whole foods on a friday night, trying to read get throughsome really hard material on "the saturated self', i resorted to reading out loud,so that i could "hear the theory." a man who works for the environmental protectionagency over heard me, as i was astonished  when i learned that robert moses wasconsidered a modernist. knowing what i knew about robert moses, and then learningwhat a modernist was, i had an out loud aha moment. he asked if i was a city plannerand i said no, i do "race and the future of the city" and we started talking about his work on sustainable cities.i asked him the million dollar question. if you are working to make the cities better,how are you going to deal with a few centuries of united states racism? he looked at me, and said, well, i don't know, but what i am advocating for makessense for all of us, clean energy, efficient transportation  and better local food. andi responded, racism is irrational, and that he was going to have to fight tooth andnail to impact the quality of lives of black folks in the city.   my conversation with him got me think about writing a piece about race, class, food,and the future of the city, rooted in both a global and a local sense.we need a new system, because the current one does not work. this newsystem must be simultaneously global and local. furthermore, if it is rootedin the exploitation of the people in the global south it will fail. systems premisedon exploitation  carry in themselves their own demise. the question is just when. cheap food requires cheap laborin the article, as the economy withers, thoughts on an inequitable food system, tomm phillpot writes,in short, an economy hinged on cheap labor needs cheap food. and that’s the structural problem faced by slow food and other would-be reformers of the food system. the challenge of food reformers isn’t just to reform the food system; it’s to reshape the entire economy—to create new economic models that revalue labor along with food, so that people can afford the revalued food.phillpot  goes on to write, quoting julie guttman,those who complain about the use of food stamps to purchase cheap, junky food ought to set their sights elsewhere. they should consider the myriad policies that allow products laden with high fructose corn syrup, transfats, growth hormones and synthetic processing aids to be sold as food. in my view, the unemployed and poor shouldn’t pay the moral price for our collective failure to curb the excesses of the food industry.phillpot  also mentions caitlin donahue's article, "out of reach: how thesustainable local food movement neglects poor workers and eaters"in the guardian, which essentially argues that the slow food movement hasa class problem. she writes that it is a movement, that has yet to really confront its class issues. though organic grocery stores and farmers markets have sprung up on san francisco’s street corners, it remains to be seen whether our current mania for sustainable, local food will positively affect the lower classes, be they farm workers or poor families.phillpot goes on to make an incredibly astute observation about class whenhe writes,donohue hinges her story on a dismal paradox of the food system: farm workers are so poorly paid that they can only reasonably afford the lowest-quality food. the same can be said for most of the other people who keep the food-system humming: slaughterhouse workers, dishwashers, line cooks, wal-mart clerks. there’s no generating vast quantities of cheap food without vast quantities of cheap labor. i am glad to see that phillpot is thinking not only about food but labor as well, because theyare most certainly connected.  initially, i thought that local, green, sustainable economieswere the future. but, three things forced me to reconsider this idea.the first was reading chandra mohanty's feminism without borders, the secondwas reading, mike davis's planet of slums, the third was hearing my professor say,that "a unit for profit, requires exploitation."mohanty forced me to see how the quality of life of people in the global northis subsidized by the quality of life of people in the global south. in feminismwithout borders, she qotes zillah eisensten who writes, "women do two thirdsof the worlds work, for one tenth of the income" and that "women and girls are themajority of the worlds poor and the majority of the worlds refugees."it is largely women and children, working in factories, who make many of the itemsthat we shop for in our stores. in fact the cheap prices of the items that we buy isdirectly correlated to their low wages.our lives are connected.from elsa barkely brown i have learned that our difference is relational. this is importantto keep in mind when talking about who has which job, who has access to which resources.mike davis has both an article and a book titled planet of slums. his work has forcedme to rethink how my local, crunchy bougie black girl sustainability idea was goingto address the 100 million  global street kids.mike davis premise #1"for the first time the urban population of the earth will outnumber the rural. indeedgiven the imprecision of the third world census, this epochal transition mayhave already occurred."mike davis premise number 2"cities have absorbed nearly two thirds of the global population explosion since 1950and are currently growing  by a million babies and migrants each week.as a result, cities will account for all future world population growth, which isexpected to peak at a 10 billion in 2050."essentially, globally rural folks are being forcibly removed from rural lands to the citiesto do jobs, that may or may not exist. these lands are extremely mineral rich andvaluable to multinational corporations.how does these women survive, in an informal economy? according to davis, by"selling water, carting nightsoil, recycling trash, delivering propane and so on."mike davis premise # 3"the africa case was particularly paradoxical. how could cities like cote d'ivorie,tanzania, gabon and elsewhere, whose economies  were contracting by2 to 5 percent per year still sustain growth of 5 to 8 percent per annum. part ofthe secret was that imf, and now wto policies of agricultural deregulation andde-peasantization were accelerating the exodus  of surplusrural labor to urban slums even as cities cease to be job machines."now do you get where i am going with sustainability for whom?hence the statement about cheap labor and cheap food was incredibly interestingto me, becuase i honestly to hear people make that connection often. i argue that the issue isn't green or local economies, but is far more global in nature.  the city, black people and american democracy the population of black people in the city, historically, has been relevant to theways in which america has been pushed to towards democracy, for black peopleand for all of its residents who weren't legally citizens.this is not to discount the struggles that occurred in the montgomery and little rock.in fact given the fact that according to a new york times article about a new report bythe southern education foundation,the south has become the first region in the country where more than half of public school students are poor and more than half are members of minorities.keep this in mind, as i will return to it later.the city is increasingly becoming a place where only households with a  combinedincome nearing 100k or more can live and enjoy the amenities,social status,health care, eduction and benefits of being in the city.what happens to a city when it's workers can no longer afford to live there? according to another recent article in th  new york times, harlem is no longer majority black. in seeing the demography shift explained in the article above, i posit that thoselow income folks who left harlem and are now in the south. shaila dewan writes inthe new york times,the shift was fueled not by white flight from public schools, which spiked during desegregation but has not had much effect on school demographics since the early 1980s. rather, an influx of latinos and other ethnic groups, the return of blacks to the south and higher birth rates among black and latino families have contributed to the change.the first thing i wanted to know was where did the people go who lived  there andwhat are they going to eat?what are the political implications of black and latino poverty re-clustering in the south?back to harlem. for me, the issue with harlem, isn't race, but it is class. if the cities, have historically  been, largely, the home of black resistance, whathappens to our democracy when there aren't any more working class or lowincome black people in the city?is this setting the stage for cities to become playgrounds for europeanand international elites with euros?how bad will it have to get for us to decide to create a city that has housing and jobsfor working class folks, middle class and the elite?will our ideologies shift so that minimum wage becomes the new middle class?  what happens when the city is comprised of black folks who have choseninto the structure rather than change it openly choose to not be  apart of it. farms, food and social justice vandana shiva has dedicated her life to collecting seeds. trained as a physicist, she is a  philosopher, environmental activist and eco-feminist. her central argumentis that the seed belongs to all of us, not corporations. she explains how the structuraladjustment program and international programs have impacted indian farmers whenshe writes,in 1998, the world bank's structural adjustment policies forced india to open up its seed sector to global corporations like cargill, monsanto and syngenta. the global corporations changed the input economy overnight. farm saved seeds were replaced by corporate seeds, which need fertilizers and pesticides and cannot be saved. corporations prevent seed savings through patents and by engineering seeds with non-renewable traits. as a result, poor peasants have to buy new seeds for every planting season and what was traditionally a free resource, available by putting aside a small portion of the crop, becomes a commodity. this new expense increases poverty and leads to indebtness.currently mostanto, is patenting seeds, and selling them back to farmers. according to john barlett in vanity fair, farmers who buy monsanto’s patented roundup ready seeds are required to sign an agreement promising not to save the seed produced after each harvest for re-planting, or to sell the seed to other farmers. this means that farmers must buy new seed every year. those increased sales, coupled with ballooning sales of its roundup weed killer, have been a bonanza for monsanto.bartlett goes into the history of the courts and mosanto when he writes, in 1980 the u.s. supreme court, in a five-to-four decision, turned seeds into widgets, laying the groundwork for a handful of corporations to begin taking control of the world’s food supply. in its decision, the court extended patent law to cover “a live human-made microorganism.” in this case, the organism wasn’t even a seed. rather, it was a pseudomonas bacterium developed by a general electric scientist to clean up oil spills. but the precedent was set, and monsanto took advantage of it. since the 1980s, monsanto has become the world leader in genetic modification of seeds and has won 674 biotechnology patents, more than any other company, according to u.s. department of agriculture data.in india, the farmers are unable to make a living off of farming and one the  devastating consequences of this is that two hundred thousand indian farmers have committed suicide in the last twenty years.to add on to the privatization of seeds, global corporations are buying up internationalfarm lands for the purposes of outsourcing food production. andrew rice writes inthe new york times, in a series of meetings, saudi government officials, bankers and agribusiness executives told an institute delegation led by zeigler that they intended to spend billions of dollars to establish plantations to produce rice and other staple crops in african nations like mali, senegal, sudan and ethiopia. “they laid out this incredible plan,” zeigler recalled. he was flabbergasted, not only by the scale of the projects but also by the audacity of their setting. africa, the world’s most famished continent, can’t currently feed itself, let alone foreign markets.given all this, food, race, privatized seeds and lands, the removal of low and middleincome earners from the economy and the city, i am convinced that paradigm shift isoccurring, and the question is, in whose interests and what are we going to do about it?when are we going to engage it, name it and activlely work to direct it? if we are able to simultaneously, think, act and plan locally and globally, i hope that we will be in a better position than we are today.

happy black girl day x assimilation x whiteness




happy black girl day black assimilation is premised on being accepted by white peopleand making them feel comfortable. in reading kevin mumford's brilliant book,  interzones, i learned that theurban  league and the naacp are historically rooted in makingsure that country  negros from the south, who moved to the north,didn't make aspiring middle  class black folks look bad.these two groups monitored negro behavior on the streets, went door todoor teaching folks about "personal cleanliness" and monitored black sexworkers.i am excited about #happyblackgirl day because it is about usaffirming ourselves and not looking to mainstream media to do so.i am grateful that @sistatoldja took the time to make it happen.the 7th day of every month is now, happy black girl day. wooter.last week i tweeted "black women are awesome on 55 million differentlevels. cnn can't capture that and i don't expect them to. it ain't they job, its ours." i see those reports and roll my eyes because i know that when cnn does theirnegro reports they are simply doing their job, which is to serve the  interestsof the shareholders and of the white power structure.don't get me wrong, if cnn was like, can you come on and talk aboutblack women's sexuality, global economy or gentrification, i would roll,but i highly doubt that phone would ring, lols. renina the pundit. ha!back to the hair. black women needing to straighten their hair to increasetheir chances of getting a job or a mate, is a manifestation of structural domination.in other words, if white women had to go through what we did ever 4-6 weeksto turn their hair into naps, in order to try and ensure their survival as employeesthen the conversation about black hair would be different.last fall when alison samuels was talking shit about zahara jolie-pitts napps,all i could think was can this child live? can i live? sidebar i haven't combedmy hair since late december, i never just rocked the fro, and it has been anilluminating experience. i am more self-conscious, always touching it, andit's just really big and unruly and i get stared at. who knew? talkingabout the self presentation of black girls the politics of respectability, samuels writes,but even the mothers who spare the hot comb still have to put time and effort into keeping hair healthy: any self-respecting black mother knows that she must comb, oil, and brush her daughter’s hair every night. this prevents the hair from matting up, drying out, and breaking off. it also prevents any older relatives from asking them why you’re neglecting your child and letting her run around looking like a wild woman. having well-managed hair is not just about style, it’s about pride, dignity, and self-respect. keeping your daughter’s hair neat is an unspoken rule of parental duties that everyone in the community recognizes and respects.hair that is nice, neat, and cared for also gives african-american girls the confidence that they can fit into the world at large without being seen as completely different.there is a lot to unpack here, so first lets have a little primer on whiteness.george yancy writes in feminism and the subtext of whiteness, "whitenessgoes unmarked" yet "it assumes to speak with universal authority can truth."he goes on to say,whiteness assumes the authority to marginalize other identities, discoursesperspectives and voices. by constituting itself as the center, non white voicesare othered, marginalized and rendered voiceless.when we think about assimilation we have to think about whiteness becausethe two are related, in this country. furthermore, what are the political, socialand spiritual consequences for a black person assimilating into a systemthat is historically rooted in oppressing that person. yancey goes on to writequoting ruth frankenberg,first whiteness is a location of structural advantage or race privilege. second, it is astandpoint a place from which white people look at ourselves, at others and at society.third "whiteness" refers to a set of cultural practices that are usually unmarked,unnamed.now that we have a working definition of whiteness laid out, we can get into zaharaand assimilation.black peoples respectability politics make my ass itch and samuels commentis the embodiment of black respectability politics. there is no greater freedom than being about to be yourself, and i cannot bemyself assimilate for whites at the same time. or perhaps i should say it is atenuous challenge to do so. don't get me wrong, i understand that it is a danceand i have changed my self presentation in order to pursue opportunitiesthroughout my life.we constantly adjust our blackness in order to make white folksfeel more comfortable.this is the essence of quest loves piece aboutabout "the little things" and the ways in which he adjust's his presentation ofblack masculinity in the presence of white folks.we do what we have to do in order to survive. wigs, perms,weaves and god knows what else. jonzey says that i put too much on whiteperception of our hair in the workplace. and i may, however, if it comes downto  me and another candidate and her straight blond hair is perceived as moreattractive then my black napps, twists or straight hair, then i lose, and this, isstructural domination.what would our hair look like if we didn't need to straighten it in order to  keepa job? the gods to honest truth is that zahara jolie-pitt, for all intents and purposes isa member of the american elite, and one of the benefits of being  member of theelite is that your "deviance" is not susceptible to being punished the same waythat it would be if you are low income. which brings me to the social costs ofassimilation.assimilation has a price. this is one of the reasons why i liked the conversationaround "bitch is the new black" because i would frame it as a one about thesocial costs of assimilation.as i read the article i thought, class wise, do working class heterosexual andqueer black women have the same dating and marriage statistics and challenges?do affluent queer and heterosexual black women and have the same datingand marriage statistics and challenges?when i hear middle class heterosexual folks talk about the "dearth" of similarlyposition black men  to date, i think of public education.  what does it mean forheterosexual black women  when black  boys are placed by a whiteschool system on a punishment/jail track at six years old, in first grade, andwhat are we going to do about it? why in the name of apartheid is this acceptable?historically, america has been premised on both the notion of democracy andthe material reality of black oppression and the denial full citizenship toall african americans. peniel joseph's new book from black power to obamagets into this. the fact that we have been denied full citizenship is why the "arewest indians/black beef is so deep?" this is why all immigrants are compared toamerican blacks.the notion is, if you can't be white you sure as hell don't want to be black. which leads me to ask, when can we just be,  just simply be able to live and be ourselves? we were never meant to survive, so for us to be talking about happyblackgirlday isrevolutionary on levels that i lightweight can't articulate right now but i am trying. when will we be able to be happy, joyous and free? as black women we put our lives on hold for our lovers, our mommas, our families,our kids, guess what, that life will never come unless we claim it. sitting in tuesdays,waiting for the chicken bone bus on new years eve, white dude who loves blackwomen strikes up a conversation with the me. he brings  up the "bitch is the newblack" article. i listen. and then while talking about his black women friends,  hesays something profound, when he mentions that we "seem to put our lives on hold."i get that sometimes we have to do it, to push through. however, every time we put ourlives on hold for someone or something else, this is a willful act. we are not objects,we are human.i could give a fuck about what a steve harvey or anyone else has to say aboutblack women's marital statistics. anyone paying their rent talking shit about uscan miss me with those. rather than tell our story and reduce black men tobeing only worth what they can pay for on a date or in rent, how about writingabout his own relationships with his family members, his mother, his daddy,his children, his narrative, his journey. hmmp.happy black girl day.with love, resistance and desire.

chicken bone bus




 on everything i love. i was on the bus from dc to ny on new years eve. this dude, sitting next to me after the philly stop, was sippingsomething in a 16 oz pepsi bottle. he then gets up and announcesthat he wants to "start a gambling jawn, on the bus, give the driver 20%, who's in?"he was an older cat, with a fedora, glasses.dude in the back is like "sit that shit down and shut the fuck up." this cat, got a puff coat on, with fur around the collar, looking like babywith a tattoo tear. and fearless.you know how you can tell that a person don't care about shooting intoa crowd. bad for me, because i was sitting next to the gambler. i'm like. lawd, we are an hour away, please, its new years eve. come on boo. so. dude in the back is like "sit down og, ain't nobody trying to hear that." gambling dude, is like "what, i'm trying to make some money, we can all makesome money, give 20% to the driver." before i know it, these cats are standing up. in fact, there are four black men, standing up, on the middle of the bus, the  lightson are at this time. the gambler, stood up, reaching into his pocket, he washolding something.the baby looking dude, was like "what, whatchu gone do,  watchu got?" he had that wildfreeway, "who you" look in his eye. another man was was pleading, "my kids are on this bus, don't do this." it wasreally bugged out to see these four black men, to see black masculinity beperformed and navigated in this instance.ummm hmmmp. philly.in some ways it was familiar, in some was it was absurd. it worked out.but really. on the bus ock?reminds me of how rap songs, be a song, but when faced with thereal life issue of, "do he have a gun?" it is totally different.

bless him, change me




love. resistance. desire.about a week or so ago fd said, "he couldn't do it anymore."ouch.i thought it was just a strong response to the holiday season,but i ain't heard from him.it was a little rocky.the tipping point for me, was didn't hear from him when we hadblizzard a couple of weeks back. he had a resentment towards me,as i was venting about school and my land lord and not taking any actions.the resentment was fine, but black people call  black people to check on themwhen we get  two feet of snow. that's just gp love.i also got stranded in maryland that day. the trains and buses just stoppedrunning. lp's loving partner gave me a ride home, in a stick shift, in a blizzard.i was grateful.in the week preceding fd also spoke to me twice in a way, that i was like, dude,where is my friend, 'cuz the person on the other end of the phone don't sound likelove bears. the tone of his voice communicated what the words didn't, desirehad waned.i didn't help any. i fucked up and pushed up on someone i had a thing withyears ago. i also mentioned it to fd. i know, black girl fail. things werealready fragile, then i went a did this. the awesome thing that came outof that behavior is the next day i felt. awful. i couldn't shake it.i told him about it.it was in that moment that i learned that no matter what was happeningin my life that i would be responsible to the maintenance of my interior life.i had a bottom, and tried to allow something material to fill a god sized hole.no bueno.i now see that work, home, school, roommate issues,  love life, my interior life needsto be maintained and now one could really do that but me, via god.i have worked hard on getting acclimated to school. it's really isolating.i am also getting use to being around new people.making new friends, learning the culture of grad school.black girls had a lot of new in '09.at times, i was self absorbed and not checking for him. in fact, it was onlyin talking with one of my homies that i realized the significance of fd's had acareer milestone. he finished his course work. however, i was deep in themidst of learning how to do apa citations. i didn't have the bandwith to reallyreflect on the significance of this with him.s.bot insisted on me writing this, but also insisted that i didn't call.i was like, i don't understand, why can't i do one and not the otherthey both constitute a communication. she was like, calling is a nono, but your blog is your space. so write. uhhhhhhhhh. hate her. love her.last thursday, i had just come back from brooklyn for xmas on sunday,and i saw his facebook status update said "queens bound" i was like wow,you ain't speaking but you got status updates. i lost it.so, i was standing in  my room, talking to my daddy, who is on thewest coast. he was like you sound really sad. i was, plus i was suppose to visithim, but i was working up the courage to tell him that  am not up to it right now.he asked me, what i was going to do for nye, i was like "make gumbo or lasagnaand watch csi". he was like, "are you sure." i mentioned that my support systemwas in brooklyn,  and i just got an email from my homie ian who is doinga free party. i would just need to find a place to stay, if i went back."he responded saying "go. then." i was like "i just got back, doesn't that lookkinda crazy?" he was like "no. right now you are in your own way, in your selfpity. other people ain't in they self pity. go, be around your friends and enjoyyourself. self pity leads to depression. your four walls at home will be there,but right now you need to get out of your own way." "you may hear from him,you may not, but you need to go where the love is."he was right, being around people that loved me, held me, fed me, was exactly whati needed.shaking her head at my scandalous silver leggings. ms. lovely, laid eyes onme and said i looked like i came from the future. that moment was priceless.on the train, i found my mind returning to the hurt and, wanting answers, but i stilledmyself. and when it got really real, i just said the first first part of the serenityprayer on repeat, until i thought about something else. interior life.i was also able to reflect on what it was like for me when i moved to newyork. how at times it was a slow grind to make friends, and in other instances,it was real easy. my first little crew was comprised of tiombe, bilal and robertglasper and while we only ran together for a month or so, it was nice to haverunning buddies. i also had homies at barnard who were from oakland. shit,i was spoiled. time takes time. luls.in the same way that i waited for god to put ms. fancy from the post below,on my path, i remain the same with this, bless him, change me.

a love letter to ms. fancy.




image courtesy of harry cutting. he has awesome stuff, check him out.a few weeks ago i woke up and realized that i am the person that i wantedto be when i was thirteen.at thirteen my closest friend was fancy and we were in middle school togetherin east oakland. we were nerdy, and skinny, not what the streets want, no?if the library had it we read it. i was partial to all the judy blume's,beverly cleary's, sweet valley high's and when i found walter dean myersi was home.we traded library books and sassy issues the way 8 year old boys tradedbaseball cards.we rode that emporium capwells basement in downtown oakland likea long island outlet mall the day after christmas.it was through my friendship with her that i saw how people treatedbrown skinned black girls. in some ways we learned how to negotiateour femininity together.by 15, we discovered berkeley's telegraph avenue, clothing stores, book stores,used record stores, natural hair, sewing and fashion magazines. while i likedthe source magazine, more than seventeen, we both shared our love of the glossies.in many ways i became myself in that era, or at the very least the ground was beingset for me to claim it in high school.she was always more of an alternative head than me, putting me on to neneh cherryand being the first black person that i ever knew to bump alanis morissette.our goal was to become fresh girls.fresh girls were natural, maybe wrote graffiti (or was at least cool with the crewwith the most ups), were smart, had cute clothes, some of which they madeand their own style.after middle school, i left oakland to go to high school in 'frisco,and a little after that she moved back east. we had a plan for her to moveto ny to model  and design clothes and i would go to college anddesign clothes, sell vintage clothes or write and just be around hip hop.i move to ny for school and she got married and had a baby, and for a hot minutei was like dude, what happened to our plan? being young and immaturei had a resentment.now that i am older i realize that all women have to make choices aboutbaby dreams vs. career dreams, especially when we live in society that needschildren, yet refuses to support the people who are implicitly charged with raisingthem.i also now realize how much of a gift it is to think of something at 14 and actuallybe able to do it 4 years later.back then i wanted to be nappy, be around black art, eat good food and reada lot.three weeks ago i realized that i am in fact this person.i get to be nappy, write about black women and pop culture (and my relationships)and have the things that i say be taken seriously by my blog readers and my professor'sand this is awesome.i googled ms. fancy a couple of weeks ago and found out she wasn't that far from me.in a twitter conversation with @prisonerswife i talked about how i wanted to saysomething, but i didn't want to come out the blue and the last few years of my lifehave taught me to leave well enough alone when it comes to people. i try to live byif it don't fit don't force it. this isn't hallways successful. i try to realize that peoplewill be bothered when they want to be,  otherwise i should leave them be.@prisonerswife responded saying something along the lines of, "people say thingslike that just because they don't want to step up" and i was like, "i'm pretty much a couragebear. if god wants me to be in contact with her, we will cross paths."ms. fancy facebooked me tuesday.merry christmas. woot.

beyonce incorporated: r&b, thugs and whiteness




  here is the thesis and intro ya'll. peace to birk and jess for helping me organize the beginning, i swear that's the hardest part, because the  rest of the framework flows from there.  in writing this i was reminded that its not enough to have something to say. its not enough to have read the books to be informed. it's onlyenough when i can frame and deploy a convincing argument.  if you have any questions, leave them below, and i will try and work them into the paper.  ~renina    beyonce incorporated: r&b, thugs and whiteness     since the 1998 crossover breakthrough of destiny’s child, beyonce knowles hasbeen a star on the rise.  since then she has released numerous albums, both withdestiny’s child and as a solo artist, she has starred in or served as a supportingactor in several major motion pictures, and has married a multiplatnuim selling rapartist.  in short, beyonce is everywhere, including the bank.  in fiscal year2007-2008, beyonce reportedly earned an estimated $87 million dollars.given that black wealth is incredible rare in the united states (oliver & shapiro, 2006),the reasons for beyonce’s incredible success are worth exploring.      in exploring the reasons for ms.knowles’ success, i am primarily concerned withthe intersection of popular culture and the day to day lived experience of africanamericans.  often times we listen to music without considering the fact that it isn’tneutral and that it also has an affect on the ways in which we go about our lives.  beyonce knowles is an accomplished, talented and attractive, singer, actor,entertainer and fashion designer.    she is also is fast becoming an entertainment empire in and of herself. while she“grew up in a four-bedroom home in houston's upscale third ward with her father,mathew, a salesman at xerox and johnson & johnson  mother, tina, a hair salonowner, and sister, solange knowles, sings.”according to forbes magazine,  ms. knowles has “sold upwards of 118 million records, won ten grammys,starred in seven films and headlined three solo tours” (rose, 2009). her endorsementdeals are extremely lucrative. she has had them with “tommy hillfiger l'oréal,giorgio armani diamonds perfume, samantha thavasa handbags” and in the lastyear, “she's added deals with crystal geyser and nintendo ds to her résumé” (rose, 2009).  further more, the blue chip corporation, general mills just underwrote her most recenttour, i am (rose, 2009). rose goes on to note that “beyoncé constantly works andreworks her act, watching every two-hour performance on tour--even after herhundredth appearance--taking notes on how to improve. "i'm never satisfied," shesays, adding with a nervous laugh, "i'm sure sometimes it's not easy working for me."then, seriously: "i've never met anyone that works harder than me in my industry”(rose, 2009). indeed, given the fact that she employs four hundred people andarguably many more through touring and merchandising, she, in many ways is acorporation.    according to marxist theory on cultural hegemony, “the class, which is the dominantmaterial force in society, is at the same time its dominant intellectual force”(strinati, 131).beyonce knowles earned an estimated 87 million dollars in fiscal year 2007-2008 notonly because she is talented and attractive but also because her most popular work serves the interests of the white ruling class elites, such as the presidents of fortune500 corporations and madison avenue advertising firms, wall street investment bankers,television and record executives. she serves the interests of the ruling class bynormalizing and never questioning the impact that white supremacist patriarchalcapitalism has on black heterosexual relationships. lyrics such as “pay my autobill, pay my telephone bill”, thug worship such as “ if his status ain’t hood, i ain’tmessing with him, he better be street if he looking at me” and “them hustlas keepon talking, they like the way i’m walking” reify the stereotype of the black, male, sexy thug. these lyrics also deploy the patriarchal notion that african american men  are only worth what they can contribute financially. furthermore such lyrics areproblematic because they place the economic issues facing black heterosexual couplessquarely on the shoulders of individuals while obscuring the structural forces acting onthe lives of such couples such as a historically segregated educational system, asegregated housing system, a discriminatory bank lending system, an oppressivepolice system, historically discriminatory judicial system, the war on drugs, the waron poverty and a largely self serving non-profit industrial complex.     i am making this argument because i am concerned with the package that hermessage comes in, the content of message that is deployed and the impact thatthis has on the masses of society, as popular culture is where most people learnabout society by deploying lyrics that focus on black women asking black menfor money for utility bills, that celebrate black men as the mythic thug, beyonceknowles both reifies the stereotype of rugged, violent, black men who work in theunderground economy. this is important because applying white hegemonic marketideology is harmful to black heterosexual relationships, given the fact that historically,black workers tend to be some of the lowest played workers in the united   states economy (oliver and shapiro).   thoughts?
