with jesus and with each other - we can create lasting change in our world today.














we live in a big world - with a lot of big problems. in every community, you’ll find marginalized people - stuck in cycles of poverty, oppression, and injustice.if you look around at common responses - you’ll see problems too; organizations who can’t work together, strategies that fail to empower local leaders, and cookie-cutter solutions that rarely result in sustainable change.maybe like us, you feel an ache in your chest that compels you to be part of change that lasts.




at one collective, we believe that the key to creating lasting change is centered in a model jesus showed us 2000 years ago.during his time on earth - he showed us a strategy that focused on the whole needs of a person, brought people together, and resulted in sustainable change.these ideas are at the center of the strategy one collective is using in communities around the world today. we’ve found that when people work together and follow the ways of jesus - the result is real, lasting change. 














video:a model that changes the worldsee how one collective’s global strategy and the ways of jesus are transforming communities around the world today. learn how you can join work happening and create impact that lasts. 
















one collective’s modelstrategy that creates lasting change
















change beginsa one collective leader called a catalyst enters a community and spends significant time building relationships, listening to, and learning from local leaders and partners who know their community best. a catalyst acts like a general contractor - working with local leaders to evaluate the needs and strengths present. then, a community plan is created that focuses on collaboration, holistic work, and sustainable solutions.
















change multiplieslocal leaders work to solve the needs that are present and strengths from the community are activated. strategic initiatives like businesses, projects, or community centers are started. change begins to multiply - person to person as the community starts to transform. additional workers from one collective join the work happening, and change is backed by a global network of support from experts, leaders, and partners.
















change expandswork expands as local leaders take ownership of key initiatives and adopt similar strategic steps in nearby locations. change spreads to nearby communities, neighboring regions, and then around the world, as people become unified around this collective strategy focused on holistic, collaborative, sustainable change.
