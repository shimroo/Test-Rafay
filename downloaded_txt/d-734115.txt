about the club

the myott collectors club has been formed as an   online source of information and meeting point for collectors and   admirers of myott ceramics. we initially concentrated on the 'art' of   myott, especially popularised by their highly distinctive art deco hand   painted vases and jugs, but due to demand from visitors have now   expanded facilities to cater for those interested in myott's connection   with goldscheider, chintz, cunard shipping line ware, the 1930's   designer gloria gladwyn and tranferware dinner services and tea and   coffee sets.



the   club was launched 22/09/02 and we are pleased to have already won an   award (see picture on right). all are welcome to browse the site, though   some areas are restricted to members only. to join the club simply   click the 'join the club' button. standard membership is £15 per year   and dealer membership is £25 per year.

membership fees levied will be used to maintain and   update the site, with an ultimate goal of reconstructing the lost   pattern books that were reportedly destroyed in a fire at the myott, son   & co. ltd. pottery in 1949 (although it is rumoured they survived   the fire and had surfaced in leeds a few years ago). in order to do  this  we need your assistance in providing data - however trivial - and   images of as many pieces as possible. have you or someone you have  known  worked for myott in the past? if so we would love to hear from  you.



some of the main features of the site are 'shapes patterns'   catalogues with rarity and value guides, a 'discussion' area in which   members can post questions and answers, and also a 'buy sell' section   where members can purchase and sell their myott ware. you can even use   an alias if you want.
if you are interested in expanding your collection then visit our vintage arts website where you will find myott for sale. you will also find other art deco pieces on this website.
if you have damaged myott that you need repairing or restoring then you use myott ceramics restoration. the restorers have many year's experience in the restoraton of ceramics.
