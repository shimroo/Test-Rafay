      diversity, inclusion and belonging
    
	the harvard university herbaria (huh) community denounces all forms of racism, harassment, and discrimination. we recognize the painful legacy of prejudice in which marginalized groups, especially scientists of color, who work across plant biology and academia have been made to feel unwelcome. with our colleagues across harvard (here, here and here) and in the botanical science and natural history communities, we stand ready to confront systematic racism and are committed to the creation of an inclusive and welcoming community in the huh. we commit to the creation of a society in which all individuals are valued and in which diversity is welcomed, whether in race, gender identity, age, socioeconomic background, religion, ethnicity, ability, language, sexual orientation, or veteran status.to these ends, we are engaged in a rigorous examination of our own institutional and interpersonal practices, and are committed to the ethical stewardship of the collections we hold in trust.
	we particularly want to invite all scientists to take advantage of funding opportunities that are a critical component to diversifying our community. please join us in this important work.
