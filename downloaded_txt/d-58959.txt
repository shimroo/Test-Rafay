have you ever asked yourself, "how can i get healthy?" while
  there are many ways to get healthy, the path to better health must include
  cleaning up the air you breathe, the water you drink and the food you eat,
  for they are the core elements of getting healthy. beyond that,
  there are other things that contribute to getting healthier, including
  the work you do, the friends you keep, the choices you make and the thoughts
  you think. so the answer to the question, "how do i get healthy" is
  to clean up  all those aspects of your life that contribute to unhealthiness.

far
  infrared light therapy devices
there is a long list of proven and effective health benefits of far
      infrared therapy that has been documented over the past 25 years. it is
        thought that light photons are absorbed by the skin and underlying tissue,
        which triggers biological changes within the body in a process known
        as photobiomodulation. although the exact mechanism of action is still
        undergoing study, what is known is that monochromatic light increases
      oxygen and blood flow, facilitating wound healing. 
we carry far infrared
        treatment devices for acne, pain relief, wrinkles and skin rejuvenation,
        a portable personal sauna and a sauna belt.

hemp
    heart high protein, essential fatty acids and fiber rich bars and seeds
hemp
  hearts (shelled hemp seeds) are the best source of protein, essential fats
  -- rich in omega -- vitamins and enzymes on the earth. those who begin each
  day with at least four or five tablespoons of hemp hearts, preferably with
  fruit and yogurt (vegetables for diabetics), will notice from the first day
  that they have sufficient energy for the entire day, that they expel wastes
  after every meal and that they are not hungry again until mid-afternoon.
hemp heart  energy bars  can be consumed
        as many separate protein and energy bars, as a large number of tiny but
  nutrient packed meal components (servings) or as several complete, high protein,
  high energy morning meals.hemp heart bars dark chocolate toppings are
        almond, cashew, macadamia, pecan,  pine nuts, cranberry, blueberry
        and strawberry. dark milk chocolate toppings are walnut, apricot, cherry
      and goji berry.


himalayan
  crystal rock salt products
three hundred million years ago, a vast primordial ocean covered the area
  that would become the himalayan mountain range. the salt of that unpolluted
  ocean was preserved as large crystal formations that now yield the purest
  salt on earth. 
we carry about a dozen different lamp shapes and sizes,  candleholders,
  bath salts, bath scrubs, table and cooking salt in fine or coarse, salt chunks
  for sole, detox lamp and

odor
  elimination sponges and sprays
our senses are bombarded by offensive odors from a variety of sources, like
    body odors, pet odors, food odors, smoke odors and musty odors. obviously,
    the best way to get rid of an odor is to remove and clean the odor causing
    substance. but some odors are very difficult to eliminate even with washing,
    since any porous material like wood, drywall, carpeting, etc. holds the odor
    molecules inside.
 no matter what the source of the odor is, we have products
    to remove the smelly offenders, including odor sponges, odor sprays and air
    purifiers. after selling this product since 1994, we have yet to find an
    order problem the sponges or sprays will not eliminate.
 


products
    for pregnant and nursing women
what you eat and put on your skin gets absorbed by you and your baby, so
    it is especially important to select chemical-free products that support
    better health.that includes the creams you put on your
    skin, the water you bath in and drink and the food you eat.
