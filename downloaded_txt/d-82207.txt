inspired reminders bulletin: your body is fighting you!







greetings dear readers!

the may livingafterwls inspired reminders newsletter was published and delivered to your inbox today. be sure to check it out, it is full of useful information you need to know in your wls journey. here is the introduction and if you are not subscribed you can can read it here in our online archive: livingafterwls may inspired reminders bulletin

it's not your imagination!
                        




your body is fighting against weight loss.    



  






the chills & thrills of weight loss surgery.


in 2009 i wrote, 
                         "ten years after being gut-whacked and i'm still on a diet." that is what i wanted to title my book which was eventually published as 
                         "day 6: beyond the 5 day pouch test." 
in the introduction i explained, "no matter what treatment a person with
 the disease of morbid obesity seeks there is a tough journey to follow.
 there is no "easy way out." i am still on a diet. and it doesn't look 
to change anytime soon."
                         

jump forward to spring 2017: i'm 18-years 
removed from surgery and i'm still on a diet! i guess i'm in it for 
life. at one time this realization would have scared the jelly out of my
 doughnut. but these days it's my security blanket. i know i have a 
disease: obesity. i have been surgically treated for the disease. by 
following the prescribed lifestyle plan including diet and exercise i 
can work with my surgery to keep the disease in remission. that is the 
cold hard reality for all of us living after wls. (see the article below
 
                         obesity reclassified from 2013 when the ama official categorized obesity a disease.)
                         

mind you, this acceptance was not easily 
achieved. i rebelled with vigor against the rules abandoning diet and 
physical activity in favor of hoping for the best. leaving things to 
chance, however, did not help me control my obesity before surgery or 
after surgery. in our wls community the path commonly trends to complete
 compliance following surgery followed by a detour along the road to 
chance and then, hopefully, a calm resolve of acceptance and renewed 
commitment to the lifestyle that supports our health and weight 
management goals. i've observed this trend for a decade and the 
anecdotal evidence predicts most patients will experience this learning 
curve.
                         

today's bulletin features a look at why our body resists weight loss in the feature article 
                         it's not your imagination! your body is fighting everything you do to lose weight. i found this subject revealing. i hope you enjoy it. as mentioned above you will find information about the 
                         2013 obesity classification and also a primer 
                         obesity defined. be sure to check out our 
                         recipe: tuna pasta primavera and then link through to some of the reader favorite 
                         hot blog topics of the last few weeks.
                         

i appreciate your time today, i know your 
inbox is loaded with messages needing your attention. may i also take 
this opportunity to thank those who support our 
                         livingafterwls bookstore
 and other publication outlets. the livingafterwls research work is 
self-funded and it is through your support that we are able to conduct 
clean research without becoming prejudiced by sponsors expecting a quid 
pro quo return of favorable findings in exchange for funding. have a 
fabulous week and may good health be yours to enjoy!

5 day pouch test quick review: liquids





hello dear readers! i know many of you are working your way through the 5 day pouch test this week or this month. in the official 5 day pouch test group on facebook there is active discussion as our members proceed through the back-to-basics programs.  in reading through the posts today i see questions and concerns about the definition of days 1 & 2 liquids. i've pulled some information from the 5dpt owner's manual that defines each of the options and gives a little bit more information on why each day 1&2 "liquid" selection is effective with this plan.
the 5 day pouch test owner's manual




protein fortified beverages: protein shakes, protein drinks, protein breakfast drinks are all protein fortified beverages. look for ready-to-drink (rtd) beverages that have at least 15 grams of protein and fewer than 5 grams of carbohydrate per serving. protein powder drinks are acceptable as well, providing they meet the same criterion of 15 grams protein and fewer than 5 grams carbohydrate. homemade protein smoothies are a favorable addition to the 5dpt menu. 

clear broth or creamy soups: clear broth and creamy soups are a favorite comfort food for many of us. canned commercial chicken broth, beef broth, and vegetable broth are enjoyable meals on days 1 and 2.

creamy soups are a comfort food favorite for days 1 and 2. many creamy soups include dairy products such as milk, cream, sour cream, or half-and-half. for purposes of the 5dpt full-fat dairy should be used as called for in the day 1 and 2 recipes because it improves satiation longer than no-fat or reduced fat food.

hearty soups:  as i developed this plan i learned that more substantial soups made of animal protein, legumes, beans, and low-glycemic vegetables work well to alleviate the discomfort and stress of a liquid diet.

soups vs. sliders: it is easy to confuse soup with slider foods since both are liquids that flow more rapidly through the stoma than solid protein. the thing to remember is the soup recipes provided are nutrient dense. slider foods such as crackers or pretzels washed down with liquids have no nutritional value nor are they satiating.  in addition, when we enjoy soup and observe the liquid restrictions our body benefits from the vitamins and nutrients in the meal while we enjoy a comforting feeling of satiation."

protein, fat, carbohydrate: what's the recommended intake after wls?







greetings readers! 

 after wls we are prescribed a high protein or "protein first" diet to follow for the rest of our life to ensure adequate weight loss is achieved and a healthy weight is maintained using the wls tool. but years of dieting have conditioned us to count calories above all else, not the nutrients. for traditionalists who are looking for a generalized daily calorie intake i share this section from day 6: beyond the 5 day pouch test which addresses the question of daily caloric intake. i hope you find this a useful nugget of info in your wls toolbox. also check out this earlier post: dietary protein: quick list and recipe links



shared with copyright permission from day 6: beyond the 5 day pouch test by kaye bailey

"i am not particularly comfortable giving specific one-on-one nutritional advice to my weight loss surgery neighbors. first of all, i’m not a health care worker so i’m not qualified to render such advice. secondly, i cannot see you to make a semi-informed analysis of your health. nutritional advice is serious business and should only be given after verbal consultation and laboratory blood analysis, always with trusted health care providers."

"what i can do here is provide you the current generalized recommendations so you have a point of reference when speaking with your qualified health care provider. we may not always have the luxury of speaking with our bariatric centers so it is wise to educate ourselves on the current bariatric standards and practices of nutrition."


"in general, based on the broad-canvas study, bariatric centers agree patients should follow a 1,200-calorie a day diet. the protein, fat, and carbohydrate recommendations are based on that recommendation."

"protein: common recommendation for daily protein intake is 60 to 105g (20-35% of a 1,200-calorie diet). protein digestibility and quality are important factors that patients must take into account when making food or supplement choices. the digestibility of protein is increased when accompanied by a full array of vitamins and minerals."

make this delicious burger tonight: beef, bacon & mushroom cheeseburger 

"fat: fat is necessary for the growth and development of the basic components for hormones, skin, hair, transportation of fat-soluble vitamins, and insulation and cushion for the body and internal organs. as a rule, the bariatric profession abides the american heart association recommendation of 27 to 47g daily fat consumption in a 1,200-calorie diet. it is beneficial to take fat-soluble vitamins with food sources that are rich in mono and polyunsaturated fats such as avocado, tuna, salmon, olive oil, flaxseed, and canola oil."

our wls body will tell us when we've consumed too much dietary fat by causing dietary stress that may include upset stomach, diarrhea, cramping, vomiting. here is a simple home remedy to help relieve this type of digestive discomfort:
digestive stress? try this simple solution 

"carbohydrate: carbohydrate provides the body with its preferred source of fuel and is the only source of energy for the brain, central nervous system, red blood cells, kidney, and retina. bariatric patients are counseled to choose complex carbohydrates over simple carbohydrates.  bariatric centers do not generally recommend a specific daily carbohydrate allowance, according to swilley. the report referenced the generally accepted recommended intake for all people provided by the national academies’ institute of medicine of 113g carbohydrate consumption daily in a 1,200-calorie diet. it is unlikely a gastric surgical patient of any procedure could meet this recommendation."

usda foodkeeper app - a tool you must use!





i have not been compensated for this post: this is information that we all need as part of our healthy lifestyle program and i'm tickled to share with you the valuable resources from usda that i've come to count upon in my kitchen and home. 

hello dear readers, thanks for joining me here today and happy spring to you all.

if you've been with me for very long you know one of my nag-topics is food safety and kitchen hygiene. for myself, and for so many of you, i know having a bariatric surgery was not only a means to weight loss and healthy weight management: it was an opportunity for a new start in the pursuit of living better, healthier lives. that includes becoming schooled in matters of food handling safety, proper food preparation and storage, and protecting myself and family from foodborne illness.

the usda is my go-to source for current and meaningful information that promotes, "kitchen confidence" -- simply the confidence in your ability to safely prepare delicious meals for your loved ones and yourself. food safety and kitchen confidence is no trivial matter. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) estimates that each year approximately 48 million americans suffer from foodborne illnesses, leading to 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths. the cdc says "many of these illnesses can be prevented by changing behaviors in the kitchen and gaining a little kitchen confidence."



foodkeeper mobile app

earlier this month the usda invited home cooks to improve their kitchen confidence by visiting their remarkably user-friendly website foodsafety.gov and making use of their go-to quick reference guide to food safety with the free and friendly app: foodkeeper for ios and android.


"the foodkeeper helps you understand food and beverages storage. it will help you maximize the freshness and quality of items. by doing so you will be able to keep items fresh longer than if they were not stored properly. it was developed by the usda's food safety and inspection service, with cornell university and the food marketing institute. it is also available as a mobile application for android and apple devices."
find the app at foodkeeper or get it directly from your app store on your favorite mobile device.

this image shows the information on storing and consuming shredded cheese. notice how clean and concise the information is presented - no lengthy explanation, just the simple facts. the clean presentation makes sense because the question "i wonder if this is still good?" is usually asked when we are engaged and lack the time for lengthy reading and research. a couple of quick clicks and we are in the know, good to go!



  

i hope you will check out the foodkeeper app and the foodsafety.gov website to build your kitchen confidence and keep your family healthy and happy as you enjoy meals together.

what's for breakfast? protein first!







recipe: spring eggs

we know the first rule of weight loss surgery is to eat protein first. that means we must eat protein at every meal. the high protein or protein first diet is prescribed for all bariatric procedures and is the dietary guideline patients are instructed to follow for life. the bulk of our calories at any meal should come from animal, dairy, or vegetable protein. this includes breakfast. by eating protein first thing in the morning we instantly raise our metabolism, we promote feelings of satiation and reduce cravings for snacks or simple carbohydrates.eating a high protein breakfast effectively staves hunger cravings and snacking binges later in the day because it reduces the circulating levels of the hormone ghrelin, which stimulates hunger. so not only are we raising our metabolism with high protein nutrition, we are managing the brain chemistry that often gets the blame for head hunger and snacking binges. the earlier in the day we eat protein the more likely we are to stick with our high protein diet plan without annoying cravings or sluggishness.



dietary protein: quick list and recipe linkstry starting your day with 35 grams of high quality protein including eggs, meat, poultry, shellfish or fish, greek yogurt, milk, cottage cheese, vegetarian protein, or protein supplementation such as protein shakes or protein bars. i keep hard-cooked eggs on hand for a quick-grab breakfast and more often than not mix my ready-to-drink protein shake with hot coffee (use it like coffee creamer) for a steady supply of morning protein.

rule #2 is lots of water -- but it's so boring! help!






don't like water - what else can i have?



drink lots of water is the universal golden rule for dieters. but even the most devoted water sippers become bored with the flat unexciting taste of water. fortunately there are many health-supportive was we can spruce up plain water creating a refreshing beverage with added vitamins and nutrients. online there are countless recipes for making infused water, a fancy word for water that blended with fruits, vegetables, herbs, and/or tea. here are a few of my go-to blends that both refresh and promote good health with an energy boost.



using the formulas below you will make a 2-4 quart batch of refreshing infused water. using a large pitcher or gallon jar prepare the infusion ingredients. top the ingredients with 6 cups ice, fill the jar with water, and stir. cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to let flavors infuse. best used within two days of making, but don't expect it to last that long. these refreshing beverages are delicious!



green tea

we've long known that green tea is beneficial to our weight loss efforts. it continues to provide health promoting benefits to those with surgery and is a pleasant alternative to water. most nutritionists agree that herbal teas can be counted the same as water when monitoring our daily water intake. remember our wls rule #2 is lots of water. to change up your green tea (or freshen your water) try these recipes to make two quarts of refreshing flavor-infused water. 



basic recipe: brew two quarts of green tea using 4-6 tea bags following package directions. while it brews add the flavor ingredients to a gallon jug, top with 6-8 cups ice, add brewed tea, mix well and chill for two hours or overnight before serving. enjoy several refreshing servings throughout the day.



try this recipe: stomach soothing thirst quenching lemon ginger iced green tea



iced peppermint tea

mint is known to refresh, soothe stomach aches, and suppress appetite. in place of green tea bags use peppermint tea. add 1/4 cup chopped mint and one lemon, sliced. mix well and chill as directed above.





berry-fresh kiwi cooler

in the gallon jug combine 3 cups halved fresh strawberries, three thinly sliced kiwis, and two thinly sliced lemons. gently muddle all of the ingredients together. add ice and tea, mix, chill, serve.



sunshine cleanse

combine two thinly sliced lemons, two thinly sliced limes, two thinly sliced grapefruits, and two thinly sliced oranges. gently muddle with a wooden spoon or spatula.  add ice and tea, mix, chill, serve. (this is also good prepared with peppermint tea.)



more ideas: simple weight loss accelerator won't leave you sour 



minty-cuke thirst quencher

scrunch 1/4-cup fresh mint leaves in the bottom of gallon jug to release flavor and aromatics (i love this refreshing fragrance!). add two thinly sliced cucumbers (peeled if desired). half two limes and squeeze juice into jug, discard halves. thinly slice two limes and add to jug. top with ice and tea and mix well. chill and serve adding more ice as desired.

digestive stress? try this simple solution







papaya fruit


 after wls surgery studies suggest we become deficient in digestive enzymes, particularly with gastric bypass and the malabsorptive procedures. this leads to stomach discomfort, bloating, and extreme cases chronic nausea.

a simply remedy is to include a papaya enzyme supplement in your diet. the tropical papaya contains a chemical called papain that is effective in digesting proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. in fact, papaya has long been used as a meat tenderizer, which essentially begins protein breakdown during the cooking and preparation process of food.

recipe: tropical protein papaya smoothie

papaya enzymes have shown positive results in aiding digestion and more recent research suggests the enzyme may be useful in reducing blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. papaya enzyme tablets can be found in the personal health section of your market and are inexpensive. follow dosing directions on the bottle and implement the supplement in your diet for at least 30 days to determine its effectiveness in your post-wls high protein diet.

papaya fruit, in its fresh state, is an excellent source of vitamin c, vitamin a, vitamin b6, and magnesium. some weight loss surgery patients may have an adverse reaction to the natural sugars in papaya. in this case it is important to enjoy fresh papaya fruit in small amounts served with lean protein.
