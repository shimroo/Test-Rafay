gettysburg series 

mr. martin's gettysburg landscapes capture the thought-provoking nature of the battlefield as he views it today, with images that create a visual, and sentimental connection between the present-day visitor and the historic events and dramatic conflict of the past. it is his ultimate goal to evoke the many human emotions that are felt out on the battlefield and to transcend those emotions with imaginative and creative visions.

great american portrait series
mr. martins historical portraits attempt to capture accurately realistically the dignity, humanity and physical traits of the personalities depicted. inspired by the tragedy and the triumph of the lives of americas military and national heroes, the portraits are respectfully hand drawn from period photographs available from national archives and museums.  they are meant to honor the men who lived their lives with integrity, pride and compassion.(shown here) "save that of honour""click" on the image here to see all of the prints in our great american portrait series

civil war series

"the civil war battlefield symbolizes the strength and grandeur of our nation, forged  by fire and reunited after five terrible years of war.  the bronze and granite sculpted warriors stand as timeless witnesses to the struggle that raged across the landscape at that time.  they remind us of the great cost in human lives exacted upon our country during those tumultuous years. my research and understanding of the horror and sacrifices that took place there, combined with the spiritual and tranquil beauty of the quiet fields, has inspired my works." (shown here) "the soul of honor""click on the image here to view all of the prints in our civil war series

west point series   
        mr. martin's west point images celebrate the rich history of the academy. for 200 years, the united states military academy has been the premier institution in the world for nurturing the military leaders and heroes of america. from the mexican war to the civil war, through world wars i and ii, to korea, vietnam, desert storm, afghanastan and iraq, the long gray line has rendered selfless service to our country with duty and honor. the academy continues to prepare leaders for the difficult role of defending america and the world against the fanaticism of modern day terrorists.

mr. martins work with colors is bright and open and has an impressionist quality. he uses a lot of light, which has a calming effect and an uplifting spiritual quality.anne marie keanespringfield,  virginiarendered with color pencils in the dramatic and spiritual style of the hudson river school, mr. martin's drawing style utilizes novel color pencil techniques.  multiple layers of primary, secondary, and complementary colors are repeatedly overlapped with a crosshatching technique, creating infinite hues and rich dark values without the use of black and brown.  dozens of layers of color combine to give each drawing a sense of vibrancy and depth, and an impressionistic quality that he feels expresses perfectly his artistic interpretation of the battlefields, portraits and landscapes. 

revolutionary war series   

mr. martin's revolutionary war series commemorates the rich revolutionary war history of colonial america and honors the patriots who fought and sacrificed for their freedom and independence from oppression.   they celebrate the strength, dignity and indomitable resiliency and spirit of the american people, then and now.(shown here) "eternal vigilance" "click on the image here to view all of the prints in our revolutionary war series

wwii series
mr. martin's wwii montages honor the efforts of our citizen soldiers, who from 1941 through 1945, stopped cold the tyranny of hitlers nazi germany in europe and the japanese empires aggressions in the pacific.  on battlefields across the globe, they courageously picked up their guns, not to conquer, but to liberate, not to destroy but to restore, and  did nothing less, than save the world."(shown here) "american beauty""click on the image here to view all of the prints in our wwii series


many artists have illustrated the battles of the civil war.  paul r. martin iii has created civil war art inspired by the emotional feelings aroused by the wonder and tranquil beauty of the battlefields themselves. mr. martin's perspective on civil war art focuses on the landscapes and monuments of the battlefield. his provocative full color drawings are a contemporary approach to a romantic theme; contemplative and meditative while paying tribute to the valor and honor of the men who fought and died there over 135 years ago. they are respectful of the heroic deeds but also attempt to reflect the awareness of the tragic, sorrowful and poignant atmosphere that pervades the now silent fields. mr. martin hopes that the viewer is instilled with the same sense of awe and inspiration that draws him and so many other people to the hallowed places where, ...spirits linger, to consecrate ground for the vision-place of souls. recently mr. martin has focused his talents on other periods of american history.  several usma at west point pieces have been created and published as prints.  a commission from the yorktown historical society has yielded a  new revolutionary war print and mr. martin has just started a new wwii series of artworks including "american beauty", a gift for his father-in-law, s/sgt. michael j. fevola. 

paul r. martin iii  is a professional artist and freelance illustrator who received his training at southampton college and long island university. he also teaches high school art in the pearl river school district in rockland county, new york. he has exhibited his drawings and paintings throughout the east and the new york metropolitan area for the past 20 years. his original artworks and prints are on permanent display at the robert e. lee civil war research center and library, the civil war library and museum of philadelphia, herbert alumni hall at west point, the pentagon and hundreds of private collections throughout the country and the world. major one-man exhibits of his works were held at the gettysburg cyclorama visitors center gallery in 2000,  at west point in the united states military academys class of 1929 gallery in eisenhower center in 2001, at the union league club in new york city  in february, 2002, the randolph county community arts center in beverley west virginia and numerous libraries, galleries and re-enactment and living history events.he has received commissions from the united states military academy, the general meade society of philadelphia,  the sons of union veterans, and the north carolina south mountain monument fund.  he is currently working on a painting for the kernstown battlefield association.  his painting the wheatfield was just used as the cover for jay jorgensens book, gettysburgs bloody wheatfield . 

the glorious spirit of mr. martins imagery, and his command of light, makes his artwork glow!  laura lee keatingcortlandt, nymy artwork is meant to pay tribute to the history of america and is intended to honor the generations of american citizens who have responded to the call of freedom.   all of my work is meticulously researched to ensure complete historical accuracy.  from weapons, accouterments and uniforms to hair color and eye color, to insignia, color and markings, the details in my drawings open up windows to the past.  it is my wish that by examining who we were in the past, we can come to a greater understanding of who we are now.  the people who attacked us on september 11th did not read their history books.  they have totally underestimated the resolve and spirit of the american people. i fervently hope that my images have captured that resolve and spirit and memorialized the many sacrifices made for our freedom.   liberty cannot be taken for granted.  the price of liberty is eternal vigilance  paul r. martin iii
