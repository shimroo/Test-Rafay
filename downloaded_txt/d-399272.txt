exterior worlds handles all elements of the design process and oversees construction of all landscape elements.  consultation begins our process as we listen to clients and let them tell us about themselves and their ideas of outdoor living space.  our intention is to give tangible form to wishes, desires, and dreams.  vegetation and structures must express the personality of the homeowner and support the architecture of the home with a beautiful yard design that functions as well as it looks.
