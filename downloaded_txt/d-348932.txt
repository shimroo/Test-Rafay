blood alcohol bac calculator

online since 1999, rupissed? is the original blood alcohol bac calculator website. over the past 20 years we have become the most popular online blood alcohol calculator with over 3,000,000 bac calculations carried out to date for drinkers world-wide.

to use our bac calculator, simply enter your age, gender, height and weight, what you've had to drink and and when you drank it. the blood alcohol calculator will calculate your current bac, the amount of alcohol still in your system and how long it will take to get your blood alcohol content (bac) back down to below 0.05%.    















        first, tell us a bit about yourself:



your age:

your gender:

your weight:

        how long have you been drinking for?




enter the time you started drinking and the current time. you can also enter the total elapsed time in the hours and minutes boxes.

bac calculations vary based on sex, age, body size, body type, and a whole range of other things that make this calculation indicative only and not to be used as evidence in a court of law. if you want to know your bac accurately, go find a policeman and ask him to breath test you. click here for the assumptions used in this bac calculator.
