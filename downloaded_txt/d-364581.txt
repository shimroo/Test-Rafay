established in 1969 echo valley country club
in 1969 echo valley country club was founded by two of des moines’ most prominent businessmen of the 1960s, e.c. “eddie” coppola and hy diamond. they shared a dream of providing a first-class country club with an inclusive atmosphere welcoming to any who wished to join. the dream of echo valley stood in stark contrast to the exclusionary policies of some area clubs at the time.
