hawaii resort








aloha and welcome to the imperial resort! located less than 100  yards from the famous waikiki beach.
we are in the middle of the renewed waikiki beach walk and in the heart of the city’s dining, shopping, and entertainment epicenter.
in an effort to inspire mindful travel, the imperial hawaii resort has partnered with the hawaii tourism authority and the hawaii visitors & convention bureau in the mālama hawaii initiative that encourages visitors to leave hawaii better than when they arrived.  visit our rooms page to find out you can mālama (care for) hawaii with us.
