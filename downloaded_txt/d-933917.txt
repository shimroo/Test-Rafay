                                        to the wonderful team at anw: let me say that i was very impressed with the overall vibe at the event. it was friendly, welcoming, professional and inspiring and i think that comes from the organization behind the event and the people tasked with the operations. i remember having questions before i even applied to showcase and from that first question to the closing of the event, mine was a great experience.
