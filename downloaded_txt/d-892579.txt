don’t take our word for it!read these testimonials from our happy clients:

my wife and i have travelled a fair amount, sometimes on a budget and sometimes a little more luxurious. for our 50th anniversary we wanted to make our first ever trip to africa extra special. we asked experienced africa travelers for travel agent recommendations and ended up going with pulse africa. they gave us a trip more special than we ever could have imagined!pulse africa put together a spectacular trip! we wouldn’t have changed a thing. we spent three weeks, starting in johannesburg, then to cape town, then to three remote lodges in victoria falls, the timbavati private reserve and the sabi sands private reserve. the sequence and timing of the destinations was perfect for getting a good feel for south africa from its’ history to the current day. every tour was comfortable and every guide was cheerful, informative and totally enjoyable. the hotels/lodges were all unique and wonderful. we left every one wishing we could stay longer.without exception, the service everywhere was exceptional and each of the lodges went out of their way to give us a special treat in recognition of our anniversary.we started planning this over two years ago, having to postpone it for a year due to covid. from the beginning and through the rescheduling, updates and quick responses to our questions, pulse africa was fabulous. the entire team was upbeat and cheerful while working through the difficulties and uncertainties of the severe covid lockdown in south africa. the website and informative mailings gave us all the information we needed to make this an easy trip. all transfers were flawless, she reconfirmed our flights and had boarding passes for us each day we flew, and pulse provided an app for our phone with all the important itinerary details. pulse africa has been the best travel agency that we have ever delt with.my wife and i have been with pulse africa 3 times before and were absolutely delighted with the service and attention we received.
– douglas –minus my misadventure with my camera, i had a wonderful time in africa. everything went smoothly and as planned. i want to thank you for all your work in preparing this trip of a lifetime for me. i truly felt like you went above and beyond in replying to all my queries so quickly, especially given the time difference. i felt well supported before and throughout my trip. i would (and have already) recommended you to anyone looking to plan a trip. hope to deal with you again in the future. once i replenish my vacations funds!
– mel –dear pulse, we were really happy of our honeymoon from the first to the last day… then, first of all, we would like to thank you for the perfect organization, your time preparing and fine tuning every step especially as we were not the easiest client.
– nathaniel –so, the trip was the dream one as hoped for especially the wonderful luangwa valley. all logistics went extremely smoothly. thank you for all your efforts with putting this trip together. again much appreciate your efforts with this trip. best regards,
– barbara –dear pulse africa, organisation and logistics from your side was excellent.  all meetings, drivers, documentations, planes were on time and everything worked smoothly. everyone was unfailingly polite and helpful. all in all a wonderful time in both main destinations and we felt very refreshed from the break. thank you for taking the time to think about what was some new ideas for us this time around.  we were not disappointed and as i said, the attention you pay to the client is one reason why we will continue to return to pulse africa. with best wishes,
– douglas and ann –thank you again for all you have done to help us plan and orchestrate this wonderful adventure.  we appreciate how important it is to have a great travel agent like you within south africa, especially when questions or problems come up (like our flat tire).
– greg and silvia –thank you, sandy! this has been the best trip we have ever taken. all of your advice was sound. londolozi was magical and luxurious. san camp was exotic and restful. baines camp is beautiful even without the delta flooded, and i can imagine how exquisite it would be when the delta is full. we are already dreaming about when we can return to africa and will definitely reach out to you when we are ready to book again. thank you so much for your expert guidance, patience with my many emails, and beautiful gifts for our family. you were instrumental in making this dream experience come true. with gratitude,
– erica –
