not your average goat



my goats are in a good environment of brush, small trees, weeds and grass. i broadcast a sandyland grass seed mix every year in the pastures; this mix consists of:  sideoats grama, wilman lovegrass, sprangletop, indian grass, little and big bluestem.i keep a loose mineral out 24/7, round bales of horse quality coastal hay are kept out during winter months, drought, and birthing season. also, during these time i feed high fat - protein feed.no baby goat is left behind! if one is left by the natural mother and needs supplementing, i do bottle feed to the point of easing into creep feeding.i have guardian dogs with my heard, willy and waylon do a great job of protecting these goats.i also have a backup system of water supply. they are checked daily or more if conditions deem so.i enjoy the process of carefully picking from the herd of babies the best ones that meet high quality physical standards that have been taught to me. the babies that don't meet these standards are sold commercially.
