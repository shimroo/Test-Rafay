the oakland baseball simworld and the xfl simworld are system dynamics based simulations for the classroom created by zenophon "zennie" abraham .
the system-dynamics-based simulations were built in "fml", "forio macro language", by mr. abraham in 2002-2003, and steadily refined until 2010, when sports business simulations and forio business simulations stopped their partnership. the game concept to this 
day has not been replicated.  mr. abraham would like to build the sims in another language - they were used in 40 colleges and high schools between 2003 and 2010.
