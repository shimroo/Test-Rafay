manage your growth
systemization consultant vancouver canada
when a business is small, it is often easier to maintain a high level of quality and consistency.  if a problem occurs, people can work together to resolve it before it becomes a significant issue for the customer.
but often as a business grows, it becomes more complex.  this complexity typically involves more people, more resources, and more challenges, making it increasingly difficult for everyone to maintain high standards and resolve issues quickly.
this puts stress on the business, creating an unhealthy work environment, and inhibiting growth.
but there is a solution.







systemize your business

to scale your business, it must first be systemized.  this is the process of transforming it into a self-sustaining organization that operates in a consistent and predictable manner, whether you (leadership) are there or not.

the value pyramid
specialist process consultants in vancouver canada
the value pyramid is a framework for systemizing any organization.  it defines the four stages in maturity that a business must move through to become fully self-sustainable, and consequently, highly scalable.


level one – owner driventhis is where all organizations begin. at this stage the business is still highly dependent on the owner. scalability is nearly impossible because growth is limited by the owner’s individual capacity. 
level two – people drivenas a business matures, it takes on key people who fill major roles. scalability increases as the business becomes less reliant on the owner, but is still at risk, should any of these people leave unexpectedly.
level three – systems drivenat this stage, policies, procedures, and metrics provide a framework to ensure core operations remain consistent. scalability is significantly enhanced because the negative impacts of growth are now effectively managed.
level four – culture drivenultimate scalability is achieved when a business has a strong team of people dedicated to continuous improvement. at this stage, the business is systemized, but employees are now empowered to continuously improve those systems.
