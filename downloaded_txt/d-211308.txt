15th-nov-2012 04:11 pm(no subject)homilophobici know that someday you'll be sleeping, darling, likely dreaming off the pain.i hope you'll hear me in the streetlight's humming, softly breathing out your name.i know that even with the seams stitched tightly, darling scars will remain.i say we scrape them from each other, darling, and let them wash off in the rain.and when they run into the river, oh no, let the water not complain.i swear that even with the distance, slowly wearing at your name,your hands still catch the light the right way andour hearts still beat the same.

20th-sep-2012 10:26 am(no subject)homilophobicstarting to feel the beginning of a healthy relationship.wtf is a healthy relationship?this thing with james is crazy.i feel like no one has ever loved me beforeand now i'm feeling it for the first time ever.every single cliche about love is becoming apparent,and i don't know what to do about it,i remember once when i was really young,reading this book that had two characters in love,and there being a direct reference to when the male put his hand on the female charactershe could feel every one of his fingers on her.she was so aware of his touch, it wasn't just a hand shaped presence on her,but something more detailed and clear.i've tried to do that with every single guy i've been with,but to no avail.butwhen jamestouches me ican feel every singleone of his fingers insuch sharp detail it's absolutely crazy.people always told me that you could feel it when someone loved youand that love showed through actionsand i never believed themuntil now.jill xoxo
