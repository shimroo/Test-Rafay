vibrant & victorian
if there was ever a home with a story to tell, it’s this one! situated in clarks beach, hayley and chris parsons love their 640 square metre victorian beauty that sits on 9 hectares of rural coastal land overlooks water on both sides.

pauanui escape
when the mullan family were looking to build a holiday home, they wanted to create a sanctuary to escape to, a place to unwind and relax and something completely different from their house in auckland. once they stepped inside the lockwood show home in kopu, they knew a lockwood would be just perfect!

stunning in stratford
talk about keeping it local and in the family! when kym and mike henry decided to build a new home, they wanted to be close to work and they certainly achieved that –they’re now only 1km away from their business itm stratford. with the help of an architect their new home was lovingly designed by kym and built by their son and nephew.
