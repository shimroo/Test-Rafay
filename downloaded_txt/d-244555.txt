“edna is absolutely great! she and her husband had that thing organized to a “t”. they are great folks to work with and very gracious and accommodating.”
j. trahan
“just wanted to say thank you for your work in organizing a wonderful time for us in alaska. it was the most amazing time and would not have been possible for me without the opportunity of traveling with your group. my time in alaska met all my expectations and more and it was fun getting to know people in the group.”
n. whitehead
“thanks for all you did in organizing our cruise. we all had a fantastic time, and we plan on it being the first of many rather than the only cruise we go on! we made some friends for life too which is great!”
