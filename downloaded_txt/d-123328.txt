georgia volunteer infantry

"confederate light guards"

 

"resolved: the 3rd regiment of the georgia
volunteer infantry do unanimously and cheerfully re-enlist for
the war... and as we were among the first to take the field, we
will, if our country needs our services, be the last to retire!"
(resolution adopted unanimously regarding
the question of re-enlistment, february 5th, 1864)
the "confederate light guards" (co. g, 3rd reg. ga.
vol. inf.) is reactivated within but not restricted to the fort
tejon historical association in southern california. civil war
reenacting is an exciting hobby for the armchair historian, student
or serious civil war enthusiast. we recreate the war between the
states to teach and inform spectators, to lose ourselves in the
time, and to share the comradery of the members of our unit. we
are accepting new members who wish to reenact, not fight, the
civil war. no one will be turned down on the basis of sex, religion,
race or political views.
