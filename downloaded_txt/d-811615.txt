  scale figures for model railroads 

welcome to fun & games! since 1993 we 
      have been assembling a large selection of figures in all scales for 
      the scale railroad market. we produce a wide variety of figures, and 
      continually are adding to our selection. we also carry figures by other 
      manufacturers that we feel are of a quality that merits your 
      consideration. in addition, as time permits, we will do custom painting for figures 
      that you provide to us. 
our figures are all
      hand-painted. 
      the preparation process involves several steps, including cleaning, priming, hand-painting, and sealed first with a varnish, and 
      finally with a dull coat agent. 
you can see our 
		selection of figures and other interesting model selections at the nmra 
      national convention/national train show, the narrow gauge 
      convention, trainfest, garden railway conventions in the midwest, as 
		well as other trains shows and conventions.
