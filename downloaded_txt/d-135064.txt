focus area science education

a strong education in stem is essential for all students, whether they grow up to pursue a stem career or just apply scientific reasoning and knowledge in their day-to-day lives. 
at a time when stem education is struggling to produce graduates with the qualities and skills to keep the united states’ science and technology sectors competitive, aaas provides a variety of programs to make sure talent and interest in scientific endeavors are nurtured. 
aaas also strives to help everyone become literate in stem by conducting research and developing tools and services for educators, researchers, and policymakers to make critical and lasting improvements in education systems.
