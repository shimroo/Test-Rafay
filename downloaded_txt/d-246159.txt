  uniting creative vision and practical thinking, to design spaces of uncommon potential.





    beyond the places we make, to the people they serve.
  uniting creative vision and practical thinking, to design spaces of uncommon potential.

    our loyalties lie first with people – those who will work, discover, learn, or serve in the environments we help to create. since 1979, this belief has enriched our client relationships, guided our design process and shaped the teams we build. more than 40 years later, tecton architects continues to support clients in the northeast and beyond as a collaborative partner in architecture, interior design and master planning.
