what researchers are saying“the icbr cytometry team is par excellence. they provide fantastic training and excellent support to facilitate the users’ research. in each specific training, they provide the sops—well-written with easy-to-follow instructions. the best part is that the core is constantly growing with new additions of advanced equipment, making it an affordable in-house facility for most research labs.” 
rekha garg, scientist, department of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery“i would like to express my sincere gratitude for the exceptional support provided by all the members of the flow cytometry core on my stem cell sorting. their dedication and expertise were instrumental in ensuring that i obtained a sufficient number of live stem cells for my subsequent in vivo experiments. i truly appreciate their commitment and dedication, which have significantly contributed to the success of our research!”
yafang li, phd, division of hematology & oncology, college of medicine“working with the uf | icbr cytometry core has not only provided much needed real-time expertise to ensure rigor and reproducibility of data, but it also has forged new collaborations across disciplines enhancing both the quality and output of our science!”
elias sayour, m.d., ph.d., assistant professor, department of neurosurgery, uf college of medicine“uf | icbr has been phenomenal in developing a real time sequencing and bioinformatic pipeline for sars-cov-2 genomic tracking. in less than one month we were able to successfully genotype more than 2,000 samples, an amazing accomplishment thanks to the extraordinary professionalism of the icbr genomic and bioinformatic groups”
marco salemi, ph.d., professor, department of pathology, uf college of medicine“in the last two decades of my research career i have been to many core facilities nationwide, but my experience at uf | icbr electron microscopy is best among those. it always a good experience working with paul, karen, rudy and nicole. the whole icbr team is helpful in all my projects and their scientific/technical experience added value to my research projects.”
tarun e. hutchinson, ph.d. , immuno-virologist and cell biologist, uf college of medicine“it is always great (and friendly, fast, accommodating, and efficient) to come over and work at the uf | icbr nextgen dna sequencing core. thank you!”
jessica a. oswald, phd , postdoctoral researcher, florida museum of natural history“we found the icbr cytometry flow core to be invaluable in so many areas. from trainings opportunities to experiment designs along with panels optimization and troubleshooting, the use of the core has been critical to advance our research. the staff are very professional, and their support is outstanding. i really appreciate the fact that they are extremely reactive to challenges and accommodating based on the needs of our experiments.”
