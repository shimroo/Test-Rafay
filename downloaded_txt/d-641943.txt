welcome to the lucky strike gold and gem mine


   welcome to the lucky strike, a gold and gem mine that also boasts a campground, where we strive to provide our visitors with a memorable and enjoyable outing. step back in time to the days of old-fashioned gold mining by taking a pan or sluice box into the stream. popular methods of prospecting in the river include gold panning, sluicing, and crevicing, which don't require any complicated equipment. spend the day outdoors with your family and friends, sharing in the excitement of recreational gold mining. a full day of panning, sluicing, or crevicing in the river will only set you back $5.00, and you're welcome to keep all that you find! the thrill of seeing that first flake of gold in your pan is like nothing else, and it's sure to give you a case of what the old-timers called "gold fever." be warned, though - once you see that first glint of gold, you'll be hooked! at the lucky strike, we offer gold panning at the flume line with local ore from the second broad river. when you need a break from mining, head over to the miners diner, located next to the covered panning area, and enjoy a delicious bonanza burger or klondike dog with a glass of ice-cold sluice juice (tea).   we hope that you enjoy your day with us, whether you're mining for gold, playing in the river or relaxing at the miner's diner.
nc gold foundation trail   if you're looking to explore the great outdoors, we have the perfect activity for you.  if you like to hike, the nc gold foundation has a trail that adjoins the footpath of the state park and will lead you back to the lucky strike gold and gem mine. the trail and footpath are available for those wanting to enjoy the beautiful great outdoors.  motorized vehicles are not allowed on these properties.  more information is available at the lucky strike gold and gem mine in marion, nc.  to ensure the safety of all our visitors, we ask that you sign in and out of the trail at the lucky strike so that we can maintain accountability at the end of the day.   


















               2025see the events pagethe miner's diner will be under construction beginning monday, january 20, 2025.
the office will be temporarily moved to our gift shop located on the other side of the panning shed. you can still fulfill all your treasure hunting desires. you will still be able to purchase gold & gem buckets, rent a high banker, and check for camping. 
the only part of business unavailable until the renovation is complete is the miner's diner.
