	 i know it's over
	 
    


this is it kids. this is the end.it's been 5 years since i started this blog and i can't even fathom all of the changes that have happened in that time... aside from all the great music i heard, i did a lot of learning and growing up... i went to university and earned my degree, i made it into my favourite publication ever (nme) on several occasions, i traveled across the world several times (and attended the best music festival in the world), i fell in love with a wonderful guy, i launched my career and moved to a new city... it's the understatement of the year for me to simply say, "it's been a blast". so i'm ending this blog now, not because i don't have the time anymore, but because i'm just not the same teenager who started it. and, while i'll always love the music, my heart's just not in it anymore. it's time for me to move on.thanks to everyone who's visited my site, left me comments, suggested new (usually awesome) things to me, introduced me to new music and new people, and the biggest thanks of all goes to al the great people i've gotten to know as a result of this blog. i wish you all the best.if you're interested in any future ventures of mine please feel free to drop me an e-mail and i'll keep you posted when i get my next project up and running.thanks for sharing the past 5 years with me and for just giving a damn what i had to say! :)

hey i know it’s been a while but i figured it’s best i mention our boy pete got handed another get-out-of-jail-almost-totally-free card. nice to see the kid with some meat on his bones. mark ronson’s found a proper replacement for lily allen… ricky wilson! great feature on arcade fire in the guardian today. i particularly liked their take on glastonbury. in case, like me, you almost forgot how adorable the pipettes were. i’m trying to watch tv again. props to cbc for giving my two favorites (history with a tinge of smut) in one show (the tudors). thanks for doing something good for a change mr. harper.

	 good news all 'round
	 
    


if you stayed up late enough last night you might have seen stephen colbert announced he's running for president. i adore that man. johnny marr has been appointed a professor of music at university of salford in manchester. amazing! glastonbury founder michael eavis is donating profits to banana farmers in latin america. pete doherty seems to be making much improvement after this most recent rehab stint. he’s even reunited with his father! arcade fire joined bruce springsteen onstage in ottawa the other night. cerys matthews (catatonia) has divorced and is moving back to wales (where she belongs) with her children! even dubya did something good for a change.

	 “speaking of” is the new “such as”
	 
    


here's a (very) brief catch-up on the past few weeks...proof that liam gallagher is not going to “live forever” after all. and speaking of that britpop classic, blur are reuniting next month woohoo! the only thing better than britney at the cma’s was sarah silverman... and kanye! and speaking of, i know hopefully have 50 cent quitting music to look forward to! thanks again kanye! white stripes have cancalled all 2007 tour dates because meg white has acute anxiety. local kids might wanna check out this interested (i.e. american) and rather outdated take on toronto’s west queen street west.

hey kids! sorry to everyone who's been checking for updates - i should have mentioned that i moved to a new city at the beginning of the month and, as if that wasn't enough, work's been busy (as it has all summer) so something had to go and it was this blog. i'll try to have a new post tomorrow :)

	 cats on crack
	 
    


 pete doherty’s kittens are high on coke. what would the tabloids do without a pete? morrissey continues to break my heart by announcing a bunch of american dates (continuing his anti-canada campaign i assume) and rejected the possibility of a smiths reunion (which i’m actually quite relieved to hear). joy division’s “love will tear us apart” is being re-released for a next month. who knew?

	 apparently they can try to make her go to rehab and she will, in fact, go go go
	 
    


 the guardian have a nice "remembering tony wilson" feature. if you haven’t yet heard of the stephen colbert vs richard branson water fight you can watch it for yourself on august 22nd.  word on the street is that amy winehouse and her pete-wannabe husband are in an american rehab facility after admitting to cocaine and heroin addictions. oh the irony. wow! now they have tabloid gossip for indie kids! (ps: i don’t believe it for a minute.)

	 some people make money and some make history
	 
    


 nme has posted an obituary for anthony wilson. peter hook had paid a nice tribute to him - as have the rest of new order. and alan mcgee. among many others. amy winehouse's drug addiction is catching up with her. jack white has a new baby son. lily allen might be getting her own tv show. and the #1 reason not to go to coachella next year is...
