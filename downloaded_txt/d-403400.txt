the new york chapter, centered on long island, ny, is one of many chapters throughout the united states, canada, and the world that encourage interest in and disseminate knowledge about rhododendrons and azaleas. we provide a medium through which all persons interested in rhododendrons and azaleas may communicate and cooperate with others through education, meetings, publications, scientific studies, research and other similar activities. our chapter is an enthusiastic group of people who volunteer their time and energy towards the success of the organization.
