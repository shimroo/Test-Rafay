the board of directors of the church music association of america has elected rev. robert pasley as its new president.
“fr. pasley has acted as an officer of the board for many years. after first becoming introduced to the beauty of sacred music in the liturgy by fr. richard schuler, of st. agnes parish (st. paul, minnesota), editor of sacred music, he became a loyal member and was identified early on as a leader. as vice president many years ago, when fr. robert skeris was the association’s president, he was there, signing the documents for the cmaa’s incorporation in virginia. he attended the very first sacred music colloquium and has attended nearly all of them in the years since. eighteen years ago, when dr. william mahrt was elected as cmaa board president and dr. horst buchholz as vice president, fr. pasley took the position of chaplain. he has served faithfully as a spiritual guide and officer ever since."
