                    about flint

flint has evolved as a result from the 
                    lack of comprehension towards family matters that is frequently 
                    demonstrated by the uk legal system and other associated organisations. 
                    flint has been developed into a politically independent social 
                    policy research centre. 
flint's work is allied to our 
                    interests in children, young people, grandparents and families. 
                    it takes a variety of forms including large scale surveys, 
                    quasi-experimental studies, smaller qualitative projects, 
                    literature reviews and evaluations. we also arrange seminars, 
                    workshops and conferences. 
topics we focus on include parenting, 
                    fatherhood, young offenders, prevention and intervention for 
                    antisocial behaviour and drug misuse, child maltreatment, 
                    child protection and child/adolescent mental health issues.
 flint mission statement

flint disseminates research findings and 
                    analysis that promote and enhance access to children for both 
                    parents and grandparents and monitors the care, the efficiency 
                    and effectiveness of the legal and social services care services 
                    and their delivery.  
flint also provides a vehicle 
                    through which forums and briefings for policy makers, the 
                    social services sector, families, the government, and the 
                    media are held in order to increase understanding of the issues 
                    affecting families and children.
we believe that only an 
                    open and honest government along with the true independence 
                    of the media, state authorities and the judiciary will enable 
                    progress to be made in these areas which have been badly let 
                    down by those responsible.
