                           launching a research effort to understand more about the biology of these shrimp & how they may affect the ecology 
                           of native fisheries and coastal ecosystems. as with all non-native species, there are concerns over the potential for novel

                           are showing signs of severe ill health, according to noaa marine mammal biologists and their local, state, federal &
                           other research partners. barataria bay, located in the northern gulf of mexico, received heavy & prolonged exposure 
                           to oil during the deepwater horizon oil spill.  based on comprehensive physicals of 32 live dolphins from barataria bay 
                           in the past summers, preliminary results show that many of the dolphins in the study are underweight, anemic, have 
                           low blood sugar and/or some symptoms of liver and lung disease. nearly half also have abnormally low levels of the
                           hormones that help with stress response, metabolism and immune function. researchers fear that some of the study
                           dolphins are in such poor health that they will not survive. ...noaa and its local, state and federal partners started 
                           the barataria bay dolphin study in past as part of the natural resource damage assessment (nrda), the process for

                           update jan 2021... in past: as per noaa finds bacterial infection as cause of death for 5 northern gulf dolphins;
                           investigation continues ...pathology experts contracted by noaa have identified the bacteria brucella in five
                           bottlenose dolphins that died in the northern gulf of mexico. these five are among the 580 dolphins in higher than
                           expected strandings that began in february 2010 and are continuing. noaa has declared it an unusual mortality
                           event, triggering a focused, expert investigation into the cause. noaa is working with a team of marine mammal
                           health experts, including veterinarians, epidemiologists, biologists & toxicologists, to investigate the cause of death 
                           for as many of the 580 dolphins as possible.  ...brucella are commonly found in populations of marine & terrestrial
                           animals throughout the world, but infection in humans is rare in the u.s., and there are no documented u.s. cases 
                           of brucella in humans originating from marine sources. noaa advises anyone who sees a stranded dolphin in the 
                           gulf of mexico region to call 1-877-whale help (877.942.5343). the stranded dolphin should not be touched, and 
                           pets should be kept away from the dolphin as well.  in addition, cooking seafood kills the brucella bacterium, and 
                           as there have been only 3cases globally linking brucella infection to consumption of raw seafood, there is minimal 
                           risk of exposure to humans through seafood consumption.  ...& past dolphin news: "noaa scientists participate in 
                           the behavioral response study of cetaceans to navy sonar, southern california scientists from noaa's southwest
                           fisheries science center are participating in a navy sponsored study known as socal-10, biological and behavioral
                           response studies of marine mammals in southern california. socal-10 is designed to measure the response of
                           cetaceans to navy mid-frequency sonar and, potentially, other sounds sources.  this project is a collaboration with
                           researchers at noaa, cascadia research, duke university, woods hole oceanographic institute, scripps institution 
                           of oceanography... & navy researchers."  editor's note on gulf oil spill as well as the continued 'take/sonar testing' 
                           off of fl in bahamas area (in addition to southern california tests) & oceansafe.org response: we applaud all 
                           efforts to protect marine mammals! however noaa states; "although severely limited in our continued ability to 
                           move dolphins out of their natural habitats in response to the oil spill"...oceansafe.org as well as other orgs believe 
                           that most of the dolphins can be relocated to 'safe wild areas'  that are in 'non-sonar testing take areas' in the
