new e-book available


hello! i am writing to share with you a new  free ebook written specifically for parents of gifted children entitled, helping  gifted kids thrive: insights from the experts. i am proud to be a part  of this collaborative effort.  
this free ebook takes a unique approach. child  & family therapist, tina harlow, interviewed 26 experts across the field of  giftedness to ask them one question: 
“what one thing can parents do now to help  their gifted child to thrive in the future?” 
this question is based on the worry that we  see in many parents of gifted children today. parents worry about the future  and often question their own parenting abilities. my colleagues and i put great  thought and care into our responses in hopes that this book may provide you  with some inspiration and guidance along the way. 
you can get your free copy of this ebook by  clicking here: https://guidingbright.lp  ages.co/expertebook
i hope you enjoy this valuable gift. since the  book is free, we are distributing it ourselves. please help us share this  wonderful resource by forwarding this email to others who may benefit as well. 
again, you can download it here: https://guidingbright.lp ages.co/expertebook
all my best, 
dr. sylvia rimm
