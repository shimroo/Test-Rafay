article february 1, 2025 local works by jackie krentzman 



city officials work to keep south lake tahoe afforda-blue




  south lake tahoe’s housing stock is controlled by regional growth
  limits. that stock became even more limited in
  2020, as white-collar workers freed from downtown
  office commutes in pricier regions moved to the area.
  home prices and rent soared by double digits, displacing many
  longtime residents and seasonal workers.

housing affordability has become a public service issue, with potentially devastating impacts




  the high cost of housing has had repercussions on all aspects of

article february 1, 2025 special to cal cities by heidi sanborn and jordan wells 



it’s time for california to help cities manage household hazardous waste




  california has become a leader in passing laws that hold
  producers, not ratepayers, responsible for properly managing
  product and packaging waste. the state needs to take a similar
  approach to the state’s dangerous (and frequently, deadly)
  household hazardous waste.

article january 29, 2025 president’s message by league of california cities president lynne b. kennedy, ph.d. 



in moments of devastation, the strength and character of public servants shine through




  elected officials hold a unique and critical responsibility: to

  the devastating wildfires in los angeles county and nearby
  regions serve as a stark reminder of this task.

brisbane charges up its climate action goals with new city ordinance




  most buildings use methane gas for heating, drying, and cooking.
  but methane is also a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon
  dioxide. a program in brisbane would slash tons of the city’s
  emissions equal to roughly 8 million miles driven in an average
  gasoline vehicle.

new study sheds light on which local elected officials are likely to get harassed and why




  incivility has become normalized at the local level.
  but these incidents don’t affect everyone equally.

  and imperial counties gives us a clearer picture of who gets
  harassed in southern california and why.
