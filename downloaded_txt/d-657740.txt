trinity baptist church

worship god. grow together.make a difference.

join us on sunday







welcome to trinity

located in the heart of manhattan, trinity has been part of new york city’s story for over 150 years. inspired by our rich history, we are passionate about living out a vibrant faith today.  at trinity, you’ll find a diverse community of people from all walks of life, united in our journey of seeking and following jesus.
wherever you are in your faith—curious, questioning, or committed—you are welcome here. explore god’s word with us and discover its wisdom for life in a fast-moving world. there’s a place for you here.







our heartbeat is simple

we walk alongside people as they explore faith and become followers of jesus through three core values:








worship god
our worship is a heartfelt celebration deeply rooted in our commitment to honor god as the central focus of our purpose on earth and in our church. our sunday gathering is more than an event; it’s a manifestation of our faith and dedication to god where we reinforce our communal bond in glorifying him.








grow together
beyond worship, we deeply value the personal growth of every individual in their walk with christ. we challenge each other, support one another, and grow collectively in understanding and living out our faith. as we navigate the ups and downs of life, we’re committed to ensuring that no one walks alone.








make a difference
acting on our faith means making tangible changes in our world. we are driven by god’s profound call for justice and compassion. we’ve identified three crucial areas where our efforts can make an impact: addressing immigration challenges, combating homelessness, and supporting initiatives in rwanda.
