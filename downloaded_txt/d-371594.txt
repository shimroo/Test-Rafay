africa 
                      game reserves - dedicated to wildlife - the mammals, birds 
                      and reptiles of the great african tableau, to the national 
                      parks and game reserves which are home and habitat to these 
                      myriad creatures and the ecosystems and flora which sustain 
                      life in these pristine habitats.
here, 
                      you will find some of the most spectacular wildlife and 
                      landscape images, as well as comprehensive and detailed 
                      descriptions of the top african wildlife preserves and regions.







we 
                            have selected dozens of these game reserves - from 
                            the savannah grasslands of kenya and the serengeti 
                            through the gorilla forests of central africa and 
                            the untamed woodlands of zambia, along the banks of 
                            the mighty zambezi and across the mystical waterways 
                            of the okavango delta, to the bushveld of south africa 
                            and the soaring dunes of the namib desert, plus many 
                            other renowned and hallowed national parks - both 
                            great and small.
