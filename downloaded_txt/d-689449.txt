 indoor cycling “the beauty of spinning is that you ultimately determine the intensity of your own work out. if not in great shape, you simply use less resistance. you are free to train at whatever level you feel most comfortable. following the cues of the instructor, you change resistance of your bike to simulate normal riding conditions. this group exercise integrates music, camaraderie, and visualization…” earl hill (as noted in the feb/march 2007 nitc newsletter) for the 16th year, nitc indoor cycling is set to begin mid-november. the location is at the masonic lodge, in mason city. days and times are; tuesday and thursday from 6:00 to 7:00 pm and saturday from 8:30 to 9:30 am. as a reminder, your membership in nitc must be current to participate for insurance liability reasons. for the indoor cycling application download click here. if you are interested in zooming nitc indoor cycling, would you let earl or mark know?

 leroy stonecypherfor those of you who do not know, leroy stonecypher passed away last tuesday morning.  the family had a private graveside ceremony yesterday, but there is a celebration of life service planned at the grace united methodist church in floyd, iowa, at 10:30 a.m. on april 17, 2021, with lunch immediately following.leroy was one of the earliest members of the north iowa touring club.  he planned and participated in many of the weekend cycling events.  together, he and i rode events in iowa, wisconsin, minnesota, south dakota, north dakota, and wyoming to mention a few.besides advising you as to the celebration of life event, i have two requests:            1.         if you are planning on attending the celebration of life and the meal following, please let me know this week.  it is difficult to find a place where a group can hold a meal these days, and when you do, there is a cost in following safety measures.  therefore, we need an idea of those planning on attending.  folks, this is not a guarantee, so let me know if you think you will attend—i understand if you have a change of plans later.            2.         my daughter and i will be assembling a booklet of memories—a copy of which will be provided to those attending the celebration of life.  i have already received a number of memories from those closest to him—and those folks are free to add to their contribution as well as anyone who has yet to share.  in addition, i am looking for pictures that hold a special memory.  i have arbitrarily set a deadline of april 1, 2021.  if you should need more time, please let me know.  i have no idea as to the magnitude of this undertaking.  therefore, i reserve the right to pick and choose the memories or pictures.not only was leroy an avid cyclist, but a husband, father, grandfather,great-grandfather, and church member--and in former years a skier, and a snowmobiler.  if any of you have memories or pictures to celebrate these events, please forward them as well.  also, be sure to provide good contact information in the event i need to contact you.earl@earlwhill.com, or send toearl w. hill, 35 main ave. s., p.o. box 301, britt, iowa 50423
