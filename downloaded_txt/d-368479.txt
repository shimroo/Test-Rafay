 this website 
                is dedicated to demonstrating the bible is god's word and it is 
                just as relevant for our modern world today as when it was first 
                written.  





 

 why 
                    is the bible god's word?


while 
              the bible is generally accepted by christian people as having divine 
              authority, comparatively few are able to clearly explain just why 
              they hold this opinion. how has it been preserved free from corruption? 
              why, in its present condition, is it worthy of our full confidence? 
              let us consider what evidence we have to the credibility of these 
              writings.

 what 
                      is bible truth?


our 
                beliefs are molded by history, 
                tradition, culture, and various religious teachers as they interpret 
                holy scriptures for us. what we accept as truth must be open to 
                reason (james 3:17). this interactive questionaire explores five 
                bible questions. each question has a “yes” and a “no” 
                answer. you can't pick the wrong answer, because both answers 
                are correct. find out how much you really know about your bible.

what 
                      is this world coming to?


                      the world seems to be spinning out of control: mass shootings; 
                      pervasive covid-19 variants; the 2021 storming of the nation’s 
                      capitol; political wrangling; continuing racial injustice; 
                      global warming causing natural disasters worldwide; and 
                      the list continues...lacking an explanation and solution 
                      to man’s dilemma, the materialist taunts the christian 
                      camp to come up with answers. unfortunately, most christians 
                      are unable to meet the challenge. however, there have been 
                      notable exceptions.

the 
                      sacrifice of jesus is fundamental to the christian faith, 
                      yet most christians cannot reasonably explain why god required 
                      the death of his only son before he could begin to forgive 
                      a single person (heb. 9:22). what does jesus sacrifice accomplish 
                      and how does it redeem us? why did god require his sacrifice 
                      in the first place? will only christian's benefit from jesus' 
                      sacrifice?

join 
                us on our journey through creation as we explore god's vast universe 
                and his divine plan of salvation for man. "the reverence 
                of jehovah is the beginning of wisdom." only the foolish 
                say in their heart, "there is no god." "day unto 
                day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge." 
                "the heavens declare the glory of god."--psalms 111:10; 
                14:1; 19:1,2
an 
                appreciation of the infinite power of the creator and of our own 
                littleness should make us teachable. the study of creation is 
                the "key of knowledge." using this key we begin to realize 
                that the only worthy ambition is to co-operate with our creator's 
                beneficient designs respecting his creation.
