melvyn wright music arranger for fair organs, busker organs, etc.






welcome to my excellent mechanical music
web site!
 if you're looking for perforated music books  or music rolls,
you've come to the right place (probably) but not if you've got a
pianola



this site is continually being revamped and enhanced
	with new wholesome and prestigious features.
there is no limit to the amount of enjoyment to be
	obtained from its viewing
(please do not confuse this site with other sites
	which are not as good as this one, and may not even exist)

now using my patented
	emailophone(tm) deluxe messaging system (with
	wings)

all complaints should be addressed to the monkey,
	not the organ grinder:

	complaints department

ready-cut
	music for
	john smith 20-note organs

	excellent music









i will punch out your own music for you on
	my turbocharged perforators (that i invented myself)
	unbelievably impressive service - private or trade - no job too messy.  
	see
	here






i am one of the uk’s leading producer of perforated music for
	fair organs and street organs (commonly known as band organs and monkey organs
	in the usa). i arrange and produce music for almost every type and scale
	of mechanical organ, from small hand-cranked busker organs up to 56 key
	fairground organs. music is produced in the form of cardboard books, paper
	rolls, computer disks, and micro-chips.  please do not buy my music
	if you are expecting any rubbish, as you will be greatly disappointed.

important: this web site uses my patented
	emailophone(tm) deluxe integrated messaging system
	for sending messages
the
	emailophones on this
	web site are all connected to my personal
	emailophone in my pocket.
	 to send a message to me, just click on any
	emailophone, shout down
	the brass horn 'mary had a little lamb', and turn the handle to wind
	up the spring.  the messages will be sent to me at a speed of
	78rpm. this is much faster than ordinary email (and mobile phones) which
	only work at 33 1/3rpm.
please note that my
	emailophone
	system is top secret, so you will not find it on competitors' inferior web
	sites.
	would you trust other music suppliers when they are not even clever enough
	to invent deluxe messaging systems?

i wish to apologise most sincerely for my competitors'
  inferior products and appalling customer service
