citizen complaints process and form
it is part of the mission of the california state university san bernardino police department to provide service fairly, with integrity, respect, and in a manner that meets or exceeds the standards of our profession. we welcome all comments from our community on the effectiveness of our services and the manner in which we deliver those services. we value your feedback and encourage members of our community to take the time to compliment our officers and staff when they are particularly pleased with our service as well as notify us when those services are anything less than completely professional and helpful in nature. for minor complaints, we encourage you to speak directly with an employee's immediate supervisor. for more serious complaints, or when for any reason you would prefer to write the complaint or have it documented, this upd citizen complaint form may be utilized. you may print and mail or fax it to our department or deliver it to any supervisory officer on duty. submissions may also be anonymous.
the department is committed to a fair, impartial review of all complaints regarding our procedures or the conduct of our employees. california penal code section 832.5 sets forth that all california law enforcement agencies shall develop a procedure to investigate complaints made by a member of the public against a peace officer. all complaints will be taken seriously and investigated thoroughly. corrective action will be taken when warranted. state personnel law requires that the actual discipline remain confidential. normally, all citizen complaint investigations are completed within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the complaint. complainants will be notified in any situation that requires investigation beyond a period of thirty days.
employee misconduct by police department employees is defined as: the commission of a crime, the neglect of duty, a violation of the department policy and procedures, and/or conduct which may tend to reflect unfavorably upon the employee or the department.
if you wish to file a written complaint, please complete the form. you may add additional sheets of paper if you need. if you file this complaint in person, you may simply ask for the supervisor on duty. if you wish to mail the complaint or fax it, contact:
