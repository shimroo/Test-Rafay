your rapid fat loss plan
so, how to lose weight in a week? or two weeks? or in a month? whatever your goal or target, you’ll need a fat loss plan. a system for carb cycling that’s based on letting you eat anything you want to – provided you follow an alternating pattern.
it’s called “macro patterning” and was developed by shaun hadsall, one of america’s fittest health and fitness pros and founder of get lean in 12. the rapid fat loss plan breaks down your 14 day cycle into 3 periods:

deplete days
carb baseline days
cheat days

it’s the kind of cycling method that works so well for bodybuilding by alternating periods of exercise with rest phases. macro patterning is scientific in basis and literally doubles the possibility that you will actually lose weight in a week and burn off stubborn belly fat.

following the rapid fat loss plan
 the 14 day rapid fat loss guide has 6 sections. each section is made of a series of action steps. each step details the things you must do if you are to lose weight rapidly.
the foundation lies in interval sequencing. this involves short bursts of high intensity training. you burn off the highest amount of energy in short but intense spurts of activity and exercise. this is the key to melting off belly fat and leaving lean muscle stronger. a nice side effect is that it kickstarts your metabolism, making your body burn off more calories.
high intensity resistance training is another important tenet of the program designed to help you lose weight in a week. there is a mix of cardio exercises, steady state routines and exercises called threshold depletion. everything is planned in a way that each muscle group in your body is exercised over the two week period.
this doesn’t mean you’ll spend all day at the gym working out! no, they are short but intense bursts, and so you’ll focus on specific areas – back and chest, shoulder and arms, abs or legs and gluteals in each session. the routines are designed to get rid of arm fat, back fat, lower belly fat and leg fat. if you’ve been trying to lose weight for a long time without success, this sequence of workouts will change that.

why is 14 day rapid fat loss so popular?
there are several reasons why shaun’s program is a big hit with thousands. for one, it’s a safe but effective fat loss guide. the system (which is presented in an easy to follow manner) works just as it promises. and the results are achieved quickly and easily, without too much work or effort.

the offer itself is risk free, with a full money-back guarantee being offered to buyers who don’t think it is useful.
the only negative things about the course are that:
a. some of the language is technical, though you quickly understand what they mean and then get used to the usage of the terms
b. a few of the exercise routines require fitness equipment like dumbbells or stability balls, which are available at most gyms
