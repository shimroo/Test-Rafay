roll of honour































 




to honour those who served their country
“in this their finest hour”

















keeping the candle burning.
the changi cross was made by staff sergeant harry stogden, raoc, as a prisoner of war in changi and is used throughout the roll of honour with a poppy as the centre piece. it is used as a symbol of unity for those who lost their lives in the far east and is not meant to categorise the prisoners in any religion or faith.
 sergeant harry stogden lost his life 15th september 1945 before reaching home.
 
all the pages within the roll of honour are written to help the fepow families in remembrance of their loved ones and are  not ‘public domain’.
