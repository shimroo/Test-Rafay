"ar training camps" to get more info before choosing an ar training 

camp. odyssey adventure racing academy (oara)this training camp 

brought together an amazing group of both experienced racers and complete new 

athletes, and put them through the time of their lives. don mann has composed 

a great group of experienced instructors who are really dedicated to every person 

learning and experiencing as much as possible. after completing the first four 

days of the camp you will have essentially completed a four-day stage race of 

day and night navigation, mountain biking, trail running, whitewater kayaking, 

river swimming, canoeing, rappelling and ascending. during the last two days of 

the camp, academy students form teams and put their knowledge into practice by 

racing together in the two-day endorphin fix adventure race. this camp will jump-start 

and advance any athletes (or even non-athlete's) achievements in adventure racing.oara's 

description of the course: "aspiring adventure athletes interested in being 

a part of this fast-growing sport, and experienced racers who want to become more 

proficient, will learn necessary outdoor skills at the odyssey adventure racing 

camp held at beautiful camp washington carver. those skills include orienteering, 

whitewater paddling and swimming, mountain biking, and fixed ropes skills (ascending, 

rappelling and traversing)."e-camp, 

by team sole (aka team epinephrine)e-camp is quite focused toward racing-specific 

training. it doesn't mean expert racing, it just means racers who are seeking 

to gain the competitive edge. e-camp isn't for everyone, it's hard, it takes mental 

fortitude and a bit more than the average level of fitness. all levels of racers 

interested in learning to be fast in a real race atmosphere are encouraged to 

attend. the camp starts on a friday late afternoon with discussion, dinner and 

quick clinics on navigation, paddling, biking, teamwork, packing, gear and nutrition. 

then teams are put together and the couse that lays ahead is shared with the teams. 

instructors at the camp train teams to prepare maps and pack gear. more

note: here at archronicles.com we strive to give unbiased opinions within 

our articles, but it is based on either our firsthand experience or through interviews 

with other adventure racers. we know there are other training camps out there, 

but we have not had a chance to experience them. if other training camps would 

like to offer an invitation, archronicles.com would send a reviewer to the camp 

and write-up a review.

particular attention to off-trail navigation and 30 practice problems that can be used as great training workout. get this book, go out into the woods with a full pack and get yourself lost.

    national geographic topo maps software
    national geographic 
    
    these types of cd-rom mapping software have been one of the best things for our land navigation training since the invention of the compass. you can get maps for most states in the u.s. to plan an adventure race training day, we pick points (make-believe check points) on the map and then go out and find those points. the distance finding feature of the software allows you to find an appropriate distance course for your training day. this software has been a great land navigation 
training tool. used in conjunction with one of the books above and you will have a great tool set to develop strong navigation skills. these cd-rom topo maps also make great additional resource maps during the pre-race course plotting!
