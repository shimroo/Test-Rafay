welcome to cdwastandards, services and supports for best-in-class dog walkers
and pet parents that enrich the lives of dogs in canada
 





 




the canadian dog walkers associationon behalf of the entire walker community, we invite you into the amazing world of working with animals

 






thank you for being part of our effort to offer standards, services and supports to dog walkers and pet parents, and enrich the lives of dogs in canada. a great many walkers are best-in-class—trained, skilled, successful business owners who embrace best practices and benefit pets in care. through supporting them and helping others achieve the same professional standing, we guide this industry’s trajectory into a quality assured one, with best practices in use across the board.




cdwa has a number of important mandates. the promises we make to our industry practitioners, to pets and their parents, and to our members are many. they are effective and meaningful, and yield the highest benefit for all who’s lives we are trying to better. see our mission.


 





we are so thrilled to be the first dog walker association in canada to operate with our scope. as a result, there is much to do to grow our membership of pet professionals, realize our full suite of planned offerings, and to service the regions we must service, nationally. we look forward to adding value in all ways, and to bridging the best walkers to pet parents.
welcome! take a look at what we do and find out how membership helps so many.


 




membership has its many, many rewards


learn about what we’re doing and, more importantly, what can be done together. 
 
 join us!
 




sentience™ magazine


there is a lot to know about dogs. they think, feel, have psychology—they are sentient.
in these articles, we dig up all the dirt on dogs, so you can access the most
current, evidence-based information available, from the industry’s best sources.
