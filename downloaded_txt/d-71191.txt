            what is the tssaa?
          

the tennessee secondary school athletic association is a voluntary, nonprofit, self-supported organization of secondary schools, conceived and led by school people (teachers, principals, superintendents) for the purpose of stimulating and regulating the athletic relations of the secondary schools in tennessee. recognizing that the primary objective of all secondary schools is to educate youth, the tssaa aims to coordinate the athletic and scholastic programs.
