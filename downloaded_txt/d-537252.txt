what it looks like to us and the words we use-- after ada limoni know the words we use define us,but it looks to me like magicwhen you use your mouth to talk.to me, words are more than symbols,they are what we are, we are sad,we are tired, we are beautifulwhen our tongues slip, whenwe forgot what we were goingto say, or when we are strugglingfor the way to say it.  the wordsi would say about you look like wind;i am invisible until i've spoken of you.

speed wash-- after ron padgettdown here in the laundry room i lord over a tiny citymade of cleaning products.for these base-colored buildings,i am a tidy act of god calling forth natural disasters named speed washor delicates.  i hopeyou'll come home soon before an entire civilization,a brief history, the epic songof our two dirty livesis cleaned to death.

what makes you cry?

a cold and lonely road at night,

or a dead possum, or

a vicious national geographic

magazine paper cut?

sometimes it seems like ice

on a highway will be the last word

in danger, but sometimes

it feels like a high school

heartbreak can wreck

harder than any car.

long-fronded cactuses

sit in west texas

like plants made of swords,

and hurtful words

hide even in churches,

but right now the worst

of the great plains

is what isn't there.

the texas pleaser  the sunset is focused and red as a post-pugilist's solar plexus: a pain never jet-lagged or caught without a thread in conversation: the bus is a timeline of its own and when we're on the road we won't speak for hours; our needs are all bandaged up and clicked shut in a tight white box, lickety-slick with a red x on the side, and at night we know if we pulled over we'd cry. the next town is an "oh, what did you say?" and the town after that is the ring, and the town after that is the card girl, and the town after that is a bucketful of spit.

faust street bridge



when the cold has cheated 

its way down into texas,

and the wet orange leaves 

carpet faust street bridge,

and we've all forgotten 

to wear our windbreakers:

the guadalupe is spilling

over the shallow dam.



my sister speaks of life's

little things that add up

to the big things: the coffee

is the morning; the morning

is the job; the job is on the bridge,

and the bridge is historic:

each picture of gray steel

is a narrative waiting for

a couple of characters.



and my sister and i are quieted  by the digraph of the guadalupe

flowing over the dam into itself,

and then a family of three

thumps upon the bridge,

all of us in a new history.

five lines about the sea











for mike sammons, 3:04 am, 3-19-13 





one quarter of the compass can be divided into 
                            an infinite number of degrees;

i'll meet you in the impossible shadow 
                            between one of these millions,

like waves or plankton or the tiny little beans 
                            that turn into seaweed --

we are lucky and unlucky.  a sailor's trinket 
                            cast overboard will make a charm

or break a spell or bob along a deep tide 
                            towards another's home or our own.

i'm never going back to titty mountainit was 963 miles from tijuanato fort stockton, and each milewas hungrier than the last.   ambersaid to the passenger window (and out into the blurred liquiddesert) "we should slow down,"she said languidly "maybe weshould stop." oddly-elbowedcacti shot by, and disappearedinto the infinite behind us. the car grew hungrier, and sodid amber, and so did i, but iwouldn't admit it (of course.)texas was beckoning, and i was reckoning a short distanceto the fine fare of fort stockton. but the sun fell, and a polar moon rose over the high plains, andi couldn't tell if the shining in her eyeswas tears or twinkles, buther face was a rich lady's braceletwith the dark desert behind her. neither of us was surprisedto find fort stockton's fine dinesclosed to our midnight kind,and i watched while amber triedto hide her hungry anger. but at (what seemed to us)the last truck stop on earth,amber's eyes were shining againwhen the waitress told her of the infamous titty mountain. their laughter put my pacificreckoning far behind me.amber's chirp of joy as she looked back weston our way out of townbrought me home again;she saw the low rise with its tiny craggy pikebathed in the early light. and i agreed when she told me as we nosed our way home:"i'm never going backto titty mountain."

broken slinkies





power lines riddle back and forth acrossmidtown like brokenslinkies, and i amworking on a mysteryof my own: howdoes the fog seem to rise from the field; how does yourmemory come alongwith the dew?

fireman's lift

if the colonel ever calls   if late at night there is a ringing and it's the colonel, don't be frightened.  remember that the funny twists  of the heron's neck are posture too.  perhaps the hair on your cheeks is bristling?  but the colonel was clean-shaven.  the colonel's prayers were more communication  than supplication; the old phone is more of an appliance than a relic.   if the colonel asks for a report, tell him everyone's fine; the rocky island in the bay is white with birds.

my first words were floor itfrom the angle of the sunthrough my bedroom window this morning, i can tell:it is 1986. the community collegeparking lot is bursting with firebirds;stereo lights are constellations. at night, the clouds thicken into an empty map. they reflectthe light from down town. this morningis one minute between rains,and the drops on the leavesare blinking messages from the future,and while decoding them, i've forgotten what year it is. now that i've scraped the house,it is time to decide what color to paint,but i feel like the work is done. the house, streaked and ugly, iswhat happens now; the housepainted grey-blue with white trimis in the shady fortune-cookie future. when i was learning to drive,my first words were "floor it."but now, in the future, i knowso many more.  my foot easesthe pedal down; i repeatthe grocery list in my head.

nearly to bay ridge, a girl in red high heels took one off on the 4th ave. r platform to put a bandage on her foot, and i was reminded of you.  maybe it was you; tired memory could not tell me, but i  was momentarily caught between the mystery of our present and a passion in my past, and the sight of your shoe alone on the concrete busted my heart up into a hundred thousand tiny red flowers.

ancient historycurious.  what we rememberfrom across an age -- eight yearsago, evening light like marmaladeon a tar-paper roof, and a girlbent out the back window. coins clinking on the concretefloor of the bar beneath the highway,but there were no coins, butthere was definitely a bar.light the color of a dirty popsiclecut up on the floor by the blinds.but the mornings i remember best,the light reflecting blue off of your bedspread.i'd find a dirty shirt for work while, in your sleep, you pushed yourself against your bed.
