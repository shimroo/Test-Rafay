i have received 2 wallpaper prints and the quality is excellent! i put in an unusual orderâbike photos blown up to large size to stick to the wall as wallpaper. the staff from thinkwalls had called me to make sure i understood the product. in my case, i ordered hd bike photos for my 7 year old old. the staff person from thinkwalls helped me figure out what finish would work best. the photos are beautiful. thinkwalls also made sure this was delivered to me in time to put these up in my sonâs room for his birthday. a big thank you to them for all their assistance and for the quality of their work.
