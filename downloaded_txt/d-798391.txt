let us put our engine knowledge and experience to work in your toyota.
at d.o.a. the focus is to yield the correct end result, reached by proper component selections. you cannot swim without going in the water, and a company claiming to "know what your toyota needs" having never run a trail, a oval, a road course, or a drag strip, is simply guessing.

before you spend your money on any performance additions, consider the source, and understand the difference between a business that simply sells, and a business that sells from real usage, and real world experience.

if you're a beginner, and you need guidance regarding your build, send us an email, we'd love to help.

note: we are the only company performing d port and raised port conversions on 20r cylinder heads.
our engine specialties include 4age, 5sfe, 18rg, 2 and 3tc, all r series including the imported 21ru, 2 and 3rz, 5 and 7m, 2 and 3f including 3fe stroker builds, 5vzfe, and most current platforms including the 2016 3.5 adkins cylcle powerplants.
