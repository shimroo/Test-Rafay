still have questions? i've got you covered!







 i need to lose more weight, how do i continue after the 21 days?






										the best part of the smoothie diet is its flexibilityâyou can use it for as long as you need to reach your weight loss goals. i make it easy to keep going beyond the initial 3 weeks, whether you want to extend the program for a few more weeks or even months. each additional week will be just as enjoyable as the first three! my aim is to provide you with all the tools you need to continue losing weight and improving your health for as long as you wish.
									






 won't i just gain all the weight back?






										unlike other diets, this isnât a âquick fix.â the 21 days are just the start of a journey towards lasting health and a slimmer body. the top feedback i receive about the smoothie diet is that cravings for sweets and junk food often vanish after just a few weeks, making it easier to maintain your weight. i also guide you on how to smoothly transition back to your regular eating habits after the 21 days, while still enjoying smoothies to keep the weight off. in fact, many people love the smoothies so much they continue incorporating them into their diet long after the initial period. as some of my clients have shared, this program is truly a complete life transformation.
									






 i have type-2 diabetes, will this work for me?






										fresh, whole fruits and blended green smoothies offer a healthy way for diabetics to increase their intake of fruits and vegetables. green smoothies may also help address some diet and lifestyle issues that worsen diabetes or contribute to its progression. the smoothie diet is designed to initiate a series of lifestyle changes that can reduce or eliminate factors exacerbating the disease, and in some cases, even reverse the condition. however, please remember that while i am a nutrition expert, i am not a doctor. if you have diabetes or any other health condition, consult your doctor before making any changes to your diet.
									






 i don't have a lot of time in the day, is this hard to follow?






										if youâre short on time, this program is perfect for you. itâs designed with busy people in mindâlike working moms, students, and anyone juggling a hectic schedule. iâve made it incredibly simple, with just minutes of prep each day. plus, i offer tips to save even more time on smoothie preparation. the recipes are quick to whip up and can be enjoyed immediately or taken on the go. with this program, youâll always have a tasty, satisfying meal ready. and if you can press a button on your blender, you can follow this program!
									






 do i need an expensive blender or are the ingredients hard to find?






										with the growing popularity of smoothies, blender prices have become quite competitive. the key is to have a blender with a powerful motor. while your current blender will likely work fine, if you're committed to making a significant health change, iâll guide you through some top-of-the-line options. i also provide recommendations for budget-friendly models under $50 that will do the job effectively. ingredients are generally easy to find, and if you encounter any difficulties, i offer a comprehensive âswap listâ with simple alternatives.
									






 is there anything that comes in the mail?






										this is a fully digital product, so you wonât receive anything by mail. the advantage is that youâll have instant accessâno waiting for a package to arrive. i want to capture your excitement and get you started right away. you can even do your week 1 shopping today and begin tomorrowâ¦ or start immediately! the materials are provided in pdf format. after checkout, you'll be redirected to a page where you can download and view everything on your computer, tablet, or smartphone. for those who prefer a physical book, the quickstart bonus offers a 20-page condensed version of the main guide, which you can print out and use just like a printed book.
