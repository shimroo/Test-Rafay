adland tv logo and color palette.




as many of you know i’m the owner, founder, editor and writer of adland.tv, the world’s longest running website devoted to all things advertising. i amassed the world’s largest collection of super bowl commercials as well as a treasure trove of some of the best — and worst— ads from all over the world.after twenty-eight years, i’ve made the decision to take it offline. i don’t have the bandwidth to keep it going as i’d like to. because in addition to running adland, i’m also freelancing more than ever. and on top of that, i’m taking care of a parent who has alzheimer’s. at this point, the labor of love i literally built by hand has become more labor and less love. so i will be putting up the following domains for auction.adland.tvadland.eucommercial-archive.comad-rag.com and sinless.org which has been the legacy nameserver for all of the above.if there is any interest in the trademark, domains, or data please email dabitch@dabitch.net with a proposal.if you would like to support me, please use this link.the symbolism between taking all those memories offline while caring for someone with memory problems isn’t lost on me. that’s why i’m asking you to consider donating to the alzheimer’s association.  https://www.alz.org/ thank youme a long time ago, fixing the servers.

charging for commercial access on adland® - a short era


        adland had a paywall for some time. when the bandwidth for serving the commercials became too large of an expense for me, i devised a plan.
