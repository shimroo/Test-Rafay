 art of chinese calligraphy: calligraphy is one of the highest forms of chinese art. flow, rhythm, balance, line, and structure are more perfectly embodied in calligraphy than in painting or sculpture.  there are different styles ... formal, fluid, graceful, abstract, balanced, playful...and the list goes on. we offer many styles for you to choose from for your custom design.


about written chinese and spoken chinese:  the same chinese character may be pronounced differently in different dialects. there are many dialects in chinese, with the 2 major ones being mandarin and cantonese.  many chinese software offer pronunication input methods for both dialects.
mandarin (also known as putonghua) is widely spoken in many parts of china, taiwan and singapore, while cantonese is prevalent in hong kong, southern china, singapore and overseas.  many words sound similar in these dialects but there are more tonal variations in cantonese than mandarin.  our translation team is fluent in both dialects, and thus will pick a phonetic translation which will sound right in both mandarin and cantonese.


kanji and chinese characters: what looks to you like a symbol is actually a chinese character with pictorial, inferral and phonetic connotations. the chinese pictographic system of writing was imported to japan many centuries ago, and is known as " kanji " (in japanese, kan+ji = chinese+word). most kanjis have the same meaning as the original chinese characters, but some have evolved over time in japanese usage and the meanings are different from the chinese characters used nowadays. click here to learn more about the chinese character


about traditional and simplified characters: traditional characters are the standard characters with centuries of history and culture embodied in them. our site provides traditional characters and not simplified characters, so that the form, beauty and essence of the chinese character can be fully appreciated.
