mind control: the mkultra files






with roots deep in the history of military sciences, and largely beginning after ww2, the history of mind control studies is a rich and fascinating one. the quest to conquer the human mind was attempted by the central intelligence agency shortly after the end of the second world war, with the creation of the mkultra project. comprised of 149 sub-projects, the goal of this program was to study the effects of drugs, and different types of radical procedures on unwitting civilians in order to better understand how to create and interrogate spies during the cold war. the results and actions taken by numerous agencies, doctors and scientists over a 30-year period would come to light to congress in the 1977 church committee hearings as some of the most shocking and bizarre studies ever perpetrated by a democratic government on its own people.
featuring an exclusive interview and presentation by renowned trauma expert, dr. colin ross, the mkultra files is an examination of some of those experiments and the effects they have had on our culture.

exploding the official myths of the lincoln assassination






like many major historical events, abraham lincoln’s assassination had an official story and a back story.
respected author james perloff dismantles the official story in his new book, thanks to the digitization of handwritten 19th century documents, and with help from two intrepid predecessors—one alive, the other dead for more than 60 years. readers may be surprised at how much 1860s america resembles today’s america, with a deep state behind the scenes, controlled information, suppression of civil liberties, and secret agendas.

pawns in the game






perhaps one of the most important books that most people have never heard of, but absolutely should read—the classic, pawns in the game by william guy carr, is a work of sensational and shocking revelations. carr, a noted author who had a distinguished career as a canadian naval officer, including outstanding service during world war ii, shows how the conspiracy of atheistic-materialistic men has manipulated world events to secure ultimate control of the wealth, natural resources and man-power of the entire world.
this satanic conspiracy, carr goes on to show, strives to abolish christianity and all religions, dismantle all ordered national governments, and weaken and finally destroy patriotism, nations and traditional family life. pawns in the game traces the history of the great conspiracy and the world revolutionary movement, showing the roles of the illuminati, the freemasons, the communists, and the united nations. this book shows the conspiracy’s part in the american revolution, the french revolution, the communist takeover of russia, and world war ii.

the pre-tribulation rapture exposed






in this work the author, robert tuccio, takes an in-depth look at what the bible teaches about the timing of the rapture. also citing contemporary authors and religious leaders, the author shows where the pre tribulation rapture doctrine originated and details the reasons why this belief is so widely held in some christian churches. it is not the intent of this work to actually determine an exact date and time when the rapture will occur, but rather to show the reader a thoroughly researched and referenced timeline which the author concludes shows a post tribulation timing of the event.

america’s cultural revolution












in his powerful new book, christopher f. rufo uncovers the hidden history of left-wing intellectuals and activists who systematically took control of america’s institutions to undermine them from within. readers may not know the names of herbert marcuse, angela davis, paulo freire, and derrick bell, but they will recognize the ideas they spread. how their radical, destructive ideology slowly worked its way from prisons to academia to classrooms to your human resources department will come as a shock. failing to act soon, rufo warns, could allow the radical left to achieve their ultimate objective: replacing constitutional equality with a race-based redistribution system overseen by bureaucratic “diversity and inclusion” officials.

vaccine danger: quackery and sin






this book reveals the most significant medical fraud in history. the theory that you can prevent illness by injecting poisons into the bodies of healthy people is dangerous quackery and sin. all true science has proven the practice of vaccination to be ineffective and unsafe. but the medical establishment has been lured into the superstitious practice, hook, line, and sinker.
it is not merely a matter of ignorance that the debilitating practice flourishes. it is, at its core, being promoted by those who know it is unsafe and ineffective. there is a malevolent spirit behind the practice. it is part of a conspiracy against god and man. while most doctors are unwitting, some are willing minions of that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, who are quite happy to kill people for profit. jesus describes such men: “ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it” (john 8:44).

covid-19 and the agendas to come, red-pilled










drawing on statements of numerous scholars from around the world—virologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, pathologists, microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, including nobel prize winners, as well as front-line er physicians and family practice mds—veteran journalist james perloff asks hard questions about the global response to covid-19. perloff draws from mainstream publications and official government sources such as the cdc, as well as independent researchers whose work is increasingly hard to find online due to censorship by tech giants like facebook, google and youtube.

the bad war: the truth never taught about wwii












world war ii has been called the good war. but untold misery and millions of dead tell us something is not right. have we been told the truth? is history really propaganda? why view the events of war from the perspective of the victor? what about the defeated germans, the russians killed and bludgeoned by our communist friend and pal, joseph stalin? what if we have been lied to, as if a dreadful script had been prearranged? maybe it is time we looked behind the news. would we begin to see massive crimes, deceit, and the shattering of illusions? life will never be the same after we discover the startling facts about the bad war, by investigative journalist m.s. king.

vaxxed: from cover-up to catastrophe





in 2013, biologist dr. brian hooker received a call from a senior scientist at the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) who led the agency’s 2004 study on the measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccine and its link to autism. the scientist confessed that the cdc had omitted crucial data in their final report that revealed a causal relationship between the mmr vaccine and autism. dr. hooker enlisted the help of dr. andrew wakefield, the british gastroenterologist falsely accused of starting the anti-vax movement when he first reported in 1998 that the mmr vaccine may cause autism. dr. wakefield directs this documentary examining the evidence behind an appalling cover-up committed by the government agency charged with protecting the health of american citizens. interviews with pharmaceutical insiders, doctors, politicians, and parents of vaccine-injured children reveal an alarming deception that has contributed to the skyrocketing increase of autism and potentially the most catastrophic epidemic of our lifetime.
