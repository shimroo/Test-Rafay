village of silver creek, ny 1892
the village of silver creek is located on the shores of lake erie, within the town of hanover, chautauqua county, new york, in an area of western new york known as the concord grape belt.
state route 5 (central avenue – west, howard street) and state route 20 (main st, central avenue – east) intersect downtown in our business district, where you will also find our village square and historic bandstand.  walnut creek and silver creek both flow through the village before joining together, to the north of the municipal building, and flowing into lake erie.
the village provides many valuable resources for its residents, including a volunteer emergency squad and fire department, a department of public works, and water & sewer department.
there are several churches within the village, including the first united church, our lady of mt carmel catholic church, st alban’s episcopal church, trinity lutheran church, zion lutheran church, first baptist church, assembly of god and the christ chapel wesleyan church.
the silver creek central school district consists of an elementary, middle and high school building, which provides education for children residing not only in the village of silver creek, but the town of hanover, town of sheridan, and the cattaraugus indian reservation as well.
according to the 2010 census, the village of silver creek had a population of 2,699 people.
 “the first settlement of the part of the town of hanover where the village of silver creek now stands, was made by david dickinson, abel cleveland and john e. howard, who came here with their families from berkshire co., massachusetts, about the year 1803, and the first school house was erected around 1823. in 1822 a well-known black walnut tree, measuring about 10 feet (3.0 m) in diameter, was blown over in a storm. the village of silver creek was incorporated in 1848, and was an important port on lake erie until railroads reduced shipping. the village is home to a skew arch railroad bridge, one of the few bridges in the country built on an angle. silver creek’s best-known resident was howard “bob” ehmke, the pitching hero of the 1929 world series. while playing for the philadelphia athletics, ehmke struck out 13 chicago cubs in game one, a series record until 1953. former nba and aba basketball player george carter is also a graduate of silver creek central high school. carter played for st. bonaventure university and later in the 1971 aba all-star game.”
