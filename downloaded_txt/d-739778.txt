i chose southern alarm to do the monitoring of my security systems in both my home and business because i knew i would be dealing with folks right here in the mountains. however, their attention to detail has continued to amaze me. they even give me a courtesy call when a battery in one of my sensors is running low. thanks to them, my family feels secure when we lock the doors.
