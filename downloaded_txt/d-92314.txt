welcome to the free software directorya collaborative catalog of free software.
what is free software?
free software is a matter of liberty, not price. think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
what is the free software directory?
the free software directory (fsd) is a project of the free software foundation (fsf). we catalog useful free software that runs under free gnu-like systems, not limited to the gnu operating system and its gnu/linux variants. many of those programs also runs on proprietary operating systems which can be used to replace nonfree software.
if you are looking for a full operating system for your computer, please see our list of free gnu/linux distributions. more about the directory
