"we planned this photo shoot with our harriet forman barrett jewelry without even telling each other! everyone just showed up at my house & we had it on! diana formyduval and i have on our rings and necklaces and alexis fisher has on her new ring! three generations showing off these amazing pieces of art! (the rest of the day wasn't too bad, either!)"

"the first of your pieces i picked out as a graduation gift from my grandmother in 1980 (i lived in woodstock) my mother also had a piece later. when she died 10 years ago, we held the piece and passed it to my sister's daughter for her 16th birthday. my daughter was ver upset that her cousin got the piece, so for her 21st birthday, i have just purchased her a piece of her own (lotus woodstock) thank you."

"just two days ago, a man outside of my coop market said, "your necklace is beautiful. is it harriet barrett's work?" so i had to write and tell you how happy i have been wearing your wonderful piece and how many compliments you get."

"i wanted you to know how thrilled i am with your artistry in redefining the remnants of my naval academy class ring...i am so pleased to be able to wear my new ring and thank you again for your sensitivity and willingness to work on this challenge with me. every time i look at my ring i'll remember your role in making it happen."

"as soon as i tried it on i knew what it really was: this necklace is an invitation. an invitation to be bold. and i knew what i must do: look the invitation square in the typeface, and respond with vigor. i’m no wallflower as it is but this necklace is a challenge—a challenge to be more daring. it is also permission to smash through all the can’ts and reach for a yes. what an incredible gift."

—robin bertman shapiro 


"i simply adore the necklace you made and i purchased at the show.  wear it often and with such warm feelings.  saw maureen cavaiola last night and she was wearing the earrings you made.  (and i was wearing the necklace).  you have such a talent!  am glad maureen introduced you!  am now a big fan!"

"dear harriet, 

i just saw this picture that i have never seen before. it certainly does the gorgeous hfb necklace and earrings! i wanted you to finally see it.
i have been meaning to write to ask whether i could send my favorite hfb necklaces to have the clasps made easier to handle. 
my daughter is now 43. my first hfb necklace was bought by my husband for me to wear at her bat mitzvah!
all the best."
