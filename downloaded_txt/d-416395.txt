hobbes development



the hobbes website at nmsu has been shutdown due to the retirement of the
person who was looking after it.


nathan woodruff created and hosted a new replacement for the hobbes nmsu archive.

the site is called hobbes archive and is located at
http://hobbesarchive.com/


the new site is now allowing os/2 file uploads.


nathan and martin iturbide have been working together to implement a lot of
cleanup and improvements to the new site.

compared to hobbes nmsu there are some improved features:

- similar layout to hobbes nmsu.
- upload web form. there is no ftp upload and no need for the .txt companion file.
- improved search which can now be done by file name, short description and long description.

special thanks to nathan woodruff for creating the site from scratch and his commitment to maintain it in a long term.

arcaos 5.1.0 announced



after years in development, arca noae is pleased to announce the general availability
of arcaos 5.1.0.


in a first for any os/2-based distribution, arcaos 5.1 supports installation on the
latest generation of uefi-based systems, and includes the ability to install to
gpt-based disk layouts. this enables arcaos 5.1 to install on a wide array of
modern hardware.


arcaos 5.1.0 can be used for new installs or to upgrade any prior version of arcaos 5.
if installing from usb stick, the usb install stick may be created using any major
operating system at hand (windows, linux, macos, and of course, os/2, ecomstation,
and arcaos). once built, the usb stick can be inserted into any usb port in the target
system to boot into the arcaos installer/updater in either uefi or traditional bios
mode (alternatively, the dvd image may be burned to physical media and also booted
to either uefi or traditional bios systems).


for a complete list of updates in this release, see the arcaos wiki. be sure to review
the readme.txt, as well, as this contains critical information to ensure that you get
up and running fast, and includes tips for getting things adjusted right away.


this upgrade is available at a steep discount with your valid arcaos 5.0 support &
maintenance subscription (and your remaining subscription time will be added to the
included support term).  to download your fresh iso, simply visit your customer
portal page and select the arcaos download center link on the navigation panel to the
left.  from there, click the "upgrade to 5.1" button, and proceed to checkout.


if your arcaos 5.0 support and maintenance subscription has already expired, you may
still upgrade at less than the cost of a new arcaos 5.1 licence.  follow the provedure
above to order your upgrade, and the discount will be reflected in your cart.


arcaos 5.1.0 is available in english only, with other languages planned to follow
in the near future.
