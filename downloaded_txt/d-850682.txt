 dr. boroditsky on global vancouver morning news 









what our patients say











i walk many hours a day for enjoyment and exercise and was developing considerable foot pain in specific areas of my feet. dr. boroditsky targeted the problem immediately, recommending orthotics to relieve and support those areas. quite a pronounced change when i first inserted the orthotics. not sure i would like them but adapted very quickly and now my feet feel very comfortable and well supported. pain is basically gone. i actually look forward to putting my shoes on because of the massaging feeling the orthotics give my feet. excellent knowledge,high tech equipment and consistent follow up.



- randy bock












dr. a. boroditsky has been my podiatrist for four years. he has designed insoles with precise dimensions and has had these made for all my shoes at a reasonable cost. the results are a 100% fit, comfort, long life and absence of arthritic pain, especially for long walks. it is also easy to order further pairs at a later date and at the same cost. i would recommend this approach to anyone who suffers from arthritis, injuries and other disorders.



- f. h.












i have been a patient of dr. boroditsky’s for many years and have found him to always be highly professional and conscientious in his care. i have recommended him on a number of occasions and will continue to do so as i feel like he delivers high quality care, always makes time for me and always has a smile while he does so.



- mr. n. pemberton












i’ve been a patient of dr. boroditsky for 15 years & can highly recommend him. not only is he an expert at his craft, but he’s a warm friendly human being.
