riders in recoveryour purpose
riders in recovery motorcycle club is a brotherhood of men that work twelve step programs, are in recovery

we are a group of men in recovery with common interests who have joined together to improve the quality of our sobriety and our lives.

we are a traditional motorcycle club with a three piece patch and mc cube.

we are a group that strives to operate with as little stress and pressure as possible. we intend to enjoy life.

we support the motorcycle clubs and motorcycle organizations in our area and offer our respect to all patch holders.

we are founding members of the north carolina confederation of motorcycle clubs and carolinas motorcycle organizations united.

“we give what we get”

we support the recovery community whenever and wherever possible when it does not cause conflicts.

we are not a recovery group such as aa or na.

we are not a 1% group of hard-core bikers.

the central core of our brotherhood is based on trust, respect and love for each other. through our brotherhood, we enhance our individual recovery, contribute to our community and enjoy life.
