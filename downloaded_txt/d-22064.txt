we are absolutely thrilled with lancaster county barns. i'd give 10 stars if i could. we live in central nj and found lancaster barns online. i really liked the look of the sheds but i was a little hesitant to order something like that online. we decided to go for it. erika is the absolute best. she's friendly and incredibly helpful. two young, extremely polite men came and had our shed built in one day. it was gorgeous and high quality work.

thank you so much for building our beautiful barn. the whole process from design to construction has been a great experience. i had an idea about the kind of barn i wanted and you made it a reality. the construction process was on schedule and exceeded my expectations. the crew was so polite, showed genuine enthusiasm about making sure i was happy and cleaned up all of the construction of all debris. i have had a lot of barns constructed over the years but this is by far the best quality and most attractive barn i have ever had. i would highly recommend lancaster barns to anyone and will definitely be back for my next one!

one of the smarter decisions i've made in a longtime choosing lancaster county barns for my custom garage! i worked along with erika to get my approved plans into production. they delivered the full framing/sheathing build within 2-3 weeks, and installed my windows/doors, finished roof, siding in 2 days.

the thing that really made the difference in my purchase decision and overall happiness with your product was that it is one of the few genuine quality items still available and made in america. 
i would definitely buy from lancaster county barns again and i am so confident in your product that i will be recommending your company to my friends and family.
