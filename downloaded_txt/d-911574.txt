icomos philippines statement on the death of pamana








on 19 august 2015, the world was greeted with the shocking news of the death of pamana, a philippine eagle, pithecophaga jefferyi, released in the unesco world heritage site of mt. hamiguitan range wildlife sanctuary, in davao oriental, mindanao, philippines.  pamana’s murder sparked outrage worldwide.

ironically, pamana, after surviving gunshot wounds in 2012 and being rehabilitated to good health by the philippine eagle foundation, was released on 12 june 2015 in mt. hamiguitan as part of philippine independence day celebrations, with pamana’s release a symbol of the country’s right to fly free again. pamana’s freedom was short-lived, once again cut short by gunshot wounds.

pamana is the filipino word for heritage.  pamana's death diminishes us all. as a species found only in the philippines, pamana is not only a national treasure of the philippines, but it is part of the world's living heritage as well.  thus, if the philippine eagle goes extinct, it is not only the filipino people's loss but humanity's loss as well; if it goes extinct, the world will never see a philippine eagle fly majestically ever again.  ensuring that philippine eagles do not go extinct is a global responsibility.

pamana's death is laden with ironies: surviving gunshot wounds and being shot again to death inside a declared wildlife sanctuary and a unesco world heritage site, where we supposed it would live the rest of its natural life in safety and security. we were wrong.  philippine eagles need more than a physically secure place to live in. given their precarious state, they need human understanding that they are better off left alone.  we should commit to providing conditions that would ensure that they are left alone and unmolested.

icomos philippines stands in solidarity with the philippine eagle foundation, the biodiversity management bureau of  denr, or the department of environment and natural resources, and the filipino people in our fight to ensure the survival of the philippine eagle for all humanity’s benefit.  we also realize that unesco world heritage sites, like the mt. hamiguitan range wildlife sanctuary, are much more than physical monuments for humanity to enjoy, but are a living heritage that should provide sanctuary to all life found therein.  we commit to take positive action that would help ensure that the shooting of pamana would be the last, and for philippine eagles to fly free.

dominic galicia is newly-elected president of icomos philippines








architect dominic q. galicia was elected president of icomos philippines by the board of trustees at elections held last saturday. he is principal architect of  dominic galicia architects, a design-oriented practice whose work has been recognized for its sensitive attention to both concept and detail.

galicia obtained his professional degree in architecture in 1988 from the university of notre dame, notre dame, indiana, where he was a notre dame scholar.  he received a university of notre dame distinguished asian pacific alumni award in june 2005.  he also studied architecture for a year at notre dame's campus in rome, and pursued graduate studies in architecture at pratt institute in new york.

although a modernist by philosophy, he is deeply concerned with the preservation of historic architectural sites. he has served as vice president of the heritage conservation society, member of the executive council of the national committee on monuments and sites (ncms) of the national commission for culture and the arts (ncca), and on the board of trustees of the philippine green building initiative (pgbi). he represents the philippines in the icomos international scientific committee on twentieth-century heritage (isc20c), in which capacity he helped to develop “bpo@escolta,” the public-private initiative to revive manila’s historic downtown. ongoing projects include the proposed 20,000 square meter national museum of natural history, in rizal park, manila.





also elected were architect rene luis s. mata (vice president for national affairs), architect ma. joycelyn b. mananghaya (vice president for international affairs), patricia maria c. santiago (secretary), and architect melvin g. patawaran (treasurer).
