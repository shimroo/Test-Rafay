        bibletime 3.0.1 released
    
the bibletime team is proud to announce the immediate availability of bibletime version 3.0.1 which is the first bugfix release in the stable 3.0 series of bibletime.
read more…

all users of bibletime are encouraged to upgrade, especially users still using bibletime version 2.11.2 or earlier.
notable changes since version 3.0:

improved tuning of scrolling speed.
improved handling of fonts to fix many bugs, including a switch to qt's native font chooser widget in settings dialog, because of many serious bugs in our legacy implementation.
improved sample text in settings dialog.
improved behavior of the mag view to be more similar to pre-3.0 behavior.
increased maximum column count from 4 to 10.
removed the orphaned and broken tests for bibletime.
updated translations, including a new user interface translations to japanese and ukrainian, a new handbook translation to russian, and a new howto translation to ukrainian.
fixed displayview.qml getting incorrectly installed under /usr/bin/ on some platforms.
fixed some compatibility issues with different qt versions.
fixed a crash when editing personal commentary.
fixed highlighting of selected text.
fixed dragging of links.
fixed modules rearranging themselves.
fixed logic related to clicking on verse numbers.

fixed drag and drop in mag view and search dialog.
fixed no text being displayed for some thml modules.
fixed undefined behavior and crashes from opening menus to select works by working around a broken qmenu interface (qtbug-77273).
fixes to handling of languages, including a caching discrepancy which caused some settings not being properly applied before restarting bibletime.
fixed saving of chapters not working properly.
fixed handling of nested  tags for osis works.
fixes to handling of pageup/pagedown keys when scrolling out of bounds. note that when bibletime is compiled against qt 5.9, one might still experience a trivial glitch where only part of the module is displayed. pressing pageup/pagedown again may help to work around this.

      in bibletime 2.11.2. it is possible to install bibletime 2.11.2 as a flatpak.
    
read more…


          this flatpak is available at  flathub.org. be sure to
          follow the "setup guide" before installing bibletime. this flatpak works on numerous operating systems. see the "setup guide"
          for more details.
        

          note: this flatpak of bibletime runs in a confined filespace. it will not find your $home/.bibletime or $home/.sword directories.
          it will use the $home/.var/app/info.bibletime.bibletime directory to find .bibletime and .sword. it is possible to move your current .bibletime
          and .sword to this directory and then make a symbolic link to $home/.bibletime and $home/.sword.
