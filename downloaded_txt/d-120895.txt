                                            i came across weddingbands.com in one of my random searches online back in 2009 when i was planning for my wedding. i selected on behalf of myself and husband to be at the time - contemporary style two tone 18k gold rings. my husband had issue with his own size as i had not measured it correctly. we ordered another one courtesy one of my bosses back then at the office. all got delivered to his house in long beach. he brought all 3 rings for me to lagos nigeria. this is 15 years down the line and we still do not have any course to change our rings because they are still looking the way they were when we first received it!

i am always proud to show or recommend any of my friends to weddingbands.com because when you talk about quality style and steeze like we say in nigeria - they got  it all covered!

thanks team for doing your absolute best in making our weddings amazing events.-  titilayo balogun,
                                                    lagos nigeria

                                            oh my iã¢â¬â¢m so pleased and delighted to be among the many here on this site that have provided their sincere praise of wedding bands.comã¢â¬â¦
initially my fiancãâ©e and i selected our rings at a brick  mortar jewelry store! the rings had to be ordered however after arriving and looking at my ring that day a bit closer i discovered a slight flaw in the design that we had chosen!
unfortunately we returned my ring and was later told my size was not availableã¢â¬â¦i was devastated!
we looked at several stores and decided to look online and iã¢â¬â¢m extremely happy that we did. we came upon wedding bands.com and completed a search and there was my ring!!!!
i placed an online order after reading over all of the online information to include testimonials shipping return policy etc. however before pulling the trigger and finalizing the sale i called the company!
my fiancãâ© and i were very pleased that all of our questions were answered the sales associate/representative was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable the representative even asked the date in which we would need them! so we made our purchase and they arrived in about 8 days.
we are so very please happy  excited with our purchase and looking forward to the day when we exchange our vows with my ring from wedding bands.com!!
thank you all so very much

                                            back in 2016 when we decided to finally make it official we ironically had 12 days to plan our wedding....and it all honestly fell into place as if it had been planned for a very long time.  we found wedding bands.com online and found the perfect ring....the grand canyon....it was truly a mix of us... yellow gold and white gold both polished and satin in a wave design around the band.  we ordered them and can honestly attest this jeweler is amazing! we got the rings in time for the ceremony and since then we have sent both of them back for inspections and refurbishing.   as our 7th anniversary was approaching 10/23 we contacted the jewelers and scheduled our bands to be sent back to be inspected refurbished and refinished.  this company is beyond professional...in communications and advice on the products they create and take pride in taking care of.

they kept the rings for almost 3 weeks giving them the time to make them look new again and today we received them back...looking like they did the day the originally arrived 7 years ago.

they communicated with us by email and phone from our initial contact to send them back for inspections/refurbishing and followed up till they arrived back to us today.

they are the type of organization that existed years ago in the old days....they take great care in what they create for you and take great pride in keeping you as a satisfied customer....we recommend them highly definitely a 10+ in todays retail world.-  kevin and jim,

                                            ab-so-lutely perfect!  weddingbands.com exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds.  great business model.  help was always there but not intrusive.  the rings arrived in a matter of days and are of the highest quality.  my personal jeweler was impressed by the craftsmanship and called out rings oustanding.  im very grateful for the service provided!  i give weddingbands.com a definitive 5 stars!-  d b.-j.,

                                            this is the 2nd time i have gone to weddingbands.com to purchase a diamond anniversary band and they do not dissappoint !  its very easy to get a hold of a customer service rep and email any specs or pictures to show exactly what you want in your ring.  i usually look art the site to get an idea and then discuss my  unique needs over the phone.  this may be a slight change to the setting or diamond size.  for my first order i wasnt sure if a website would be a good way to buy a diamond ring however they make it very easy to discuss your needs and send pictures in advance etc that i went back a second time for another ring to stack with the first.  in the case of my second ring once received i wanted a different setting with thicker prongs and they worked with me until i  got exactly what i wanted!  

the quality of the diamonds are great and the customer service excellent!

                                            i love my band.  i looked all over and weddingbands had the most choices and best price.  when i contacted them to alter my order they were courteous and prompt.  they also ensured the engraving was properly spelled in the greek i requested.  i highly recommend them.-  kris,

                                            i have for many years wanted an extra wide band.  my husband purchased a second band 7mm for me when my first band cracked apart.  no grief there because i never liked it anyway.  my finger size has changed as i have aged and my second band became tight on my finger.  i finally took it off before i would have to have it cut off.  we started shopping at local jewelers and pricing the type of band that i wanted.  none of the jewelers had bands as wide as i was looking for especially in the ring size i needed.  thank goodness for weddingbands.com.  i found the exact width of band i wanted 10mm and in the perfect ring size.  i felt very assured of my purchase because of the return policy provided.  i am very pleased with my ring and the service provided.  thank you.-  robin s.,
