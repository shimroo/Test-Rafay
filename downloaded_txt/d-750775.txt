bobcat/bruiser collaboration



dec 18, 2024




this fall, 8th graders at girls preparatory school read animal farm by george orwell. after finishing the novel, their teachers challenged them to write their own children’s books with an allegorical message, similar to orwell’s work. as part of their final exam, gps 8th graders visited brainerd baptist to share their stories. the students from gps and bbs gathered together to read their books, ask questions, and engage in lively discussions. it was a fun and inspiring opportunity for our students to see that anyone can be an author and bring their own stories to life.

bnn - making news fun 



oct 22, 2024




 have you heard about the bobcat news network (bbn)? for many years, students at brainerd baptist school received their morning announcements over the pa system. however, this year, two innovative teachers, april connell and suzanne breedlove, have taken this idea to the next level. they've transformed the routine task of delivering school news into a fun, engaging, and highly anticipated weekly video series.

pirates invade brainerd baptist school 



sep 21, 2024




if you have followed the brainerd baptist school social media accounts, you have undoubetedly seen the hashtag #learningisfunatbbs many times. i never cease to be amazed at the fun ways in which our faculty make learning fun for our students. this past thursday was international pirate day and our 4th and 5th grade teachers did not let this special day pass without incorporating it into a fun day of learning. i have asked 4th grade teacher jesse robinson to tell us about this day.

new faculty for 2024-2025



jul 17, 2024




if you have been a part of the brainerd baptist school community for a while, you have probably seen similar posts each summer introducing our new faculty members. i have often said that the most important part of my job is finding faculty who are the best fit for our culture and community. as we make final preparations for the upcoming school year, we are excited to introduce the new faculty and staff joining our team.

summer 2024 construction projects



may 28, 2024




since 2020, our school has completed several construction projects during the summer months that have completely transformed our campus. we have built new classrooms for 1st grade and k2, a new library, a stem lab, the learning center, a new upper school office, new administrative offices, a new entryway, a new shop, and a remodeled cafeteria. last summer, we completed a full remodel of our entire lower school, including new floors, paint, windows, furniture in all classrooms, and new bathrooms for our k3 and k4 students

new grading policy for 2024-25



may 15, 2024




over the past few months, teachers at brainerd baptist school have collaborated to develop a new grading policy aimed at ensuring consistency across 1st - 5th grades. historically, different grade levels have adopted their own grading policies, leading to discrepancies and confusion among parents and teachers regarding expectations from year to year. to address this issue, a committee was formed with teachers representing multiple grade levels. this group then met with each grade level to hear concerns and frustrations and also explored grading practices employed by other schools.

tybee post #2



apr 23, 2024




day two is well underway here on tybee island. the weather has been absolutely perfect today. we began our morning with the infamous shark dissection (your children learned a new word - ichthyology). all students were able to complete the assignment - and that doesn’t always happen! after the shark dissection, the students enjoyed lunch (pizza), and then we headed to the beach for one of the favorite classes at tybee - “choosies,” in which students were given a lot of different choices from playing in the water, building sandcastles, hunting for shark’s teeth, looking for seashells, playing volleyball, or just relaxing. both our lacrosse and volleyball players spent some of this time practicing for their tournaments that begin when we return.

tybee post #1



apr 22, 2024




we're wrapping up our first full day at burton 4-h center, and i'd like to give parents a glimpse into our day so you can see what your children (and chaperones) have been up to. while we understand that some of you may desire more frequent photo updates, our standard practice is to capture moments throughout the day and post them in the afternoon. due to limited internet and cell coverage at the camp, posting updates in real-time is challenging and also time-consuming. our priority is to be fully present with the students as they are doing these fun things. however, rest assured, a comprehensive photo album will be shared soon via the school’s facebook page.

collaboration is a good thing 



apr 15, 2024




i am passionate about sharing the wonderful events that unfold on our campus each day. this past week was particularly busy, brimming with various activities that our school community cherishes. throughout the week, our students delighted in perusing the offerings at the book fair and showcasing their artistic talents at the art show. culminating the week was our cherished annual grandparents day. the festivities commenced with a delightful breakfast and was followed by a program where our students showcased a medley of songs from beloved broadway productions. finally, students escorted their grandparents to their classrooms, where they engaged in special activities together.
