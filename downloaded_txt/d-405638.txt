365ad achromat doublet
a doublet (or achromat) is 2 lenses of dissimilar material fused together to formone lens. the function of each lens on its own is to magnify the target in its own way, but to also control the light so that it does not separate into its component color bands much like a prism would or much like a standard singlet style archery lens would.
