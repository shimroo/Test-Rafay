what our clients are sayingschwartz & woodward worked with us to plan my daughter's wedding. my daughter and i are very organized and could have done it ourselves; however, i wanted it to be a wonderful experience for the entire family, so we hired joanne. everything went so smoothly, she answered all our questions and gave us lots of guidance; but i never felt that she pushed us towards any one vendor. she provided good information and let us make our own decisions. everyone she recommended was first class to work with. she went above and beyond what was expected to provide a wonderful product. joanne only recommends quality vendors. a year and one/half later, we are still getting compliments on our awesome flowers and gorgeous table linens.my husband will tell anyone whose daughter has just gotten engaged to use schwartz & woodward. he says" they allowed me to enjoy my only daughter's wedding!"i regret i could only give them 5 stars. they are that great to work with!received via wedding wire
