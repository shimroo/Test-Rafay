imate offers security in an insecure world

account takeover up tenfold in past year
account takeover is notoriously difficult to combat, because companies cannot discern between legitimate and fraudulent users as they are both presenting correct credentials.




identity fraud at all-time high.

9 out of 10 of website login attempts? yeah, that'll be hackers, credit stuffing.
credential stuffing is rampant âattackers try passwords stolen from hacked account databases on lots of other websites in the hope they also work






todayâs model of identity verification and authentication fails to meet the needs of accountholders or organisation. accordingly, a much more holistic approach is needed to take into account a richer array of context around the identity and lifestyle of the consumer.
imate works on the premise that all data is freely available to fraudsters. imateâs holistic individual lifestyle approach focuses on the prevention and damages mitigation of the individuals risks when their identity data is being used, with special focus on fund transfers, account openings, account takeovers and communications with organisations. our aim is to improve, promote and strengthening the capabilities of organisations to stop fraud to the individual and organisation. 
imate's comprehensive identity protection platform integrate with; biometrics, behaviometrics, location and context analyses tools. allows the creation of custom rules and workflows for different products and channels that use a sufficiently wide scoring band, allowing for granular customization. this solution is about multiple data sources across multiple suppliers that make up the identity lifestyle of the individual. the individual authorises the use of their data so they are part of the solution in this inclusive fraud protection system.
