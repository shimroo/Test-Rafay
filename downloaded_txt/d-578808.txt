dave raulstone

this was the first time that i serviced my cruiser with n1 4×4, and what a great experience. i previously serviced at a toyota agency, but after 3 services and a number of issues, i decided to try n1 4×4. they picked up things immediately that toyota had failed to do in the 3 services.  i strongly recommend that, if you have a hilux or a land cruiser, and live in the pretoria area, you try these guys. i will be using them again!
