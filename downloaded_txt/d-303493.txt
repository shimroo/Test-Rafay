welcome to marc gunn's irish & celtic songs lyrics presented by the celtic music magazine and the irish & celtic music podcast. the british isles are full of great music. i fell in love with irish songs and scottish songs by listening to bands like the dubliners, the corries, the wolfe tones, the clancy brothers, ewan maccoll, and the irish rovers.  these artists inspired me to compile this list of celtic and irish songs & lyrics with streaming mp3s free, so you can listen and learn the way i do, by ear.

a begging i will go
a drop of nelson's blood
a fairy story
a man's a man for a' that
a miner's lullaby
a prudent thief
all for me grog
an irish lullaby
are you sleeping maggie?
arthur mcbride
auld lang syne
ballad of the sea
barnyards of delgaty
bedlam boys
beer, beer, beer (charlie mopps)
big strong man
black is the color
black velvet band
bog down in the valley
bonnie ship the diamond
botany bay
buttercup's lament
come by the hills
come out ye black and tans
come ye by atholl
danny boy
dicey riley
do virgins taste better
donald macgillivray
donald, where's your trousers?
down among the dead men
drunken sailor
fiddler's green
finnegan's wake
flower of scotland
foggy dew
follow prince charlie
frog kissin'
galway shawl
green grow the rashes
gypsy rover
happily ever after
happy birthday from ireland
haul away joe
have some madiera, m'dear
health to the company
henry martin
high jeannie high
if i had a million ducats
i'll drink from dusk til dawn
i'll tell me ma
i'm a rover, seldom sober
irish ballad
irish lilting song
irish rover
isn't it grand, boys?
jedi drinking song
jock stuart, a man who wears a kilt every day
johnny jump up
johnny, i hardly knew ye
join the british army
jug of punch
kilkelly, ireland
killiecrankie
kilted for her pleasure
kilty pleasure




lanigan's ball
leaving of liverpool
lily the pink
lish young buy-a-broom
loch lomond
lusty young smith
maid went to the mill
mairi's wedding
men of new basin canal
mingulay boat song
molly malone
monahan's mudder's milk
nancy whiskey
o'er the way
old dun cow (macintyre)
old fenian gun
paddy mccollough
patriot game
peggy gordon
purple flower
rare old mountain dew
rattlin' bog
rising of the moon
rocky road to dublin
rosin the bow
satisfied
scarborough faire
seven drunken nights
siuil a ruin
skye boat song
slainte mhaith
spancil hill
st. patrick never drank
star of the county down
tae the begging
teddy bear picnic
the bridge
the dragon's retort
the holy ground
the humours of whiskey
the leprechaun (you're no irish laddie)
the mermaid song
the moonshiner
the mower
the night paddy murphy died
the orange and the green
the parting glass
the scotsman
the shearin's no for you
the unicorn song
the widow and the devil
tinkerman's daughter
twa bonnie maidens
twa corbies
waxie's dargle
what do you do with a drunken sailor?
when irish eyes are smiling
when she held me in her arms
when the dairy farm caught fire
whiskey in the jar
whiskey, you're the devil
wild colonial boy
wild mountain thyme
wild rover
won't you come with me?
ye jacobites by name
