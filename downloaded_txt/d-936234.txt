ajax in the city










about this blog - they say that on the day the french revolution started that louis xvi wrote in his journal that "nothing much of importance happened today."now, of course, we know that he couldn't have been more wrong.but, maybe that's just how life is, you go about living your life and then bam, all of a sudden something that you didn't pay any attention to when it happened comes back and bites you in the butt.or maybe not.i like to think i see things a little more clearly than louis did, at least, i hope i do.you be the judge.about me - my father is african-american and greek.*my mother is african-american and french.*and everywhere i go people tell me i have an accent.so who am i?i'm nicholas ajax stamosall american every man.the citybill in exile - nsfw[the] boner guide - nsfwcamille readsdwight supremacyguy dadshunk du jourjockohomokeithkats iv - nsfwkenneth in the 212mathew philipministry of pleasurenightcharm - nsfwthe perculiar one - nsfwpictures of naked men - nsfwa place in the sun - nsfwplanet homorestoring loverod 2.0roids and rants - nsfwsecret songstwo cents worth
