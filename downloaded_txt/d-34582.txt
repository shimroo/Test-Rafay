welcome to











mass elite lacrosse


































this year, mass elite is celebrating its 25th anniversary. founded in 1999, by leslie frank and paula evans, mass elite was the first club lacrosse program for girls in massachusetts. what began as one travel team has now expanded into a nationally-recognized, elite club that offers comprehensive athlete development, year-round training, and national tournament exposure. the success and longevity of mass elite can be attributed to the investment of our exceptional coaching staff (many of whom are mass elite alumnae) and the passion and commitment shared by all of our student-athletes and their families.
