it wasn't so bad!





although it was a really long day, up at 4.30am and then trains across france - through the tunnel and home by 7pm, it actually wasn't so bad. wistle is a hardy traveller, we stopped in paris at a bistro for lunch, and did quite a bit of napping on the train -
nice to be back in london, see my guys,
im maid of honour at a friends wedding on friday which will be fun - and then planning to do some work before i head back to france -

over







back to reality on tuesday - wistle and i are getting the train back to london - but mi maid of honour at a friends wedding on friday which im looking forward too - off to rigby and peller to get a corset thursday - i kid ye not. vivienne westwood dress, very un-croissant-forgiving.
my dad caught a 15kg tuna! which is pretty amazing -
i went sailing on molly yesterday with pete -
we're having a barbecue tonight which my dad is cooking. we went to the butchers and he got steaks that weigh more than i did when i was born - and i was not a small baby - potato shaped as you well know.

be well, rachel x

ps. i should point out that it is not my dad in the photo -

pointless





i have to say this in the wake of amy winehouses death and the fact that people are leaving bottles of vodka and cigarettes at her shrine.

i wish that the public perception of addiction was correct. that people understood it is not lack of will power, but a disease as powerful and dibilitating as any other potentially terminal disease. it is a disease not just of the physical body but also of the emotional and the spiritual.

however - i feel i have to accept that the world at large will never truly understand this - and why would they need to? those of us in recovery from addiction understand because our lives depend on it. it is like trying to explain to someone who has never had cancer what having cancer is like, or diabetes, or a heart condition. unless you have it, it is impossible to understand. and i have to accept that we as a society in general (not all), will always slow down to look at a terrible and fatal car crash. rock and roll - and i am qualified to talk about this - is about music, living, expression of the spirit, sharing, allowing yourself to be free. it is not about killing oneself with addiction, dying young, club 27 give me a fucking break. leaving alcohol at a young girls shrine, is like leaving a jar with mini tumours at the grave of someone who died from cancer. it is a sad day. im afraid i will have to hand this one over to god and thank him that i found recovery from a fatal disease that only perhaps 5% of addicts ever are blessed enough to find.
