pvd
pad is a disease of the blood vessels that affects 15% of the population worldwide. in pad, the arteries that carry blood to the arms or legs become narrowed or clogged, leading to slowing or stoppage of blood flow. the disease most commonly affects the legs and sometimes occurs in the arms. many people do not give much importance to initial symptoms - such as pain or numbness in the legs or arms - because they mistakenly believe it is a normal part of aging. ignoring the symptoms may lead to gangrene of the limbs and eventually limb loss.
