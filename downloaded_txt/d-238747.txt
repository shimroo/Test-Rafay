"how can you call a takeover 
a discovery?"







  


-public enemy








random public enemy link of the minute:

















public

enemy, in my opinion, is the greatest band of all time - that is - of any

music genre.   i have been a fan of the group for about 19 years now.  i feel there isn't enough pe information on the web,

and i really can't understand why.  so, therefore, i have created

this site.  thanks to the official public enemy website, i can stay

up with the latest information on the group to keep it current.  so,

go ahead and enjoy it - and if you have any suggestions on how i can make

this site better, let me know!  i'll be glad to listen to any suggestions...

hell no we ain't all right!

  - public enemy in the news.  this isn't the new york post, although

with all the articles on pe lately, i wonder if the authors of some of

them ever listened to pe or ever followed the group...
