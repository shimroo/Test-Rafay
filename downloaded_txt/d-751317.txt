sure, the financial world is going full-on digital, automatic, and mobile. but when it comes right down to it, we believe this business is still all about people. because a computer can’t help you choose the right checking account, or fill out a loan application. and a mobile phone can’t sponsor events in the community, or shake your hand when you close on your first mortgage. nope. only people can do that. people helping people. that’s who we are at jefferson credit union.
