"come away with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest" - mark 6:31
hospitalityhomes.org 
is a network of homes providing rest and renewal for full-time pastors, clergy, missionaries, chaplains, ministry directors, and other full-time christian workers. the network of homes are privately owned by christian hosts in the spirit of romans 12:13 "share with god's people in need, practice hospitality." they are available to full-time christian workers seeking spiritual and physical renewal for a nominal​ reservation fee to the ministry. our goal is to provide opportunities for those who are on the frontlines to "come away" with jesus, get some rest and to be restored.

testimonials​from previous guests
the best time of our year. truly a great blessing & the best family time we’ve ever had. so thankful for this ministry.
we are grateful for the place we stayed! we were overwhelmed by the location. our host was thoughtful. his hospitality caused us to ask ourselves how we can follow his example.
life changing - what an anointed location that i know god will continue to use for his glory and for revealing himself to those seek him. the hosts were available but allowed me to be alone with god and were never a disturbance or distraction.
our hosts were wonderful hosts! from the moment we arrived we felt welcomed and right at home. the location is beautiful and it was wonderful having a little cabin all to ourselves. we are grateful for the ministry of hospitality homes. 
the place was very clean and comfortable. it was a relaxing place to get away from city life. the owners were very nice and we enjoyed getting to know them. they were very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed.
the hosts were amazing. they took time to get to know me and allowed me the opportunity to hear about them. their home is a lovely oasis with a beautiful walking trail located directly behind it. i thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
it was a great stay for us. really relaxing cabin in a beautiful area near the coast and not too far from the redwood forest. there was a wood burning stove and plenty of firewood to heat the home. my family had a really refreshing stay.
wonderful and refreshing! the hosts were so welcoming and gracious. home is spacious and beautiful and really geared towards kids! the pool, hot tub and game room were a huge hit with our children.
we had a wonderful time there with our hosts family. the rooms were comfortable and the home was spacious and beautiful. the outdoor scenery was gorgeous!
the hosts cared for me very well, more than i expected. i felt it was as my home and they were very friendly. i was blessed very much. thank you.
