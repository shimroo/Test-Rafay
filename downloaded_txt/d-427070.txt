improving society 
						through social activism



























at the heart of the bohnett foundation is the belief that participation is a fundamental 
			right—everyone deserves the chance to contribute and belong. inspired by david bohnett’s own 
			personal journey, the foundation funds programs that open doors and opportunities in civic 
			life, communities, and the cultural arts.
by supporting initiatives that deeply foster acceptance, empower future leaders, and connect 
			communities through technology, it strives to give everyone the power to take an active role 
			in shaping a better society.
