      this morning, shortly after midnight, the state ofcalifornia executed stanley "tookie" williams for themurder of 4 people in 1979, a crime which he says hedid not commit. williams, founder of the notoriousstreet gang the crips, was convicted almost 25 yearsago and had exhausted all legal appeals. arnoldschwarzenegger, the governor of the state ofcalifornia, personally rejected williams´ clemencyappeal and ordered that the murder of williamsproceed.this appeal for pardon was based on the fact thatover the three decades williams has spend on death rowthe prisoner was completely rehabilitated. herenounced the gangster lifestyle which he had helpedto define. he authored award winning children´s bookswarning against the dangers of gang violence. he wasnominated for the nobel peace prize because he opposedevery kind of violence, unlike mr. schwarzenegger whoauthorized williams´ murder hiding behind theshameful,cowardly veil of the law.the state-sponsored murder of stanley "tookie"williams, besides erasing a man´s very existence andhis dignity, makes a joke of the principle ofredemption through rehabilitation. here we have a manwho spent a quarter of a century in vociferousdenunciation of violence and in the end this countedfor nothing.the very practice of capital punishment is abhorrentand shall be regarded in the annals of history asevidence of the barbarism of the societies that allowits practice. indeed, every single member of westerncivilization has rejected state-sponsored murder.every member, that is, save for the united states ofamerica. the united states is also one of the very fewcountries in the world that allows for the executionof children. we are in good company here: thisbarbarous fraternity consists of china, congo, iran,nigeria, pakistan, saudi arabia, and yemen. indeed,america is the most enthusiastic murderer of childrenin the world: 19 children were executed in americabetween 1990-2003.scientific advances in recent years have revealed thatmany innocent people have been exectued. 122 wronglyconvicted people have been released from death rowsacross america since 1973. how many more innocentswere not released and met tragic, criminal deaths. afew brave leaders, such as governor ryan of illinois,have been courageous enough to call an end to thecruel practice of state sponsored murder (mr. ryancommuted the death sentences of every single death rowinmate in his state to life imprisonment) but on thewhole, american leaders refuse to remedy this sadsituation out of fear of losing the confidence ofconservative voters.a german teenager wise beyond her years recentlycommented to me that whenever a government carries outa crime with the approval of the people, howeverpassive that approval may be, then all of the peopleof that society share in the blame for thatgovernment´s crimes. therefore, every american whosupports the practice of state sponsored murder hasthe blood of innocents on their hands.the hypocrisy of half of the population (polls sayabout that many people support capital punishment) ofmy country makes me absolutely sick. these morallyambiguous people often quote the bible´s "eye for aneye, tooth for a tooth" mantra in defense of the deathpenalty. the irrelevance of a 2000 year old work offiction aside, doesn´t that same book hold as one ofits central tenets that "thou shalt not kill?"once again i find myself sickened by the actions of acountry that history will judge as the greatestperpetrator of injustice in the world in our age. ifind myself frustrated and almost at times ashamed tobe a citizen of such a country. and i find that theargument i have often used to comfort myself- that nomatter how horrendous the government and policies ofthe united states may be, the american people are anoverwhelmingly compassionate, warm, generous bunch-crumbling in the face of such facts as publicacceptance (at least 50% of the public, in any case)of state sponsored murder.the united states of america is the world´s greatestpractitioner of state sponsored murder. there ismurder in iraq and afghanistan in the name of fightingterror by inflicting far greater terror and killingfar more innocents that any osama bin laden could everdream of, murder of people in poor agrarian societiesby agricultural subsidies to rich american foodproducers, murder by greedy financial institutions whoimpose conditions designed to enrich a powerful elitewhile keeping billions of others in poverty, themurder of the very environment of the earth by beingthe only western nation to reject the kyoto protocolon global warming- and the list could go onindefinitely.if i diverge greatly it is only in the service of mypoint. how on earth, in 2005, can a nation whichclaims to espouse the lofty ideals of "life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness" allow such statesponsored murder to continue? it is a great shame thathistory will judge us for. with great shame we shouldjudge ourselves for it.and so back to mr. williams. when the executionersattempted to insert the injection tube in his arm, aprocess that normally takes 2 minutes, they needed 11minutes. williams shook his head in frustration andasked "are you guys doing this thing right?" stanley"tookie" williams was 51 years old. he proclaimed hisinnocence until the very end.-brett

      thank you indra, good point. as far as resiloutions go i have not been all to good at keeping them....i started the year with drinking gallons of water, waking up early and anticipating school, going to bed relatively early and minamizing my consumption of beer....not that those were my only one but still those were a few of them. i admit it, i am weak...i like staying up late and drinking everything else under the sun instead of water.....and my mind has been wondering away from physiology to exotic places with a warm sun and dreamy white beaches...but then gravity pulls me back to iceland and i slam into the ground full force, forcefully drinking water and frugally saving money... i opened a thing at myspace the other day but havent set it up, i just went to check up on people but so is this like the biggest thing in la or something? everybody seems to have one. so i am working on getting a resumé up and running and we will see if it works... on that matter, i have been thinking about taking a class in creative writing in nyu next summer....i have about a zillion ideas floating around for next summer but thats one of them, please feel free to give me advice...i need it. on a happier and less confusing note, i am experiencing a drowning sensation at school and i have finally given up on men in any form shape or matter, i think the song how bizarre sums these nocturanal unmonogamist creatures correctly. how long do you think u could live without working granted you have minimum money to live off of? i think i could go for at least 3 years and in that time i would write a couple of books and maybe even finish reading all the ones i want to....i mean i think it would be quite nice, i would just go to some little island where the weather is nice and stay there and relax and just zone out and on my return home i would publish my books and everybody would love them and the would be the best selling christmas book around.....i would get a book deal in new york and i could just fly between there and la, writing books and tv drama series, semi based on my own life.... sorry the thought process got ahead of my there..... but think about it... waiting for a text is a meaningless as looking for a answer in a pauly shore movie, i need a makeover, a makeover of my mind and soul. i started a soul makeover last week but that went as well as rosanne having a lipo, as soon as a little handsome devil comes strolling around the corner i say fuck my makeover and go for the little bugger. which offcourse lands me here and i go around in circles thinking about him, me , us, future, past and watch every episode of s a t c for refrence and possibly guidance.... carrie drew me to the conclusion that there is no conclusion, you just have to go for it until your body and soul are drained and your are left a mere shadow of your former self with a little heart thats shattered into a million pieces but on the upside, you lost weight. i mean, everybody deserves a second chance as long as your heart gives the okay, right? i think its about dating karma, if i give a guy that is a freakin tasmanian devil a second chance to see that maybe theres something good in him, i will be given a second chance by the guy that sees me as a rambling lunatic with at least half a dozen personalities.. or maybe there is just one chance, make it or brake it. the other stuff is just complicating things and procrastinating the unevitable brake up....i dunno, i am putting way to much pressure on these things and just go with the flow...... well i was doing just that until last week, two evil male tried to play cinderella on me and get me to swallow there apple.... this cinderella has woken up and spit out that apple, all by herself!its going to be me myself and i again and fuck those arrogant son of***** that think that when they say bend over i smile, no way bobby. after all that venting of bitterness i leave you for now my loves ..... not so much burned as scarred and undecided.... sigga dögg

      boy sees girl on the other side of townan ice princess with her very own crown he's too good to be taking such a chance 'cause she walks the streets without feelings,just some mind games to put him in a trance sigga i remember holding you just yesterdaybut you're memory is all that i have today i was hoping this is just a dream,but there's no ticket backi feel a cold wind blowing,our future looks blacknow i remember the times that have gone byand promises we once madei can’t figure out, why nothing stays the sameyou said we hit it off like a house on firebut then you decided to change your desiresthere must be someone else you sawsomeone you thought could give you something i couldn’tmaybe i should have done some of the things that i told myself i shouldn’t you said i am without a doubt one of you closest friendsthan why did what we’ve shared have to endthere isn't anything i wouldn't have done for youwe could have taken what was getting old and made it new you said this must be fate but something is telling me we just had our last date we even spent a night together, with my best friendthe next morning you apologized and said it would never happen again and that’s when it all began,i started to let my guard downi though i was the only boy for you in town. you told me i was your first pick,but than you turn around and make my stomach feel sickyou said you loved my brown eyes and the way i style my hairi should have known from the start, your intentions weren’t fairand whats this about you never telling me a lie?did all that crap about not feeling romantic and cuddly just pass you by?what was the real reason we didn’t kiss goodbye if i had another chance tonight i'd try to tell you that the things we had were righttime can't erase the feelings that we’ve sharedbut i hope it gives you time to realize just how much i cared. maybe time may find us in tomorrow looking for today…
