augusta's futureplanning, promoting, and implementing the tomorrow of downtown augusta, georgia



since 1982, augusta tomorrow has envisioned the city of augusta as a progressive urban area. the urban area master plans have resulted in the completion of many projects, such as: the riverwalk on the savannah levee, lafayette center redevelopment of the entire north side of the 900 block of broad street, the augusta riverfront project (marriott hotel, convention center, and riverfront center) and the augusta common – with much more to come.
