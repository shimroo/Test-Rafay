joe davis and david scherer provide an invitational approach for individuals and organizations seeking intercultural development. click here to bring them to your organization.



 

our valuesinvitational-we believe that people do not evolve through guilt or coercion. we take a developmental approach to our work to find the solution that is appropriate for where people are in their organization. we want to give people a better story rather than condemning the story in which they are living. we have found this to be a much more effective way to create authentic movement on the arc.intentional-we do not believe in doing this work haphazardly. organizations don’t approach other solutions with “throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks”. why would we do this when it comes to something as important as intercultural development and anti-racism? the solutions that we provide are strategic with evidence-based results to back them and evaluative measures to determine whether they are effective..intersectional-while we know that racism is one of the most pressing issues of our time, we also know that you cannot address this issue while neglecting other forms of oppression. we take a holistic approach to our work that takes into account issues of gender, class, religion, sexuality, and many more diversity dimensions. we believe that none of us are free until we all are free. our liberation is inextricably connected to our neighbor’s liberation. incarnational-this is a big word to affirm the fact that we believe that our bodies matter. the trauma that we have experienced as the result of intercultural conflict live deep in our bones. because the harm has happened to our bodies, we believe that the healing also needs to come through somatic (body-centered) practices. for this reason we utilize art and other embodied practices.justmovejoe davis and david scherer (justmove) are both artists and educators who bring 30+ years of experience between the two of them in facilitating intercultural bridge building and personal growth. they have worked with individuals and organizations across the country to "move the needle" toward cultural humility and awareness. they are both qualified administrators of the intercultural development inventory
