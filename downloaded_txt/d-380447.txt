                                    i heard this on ron bowes' show saturday night, and was blown away. you make the coolest music. a distinctive sound, and a cool vocal, not to mention the perfect guitar sound to fit your music.

new award for legacy artists and sotm february 2025!

    there has been an ongoing discussion about how to recognize and show a fair amount of acknowledgement to the many artists on mixposure who have been with the site for at least 10 years, and who are actively involved with the artists on the site. so now we have a brand new award. the mixposure hall of fame. i asked the other djs who they thought would be the best artist to recognize and immediately it was rich lodato.    
        
    song of the month for february 2025 is a brilliant collaboration from dave "mezzer" meredith and joseph rodriguez: angelangel  (ft joseph rodriguez)

december 2024 artist of the month is sean winthrop sotm from ian burrage! 

   about sean winthrop: " sean winthrop is a jazz composer, producer, multi-instrumentalist & recording artist. they say jazz was born in new orleans, but it grew up in kansas city. as a native of  kansas city, sean has been deeply influenced by its rich jazz history & culture. "kansas city by night" is his new album; a love letter to his home town, and is poised to be a landmark in an unusual career. difficult to pigeon-hole, his work ranges from cool & latin to new age jazz.  often topping the indie charts, sean's music has been heard in over 130 countries, and called "heartfelt, tasteful & as smooth as glass!"
