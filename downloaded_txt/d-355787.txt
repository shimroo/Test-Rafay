fini.





sorta.

so there we are, three bloggers under one new rooftop called adverve.

the new deal is called adverve, a merger of three very distinct blogging voices: darryl ohrt from brandflakes for breakfast, the always live + uncensored angela natividad, and myself.  are we tearing our blogs down to build the new adverve condo? not  exactly. they'll stay live as we spread the word and migrate our  audiences to our new home.

our voices won't change, and that's a  large part of why we decided to merge. three distinct povs sharing a  common vibe of advertising, design and all things net. in other words, a  little something for everybody. 

never the same perspective,  always full of surprises. what you always loved about any of us  individually, you can now get in one place. we may even jump in on  topics together. 

we're also changing the dynamic of the adverve  podcast. that means more free value for you. because it's all about you.  and on adverve, you'll always get three for the price of free.

adverve, forever.

darryl, angela + bill

our billy wants to change, too.


















“caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa, and from thence into beauty.”*

and you’re like, wtf? where was my thursday mtlb post???? easy people. it's not that i’ve been out staring at swords in c-stores or fish on overpasses, but the blogging workload after six plus years here (and in real life), is such that some major changes are underway for this here entity called mtlb. that’s also basically me teasing you ahead of your labor day plans with what’s next. stay tuned bitches, i got shit to do.

(image.) 

*c’mon people, did you really want me to go with a bowie cha-cha-cha-changes reference?

the hal 9000 - get one today!























the future of computing – today! cool look at the influence of the movie 2001 in advertising. (see that shit when you’re five, trust, you’ll need therapy for the chimp scene alone.)

because chicks dig a fanny pack.

















no, they do. i have three. (dukes of hazard, van halen and an a-team.) in this case though, tda does not share my view that the male fun bag is as effective for luring women as say, axe, so they created a safe-sex campaign for sir richard’s condoms (the tom’s shoes of condoms, available in whole foods and walgreens). the accompanying message states “this is a complimentary fanny pack. when worn as a fashion accessory by a man, it makes for excellent birth control. no man has ever been seduced while wearing a fanny pack in the history of the fanny pack. in the event you prefer your birth control to involve actual intercourse, may we suggest sir richard’s condoms.” sexy!

kubrick deconstructed.























the internet is a wild wonderous place, innit. from designer viktor hertz comes a different interpretation of stanley kubrick’s movies through posters (which appears to be part of a larger collection, some of which is nsfw.)
