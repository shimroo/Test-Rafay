    dependable equipment

our trucks are all late models and well maintained. operating equipment that is safe and dependable has been important to us for many years. this pays off in reduced road calls and accident claims. it is much less expensive to do preventative maintenance on a truck in our shop than to repair it alongside the highway with our customers’ undelivered load on it.
