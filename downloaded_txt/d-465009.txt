frequently asked questions 










do i need a medical consultation to order products?

we have prescription and non-prescription products in our store. the prescription products have an rx icon next to the product image which means you need a consultation before we can ship your order. non-prescription products do not require any consultation. you can order them just like you do from other online stores.







how does the medical consultation work?

if your shopping cart has any prescription product, we’ll ask you to provide some information about your symptoms, medical history and goals. we’ll then match you with a licensed provider from your state who will review your information and evaluate your treatment options before approval.in some cases, your provider might disapprove your order and prescribe an alternative product for you.  you can message your provider if you have any questions.







topical vs oral, which one should i choose?

we have products in both topical (solutions, creams and foams) and oral (tablets and capsules) forms. both are effective with acceptable side effect profiles. in general, a topical product is less likely to cause side effects than the oral counterpart, while the oral form has the advantage of convenience over the topical version.







do you have any satisfaction guarantee?

if for any reason you are not satisfied with your product, you can contact us for a refund within 6 months. shipping and handling costs are non-refundable. if you have multiple orders, only the most recent order is eligible for a refund. please read our terms and conditions for more details.
