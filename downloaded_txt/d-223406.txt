bad weather threats could not stop the seabury hall’s 39th annual craft fair
the seabury hall craft fair opened with the music from a parade led by the isle of maui pipe band. craft fair is a huge event that seabury hosts every year and pressure was on the organizers this year when the day of, may 11, was forecasted to rain. 

a cultural learning experience for all
another incredible showcase was performed by the whole school at this year’s he hāʻupu aloha, with the theme being ‘maui nō ka ʻoi: maui is the best.’ he hāʻupu aloha has been a yearly tradition at seabury hall where every grade level including the staff perform hulas and celebrate hawaiian culture, along with a few solo dances from other students. 

spartans cap their track season with state titles
the spartans swept the competition at the maui interscholastic league track and field championship on may 4, which led them to place top in hawai’i at the island movers track championships on oahu last week.
