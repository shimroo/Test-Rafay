            called dor-co for a quote on replacement of a broken coil spring on one of our garage doors and pro-active replacement of the same spring on the other door. the service technician (larry) showed up the next day (st clair township) and replaced both springs in an extremely efficient manner, then did an overall maintenance of the hardware on both doors. we were extremely pleased with the overall experience and how proficient and personable the technician was to interact with. highly recommended.
