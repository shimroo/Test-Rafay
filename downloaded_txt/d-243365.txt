the highway: a repository of historic christianity and the reformed faith








 








 











and a highway shall be there; 
                and a road, and it shall be called the highway of holiness. 
                the unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for 
                others. whoever walks the road, although a fool, shall 
                not go astray. 
(isaiah 35:8)
