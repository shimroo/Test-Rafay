supporting the cancer community




































































uicc provides learning and development opportunities for members. member organisations have privileged access to uicc events and voting rights as part of the general assembly.





































uicc fosters a learning culture across the cancer community, encourages collaboration and offers a range of knowledge sharing opportunities.





































uniting cancer professionals and policy makers in premier events like the world cancer congress and world cancer leaders’ summit is an essential part of uicc’s work. uicc also leads on the global world cancer day campaign. 













driving global impact
















political will and a national strategy that prioritises targeted investments in cancer control as well as action at the international level can reduce the global cancer burden. 
 targeted commitments












uicc has created several new organisations and initiatives to address long-term public health challenges and unmet needs.
 creating new initiatives












while uicc works on all aspects of cancer control covering all cancer types, the organisation pays special attention to a number of key thematic areas.
