customer reviews


we always love hearing from our customers. here are a few of our reviews!











shot show 2019 airgun news – final reportin this final hard air magazine shot show 2019 airgun news report, today’s new products may be last, but they’re definitely not least!
beeman precision airguns launched a large number of new products at the 2019 shot show. among them is a new pcp air rife, the model 1517. it’s shown in our heading photograph above, by ana guerra of beeman.
the model 1517 fills to 3,000 psi and has a 10-shot rotary magazine. beeman is claiming up to 100 shots per fill, although this is not a regulated air rifle, so expect some significant fps changes through those 100 shots. there’s also a model 1327 which has a 2,000 psi fill pressure and qb78-style trigger and stock. that’s pretty-well a repeater version of the existing beeman chief.

beeman qb78s air rifle test review .177 caliberthis beeman is our most traditional candidate for best plinking airgun. it’s a single-shot bolt action air rifle that shoots pellets and retails for somewhere around $90.
the qb78 has a cock-on-closing action that’s tops for safety. the standard open iron sights are pretty primitive, but it’s easy to add a scope or red dot sight.
this is the most powerful of our best plinkers. with a decent scope, the qb78 can be amazingly accurate out to 30 yards and beyond. it has a great reputation for accuracy!
