what's the difference between certificates and specializations?
a certificate offers in-depth study of a professional field through coursework that balances theory and practice, providing learners knowledge and expertise in less time than many traditional postgraduate degrees. a specialization is a short series of courses designed to help you quickly gain knowledge in a focused area of study and acquire in-demand skills sought by employers.
