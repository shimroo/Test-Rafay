    don’t ignore these 5 signs that you need brake repair

november 6, 2024

properly functioning brakes are crucial for your safety and the safety of others on the road. so if you notice a symptom of brake trouble, it’s important to address it asap. at engine house inc., we provide expert brake repair in the greater phoenix area. here’s a look at five signs that it’s time for brake repair.                                                                                        squeaking or squealing noises                                                      if you hear a high-pitched squeaking or squealing sound when you apply the brakes, it's a clear warning sign that your brake pads are worn out. most brake pads come with built-in wear indicators that produce a sound when they need replacement. ignoring this sound can lead to more significant damage, as worn-out pads can damage the rotors, leading to more costly repairs.                                                                                        grinding noises                                                      a grinding noise when you apply the brakes is a more serious issue than squeaking. this sound typically indicates that the brake pads have worn down completely, allowing the metal backing plate to make contact with the rotor. continuing to drive with grinding brakes can cause serious damage to your brake rotors, requiring a more expensive repair.                                                                                        vibrations when braking                                                      if you feel vibrations or a pulsing sensation in the brake pedal when you apply the brakes, it could indicate warped brake rotors. warped rotors can lead to uneven braking and decreased stopping power.                                                                                        soft or spongy brake pedal                                                      a soft or spongy brake pedal can indicate air in the brake lines or a leak in the brake fluid. when you press the brake pedal, it should feel firm and responsive. if it sinks to the floor or feels unusually soft, it's crucial to have your braking system inspected. delaying repairs can lead to brake failure, putting you and others at risk. with a brake fluid leak, you should get towed to the shop instead of driving there.                                                                                        warning lights on your dashboard                                                      most modern vehicles come equipped with a brake warning light on the dashboard. if this light illuminates, it can indicate a problem with the braking system such as low brake fluid or failing wheel speed sensors. if the warning light comes on, it’s essential to address it immediately and have your brakes checked by the mechanic.                                                                                        brake repair in phoenix, az                                                                   for                                              auto repair in phoenix                                               and the surrounding area, contact engine house inc. at                                                           ﻿                           602-265-2752                          ﻿                                              . our local mechanics can expertly handle your car’s repair and maintenance needs. feel free to give us a call to make an appointment!

 




   

    4 warning signs that you may need an engine rebuild


 by engine house inc.

october 2, 2024

when your engine starts to falter, it can signal deeper problems that may eventually require an engine rebuild. an engine rebuild can restore the power, efficiency, and reliability of your vehicle when normal repairs won't cut it. at engine haus inc., we provide expert engine rebuilding in the greater phoenix area. here are four signs that it might be time to consider an engine rebuild.                                                                                        excessive smoke from the exhaust                                                      if your car is producing more exhaust smoke than usual, it could be an indication of serious internal engine problems. the color of the smoke can give you a clue about what's wrong:                                                                   blue smoke points to burning oil, which could mean worn-out piston rings or valve seals.                                                           white smoke suggests a coolant leak, possibly caused by a blown head gasket or a cracked engine block.                                                                                                    loud knocking noises                                                      a knocking sound coming from the engine is never a good sign. engine knocking is commonly caused by issues with the combustion process. in many cases, it can indicate worn bearings. this could potentially lead to engine damage that may require a rebuild to fully resolve.                                                                                        loss of power                                                      a noticeable loss of engine power, especially during acceleration or while climbing hills, is often a sign of internal engine wear. as the miles add up, components like the pistons, rings, and valves can degrade, reducing the engine’s ability to compress air and fuel properly. if your car no longer delivers the power it once did, an engine rebuild may be the most effective way to restore its performance.                                                                                        high oil consumption                                                      if you're constantly needing to top off your oil between oil changes, it could indicate that your engine is burning oil internally. this is often caused by worn-out piston rings or valves. a rebuild is often the best way to address widespread internal wear and prevent further damage.                                                                                        engine rebuilding in phoenix, az                                                                   for                                              engine rebuilds in phoenix                                               and the surrounding area, contact engine house inc. at                                                           ﻿                           602-265-2752                          ﻿                                                           . with our                                              local auto machine shop                                  , we can expertly complete tasks such as engine rebuilding. feel free to give us a call to schedule an appointment!

  i recently had my 318 engine redone here. they did a great job restoring my old engine. they even included a complete gasket kit and new oil pump. i was even educated on proper break-in and what type of oil i should be running in my newly restored engine. i can't wait to get this baby running.

  had a great experience at the engine house. my engine started to knock so i started looking for an engine rebuilder. i found the engine house with an a+ rating at the bbb and being in business for over 40 years. so i went down and met terry, the owner. he gave me a tour of their facility. they have all the machine tools in house to rebuild engines. terry quoted me a fair price so i had my engine repaired there and they had it done within two weeks. runs great. highly recommend!

  my experience was great. took my car in after about 220k miles on it to get the engine rebuilt. terry and his crew were extremely friendly and i was helped right away instead of waiting for an hour or more like most places to get my car checked. price was the best one that was quoted and the quality of work was excellent.
