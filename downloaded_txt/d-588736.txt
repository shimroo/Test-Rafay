join us for a comedy mystery show where you become the detective and solve the crime!
sleuths mystery dinner shows over two-hour long experiences will keep you talking for years to come!
						you'll be treated to a hilarious 45 minute comedy mystery where all the clues are presented and you help solve the crime.
						enjoy a delicious dinner as you formulate insightful (and not so insightful) questions for the live interrogation.
						after dinner, each table gets to ask questions and uncover additional clues. itâs improvisational comedy that will have you in side-splitting laughter!
						your evening concludes with your choice of a yummy âmysteryâ dessert as you make your final guess as to who committed the crime.
						then, watch as our detective unveils the actual criminal and then awards fun prizes to those of you who were successful sleuths!

this is a modal.
reveal makes these very easy to summon and dismiss. the close button is simply an anchor with a unicode character icon and a class of close-reveal-modal. clicking anywhere outside the modal will also dismiss it.
finally, if your modal summons another reveal modal, the plugin will handle that for you gracefully.
