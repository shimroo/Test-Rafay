“community action partnership orange county is a proud supporter of the anaheim chamber of commerce. as a strategic partner, we look to forward to creating opportunities for economic development and community empowerment while stimulating job growth and enhancing the overall well-being of the anaheim community.” ~lisa dulyea 

 “being a member of the anaheim chamber of commerce over the years has been a game changer for our business. no organization knows the anaheim business community and our needs better than the chamber. they support and sponsor many opportunities to volunteer and engage with the anaheim community all year long. these opportunities create ways for us to build strong relationships and partnerships that help our business grow. the chamber has lifted us up and guided us when needed. the pandemic was tough, but because of chambers like anaheim, we had the assistance we needed to thrive. anaheim lighthouse is a proud member and deeply grateful for all the chamber does.” ~tamara jimenez 

“the chamber has been instrumental with dsm-firmenich anaheim plant in multiple ways. we effectively partnered with the chamber as we examined opportunities to make a positive impact on the community during the covid 19 pandemic. the chamber was able to provide us with outlets for sanitizer as our company saw a need that we could fill. the chamber has partnered with us to find partnerships where we could provide other support for non-profits. we have used the chamber to develop opportunities to demonstrate what we do and provide visibility to site expansions. furthermore, the chamber has helped us expand our reach as we create more jobs for the community. when our plant is brainstorming how we can impact our community, or how the community can help us, our first call is to the chamber.” ~michael moreno 

“freedom plumbing is grateful for the many opportunities this chamber offers. it’s been rewarding to be involved in contributing to worthwhile projects.” ~shaun dymek 

 “there are many benefits to being a member of the anaheim chamber of commerce. networking and community service have been a huge benefit thru which we have developed relationships with new clients, the business community, and city officials. being an ambassador for the chamber is the icing on the cake where deeper relationships are developed and there are more opportunities for community involvement!” ~katie henry 

 "being members of the anaheim chamber has been beneficial to both the company and personally. chamber staff is helpful and friendly when needing information, direction and advice on business inquiries. as an ambassador for the chamber, getting to represent both reborn and the program, as well as meeting great people in the community is a plus!"~diana ramirez
