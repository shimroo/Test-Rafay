“it took me over 20 years to earn an associate degree — it’s never too late (even
                                    if it takes a few decades)!  school is hard to fit into everyday life when running
                                    a business and raising a family. the funny thing is that if i were given an opportunity
                                    to live my life all over again, i wouldn’t change a thing except that after high school
                                    graduation, i would stay in midland and attend midland college.” — reagan hignojosfollow in reagan's footsteps, and reimagine your future at midland college. enroll today!
