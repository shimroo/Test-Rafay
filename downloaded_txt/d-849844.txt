this is how you can measure your pool

place your pool in an imaginary box or rectangle, then using a measuring tape, measure from inside coping edge (waters edge) to coping edge (waters edge) for maximum length and width. please do not add on any more than required, as this will only increase the price for your cover. for free advice, please call our sales team at your nearest branch.

we have a proud history with the first safety net having been designed and fitted in zimbabwe in 1972. since then, the aqua-net has become synonymous with child safety in south africa and is trusted by parents and pool owners for its 100% safety track record
