donde esta el bano, aqui!





so petty and stupid, you'd think his brother must have filled it out.


jeb bush identified himself as hispanic on a 2009 voter-registration form
 in florida, according to a copy of the document obtained by the new york times. needless to say, neither bush nor his parents are hispanic.

this is becoming a low-rent 'house of cards'  (lean-to of post-it notes?)





disturbingly weird.

"i'm not anti-gay...i just do not like homosexuals (pronounced ho-mo-sez-jew-all"

ever since plato's retreat closed, he's lost that "lovin' feeling" that even a mustache ride cannot recover...





like the drunk asshole who has to cover the righteous brothers during karoke, john bolton only knows one terrible song, and insists on performing it terribly...and constantly.

still hope...





the eugene jarecki will some day have a chance to do a six-part documentary on dick cheney called "the shooter" wherein cheney confesses to war crimes while replacing parts in his pacemaker.

but...





did anyone ask him about a grinder account?


he's been a u.s. senator for 12 years, and was a congressman for eight 
more before that, but south carolina republican lindsey graham says he 
has never sent an email.

and yes, you are right, that type of joke deservedly died about 2010.

not a great source





other than inspiring congressional investigations for at least the years 2013-2017, i don't really care much about hillary clinton's gmail account (unless it was hotmail, then at least it would be funny).

but it is disturbing that the man who has spent the last decade defending the worst dictators on earth is the source for her defense.
