pleased to announce the signing of renowned british boy band blue to a worldwide deal.

excited to release the group’s seventh studio album, which will be released in 2025, 25 years after blue first formed. 

“after our two no.1 albums this year with shed seven, the opportunity to sign blue, who also had two no.1 albums in 2002, was something to get excited about, and when you look at their history, recent touring, audience size and not to mention some great new songs, they tick all of the right boxes,” said rob collins, md of cooking vinyl.

in a joint statement, blue said: “we are so excited to be working with cooking vinyl for our 25th anniversary. rob and the team are full of great ideas and we can’t wait to start working with them. there will be something old, something new, nothing borrowed but all things blue!”. 

the group are one of only 20 artists (including our very own shed seven) to ever have two separate no.1 albums in 12 months in the uk charts.
