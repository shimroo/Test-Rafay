 work in arcade entrance and stairwell corridorthe corridor linking the arcade entrance to the building with the sacristy entrance to the church is badly in need of refurbishment and a lick of paint. work has now begun and will last about four weeks. during this time, the arcade entrance to the building will be out of use and the public toilets inaccessible. with regards to the facilities, these are available at 114 mount street. in terms of entering the church, please use the mount street gardens entrance or the farm street entrance during this period. please note that the gardens shut at 5pm, so you will need to use the farm street entrance after this time.
