journeythe journey of wia to becoming an international airport is one characterized by a story of passion, fate and resilience. it was not an outright commitment to succeed in the airline industry. in fact the early adopters would probably argue otherwise if they found today how the airport has grown, serving airliners which fly to almost all the corners of the globe. this is because it seems obvious their desire was for the airport to serve the elite residents of wilmington, if the history of this airport is anything to go by.now with the availability of longer runways, a state-of-the-art terminal complex, specialized aviation staff, and customs and immigration facilities, the time was ripe for the airport now to become international. in 1988, it became the new hanover international airport in readiness to welcome planes - and their occupants - from far and wide, and a year later, the airport was handed over to the independent airport authority to oversee its operations.   recommendations!see and understand why it pays to be a wilmingtoner! we have exclusive offers from several unique providers. take a look below on what they have to say :)
