press conference with martin garbus
renowned lawyer martin garbus, called "legendary, one of the best trial lawyers in the country" by time magazine, has joined the team of lawyers appealing the convictions of the cuban five. in early june garbus and supreme court specialist thomas goldstein, together with long-time cuban five lawyer richard klugh, filed a motion in u.s. southern district court, seeking an evidentiary hearing and the right to discovery on behalf of gerardo hernã¡ndez, in his habeas corpus appeal. this motion relates specifically to the issue of u.s. government payments to members of the miami media during the trial of the five, journalists whose coverage helped to add to the already poisonous atmosphere in miami against the five.

extradite cia assassin luis posada carriles
wanted for terrorism in venezuela, cuba, and central america;
            living in miami, protected by the u.s. government 
 luis posada carriles is the most notorious of the many miami-based terrorists who the cuban five were monitoring and preventing from carrying out further acts of terrorism against the people of cuba and others around the world. his most notorious crime was masterminding the mid-air explosion of cubana flight 455 in 1976, killing all 73 people on board. he is wanted in venezuela on 73 counts of murder, and the u.s. government has been studiously ignoring the venezuelan government's extradition request.
