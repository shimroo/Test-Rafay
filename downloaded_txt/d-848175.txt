jess skinner was our agent for the purchase of our home in rapid city. she was responsive, honest, and had a positive attitude. things got a little complicated as we approached closing but we knew that jess had our best interest in mind and it all came together just fine. i would 100% recommend jess.

so blessed that jessica was introduced to us by our daughter. we could not have  chosen a more knowledgable and dedicated agent. she worked many hours to make our home buying experience as easy as possible. it was a complicated procedure full of issues on an older property.  we would definitley use her again and highly recommend her to others. on a scale of 1 to 10 we give her an 11.

jess was phenomenal! always answering our questions, and/or responding to anything, right away.she was very knowledgeable and understanding. and if she didn't know, she would happily find out the answer.she gave no pressure to look at houses we weren't interested in/were missing details we needed.jess was fun, pleasant, and extremely helpful.
