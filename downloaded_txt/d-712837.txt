what we do?scripturally based approachjesus spent much of his ministry teaching spiritual warfare and the demonic realm. considering his public ministry, he spent most of his time preaching, healing, and delivering people. accounts of jesus ministering deliverance are plentiful:
● mark 1:23-28 jesus cast a demon out of a man in a synagogue
● luke 13 – jesus casts the spirit of infirmity out of a woman
● matthew 8:16
● matthew 8:28-34 – gadarene demoniacs
● mark 1:23-34
● and more
we can see that he trained the disciples to do ministry, gave them the authority to heal and cast out demons (matthew 10:1, matthew 10:7-8,) and sent them out. after jesus’ death, resurrection, and ascension, we also see the early church ministering deliverance.
authority in jesus nameit is interesting that we have no record of jesus’ instructions to his disciples on how to cast out demons, with the possible exceptions of matthew 12:43–45 and 17:19–21, where some insight is given. when the disciples discovered that demons were subject to them in the name and authority of jesus, they were joyful (luke 10:17; cf. acts 5:16; 8:7; 16:18; 19:12). but jesus told the disciples, “do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven” (luke 10:20).
spiritual warfarethe emphasis in spiritual warfare is highlighted in verses such as 1 john 4:4, “you, dear children, are from god and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world [the devil].” the victory is ours because of the holy spirit who dwells within us. believers can overcome their struggles with the past, habits, and addictions, because “everyone born of god overcomes the world” (1 john 5:4). we need prayer, godly counsel, and the support of a good church, but not necessarily a “deliverance minister.”
an issue seen in the biblethat is, when people are delivered from spirits, the spirits come out of them. that means the spirit must first have been in them! look at the following scriptures: matt 12:43, mark 1:26, mark 5:8. the spirit comes out. demons exist outside of us, but they seek to enter to accomplish their mission most effectively: to kill, steal, and destroy. after jesus’ resurrection, he gave the church its marching orders in mark 16:15-19. jesus commanded his followers to preach the good news, heal people, and drive out demons. the mandate is unambiguous. we believe that the ministry of deliverance is for the church today and did not end with christ’s death. to lay the foundation for understanding the dynamics of deliverance ministry, we must first explain the basic makeup of man, god’s great love! we are uniquely and wonderfully made. however, there are different components to our being. we need to clarify the terminology before we proceed.
nature of the demonic realmdemonic spirits are created beings; one-third were cast out of heaven with lucifer when he rebelled against god (rev 12:3-9). they have minds, wills, and emotions (they get tired), they can communicate with one another, and some are more wicked than others (matt 12:43-45). not all demons are in hell but are active in the world today, seeking to kill, steal, and destroy (john 10:10). they try to enter into people because they can better carry out their mission. demons can put thoughts in people’s minds but cannot read minds. this conclusion is an experiential insight, and we understand that some believe that demons can read our minds, but we do not believe that to be the case. there is a hierarchy in the demonic realm, just as in the angelic realm. there are wicked princes over areas/countries (daniel 10:13). still, the focus of deliverance ministry is in this first heaven environment where we live.
