orel r.“i stayed for two weeks as a single traveler, while working remotely. had everything i needed and felt at home. thanks madi & jonah, you guys rock.”



jennifer m.“this is a great place to stay whether you're a thru hiker or in town for a day. everything is pretty much self serve which is nice. the owners communicate well and can answer all your questions.”



ian m.“so far, i have said, ‘bury me at the fireside inn’ several times and i don’t plan on stopping anytime soon because it is simply wonderful!”



allison w.“a great place to stay! the owners were accommodating and easily accessible. other guests were respectful. being a solo female guest i felt safe!”
