our strategic plan



















national new play network is the premiere service organization for american theaters that believe in new work.

 

as an alliance of professional theaters, our members collaborate in innovative ways to  develop, produce, and extend the life of new plays.














upcoming rolling world premieresnnpn’s flagship initiative, the rolling world premiere (rwp) program, is shifting the new play paradigm of the one-and-done premiere to a diversified, traveling, multi-production premiere. the rwp program models a process for developing and producing new plays – one that results in stronger work overall and the momentum needed for a play to join the repertoire of frequently produced new american works.
