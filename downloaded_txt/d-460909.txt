welcome to the north american reptile breeders conference



welcome to the home of the north american reptile breeders conference & trade shows. the shows are organized by bob ashley of eco publishing and brian potter of chicago reptile house. the shows take place six times per year in four cities: tinley park illinois, dallas texas, st. charles missouri, and schaumburg illinois.
the shows are one of the best places for the general public and breeders alike to come out and meet many of the world's top reptile breeders face to face. every year the breeders bring out their top projects and showcase them at the narbc shows.
the narbc shows were started in 2001 with a mission of classing up the typical reptile show experience and providing vendors with a show management team that sees the relationship as a partnership between narbc and each individual vendor.  without great vendors a show is nothing!  narbc has been able to partner with some of the worlds truly top breeders as well as some of those just starting out in the hobby hoping to make their mark on the industry.  as you walk the aisles at an narbc show you will see years and sometimes an entire lifetime of hard work put in by the vendors to produce beautiful, healthy and thriving captive born reptiles.  the amount of money and time put into the animals is truly inspiring.  enjoy your time walking the aisles and speaking with the vendors and see what the narbc difference really is!  we hope you leave the show with a new pet or at least an appreciation for what the breeders do and a respect for the animals themselves.  and please take a moment to stop by the most important booth at every show...the usark booth.  without them not only would we not have these shows but your pet reptiles would already be considered illegal in most areas of the country.  get educated on why that is at the usark booth!
