skin tears


i primarily associate skin tears in the american standard chinese shar-pei with the prominent skin folds, “meat mouth” muzzle and thicker skin with bullae (blisters/vesicles). the skin often resembles the texture of an orange peel. this is known as hereditary cutaneous mucinosis (hyaluronosis). this condition results in high levels of hyaluronan in the dermis and epidermis of the skin. the excess hyaluronan disrupts the organization of collagen fibers in the dermis which are responsible for the strength and support of the skin much as iron rebar or steel mesh is used to strengthen concrete driveways and patios. lastly, the excess...

announcing a genetic test for shar-pei autoinflammatory disease (spaid)


a validated genetic test is now available to measure the copy number variant (cnv) linked to shar-pei autoinflammatory disease (spaid), reveals an international collaboration lead by scientists and veterinarians at uppsala, sweden and wurtsboro, new york, usa. details were published in the april 23 edition of the open-access journal bmc genomics. http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2619-0 this work represents the third step in the group’s ongoing research into the relationship between the shar-pei dog breed’s unique skin appearance and a complex hereditary syndrome, spaid. in 2011, the team first reported the existence of a duplicated segment of dna upstream of the gene hyaluronan synthase...

symmetric dimethylarginine (sdma)


sdma symmetric dimethylarginine is a new renal biomarker which can detect kidney disease when approximately 40% function has been compromised. sdma is released into the circulation during protein degradation. because it is almost exclusively eliminated via renal filtration it is a good estimate of gfr. sdma is specific for kidney function. it is not impacted by extrarenal factors like bun and creatinine. sdma is an early indicator of kidney disease – it is not increased in animals with other various diseases. it is not dependent on the dog’s lean muscle mass. sdma should be evaluated with other kidney tests such as bun, creatinine, urinalysis,...

“3l” disease in chinese shar-pei


shar-pei are the only breed i associate with this condition and it is often confused with swollen hock syndrome which occurs in conjunction with familial shar-pei fever (fsf). 3l disease is unilateral or bi-lateral non-painful swelling of the ankle joint in the absence of a fever. in the past this swelling has been termed “socks”. i believe there are two main causes behind this condition, both centering on hyaluronan production in the tarsus and/or metatarsus (the anatomical region below the stifle or knee and above the rear foot). i believe three mechanisms are involved (1) increased production of lmw- ha,...

training the chinese shar-pei – updated 2015


the chinese shar pei is a hearty breed. they are often described as stubborn, headstrong, and difficult to train. the truth is, they are great companions and can be quite fun to train to a very high level! however, they do not typically respond well to aversive training methods, which rely on physical corrections to attempt to teach the dog what to avoid. so their ‘difficult-to-train’ reputation may have originated from trainers attempting to use force, which was not inherently motivating. luckily, modern training techniques[1] strive to enhance our relationships with our dogs, and shar pei respond quite well to...

spaid – shar-pei autoinflammatory disorder


spaid is a term to describe the spectrum of clinical signs due to systemic and persistent inflammation in chinese shar-pei.  all the signs in spaid are autoinflammatory in nature and are related elevated levels of hyaluronan, a molecule which functions as a danger signal (a damp) that triggers the inflammatory response.  spaid resembles human aid (autoinflammatory disease) that also presents with multiple inflammatory signs.  many shar-pei with spaid also receive relief from disease by the use of il-1β inhibitors which suggests a cytokine-driven inflammation and a dysregulation of the innate immune response.  spaid definitely is linked to increased levels of...

the answer!


  an important paper published march 17, 2011 in the journal plos genetics has given important new information concerning the relationship between hyaluronan (as present in the folds and wrinkles of the chinese shar-pei), fsf and amyloidosis. the link to the article “a novel unstable duplication upstream of the has2 predisposes to a breed-defining skin phenotype and a periodic fever syndrome in chinese shar-pei dogs” is at http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001332 . an international research group at uppsala university, sweden and the broad institute of mit and harvard including linda tintle, dvm of wurtsboro, new york has uncovered a copy number variant mutation...

lens luxation study at the university of missouri.


primary lens luxation is an eye problem which is hereditary on the chinese shar-pei. the lens is held in place in the eye by fibers called zonules. if these fibers are weak, not located properly around the circumference of the lens capsule, or break, the lens can fall out of its normal position or “luxate”. the lens typically moves forward against the iris blocking the pupil and interfering with movement of aqueous fluid into the drainage angle which is located around the base of the iris. this can result in an increase in intraocular pressure known as secondary glaucoma which...

holiday hazards


are you ready for the holidays? with the holidays approaching rapidly, there are a few questions that always seem to pop up regarding pets. there is, of course the question of whether or not to get a pet for christmas, or give one for that matter. there are the safety concerns for the pets we already have, and love dearly. do we give our furry family members gifts (and if so, what)? then, there are the good manners we always have to hear about from our relatives, which of course our pets do not possess when the relatives are around....

nail trimming


equipment needed: nail trimmers and kwik-stop® dog’s nails or claws are meant to be long. in wild canids they are used as tools for digging, ripping, gripping and fighting. in the domesticated dog these functions are no longer useful and long nails lead to problems such as damaging the home environment, causing injury to people, broken nails resulting in bleeding and trouble walking on hard surfaces. when a dog’s nails become too long they interfere with the dog’s gait and as the nails continue to grow, walking will become awkward and painful. in severe cases a dog’s nails can curl...
