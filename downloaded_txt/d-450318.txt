r' gershon dubin asked:> anyone have an idea what the me'ein hachasima is for ma'ariv aravim?r' micha berger answered:> "ma'avir yom umeivi laylah, umavdil..."i imagine that the problem bothering rgd is probably the "extra" sentence("keil chai ve-kayam...") between that and the chasimah. i seem torecall that the chabad nusach (maybe others, too; i don't know offhand)omits this sentence, presumably due to this concern.iirc, there was a similar machlokes ha-ge'onim regarding the sentenceof "or chadash..." in the morning berakhah of "yotzeir ha-me'oros."i think that r' sa`adyah ga'on omitted it, not just because of "me-`einha-chasimah samukh la-chasimah" concerns (which the rest of his siddursuggests that he did not interpret as strictly as we do), but becauseit doesn't fit with the theme of the berakhah at all.i wonder if there's a reason that these 2 parallel berakhos both have an"extra" sentence after what would have been a more natural conclusion,and both of those extra sentences serve to look toward the future. -d.c.

from: "kohn, shalom" <skohn@sidley.com>> i had understood tzimtzum as a simple metaphor for the following > problem --> hashem's presence "fills the world," so how could there be room for> anything else? two objects cannot be in the same space at the same time.i had been trying not to comment on this thread, but the chance of disagreeing with both rygb and rsc in one post is too good to pass up.  here are two options:1. in the beginning of h. yesodei hatorah the rambam describes god asnecessarily existing, while everything else exists only contingently.for example, if hizkiyahu had become mashiah god would still be the same,but where would the subscribers of avodah be?now, the rambam explains there that god not only generated the world,he also sustains the world. how he sustains the world depends on whatthe world is like (this is arguable; see ibn ezra's introduction tosefer kohelleth for someone who disagrees, and klah pithhei hachmah#86 for someone who agrees). one possible view of tsimtsum is that itrepresents the abandonment of other possible ways the world could work -- at the level of laws of nature and laws of hashgaha, not at the levelof historical phenomena.2. rabbi dessler has an essay on what he calls "fields of choice".he says that there are some crimes so beneath one that one doesn't evenchoose not to do them, and some acts so above one that one doesn'tchoose to do them. he argues that the basic work of mussar is toraise one's field. arguably the "location" of one's field is closelyrelated to one's consciousness of god (see the rambam's discussion ofhashgaha and nevuah in part ii of the moreh nevuhim, and see mn i:1).someone who is acutely aware of god would find it very hard to sin.another possible view of tsimtsum is that it represents god playing hideand seek in order to insure that we have free will.i remember once explaining to a baptist friend that he didn't reallybelieve that "every word in the bible is literally true". i gave hima few examples, my favorite being "the children of israel encamped ongod's mouth (al pi hashem yahanu bnei yisrael)". he finally admittedthat he didn't mean "literally true" literally.analogously when kabbalists say "tzimtzum kipshuto" they don't meanit literally. one plausible distinction is that option #1 above is"kipshuto" because it describes things as they are, and option #2 is not"kipshuto" because it describes our perception of things.incidentally, one of my rebbeim every so often would say "tzarichlrakez, ki bidvarim kaeleh assur lit'ot." i never quizzed him about whatprecisely the issur is, but there is a middle ground between permissiblediscussion of incorrect views and kefirah. my own bottom line is that(at the very least) what can be translated into philosophy is permissible,but i have no source for that.david riceman

(2) the figure is probably off by even morethan that, if they were unaware of the time difference between baveland greece; granted that there were no standard "time zones" back then,but regardless, it still takes some time for the sun to get from bavelto greece.but when i did the calculations, i realized how insignificant this timeis when averaged out over 4267 lunations. it turns out that hipparchushad an acceptable range of error of almost four hours!!! any figure from3024167.11 hours to 3024171.06 hours, when divided by 4267 lunations androunded to the nearest chelek, will yield the famous figure of 29.5 daysand 793 chalakim.again, i thank rjo for setting me straight. i had no idea that theancients' records were so accurate, and over such a long period of time.summary: i had been among those who found it difficult to imagine thatchazal's duration of the lunar month could have be obtained by anymeans other than revelation. we now see that it was not only *possible*for the scientists of their day to come up with that figure, but thatscientists even more ancient did come up with that figure.akiva miller

there should only be a few iterations of this thread.  however.1) rzl insistst that the phrase mamon li means that this is tzedakamoney from the rambam's brother to the rambam, and not money that therambam's brother earned as the rambam's agent.rzl also cited (while trying to prove a different point) that the rambamhimself (pirke avot) uses the grammatical construct lahem to referto the profits generated by a businessman agent for a talmid chacham -showing that linguistically, this is how the rambam himself used it,so i am somewhat confused by rzl's confidence that this grammaticalstructure has to refer to charity.2) rzl misunderstands the basis of the rambam's objection to studydependent on charity. while part of it is "sofo melastem et haberiyot",he views the entire notion of such study as hillul hashem, bizayon hatora,and kibuy or hadat. it is the statement of the individual that historah study is of such importance that other people should support it.given this, it is irrelevant where the source of funding arises -if it is not self generated. therefore, the rambam is very careful todelineate specific exclusions - that certain types of support are viewedas acceptable, because they are not direct financial support, but morereflect the type of favors that businessmen would grant each other.therefore, given that very careful delineation, the fact that therambam does not list support by family (and i think it is quite clearthat among those who believe in supporting torah study, supporting arelative talmid chacham was quite common)- is convincing proof that hedoes not view such support as permissible.3) wrt to the case the rambam brings down:the case the rambam brings down is clearly distribution in a timeof drought. there, even though there was a food shortage, there wasa talmid chacham who refused food distribution because it was limitedto talmide chachamim. (the rambam also brings down another case wherea talmid chacham's life was in danger, and he tried hard to save itwithout having to use the fact that he was a talmid chacham).one can legitimately argue that refusing food in this situation is amidat chassidut. however, to argue from this that it was acceptableto distribute charity to talmide chachamim, and to accept it - seems adeliberate distortion of the text, necessitated by the desired conclusion(which is why i said it was a weak argument, and the kesef mishne knewit was weak). the text is explicit that the food distribution was onlyin times of batzoret. we know talmide chachamim were not necessarilywell off in general, but the food distribution was only made in times ofbatzoret - proving that it was only the issue of batzoret that allowedthis to happen.meir shinnar

	 tzimtzum kepeshuto
	 
    


i am less than a novice on kabbalah, and certainly do not understand thedetails of the debate about tzimtzum. so, this is a question for thoselearned in the area.i had understood tzimtzum as a simple metaphor for the following problem --hashem's presence "fills the world," so how could there be room foranything else? two objects cannot be in the same space at the same time.so, tzimtzum expresses the idea that hashem has retracted himself --leaving to one side whether the remaining presence of hashem is inanother dimension, or in the subatomic interstices, or what have you --so as to give a place for the world and for human action. in other words,tzimtzum expresses only the concept that hashem has granted space forother things to function and exist. beyond that, details of tzimtzuminvolve describing the essence of hashem (e.g., what was before and whatwas after the tzimtzum process), which is indescribable.perhaps one of the experts debating these issues can explain the conceptsand areas of debate in more detail in light of the above.shalom l. kohn

once rmshulman raised the subject, i too thought about the propriety ofcontinuing this discussion. i'm allowing it on list because there is atleast one chaveir who i would use as a poseiq who already contributed.otoh, ryzirkind is showing incredible self control by notably notcommenting on the subject.for my own comfort, i will keep my posts to discussing material alreadyon the web. at least my misunderstandings won't add to the total qabbalahbeing mis-learned. of course that gives me pretty close to open season...on mon, jun 05, 2006 at 01:15:12pm -0500, kohn, shalom wrote:: i had understood tzimtzum as a simple metaphor for the following problem --: hashem's presence "fills the world," so how could there be room for: anything else? two objects cannot be in the same space at the same time.it's a huge mistake to view tzimtzum as having to do with occupyingphysical space. the question isn't about melo khol ha'aretz kevodo,because tzimtzum was a necessariy step in order for there to be an aretz.space itself is a nivra. tzimtzum is the constriction of potential sothat anything other than him, including space, can exist.i once was given the mashal of tzimtzum being like a slide. (rememberslide shows?) by blocking parts of the light, a slide can make a pictureon the wall. nimshal: the light is hashem's shefa, the slide is tzimtzum,selectively blocking that shefa, and the picture on the wall is you,me, the galaxy, space, time, and every other nivra. iow, creation isthrough the removal of the potential for things and attributeshashemdoes not want to exist.and so, if everything could exist nothing would exist, and thus the yeishof the universe is from the ayin of the ein sof. thus bringing us to lacosmism.the l rebbe adds two axis to this:+ tzimtzum could be taken (1) literally (2) or figuratively; and+ it could be taken as referring to (a) atzmuso or to (b) his or.in rygb's lexicomn "tzimtzum kipeshuto" is (1a) the literal tzimtzumof atzmus, and he cites reed that this is heretical. however, he doesn'tattribute this kefirah to any baalei mesorah. quite lehefech: rygbis using what he considers blatant kefirah as a means of ruling outpossible [mis]understandings of various peshatim.i raise this because i want to point out that despite the languageused in numerous replies, reed obviously isn't claiming that someone,e.g. the leshem, is a kofeir, but that peshat in the leshem is notthat of literal tzimtzum of atzmus (1a), because it's kefirah.it seems clear that numerous misnagdim of the alter rebbe's era held of(1) literal tzimtzum. it is far less clear whether they were speaking of(a) atzmus or (b) or. the l rebbe asserts that they did hold of (1a)literal tzimtzum of atzmus. and that's what one finds described asthe misnagdic position in numerous l web sites. because of the above,rygb asserts thay they're mistaken, confusing misnagdic belief in (1b)literal tzimtzum of or with kefirah (1a).the question boils down to whose description of late 18th and early 19thcent ce misnagdic thought tdo you believe, the lr or reed's?i have my own perplexities with the issue, which were reflected in myopening comment about it seeming like the tanya uses the sun and the beamthat comes from it interchangably in relation to the light on the wall(us). i obviously misunderstood, will work out how off-list.second, if you say that tzimtzum is (b) of his or, then doesn't thatmean that all of creation really is of his atzmus, since that was notmetzamtzeim? in a manner even beyond figurative tzimtzum.because of this 2nd issue, i could see less of a problem with "atzmusoumahuso melubash beguf" than if it were referring to or.-mi-- micha berger             it's nice to be smart,micha@aishdas.org        but it's smarter to be nice.http://www.aishdas.org                   - r' lazer brodyfax: (270) 514-1507

after some time,rbb regained his composure and with a big smile, stated as follows;when hashem was creating human beings, he created various levels ofperfection. when he decided to create the highest level, my rebbi r'chaim was born. however, in order to make it clear to people that hewas not an angel, he gave him a slight chisaron...he has difficultywith the chush haniggun...otoh, i am so full of chisronos that hashem,in his mercy, bestowed me with one ma'ala; the chush haniggun....i feel a similar shock to rde's words as rbb felt to his conversant'sremarks. saying that r' dessler did not carry much weight in the world ofkabala shows a marked lack of awareness as to how profound rav desslerreally was. first of all, rde's contention is simply not true. ravdessler had much massah u'mattan with the sefardi mekubalim in eretzyisrael who respected him inestimably. but even if this was not true,rav dessler lived in the olam hayeshivos. obviously his influence wasprimarily limited to that world. to imply that his shittos in kabalacan in any way be marginalized as a result is pure folly. furthermore,the fact that the lr rejected his approach to tzimtzum has nothingto do with his standing in the chassidishe velt. rav dessler learnedchassidus extensively, was admired by the greatest chassidim such as r'itchele masmid, and is currently admired by chassidim who are aware oflitvishe gedolim who crossed the line into chassidus. i don't mean tobe disrespectful to rde whom i hold in high regard, but i believe hisabove comment was entirely uncalled for.simcha coffer

	 teaching midrashim literally
	 
    


at the suggestion of an areivim moderator i am sending this to avodah.the jewish press [full article at <http://tinyurl.com/lctnp> -mi]shortchanging our children by teaching midrashim literallyby: rabbi  pinchas rosenthal"(quoted from a message from ms toby katz posted on areivim.)for a detailed critique of this article seehttp://parsha.blogspot.com/2006/05/dangers-of-midrashim-fisking_22.htmlalso, how does all of this square with the following? from the musar movement by rabbi dov katz (english translation) footnote, pages 301-302.    "2. see s. mark, op. cit., pp. 88­90. the author also relates that    prof. hermann helmholtz, the famous philosopher and scientist, evinced    an interest in meeting r. israel, and an animated conversation took    place between the two of them. helmholtz seized the opportunity to    express his surprise that the talmud, which is built on such solid    and logical foundations should have given space to such legends which    sound like fanatical and outlandish fantasies, such as the stories    of rabbah bar bar chana, which tell of a bird standing in the sea,    with the water reaching up to its feet, and its head to heaven (baba    batra 73b). r. israel answered by using an analogy: they were living    in 1871, after germany had won its great victory over france. the    king of prussia had been crowned kaiser of all germany. his emblem    was an eagle. previously it had been one-headed; now it had become    two-headed. hundreds of poets and authors had celebrated the event    in diverse forms. he himself had read a poem in which the author    had given a description of the glory of modern germany in these    terms: the great german eagle had one head reaching out to memel    and the other to metz; its one wing tip touched kiel and the other    badensee. they knew the reference.    the poet had described how far german territory now extended in all    four directions. now, the professor could imagine to himself that    600 years hence ­ when no one would remember how germany had been    fragmentized in principalities and the metaphoric description of the    rise of the monarchy ­ someone would find a story of a two-headed    eagle with wings extending some 300 miles in some library. would he    not express the same opinion as the professor had on the stories of    rabbah bar bar chana?    obviously, just as they understood the import of the two-headed    eagle, so did the people of those times understand the implications    of those stories, which were certainly richer in content than the    mere description of an eagle. it was because the present was so far    removed from that epoch that the description seemed so absurd to    them. similar approaches had to be adopted towards the other aggadot    of the talmud as well. the reply is characteristic for r. israel,    and shows his rationalistic bent.">btw, i heard a similar story recently about rav yitzchok blazer. the last>czar of russia liked to issue edicts that disrupted the lives of people. once>he signed an edict evicting all of the people from a certain district.>everybody was forced to leave the area with very short notice.>  at this time some maskilim asked reb itzele how anyone could believe in>fantastic midrashim. reb itzele picked up a newspaper that had the headline>"czar caused 10,000 to move with 5 drops of ink." reb itzele said that we>know what this means. that by signing the edict the czar caused 10,000>people to leave their homes. however, in future generations people who read>the headline will wonder how anyone could believe that with 5 drops of ink>the czar caused such an upheaval. "the same is true of medrashim," said reb>itzele. they have a meaning that was known at the time that they were>written down. however, today we no longer know their meaning, and they are not>to be taken literally.yitzchok levine
