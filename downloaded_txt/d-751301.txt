robin hood in greyhawkadding robin hood to greyhawk is easy.  although it can be considered a heresy.  the group has to be added where there is a forest.  and probably while a crusade is going on.  it's also a good idea to pick up either gurps classic robin hood from warehouse 23, or the campaign classics: robin hood for rolemaster and fantasy hero.  the last is available second hand on ebay.  you might also find howard pyle's work on robin hood a good read.  if you want to delve deeper, there is a bibliography at the back of gurps classic robin hood that provides you a good starting point.the following nations are good for adding robin hood.furyondy -- the nation of furyondy currently (as of 591 cy) started a crusade against the empire of iuz.  belvor iv could be like king richard i of england.  unlike the crusades of our world (they are complicated in history), furyondy's crusade against iuz is a moral crusade against a real evil. the prince john character could be a brother or baron looking to expand his power.  sir guy of gisbourne could be a knight that stayed behind to help guard furyondy. same with the sheriff of nottingham (just choose a furyondy city or province that would work well)robin hood could be based in the vesve forest.  he could be a highway man robbing from the rich to give to the poor.the duchy of ulek -- the duchy of ulek has the silverwood within it's borders.  a perfect place to place robin hood and his merry band.  the duke of ulek could be away for some reason, and a treacherous brother could fill what is needed for prince john. the sheriff of nottingham becomes a sheriff of what ever county in the duchy of ulek you need him to be. and sir guy would be part of a county of the duchy. the duchy of ulek was where i set robin hood for my own robin hood campaign.there are other nations where you can set robin hood.  the great kingdom of aerdy can be a good fit.  but the two places above are my suggestions for setting a robin campaign.  reading through the greyhawk campaign setting (circa 1983), the living greyhawk gazetteer (circa 2001), or greyhawk: the adventure begins (1998) and reading through various sources for robin hood can give you more ideas on how to fit robin hood within greyhawk.



epic greyhawk dnd 3/3.5 edition greyhawk epic level guide draft - a very rough working draft compiled and edited by rob douglas contributing authors: rob douglas,  based on original material by e. gary gygax, carl sargeant, man of the cranes, ▾ introduction  with my own campaign encroaching on epic levels after the release of the epic level handbook, i found myself wondering how these rules would impact the world of greyhawk in particular.  in older editions of the game, characters above 20th level seemed to be beyond what could be reasonably represented in the game.  but with  the release of the elh, i was inspired to begin cataloging my ideas for an epic greyhawk campaign.    in this document i am attempting to gather d&d 3rd edition statistics for the epic level features that have been introduced into the world of greyhawk setting, as well as maintain links to details on elements of greyhawk that are particularly epic.  i also want to provide a collection of adventure and campaign ideas for epic level play.  since it was first introduced, there have been elements of the world of greyhawk which were even more spectacular, more magical, and more epic than the basic rules of the game could cover.  the suloise mages, the twin cataclysms, iuz, slerotin's tunnel and innumerable artifacts, as well as the prospects of divine ascension, and interactions with the gods themselves, all call to mind elements more fantastic than the basic d&d rules can cover.  carl sargeant's work with iuz the evil, and ivid the undying extended many of these concepts, and others have written of vecna, the ur-flan, and the age of myth.  and then there are the gord novels, which definitely cover an epic level of interaction, including demon wars and ultimately the battle with tharizdun.  greyhawk is a campaign world rife with possibilities for characters who have surpassed the powers of even the famed circle of eight, those who can contend or conspire directly with mordenkainen, et al.  i hope this work will help inspire such innovation, and continue to grow with more information to share with others. chapter 1: characters, skills, and feats▾ chapter 2: epic spells  iggwilv's curse (rot8)  invoked devastation  rain of colorless fire  slerotin's tunneling▾ chapter 3: running an epic game in the world of greyhawk ▾ the epic adventure ▾ adventure themes  1) imprisoned epic - something was imprisoned and now is about to escape or has escaped.  2) strange lands - the world is not fully mapped or explored. while everyone [i]thinks[i] that the main land (the flannaess) is the most advanced, maybe it is not.  3) ancient lore - lost epic lore from ages past comes to light. this is similar to imprisoned, but tied more to historical events. the elves, and the suel both represent powerful, probably epic level cultures, and both have lost cities to the desert or demiplanes that could house epic items, spells, and/or monsters - or even npcs.  4) interplanar threats - once you look beyond this one world, epic things are more necessary to keep order in the multiverse. greyhawk would be devestated by a gate opening that brought in thousands of demons. so being able to stop that gate at the source, and not disturb the balance of the world would be an epic challenge.  5) interplanetary threats - very similar, but slightly different. there was some work done on this in 2e with spelljammer, but if you didn't use that, it opens up space travel as a truly epic area of expertise. perhaps stopping an invasion of devastation vermin from another planet would be a challenging task.  epic dungeons  epic wilderness  planar travel ▾ the epic campaign ▾ published adventures suitable for epic level play (pre-3e)  the apocalypse stone  the dancing hut  die, vecna, die!

the silver wolf: descending into the depths of the oerth: like father..like son?


cruelsummerlord writes "denrik wanted to remind normin how much more money the glendowyrs might have if he didn’t spend so much of it getting sloshed at the orc’s trough, but he wisely held his tongue."

the silver wolf: descending into the depths of the oerth: a wretched wasp's nest


cruelsummerlord writes "the city was nearly as bleak and depressing as the shantytown outside. signs of poverty were everywhere, from the filth littering the streets to the beggars and street urchins rooting through trash containers and debris piles, to the buildings that were either decrepit, ramshackle hovels or fortresses with barred windows and thick oak and bronzewood doors. people skulked furtively through the streets, regarding one another suspiciously, and the very air itself was rife with tension and fear."

the silver wolf: descending into the depths of the oerth: brotherly love


cruelsummerlord writes "everything briefly went dark for the companions as kashafen started casting his group teleportation, but the look in weimar’s eyes was seared into his friends’ minds.it was a look that made clear that he was ready to kill every bandit in stoink to save denrik, if that was what it took."

the silver wolf: descending into the depths of the oerth: prologue


cruelsummerlord writes "it all seemed barren,
bleak and lifeless. there was hardly any life for miles around except the few
sickly bushes and stunted trees that struggled to survive in the hard, dry
wasteland. everything was silent except for the grinding creak of the wheels of
the caravan’s wagons, the grunting and laughter of the gnolls and orcs the caravan
employed as guards, and the occasional quiet sobbing of some of the wagons’
occupants"
