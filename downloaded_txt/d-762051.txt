timeless keelboat class, unforgettable racing. 

dragons are technically difficult but not always physically difficult to sail. this is much better for me compared to my experiences of etchells, 707s and rs21s, where the loads can be extremely high. the fleet have been very welcoming and friendly and i've met a lot of people from a wide range of backgrounds.- catherine sears jerboa gbr 831
