over 40 years of educating and advocating for tourism in the southeast














who we are…



on september 14, 1983, a small group of industry leaders from the southeast gathered for the purpose of organizing the southeast tourism society (sts). those charter members shared the mutual belief that regional promotion of tourism, via a partnership between states, would create a powerful marketing alliance unparalleled throughout our country. now, 40 years later, their vision continues as sts is an established leader among tourism organizations.

—  joni buford, tmp, fep, growth marketing manager/idea cultivator; accent creative group







"during the first week in my role, multiple people told me – you’ve got to go to southeast tourism society’s marketing college. over the next three years, i learned how to better market our destination from leading industry experts and expanded my knowledge of what we do and why we do it. i highly recommend that anyone entering a hospitality and tourism-related role consider the investment and ongoing education from sts."
