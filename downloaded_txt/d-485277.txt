aanr west club highlights

mountain air ranch
mountain air ranch has been the focal point for clothing-free recreation in colorado since 1935. it is said, that clothes make the man. at mountain air ranch you can lose the clothing and the associated labels that society puts on them. have you ever wondered why children love to be nude? it’s not just because they can, but because it’s liberating.
mountain air ranch is in the foothills 20 miles southwest of denver, off hwy. 285. members and guests can enjoy the fresh mountain air, the clear blue skies, and a landscape shared with deer, fox, birds, and other native wildlife. you can unwind while hiking the trails or while relaxing by the pool. exploring the 150 acres of natural beauty, the same way nature made you, is the essence of freedom. https://mountainairranch.org



 


hawaiian naturist parka clothing optional bed & breakfast venue where all are welcome
located in the tropical rainforest, it’s hard to believe that this great escape from the city is just 7 miles from hawai'i volcanoes national park!
imagine feeling the warmth of the filtered morning sunlight peering through the ohia trees as you sip a warm cup of coffee all while clothes-free! tropical bird songs fill the jungle! maybe you will go for a dip in our pure rainwater pool or head to the incredible jetted lava rock showers! enjoy our wood-burning sauna too! words and pictures can't convey what it's like to experience this very special place. being able to enjoy it all nude just adds to the tranquility. hawaiiannaturistpark.com


 


sun tree travel clubsun tree is a travel club, one that has no property, nor facilities. in the case of suntree, we meet:
at the homes of our members for potlucks, swimming, games, hot soaks, conversation
on public lands for camping, hiking, water skiing
in facilities which we rent - lodging at ski resorts, camping at commercial areas, house boating.
we have married people, singles, normal people, eccentric people, nice folks, and various ethnic groups represented. our main concern is compatibility between the members. for that reason, we suggest attendance at some of our events prior to making a decision to join the club.
our members live in various places all over new mexico, west texas, arizona, and other locations in the united states and mexico. this situation makes the "travel" in our name very appropriate since most members have to travel to our events no matter where they might be held. http://suntree.net


 
have you ever thought about how society shapes our comfort zones? clothing has always been about more than just covering up; it’s about identity, status, and sometimes even control. when you take that away in a setting of trust and respect, it’s remarkable how quickly you connect with your authentic self and others.
but let’s not romanticize it too much. choosing vulnerability—even in small ways—isn’t easy. it takes courage to break free from norms and embrace individuality, whether through naturism, creative expression, or simply challenging outdated ideas about what’s "acceptable."

naturists are only interested in physical appearance: naturism is more about body acceptance and comfort rather than focusing solely on physical appearance. people of all shapes, sizes, and ages participate in naturist activities.
when it comes to naturism, there's a persistent myth that needs to be addressed: the idea that naturists are only interested in physical appearance. this could not be further from the truth, as the ethos of naturist communities and activities is deeply rooted in principles of body acceptance and comfort rather than an evaluation of physical aesthetics.
naturism, also known as nudism, is a lifestyle that embraces the human body in all of its forms. the philosophy behind it is built on the ideals of freedom, respect, and harmony with nature. naturists advocate for the right to be comfortable in one's own skin, without the constraints or societal pressures often associated with clothing.
this movement includes individuals from all walks of life—people of different shapes, sizes, ages, and backgrounds come together to share in the experience of naturism. it's not an exclusive club where only those with so-called 'perfect bodies' can join; rather, it's an inclusive community that celebrates body diversity. countering the mainstream culture that often promotes unrealistic body standards, naturism encourages individuals to have a healthy relationship with their bodies as they are.
in naturist settings, the unclothed body is normalized and desexualized, which helps to shift the focus from physical appearance to the essence of the person within. it's about being comfortable with oneself and others, regardless of imperfections or societal labels. by stripping away clothes, naturists also aim to strip away judgments and comparisons that can be so prevalent in the clothed world.
furthermore, naturist environments often foster self-esteem and acceptance. participating in naturist activities can lead to an increased appreciation for the body's capabilities and the uniqueness of each individual. in these spaces, one is more likely to encounter encouraging affirmations of body positivity than criticism or disparagement.
the myth that naturism is solely about physical appearance is a misunderstanding of the naturist philosophy. this lifestyle choice is about much more than surface-level aesthetics; it's a commitment to accepting oneself and others, and enjoying the freedom of living unencumbered by clothing. as the naturist movement continues to grow, it challenges and inspires society at large to embrace a more wholesome and accepting view of the human body.classifiedsshort storythe forgotten island
a group of close friends who had been craving a break from their hectic lives set sail for an adventure on the open sea. despite their excitement, a sudden storm disrupted their course and forced them to land on a completely unknown island. the island was unlike anything they had ever seen before blanketed in soft golden sands and filled with dense tropical flora, it was a true paradise.
the friends soon realized that they had found more than just a beautiful escape from the world's demands. they had discovered a place where they could truly connect with the elements and recharge their souls. as they explored the island, they felt a deep sense of peace and wonder that they had never experienced before.
as they embraced the purity of their surroundings, the friends began to let go of the societal norms and stress that they had carried with them for so long. they found that, in shedding their garments and inhibitions, they were able to connect more fully with one another and with the natural world around them. in the lap of nature, they found solace and unity, and their time on the island became a life-changing experience that they would never forget.
