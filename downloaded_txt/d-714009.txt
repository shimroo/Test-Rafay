due to the covid-19 pandemic and despite great efforts from the staff, volunteers and our generous community of supporters, we have come to the disheartening realization that there is no viable way to continue with our travel and recreation programs.
as of june 30, 2021 we will no longer offer our travel and recreation programs and will be focusing exclusively on our film distribution service sproutflix (www.sproutflix.org).
