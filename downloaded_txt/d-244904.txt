the word on the street…









the runner's edge is a staple in farmingdale. it is the go to store for running sneakers, clothes and nutrition. i have been fitted more than once by the friendly and knowledgeable staff. they got me through two marathons with the right sneakers for my race.

john g.





given personal attention. professional. very informative. left with the correct running shoes needed.

 jerrilyn a.





always have a wonderful experience at runner's edge. great quality products and even better customer experience.  i know when i purchase a new pair of sneakers that the individuals who work here are very knowledgeable about the gait cycle, the anatomy of the foot and demands of activities.

jessica m.





for context: this was my first experience at a running store, and buying running shoes. i’m pretty clueless about it, but i’m prepping for a marathon in the future. the staff at runner’s edge was extremely friendly and welcoming.

evan g.





for the serious runner + track & field participant, this is the store for you! chain stores with similar stock, just don't have the expertise and knowledge like the staff does here.

susan g.





late in life i joined the running/walking world.  didn't know where to get "real" running shoes and thankfully a friend recommended runner's edge. won't buy my running sneakers anywhere else.

andrew p.





had the most pleasant experience at this store today. the staff member who helped us was a true gentleman - he was so kind and knowledgeable. we left the store feeling confident with our purchase. you won't get this quality of customer service online. look forward to coming here again.
