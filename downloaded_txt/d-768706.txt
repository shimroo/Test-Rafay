our mission is to make our students more successful in life, in everything they do.  we do this by teaching traditional karate as a complete discipline (mind, body, and spirit) which in additional to physical defense promotes the development of high personal standards and respect for fellow men and woman, boys and girls.  our focus is to develop students who are positive contributing members in our community.

i started my uechi ryu karate training in okinawa and am now continuing under sensei nestor folta. the training he gives is exactly the same as i received when i trained in japan; challenging, powerful, effective, and authentic. true to its okinawan roots.






kelly legos - confidence


we recently signed up both our children (ages 8 and 10) at okinawa karate and cultural center and could not be more pleased.   master folta strikes an amazing balance of patience, motivation, education and discipline.   they are learning so much and i’m already seeing changes in their confidence.  looking forward to seeing where they go from here:)
