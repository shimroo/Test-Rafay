located in southern hunterdon county, the township covers a 21.8 square mile area of active farms bisected by the sourland mountain ridge. we are a rural community of families who passionately care about preserving the special quality of life which is unique to this part of new jersey.the delaware indians had a path through the woods from lambertville through mount airy, ringoes and reaville to newark upon which the old york road was subsequently laid. west amwell township was originally part of amwell township which was formed in 1708 when hunterdon county was still part of burlington county--west amwell split from east amwell in 1846.
