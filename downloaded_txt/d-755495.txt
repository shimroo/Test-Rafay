this is the last weekend of girl scout cookies for a full year. we have cookie recipe books at our booths (in the mall friday 4-8 and saturday 10-2) but i will e-mail them to anyone who wants one. out-of-town cookie orders are being shipped tomorrow.

this weekend i was the recipient of one of those 'insults disguised as casual chatter' monologues. the kind that starts out "i don't know how you can possibly give 5 children enough attention and love" and goes downhill from there. strangely, i only get those lectures from people with one or two children. i say lecture/monologue because i just nod and smile while the person goes on and on about how exhasting their child is and how they can't understand people who have more than two children. nothing i say would change that person's mind anyway. let's review how neglected our children are right now. tommy has group therapy, psychiatrist appointments and horseback riding lessons. he and doug play d&d with a friend and the friend's father every other week. tommy gets to go along on the boy scout camping trips. poor, pitiful sarah is secretary of the student council and a member of the art club, the school's news crew, girl scouts and has a part in the seventh grade play. she participates in sibshops and has a weekly sleepover either here or at a friend's house. she somehow manages to see a movie in the theater almost every week. noah is a boy scout and active in karate (3 times a week) while also participating in tag and the school chess club. amy has preschool twice a week and gets to participate in so many of the girl scout activities that she considers herself a girl scout. evan has no organized activities but still nurses full-time and you will have to just trust me when i say that is a time-consuming activity. sooooo, i just don't think my children are neglected.

noah had a sleepover friday night and his friend gasped when he saw our christmas winter girl scout cookie lights on the front of the house. the next day, doug took down part of the lights. i think noah should have visitors more frequently.

i took advantage of a cookie booth inside the mall and did some window shopping. two thoughts. first, i can tell by the store's background music if they want me as a customer. second, the new spring fashions look like the wardrobe for "caddyshack".
