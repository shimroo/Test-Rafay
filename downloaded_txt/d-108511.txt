what is core shamanism?
based on michael harner's years of research and experimentation, core shamanism consists of the universal, near-universal, and common features of shamanism, together with journeys to other worlds.
core shamanism provides direct access to compassionate spiritual power and knowledge to help others and our planet.








"what's really important about shamanism is that there is another reality you can personally discover...we are not alone."
—michael harner, founder




"the foundation for shamanic studies has had enormous impact on our world, helping to connect people all over the world with powerful sources of compassion and wisdom. the core shamanic teachings originated, researched, and developed by michael harner are primary and timeless. by learning these practical and remarkably effective methods, people are able to make direct contact with the helping spirits of another reality and bring back knowledge and healing to our troubled planet. when we travel this road, we come to know, as a matter of experience not of faith, of the fundamental unity of all things—an understanding that lies at the heart of an enlightened society."
— susan mokelke, president
