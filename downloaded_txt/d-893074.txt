link pages










 von dieser seite gibt es auch eine deutsche fassung 


		welcome to my website! this site is a collection of thing i find (or used to find) interesting, and maybe it even holds some useful information. do not hesitate to  tell me  what you like and what you don't, what you found to be wrong or silly. i do not keep a regular change log anymore, but occasionally the  what's new page informs you about changes.
	

 here are the things you can find on my pages:





 games, mostly board games of the more complex sort, are a big hobby of mine. if you are interested in the games i play and own, look into my gaming page for more information; you will also find reviews of some games there. and for some years now i have been translating game rules â please go here for more information.
			




				i have collected some ideas and variant scenarios for flash point: fire rescue, a cooperative game about, you guessed it, firefighting and rescuing people. i made a free variant for this (oktoberfest), and i also designed a few commercially-produced variants: 2nd story, extreme danger, dangerous waters and honor & duty.
			




 paper modelling is a very old hobby of mine, and at last i got around to write a bit about it. not much, but maybe something to awaken some interest in the thing?there are also some pages in german language about paper modelling and paper toy theatres on my companion website papierwerke.info.
			




				in 2014 i fulfilled a childhood dream and bought some model steam engines. these pages are about my experiences with them. there is also a section about my metal construction sets. (note: these pages are in german language.)





				i like hiking and have started to write down some of the tours i did, or plan to do (in german language).
			




				in 2003 i took up paddling again as a weekend hobby. i am just a leisure paddler, but i felt the urge to put down some of my experiences in writing (mostly in german language).
			




				i like to take photos, and i share some of them here.
			




dancing has been my hobby for some years now, both standard dances and "volkstanz" (i.e. folk, or ethnic, dances). (these pages are in german language.)
			




				the web â¦â one of the nice things about it is linking up and telling others what we found and what we liked most! visit my favourite links page with its various sub-sections â¦ even if some of these links are probably not quite as interesting anymore as i thought at the time.
			




				and then ...: it's me!, introducing myself, my immediate environment, and the city i live in: berlin. i also wrote down  some of my thoughts, so i wouldn't forget them.
			




				this is a link to an obsolete (german-language) website for people interested in fairy-tales:  der mã¤rchenbrunnen. "the fairy-tale well" was the name of the small stage my wife and i ran for two years in berlin-steglitz. you can find some general information and old posters on these pages.
			




				â¦ and what about skydiving? well, it used to be an important pastime for me, but those days are gone. if you want to know about skydiving near berlin please visit  the pages of my former club.
