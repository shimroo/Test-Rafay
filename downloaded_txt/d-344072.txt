car insurance tips
when it comes to car insurance, we've been there, done that, now serving 278 tips in 24 categories ranging from auto insurance coverage types to uninsured motorist insurance.











car insurance for teenagers
when shopping for car insurance for teenagers, it is a good idea to shop around online to compare prices and find the most affordable. 
higher insurance rates for teenagers are due to their inexperience and sometimes reckless behaviors when behind the wheel. but, it is important to remember car insurance companies do reward for good driving records. so being a safe driver will help lower your rates.
as a newly licensed driver, teenagers should know a few things to help their car insurance rates low. 
first, cars are rated to determine insurance rates. for example: a corvette is going to have a higher premium than a pick-up truck. add in a teenager driver, the insurance premium soars even more. so it is best for a teenage driver to stay with a car that is going to be lower on premiums, like a 4 door sedan. 
most states only require auto liability insurance for cars that are paid for. so keeping this in mind, it is a good idea to buy something cheaper as a first car.
other things that affect your rates are speeding tickets or accidents. it is important to pay attention to the road, follow the speed limit and do not talk on cell or text to avoid accidents. doing these things will keep your insurance rates down.

student car insurance
most parents will agree, young drivers are hard to insure! statistically young drivers have the most accidents and most moving violations due to their inexperience. there are some things young drivers can do to get affordable student car insurance.
good grades matter. most insurance companies offer what is called a "good student discount". the thought process being that students who get good grades are often more responsible and careful about their daily activities. the typical gpa required for a good student discount is a 3.0 or b average. 
companies typically give a discount for a young driver who has completed a driver education course or a defensive driving course. many public schools offer driver education courses and many private driving schools offer defensive driving courses as well. be sure to choose a private school that is dmv approved. upon successful completion a certificate is given to the student driver and it can be sent to the insurance for discount.
the most important thing a young driver can do is to maintain a good driving record. remaining accident and moving violation free is very important in obtaining and keeping affordable student car insurance.

should you buy insurance for a rental car?
if you are planning on renting a car, it is important that you do some research beforehand to determine whether or not to purchase rental car insurance. most of the time, obtaining it from the rental car agency is going to be more expensive. knowing your options before you rent the car is beneficial to you and your wallet.
first of all, if you have car insurance, call your provider to see what is included on your policy in the event you are in an accident while driving a rental car. 
if you do not have car insurance, you can check with your homeowner's insurance and see if there is any rental car insurance included in your policy.
if you do not have either of these policies on your own, it is possible to obtain rental car insurance from your credit card company too. calling them, they can tell you what options that they offer.
the last option is to obtain rental car insurance from the rental car agency. this should be used as a last resort, as it is usually more expensive.
it is best to prepare yourself and not spend any money unnecessarily. it is important to carry the rental car insurance as you may put yourself in a bigger financial hardship if you were to be in an accident with no insurance.

car insurance for young drivers
insuring a teen driver is expensive. teen drivers are involved in more fatal or serious injury collisions that any other age group, and this drives up the expense of insuring them. however, there are ways to lower the costs of car insurance for young drivers. 
the kind of car given to young drivers will have a direct impact on insurance costs. most young drivers want a small, fast and sporty car. however, the combination of the three can create a substantial insurance premium. the faster the car, the higher the insurance premium will be. also, sports cars have a higher theft rate, which also makes them more expensive to insure. to lower insurance costs, young drivers should have a larger, older model car. larger cars are heavier, and therefore prevent young drivers from speeding and driving recklessly. also, an older car that is paid for will only need liability insurance instead of collision and comprehensive insurance. finally, an older car will have a lower blue book value, therefore it will cost less to insure.

group auto insurance
group auto insurance is becoming the way for companies to finance their car insurance in a much more affordable way. companies that offer their employees use of a company car are the most common subscribers. group auto insurance is usually used for government insurance, private company insurance and even organizations or civic groups.
group auto insurance is "buying in bulk" and we all know buying in bulk usually results in a cheaper price. the larger the group and the more members that are enrolled the bigger the discount on the premium. 
group auto insurance lets you come and go as you please. there are no mandatory terms. if you are on the insurance for a few months and decide it's not for you, you can change plans without penalty. this allows great flexibility for its members.
flexible payments are another benefit of group auto insurance. everyone that signs up for the group auto insurance policy does not have to pay the same way. you can pick the payment that works for you, annual payments, bi annual payments etc. 
group car insurance is a great way for a company to get maximum benefits at efficient costs for their auto insurance needs.
