traveler reviews







                            "after a trip like this, a cruise looks pale in comparison. we feel we’ve experienced these countries and not just given them a cursory glance. visiting some of the lesser-known areas added greatly to the whole experience. getting to know the guides so well was an added benefit... a tough act to follow!"
                          


j. & g. macdonald
west vancouver, bc, canada





                            "i can't tell you how much my father and i enjoyed our trip to central asia, and i'm convinced it wouldn't have been nearly as much of a success had it not been for mir."
                          


c. wilson
tiburon, ca





                            "from the steps of the potala palace to the steppes of mongolia, from spinning prayer wheels to sheep with their nomadic herders, this trip is a feast for the senses. the colors and images inside the monasteries, the sound of the horse-head mongolian fiddles, the taste of yak-butter tea, the smell of incense burning, etc. all of these combine for an overriding impression of this stunning region of the world."
                          


k. whitmer
bellingham, wa





                            "a great adventure. something one should do once (at least) in life."
                          


j. heldman
oakland, ca





                            "i liked every part for different reasons. we had such a nice combination of driving through the countryside, seeing the cities, and meeting friendly people."
