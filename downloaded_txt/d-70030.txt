the international guild of miniature artisans
 in the pursuit and recognition of excellence 
igma was founded to promote fine miniatures as an art form; to increase awareness and appreciation of high-quality workmanship 
through public education; to recognize and honor qualified artisans and encourage work of highest quality; to encourage the development 
of new artisans; and to coordinate and serve the interests and needs of the artisan and non-artisan.
