crown falconry equipment and supplies


welcome to the pages of crown falconry





suppliers of some of the finest hand-crafted falconry equipment in the united kingdom, we can supply the full range from blocks and perches to gloves and swivels. here's a few words about us from the man who started it all, jim moss:
crown falconry was established in 1993 growing from my general interest in wood turning and metal working, turning a few block perches for my local falconry friends and acquaintances. 1997 was quite a big turning point with the design and production of the rubber topped bow perches and block perches. to date, with well over 1,000 bows and blocks out in the field, as far away as japan and south africa, i feel i had at last done something to bring perching into the 21st century.i hope you enjoy browsing the pages of our web site, and i would like to take this opportunity of thanking old customers and welcoming those of you who are new to our products. here's wishing all of you happy hawking days for years to come.
