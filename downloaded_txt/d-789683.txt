the department of neurobiology and behavior (nbb) was among the first to combine the study of animal behavior with its neural basis. our faculty and students are dedicated to exploring a wide range of scientific topics, from single neurons and complex circuits to whole organisms and their societies. central to our mission is the quest to unravel the profound mysteries of how nervous systems generate behavior, including the evolutionary pathways that have shaped brains and behavior over time. we believe these scientific frontiers are not just fascinating but also critical for understanding the intricacies of the brain, the least understood organ that underlies human experience. as a community we adhere to cornell's founding principle of "... any person ... any study".
