norte americano-style vegan lucuma ice cream







bryanna's norte americano-style vegan lucuma ice cream
servings: 12; yield: 6 cups

2 cups soy or almond milk
2/3 cup lucuma powder (available in health food stores or online from amazon.ca)
2 cups (1 pint) your favorite plain vegan creamer (i like so delicious original coconut milk creamer)
1/2 cup raw cashews or raw, shelled sunflower seeds, soaked in boiling water for 10 minutes and drained
3/4 cup light agave nectar
1/2 tbs pure vanilla extract
3/8 tsp xanthan gum or guar gum or 1 1/2 tsp instant clear jel (acts as a stabilizer)
1/4 tsp salt

the night before or morning before serving the ice cream, place the 2 cups soy or almond milk into a blender along with the lucuma powder and blend until very smooth. scoop the mixture into a jar and refrigerate for 8 hours.

after 8 hours, mix the refrigerated lucuma mixture in the blender again with all of the remaining ingredients. blend again until it is very smooth. pour the mixture into a pitcher or bowl and place it in the freezer until it is very cold all the way through, but not frozen (check every so often).

as soon as the mixture is very cold, scoop it into your ice cream maker and freeze according to directions for your machine. scoop the finished ice cream into freezer container(s), cover and freeze for several hours before serving.

bryanna's "fried chicken" salad this is a southern-style salad that is a meal in itself. you can "fry" the soy curls® in the oven without fat, or panfry them...it's your choice. (nutritional info is for soy curls® baked in the oven.)
12 oz. reconstituted soy curls® (use the largest ones you have) (4 oz. dry, soaked in hot chicken-style vegetarian broth),  (see butlerfoods.com for where to buy or order soy curls in your area. see cooking tips, below, for more info.)
if you have no soy curls®, use 4 cups slices of "chicken" seitan
whole wheat flour for dredging
1/2 cup soy or nut milk curdled with 1/2 tbs. vinegar or lemon juice
panko breading: (mix well)
1/2 cup panko (japanese breadcrumbs)
1 tsp garlic granules
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp salt
freshly-ground black pepper to taste
salad:
6 cups organic baby greens
2 cups sliced roasted beets
1/2 cup "blue cheese" sheese, crumbled (an alternative would be tofu feta from the jun/jul 05 vf)
vegan "honey"-mustard dressing:
(3/4 cup eggless low-fat mayonnaise
http://veganfeastkitchen.blogspot.com/2006/09/modernvegan-blt-sandwich-heaven.html
or tofu mayonnaise)
http://www.bryannaclarkgrogan.com/page/page/661699.htm #august18,2003
(or use vegannaise, if you don't mind the calories!)
1/4 cup agave nectar
2 tbs smooth dijon mustard panko breadcrumbs:
panko are japanese breadcrumbs noted for their crunchy texture, which is lighter and crispier than regular breadcrumbs. you can find them in most supermarkets now (look near the fish department in
some stores), or asian grocery stores. or but online from many online asian grocery outlets, such as
http://www.mingspantry.com/
wholewheat panko bread crumbs are available:
look for ian's whole wheat panko breadcrumbs. amazon is one venue that sells them online.to make your own panko, see cooking tips below. to cook the soy curls®:
set up shallow bowls with the whole wheat flour, curdled soymilk, and panko breading
mixture in a line on your counter (see picture). dredge the soy curls® in flour, then dip
in the curdled soymilk, and then roll in the panko breading mixture. place each piece on
a cookie sheet, not touching the others. oct/nov/dec 07 vegan feast 48 now you can pan-fry the pieces in a little hot oil in a nonstick skillet, cooking until
golden brown on all sides, and draining them on paper towels,
or you can bake them on dark cookie sheets, sprayed with oil from a pump sprayer (and
spray the top of the soy curl® pieces, too), at 500° f for about 10 minutes on each side,
or until golden brown and crispy.
while they cook, assemble the salads, dividing the greens between 4 salad bowls, and
distributing the beets and sheese evenly around the edges of the bowls. pile the hot soy
curls® in the center of each salad.
whisk the dressing ingredients together well and drizzle over the salad. serve
immediately.

vegan chocolate hazelnut or pecan lava cakes







 bryanna's hazelnut or pecan praline lava cakes these individual cakes usually have a soft center of chocolate fudge that erupts in a rich, dark puddle from the cakes.  this recipe is an easier version of the cake that some of you might have seen before, though it is not in any of my books or newsletters.  but i decided to try a caramelly hazelnut praline filling.  it was a big hit with my guests. originally, lava cakes were flourless cakes with a batter based on eggs that formed a molten center when the cakes were baked.  more often than not these days, a rich cake batter containing flour is used and a frozen chocolate mixture is placed between layers of batter before baking.  this is the type that i started with to make a vegan version of this cake.  this batter has very little fat in it, yet is rich, moist, tender and chocolatey.  the hazelnut filling tastes rich enough that half a cake is plenty for a serving, along with a scoop of vegan vanilla "ice cream".note on baking vessels: use ramekins, bowls, little soufflé dishes, giant muffin tins, ceramic coffee cups-- anything that holds about 1 cup (8 oz.).  i prefer bowls with a rounded bottom, but have used a variety of vessels successfully.  they should be generously greased with vegan margarine and placed on two cookie sheets.filling:1/4 cup earth balance, or other good-tasting vegan margarine7/8 cup hazelnuts or pecans, toasted and chopped3/4 cup brown sugar3 tbs soy creamer, such as silk brand, or nut creme2 tbs. vegan white sugarcakes:wet mix:1 cup (8 ounces) firm silken tofu or medium-firm regular tofu2 cups brown sugar1 1/4 cups strong liquid coffee or espresso2 tbs. oil4 tsp ener-g or orgran egg replacer powder1 tbs. vinegar1 tbs. vanilla or chocolate, coffee or hazelnut liqueurdry mix:1 1/4 cups pastry flour (you can even use whole wheat pastry flour with the rough bran sifted out)1 cup organic unsweetened cocoa1 tsp baking powder1 tsp baking soda1/2 tsp saltfilling:1/4 cup earth balance, or other good-tasting vegan margarine7/8 cup hazelnuts or pecans, toasted and chopped3/4 cup brown sugar3 tbs soy creamer, such as silk brand, or nut creme2 tbs vegan white sugarto make the filling:place the earth balance in a medium microwave-safe bowl or pitcher and microwave until melted, about 2 minutes.  (or melt in a medium saucepan over medium heart on the stovetop.)  add the remaining ingredients and microwave on full power (or boil n the stovetop) for 3 minutes.pour the mixture into a flat baking pan lined with parchment and place in the freezer to cool until you can handle it like candy.  divide into 8 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball.  place, not touching, on the parchment and place in the freezer while you make the cake batter.to make the cakes:preheat the oven to 350 ° f.have the 8 cups or ramekins for the cakes prepared as above under note.mix the wet mix ingredients in a food processor or blender until smooth. whisk together the dry mix ingredients in a medium bowl.pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk briefly to make a smooth batter.divide the half of the batter evenly into the prepared cups or ramekins.  gently place one of the hazelnut praline balls in the center of each and gently press down a tiny bit, and then top evenly with the remaining batter.  place the filled cups (or whatever you are using) in a large baking pan or on a cookie sheet with a rim.bake in the center of the oven until the cakes are  puffy and set, about 35 minutes.  test on the side of one of the cakes with a cake tester or toothpick.  let cool in the pan 10 minutes, then loosen carefully and invert onto parchment-lined plates or pans. to serve:cut each cake in half.  serve each half on a small dessert plate, still warm, with a scoop of vegan vanilla "ice cream", such as soy delicious, soy dream, or tofutti.note: leftovers can be refrigerated, wrapped in plastic wrap, and then reheated, uncovered in the microwave for a minute, or in a 350°f oven, covered loosely with foil, for about 10 minutes.serves 16nutrition factsnutrition (per serving): 330.4 calories; 34% calories from fat; 13.4g total fat; 0.0mg cholesterol; 202.8mg sodium; 400.3mg potassium; 52.2g

new, even tastier updated version of my steamed vegan "parmesan"







 this is a new and improved version of the vegan"parm" recipe i posted in november of 2019. i've been a bit fed up lately with cashews, cashews, cashews when it comes to vegan cheese!  for one thing, they are expensive, especially the fair trade, organic variety.  for another, they can be ethically compromised (see https://bit.ly/2olehgm for more on these issues.)  my aim for some time has been to make vegan cheese that is delicious, easy to make, inexpensive and made with easily-obtained ingredients, and without the need for cashews or culturing.some time ago i ran across martine's groundbreaking recipe for vegan steamed rice cheese at lowcarb-vegan.net/vegan-steamed-rice-cheese/  i tried it right away-- it was easy to make and tasty!but, it was made with white rice flour, which is not particularly low-glycemic (and i have to eat low-glycemic). so, back in 2019, i got a notion to use some sort of bean flour instead, along with some high-resistant-starch potato starch, and it worked beautifully. i added more nutritional yeast, along with some miso (for a fermented flavor), and onion powder and garlic granules. even better!my far-away australian facebook friend fran p. was also working on such things and we shared our successes and failures. i hoped (and still hope) to make a cheese that melted, but i'm still working on that. but, in any case, one day i got the idea to grate this very firm, tasty cheese and it seemed to me to be a delicious and much less expensive alternative to commercial vegan "parmesan" products.in this latest version, i boosted some of the flavor components, and it's even better! my husband was even slicing it and eating it out of hand!  i'm working on some other versions of this type of cheese, but i wanted to share this one with you right now because we're so pleased with it.  let me know what you think!printable recipebryanna's  new updated steamed vegan "parmesan"(low-glycemic, high in protein and fiber, nut-free, soy-free) april 23, 2021   **makes enough to fill at least two 142g shaker jars.low-fat option: i have made this cheese with no oil, using 1 cup + 1 1/2 tbsps. water and it turned out just fine, but may not melt as well.this very tasty cheese is high in protein from bean flour, and is low-glycemic. it's also a great source of resistant starch (which acts as a soluble fiber). potato starch [not the same thing as potato flour, btw] is also very high in resistant starch and makes for a very firm cheese, suitable for grating or pulsing in a food processor. (see https://bit.ly/2pjhau9 for info on resistant starch, which improves insulin sensitivity, lower blood sugar levels, reduces appetite and has various benefits for digestion.)ingredients:    • 1 1/3 cup/124 g  chickpea flour (note: i've tried several bean flours and this works best.)    • 1/4 cup/ 41 g  slightly packed-down potato starch (not potato flour)     • 1 cup water    • 1/4 cup melted refined coconut oil (preferably fair trade, organic)    • 2 tablespoons olive oil    • 1 1/2 tsp salt    • 1 tablespoon dark miso note: dark miso gives a more fermented flavor than the white variety.    • 1 1/2 tsp. smooth dijon mustard    • 1 tablespoon lemon juice or sauerkraut juice    • 1/4 cup nutritional yeast flakes    • 1 tsp. onion powder    • 1 tsp. garlic granulessteps:1. pour 2 cups of water into your steamer pot, instantpot or pressure cooker, equipped with a flat steamer basket in the bottom.  

2.place all the ingredients into the jar of your blender, and blend until it forms a completely smooth, milky mixture, without lumps or visible oil droplets. 


this is the pyrex mold that i use, lined with cooking parchment3. pour the cheese mixture into a greased or parchment-lined pyrex, metal or ceramicmold. choose a mold that will hold 2 cups, with about 1/2 inch of “head room”.      
place the mold onto the steamer basket.  i fold a long piece of aluminium foil lengthwise into a wide strip and use  it to lower the mold onto the steamer basket. this makes it easier to remove the hot mold from its close quarters after it's cooked, too!4. steam the cheese for about 45 minutes (or 25 minutes on steam function in instant pot, or pressure cooker).  release pressure in the instantpot or pressure cooker after cooling down for about 20 minutes. use the aluminum foil to lift the hot mold out of the pot onto a cooling rack.after the steaming, the cheese will still be a bit soft. don't worry, it will firm up once it cools. if a thin layer of water dripped onto the cheese from the pot's lid-- drain this off carefully. let the cheese cool to room temperature and then cover it and put it into the fridge overnight to firm up.once it is firm, you can release it from the mold and store it in a lidded container for a week or so, or you can freeze half of it, well-wrapped. the cheese tastes best if you leave it to firm and develop flavor for a day or two before eating.  you can grate the cheese on a box grater, if you wish, but i use a food processor. i cut the block into small squares and place them in a food processor.pulse until they are chopped and then process until it looks like commercial grated parmesan. scoop the resulting "granules" into two shaker bottles-- i have used two 142g earth island/followyourheart vegan grated parmesan-style cheese shakers, but you can just use some clean, dry  jars and scoop it out. or, if you prefer, cut the block in half,  process one half, and freeze on half, well wrapped, for grating later.ps: i keep most of  my grated "parm" in the freezer, only leaving a small amount in a jar in the refrigerator and refilling as needed.
enjoy!

homemade low-sodium, low-glycemic asian cooking sauces







 it's been a long, long time since i posted!!  i've mostly been cooking from my own books and files, as well as some old favorites on my bookshelves. and, as those of you who still follow me may know, i've been altering my diet to according the vicissitudes of  aging.i love asian cooking, but i am following a lower-sodium diet, as well as a low-glycemic one (very little sugar, and only low-glycemic carbohydrates-- you can check out some of my past posts on this subject).  checking out sodium and sugar content on the labels of the bottles of soy sauce and other commercial asian sauces readily available in supermarkets and specialty stores was quite a shock!my first challenge was soy sauce. i have used kikkoman soy sauce for years, but, at 960mg of sodium per tablespoon, i knew that i would have to make a change.  soy sauce is
one of the oldest condiments in the world, originating in china.  it
has a meaty, rich flavor which adds body to many western meatless
recipes.  it is an essential for meatless cooking.  kikkoman makes a
variety called “less sodium soy sauce”, which contains 40% less
salt than ordinary soy sauce, with no loss in flavor, and it is widely available in grocery stores.i love asian cooking, but i am following a lower-sodium diet, as well as a low-glycemic one (very little sugar, and only low-glycemic carbohydrates-- you can check out some of my past posts on this subject).  checking out sodium and sugar content on the labels of the bottles of soy sauce and other commercial asian sauces readily available in supermarkets and specialty stores was quite a shock!i figured that i could make my own low-sodium soy sauce, since the small bottles of kikkoman less-sodium soy sauce are expensive, and i can't find larger bottles in my area. i figured that i could somehow make my own and, low and behold, i found an easy recipe online at https://thewoksoflife.com/low-sodium-soy-sauce/, and had all the makings for it. ps: for your information:       many folks use a product called bragg’s liquid aminos instead of soy sauce, mistakenly believing that it contains less sodium than ordinary soy sauce (or tamari or shoyu, other terms for soy sauce).       but, the truth is that bragg’s actually has the same amount of sodium *per tablespoon* as ordinary soy sauce!       and, since bragg's not a fermented product, it has a less complex flavor, so you often use more of it.       the serving size for the bragg's product is only half a teaspoon, containing 160 mg of sodium.      the serving size listed on the kikkoman soy sauce bottle is 960 mg for 1 tablespoon, and 6 half-teaspoons of bragg's makes 1 tablespoon, so it's the same amount of sodium with less flavor.easy homemade lower-sodium soy saucemix 1/2 cup regular soy sauce, 1/2 cup chinese dark soy sauce (which i happened to have in my cupboard), and 1 cup water-- that's it!  (makes 2 cups) regular kikkoman soy sauce contains 960 mg sodium per tablespoon, and dark soy sauce contains 870 mg per tablespoon. by mixing these two soy sauces with the water, you have a full-bodied, tasty, and very inexpensive lower-sodium soy sauce  at 457 mg sodium per tablespoon!**********************the second sauce that i attempted was thai sweet chili sauce.  we don't use it as often as soy sauce, of course, but it's great to have around to serve with my thai-style corn fritters, shallow-fried or baked. it's also good for dipping chunks of crispy of fried (or air-fried) tofu, soycurls, seitan, vegetables, etc., or for adding to many types of asian stir-fries that call for some sweetness and chili heat.there are many homemade versions of this delicious, spicy sauce online, but i put together a quick and easy mixture, using agave syrup for the sweetener because it is much lower on the glycemic index than sugar (though, you should not overdo any type of sugar).bryanna's not-so-sweet thai  sweet red chili saucemakes about 1 3/4 cupsmix together in a small saucepan:1/2 cup un-salted rice vinegar1/2 cup water1/2 cup agave nectar3 tablespoons vietnamese chili garlic sauce1 1/2 tablespoons low-sodium soy saucebring this to a boil, then turn down and simmer for about 5 minutes.  remove the pan from the heat. then stir in 1 tablespoon potato starch mixed with 1 tablespoon cold water. this will thicken the mixture quickly. store in a jar or bottle in the refrigerator. ****************the third sauce that i made this morning is a version of chinese vegan stir-fry sauce. this is not the same product as  chinese vegetarian "oyster" sauce or chinese "mushroom" stir-fry sauce. (i plan to work on that one soon.) but just a little bit can add good flavor to a marinade or veggie stir-fry.bryanna's homemade vegan multi-purpose chinese stir-fry saucemales 1 1/4 cupswhisk in a small saucepan:1/2 cup lower-sodium soy sauce (see above)1/2 cup low-sodium vegan "chikn" broth or veggie broth1 tablespoon cornstarch1 tablespoon agave nectar or your favorite sugar sub1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger (or a bit of ground ginger)a good dash of garlic granules1 tablespoon of dark chinese (toasted) sesame oil1 tsp un-salted rice vinegarbring to a low boil, then turn down to a low simmer and cook until thickened. allow to cool off, then store in a tightly covered jar or bottle in the refrigerated.enjoy!
