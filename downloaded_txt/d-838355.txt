make your special dayunforgettably magical…when people first get to the reception for the cocktail hour, the bridal party is usually taking a break or taking photographs with the photographer.having a close-up magician mixing and mingling keeps all your guests entertained while the bride & groom are transitioning from the wedding ceremony to the reception.  more importantly, a lot of your guests may not know each other and the cocktail hour can turn into small groups awkwardly standing around waiting for the arrival of the bride & groom and for the reception to officially begin. having close-up strolling magic will get people involved and interacting, loosening up the room and getting people talking with each other. it creates a great buzz in the room and sets the stage for the entrance of the bridal party.during dinner service, whether you are having a formal sit-down style dinner service or a buffet service, there will be tables of people waiting to eat and tables of people who have already eaten waiting on everyone else to finish.  having strolling close-up magic going from table to table keeps the guests who are waiting engaged and entertained.  no one is sitting around bored waiting for the next event in your wedding reception.  your guests are enjoying every moment of dinner service and feeling connected, feeling that they are truly a part of the celebration!special gift for the bride & grooma truly magical souveniryou will treasure forever…hank morfin has a signature effect that he closes his stage shows with that involves a photograph.  it is a truly emotional and magical piece ending in a spectacular moment of magic captured forever in a photograph!  for your special day, hank will personalize this effect by using a photograph of the bride & groom performed and presented to the happy couple in front of everyone.  if you have hank entertaining your guest only for the cocktail hour then he will perform this just before dinner service or if you are savvy enough to hire hank to entertain through dinner service then he will perform this right after dinner service before all the other key elements of your special day begin.  it is an incredibly special piece of entertainment which becomes an integral part of your wedding reception and leaves the bride & groom with an unbelievable magical souvenir to commemorate your special day that you will display on your shelf, hang on your wall or put into your wedding album.  every time you look at it, it will bring you right back to those special moments!  it is a very special gift from hank to you and is included in all our bridal magic packages.




“michele and i asked hank to perform his magic at our wedding last year on may 20th 2018. hank was brilliant and amazing!!!  hank was so very personal and entertaining with all our guests as young as 8 and as old as 91.  hank is truly gifted in the world of magic!!!  i would highly recommend hank for all your magic needs, weddings, private parties and corporate events. ”
