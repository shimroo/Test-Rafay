welcome to tmi episcopal (grades 6-12)
located in the texas hill country, just 20 miles from downtown san antonio, tmi episcopal is a coed, college-preparatory school for students in grades 6-12. its rich history dates back to 1893 when the school was founded by the episcopal diocese of west texas and has grown to become the excellent academic community it is today.  from honors and advanced placement courses, a wide range of fine art and athletic activities, and the optional, distinguished jrotc program to the school’s dedication to service and leadership, tmi is a place for students to engage, learn, and grow into the well-rounded leaders of tomorrow.
