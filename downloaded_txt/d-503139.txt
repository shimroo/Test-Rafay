youth development 















 the y is the starting point for many youths to learn about becoming and staying active and developing healthy habits they’ll carry with them throughout their lives. moreover, the benefits are far greater than just physical health. whether it’s gaining the confidence that comes from learning to swim or building the positive relationships that lead to good sportsmanship and teamwork, participating in sports at the y is about building the whole child, from the inside out.



healthy living















because we know that healthy lifestyles are achieved through nurturing mind, body and spirit, well-being and fitness at the y are so much more than just working out. beyond fitness facilities, we provide educational programs to promote healthier decisions and offer a variety of programs that support physical, intellectual and spiritual strength.  at the y, it’s not about the activity you choose as much as it is about the benefits of living healthier on the inside as well as the outside.



social responsibility















there is no other nonprofit quite like the y. be a part of a cause committed to moving people and communities forward. at the y, we are committed to providing support to our neighbors and opportunities for kids, adults and families to give, join in or advocate in the name of stronger communities.  at the y, you can take an active role in bringing about meaningful, enduring change right in your own neighborhood.
