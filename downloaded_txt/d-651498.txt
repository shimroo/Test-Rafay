bulbs!

	      looking to buy a projector lamp?  we have acquired the stock
	      of two camera stores
	      that have recently closed.  we have literally thousands of hard to find
	      bulbs for all sorts
	      of equipment dating from the 1940's on through current models.  
buy projector lamp! buy projector bulb!
	      buy slide projector lamp! buy slide projector bulb!
	      buy movie projector lamp! buy movie projector bulb!
	      buy theatre lamp! buy theatre bulb!
	      buy stage lighting!
	      
	      our  main concern here is to get them into the hands of people who need
	      them....
	      if you are not a reseller and want the bulb to maintain your vintage
	      projector;
	      call us first.  we will not price gouge.  often you will find our
	      price
	      to be a fraction of the bulb's actual retail price!
to check our inventory;  enter our site and click on "hard to
	      find lamps"

varies!
	      ask us
	      before 
	      you buy
	      elsewhere!
