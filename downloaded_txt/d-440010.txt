office updates









neffy® (epinephrine nasal spray)

neffy was recently approved for treatment of anaphylactic reactions. neffy is a single spray device. neffy is approved for patients weighing 66 lb or more.studies leading to its approval were performed on healthy volunteers. it was not tested in patients experiencing anaphylaxis.neffy resulted in a similar increase in blood pressure and heart rate as injectable epinephrine. however, blood concentrations of epinephrine were lower after neffy than after epipen administration.the effectiveness of neffy may also be affected by various nasal conditions, including the presence of nasal polyps or severe nasal congestion which may be part of the initial presentation of an allergic reaction.lastly, neffy may not be covered by your insurance. we are providing prescriptions for neffy, but given the availability of injectable alternatives, prior authorization assistance will not be provided by our office.





covid-19 office policy

masks will be optional in our office. if you are sick, recently exposed to someone who is sick or unvaccinated to covid, due to the risks to young children, pregnant women, the elderly, immunosuppressed individuals, etc., we kindly request that you continue to wear a mask while in our office or consider making your appointment virtual. thank you for your assistance. 





flu shots

flu shots are available in our greenwich & norwalk offices starting on monday october 14, 2024. please call to schedule yours! we still encourage patients to seek a high dose flu shot elsewhere. we continue to encourage all eligible patients to be immunized against covid and to get all recommended boosters.

what our patients are saying







“awesome team! dr. mark litchman is super knowledgeable on allergies, thorough and really cares about his patients. the allergy shot scheduling system is convenient and efficient and the staff is kind and caring as well. parking is usually no problem at all. i checked in advance re: insurance so i have had zero trouble with any billing matters. i’m grateful to have help combatting these allergies, it has made a huge difference! highly recommend this office and team.”-pearl c., via google reviews








“dr. litchman figured out a protocol to treat my allergies. he also referred me to a wonderful ent at yale. out of everyone i've seen in many years, he's the first m.d. to actually make an improvement in my condition.” -charles lee, via google reviews








“my entire family sees dr. louit. very knowledgeable and very good bed side manner. we are taking shots ,never had an issue, they have accommodated me even on short notice. if you take a break from your shots, you will need to start back up..it's just the way the shots work, i don't think this has anything to do with their work ethics or patient service. overall we are very happy.”-jayasudha reddy- joseph (jaya), via google reviews








“great place. litchman is super. been going here for years and it could not be more convenient, well run and easy to work with for allergy shots (me and one of our younger kids all happy customers).”-michael bego, via google reviews
