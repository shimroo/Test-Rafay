what is it?


long ago i used to keep addresses, phone numbers and other personal information in old windows 3.1 cardfile, which i missed in microsoft windows 95. 
					   the alternatives (ms scheduler, ms outlook) were either too complex or inconvenient to use. 
					   i just needed a simple, small notebook with the ability to locate an item quickly without any predefined fields (street addresses, zip, state, phone, fax, etc.).
in early 1998 i decided to make such an application myself. 
					   until now it helps me, as a disordered person, to keep all things in one heap, but easy to find what i need.
					   this small application is equally suitable for use as a small "database" for references, notes, addresses, links, recipes... or anything else you want quick access to.
decades passed. everybody moved to mobile apps, kept notes in cloud storage, but i still get a lot of old windows azzcardfile support requests.
  					   that means hundreds of people are still using azzcardfile and it's time to release an improved version of it.

try it!
