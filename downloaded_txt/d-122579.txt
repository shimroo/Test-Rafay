 rutherfordton

/ forest city nc: the camper pros 
if you like to camp and to move about the united states at your own pace, an rv just might be the way to go for you. although not for everybody, many folks are finding out that going full time in an rv can be a rewarding experience. changing to this type of lifestyle requires a huge amount of planning and also deciding on what type of rv to buy. if you are going to be an occasional week end type of person then a small rv would be just the ticket. on the other hand if you want a full-time camping experience you will want to look at one of the mega fifth wheels as your choice. 
if you like camping, you will certainly like the rv experience. it is like camping in luxury. you can still have your outside fires and bar b q your favorite meals but instead of sleeping in the heat or cold, you can crawl up on your soft mattress with a good book while still being surrounded by nature. 
the important thing to remember is that having an rv should be fun, not a chore. if it is more of a chore, it is probably not for you. rv stands for recreational vehicle and that is how it should feel.
          

travelling in your rv can allow you to see many more sights because of the money you will save from staying at a conventional hotel. in fact, many of the amenities that you enjoy at most hotels are present at many rv parks across the united states. most provide power, cable and internet with your plot rental. 
before either buying or embarking on your first trip, it is important to consult with experts of the trade. sites such as  can provide you with all sorts of information from how to buy an rv to cleaning your black tank. you can also get a feel for some of the rv parks that the author has stayed at to see if they are a match for your needs. 
in addition to knowing what to buy and where to go, you will need to learn all the basics about rv maintenance. the above site will teach you all you need to know about checking your engine and troubleshooting various common problems. 

        you will also want to learn all about your rv by reading the owner's manual from start to finish. features on every rv are different so you will want to familiarize yourself with all the specifics to get the most enjoyment out of your new toy. 
there is one factor that many folks simply do not think about and that is the clearance of the vehicle. know your height and be sure your route does not have any height restricted bridges, just as a trucker would. giving your rv a haircut would certainly make for a bad day on the road. 
once you do all your research and you are ready to go, visit us at the camper pros and review some of our great videos and follow the depreys as they travel across the great usa in their 43 foot rig and volvo diesel pusher. they will show you how to handle full time rv living with a hint of humor. the depreys will also show you how to run a full time business while on the road! they now run a fulltime pc business right from their rig all while looking at mountains or perhaps the ocean as their daily view.
