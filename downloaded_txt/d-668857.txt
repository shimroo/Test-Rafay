i’ve been going to harvard square eye care for about 10 years now. they do a great job with both the optometrist/ eye exam part and the glasses fitting. i have somewhat complex vision issues due to glaucoma, and i have found the optometrists here very knowledgeable and helpful, even though i’m under regular care with an ophthalmologist elsewhere
