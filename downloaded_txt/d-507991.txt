  buzzerblog moves tonight!  


 saturday, september 30, 2006 


this was a long time coming, but we finally finished the site.  buzzerblog at blogger has reached its end.  we had just about enough of the server downage time and our restrictions, so we decided it was time to go.  we are moving to flashgames^2 as of tonight at midnight.  here is our address situation:www.buzzerblog.com- still works.  you can keep this.buzzerblog.blogspot.com- will be up for a bit for archive purposes, but will disappear in a few weeks/monthsbuzzerblog.flashgameshows.com- this will be buzzer's new source address.again, www.buzzerblog.com will still work, but we are moving sites.  what is in store for the new site?  we are adding categories, so you can track all stories about "deal or no deal", gsn, and that sort of thing.  we are adding spoilers of that day's shows and some opinion/editorial posts down the line.  you readers are free to ask to write anything by emailing us at buzzerblog@flashgameshows.com.  the site looks nearly the same.  the attitude of the site will be the same.  our home has changed, and we are absolutely thrilled to be working with the extremely talented chris colbourne and dan berger.  we'd like to thank you for your time here at blogger and hope you enjoy the new home even more.-alex davisbuzzerblog.flashgameshows.combuzzerblog.com

  des lynam quits countdown at christmas  





the host of the hit uk game show "countdown", des lynam, will be leaving the show at christmas, his publicist said.  the 64 year old host said he would leave now and save the "wear and tear", while co-host carol vorderman stated that he was "amazing" and a hit with his fans.  the studio move from leeds to london has been scrapped.  i've seen some episodes of the show, and it is something i would truly love to see come to america.  but on the uk front, does anyone else feel that ms. vorderman could easily carry the show on her own?gameshowvideos.com has a very funny clip of countdown with both lynam and vorderman.

  british "1 vs. 100" pictures  


 friday, september 29, 2006 


 here are a few pictures from the uk "1 vs. 100" set, which is relatively similar to the us set.  however, i still think we, by far, have the superior rules.  nbc starts "1 vs. 100" as a five-week event starting friday, october 13th at 9pm et.

  new gsn website  


 wednesday, september 27, 2006 


gsn released a brand new website tonight, and pretty nice if you ask me.  take a look.  it's not as clunky this time around, and much nicer on the eyes.  i have to be honest, after talking to a lot of the staffers, that gsn crew is one of the hardest working and nicest i've ever been able to do things with, and their tech/web staff is just amazing.

  rumor contorl: temptation (sale of the century) in the usa?  





there was a teaster posting on craigslist a bit ago about a show involving shopping looking for contestants.  it was from a "major production company" and was a "popular game show", which meant it had to be established at some point.  now comes this new posting. new craigslist possible temptation postingpeople must fly to australia.  it involves shopping with extreme discounts from money you earn.  this basically has to be temptation, doesn't it?  i really hope this is, because temptation is one of the best game shows that has been on tv in a very long time.  for those of you that don't know, "temptation" is the revival of "sale of the century", an old 80s game show, currently shown in australia and recently sold to south africa.  unless i'm completely wrong, and please tell me if i am, this is really looking like "temptation" is coming to america.

 tuesday, september 26, 2006 


is "whose line is it anyway?" the show with more primetime hours than any show in a long time, if not one of the top ever? it's been on us primetime since about 1998. abc family has aired a monday superblock for a few weeks plus new episodes, and now there is a three hour block of it on fridays. comedy central played with it in the 8:30pm slot before "the colbert report" started. bbc america is airing it at 8-9pm et and 11-12pm et. now fans can watch it when they'd like at home. warner brothers released "whose line is it anyway?" season one:volume one, containing the first ten episodes of the us run of the improv comedy (game) show that has been on the air internationally since 1988. at a price of $26.97, the dvd will come in two formats: the edition seen on abc and an uncensored edition. each edition will contain never-before-seen footage as well.

  networks pump out new game shows  


 monday, september 25, 2006 


hot on the heels of the popular nbc game show "deal or no deal" major networks are now coming out with their own formats, most of which already covered here.  abc has two game shows in their protection.  one of which is "set for life", which will see people stand on a tile and hope it's a good one and not a bad one.  think "deal or no deal" for non-lazy people, or even a complete ripoff of "powerball: instant millionaire".  this game has moved up from its projected december release to november.  also, as reported abc picked up the fox show "show me the money"-then-"show me what you got"-now-"show me the money" according to craigslist.  this show, which might be rather interesting, will see contestants answer trivia questions, with each right answer multiplying their money possibly into the millions or a wrong answer forcing a contestant to lose ungodly sums of money.fox is releasing their trivia show "the rich list" in late fall.  "the rich list" will see contestants name items off a list, whether it be beatles albums or state capitals.  the winning team gets to go to the bonus round, where they can win up to $250,000 (according to early runs).  also, a team can stay on the show as long as they win.  nbc will debut their trivia game show "1 vs. 100", hosted by bob saget, in either november or december.  this goes against their original september 11th projected premiere date, which would have rushed the show to air.  recently, abc dropped "the con test"/"pokerface" and has projected to have lost the rights to "who wants to be a millionaire."  on the cable front, gsn will debut the foreign game show "that's the question", hosted by bob goen, on october 2nd at 6:00pm et.as a little side note, i often get emails asking when new episodes of "i've got a secret" will be made, and quite frankly, we don't know when and if they will be made.  however, you guys can help.  be sure to click here to email gsn and ask for it to come back, go to the request-o-matic, or go to the gsn buzz to speak your mind about it.
