|mtv hits]so, i've been working from home this week since my car's in the shop.  failed emissions, so it's gonna be about $1300 in repairs, ugh!anyway, on a good note, i was listening to mtv hits while working and on came the new song for the james bond movie "quantum of solace".  it's a duet by jack white and alicia keys.  i think it's an amazing song.  it's very stylistic and technically classic.  the song is "another way to die".  love it!!!

|pandora - randomness]i have a coworker that shares her birthday with mine.  so, she made me double peanut butter cookies and i made her pink lemonade cupcakes (b/c she liked the ones i made a couple of months ago).  so here's a couple of pics of the cup cakes.also, my mom sent me an e-card for my birthday.  she knows i'm gay, but doesn't really know about the "bear" community.  i laughed so hard at this the irony that i almost pissed myself!  it's actually quite dirty!  hawt!http://www.hallmark.com/ecardweb/ecv.jsp?a=eg4103072933805m273657896y&product_id=

|pandora - randomness]a couple of coworkers and i started pondering this and i thought it was a very interesting idea.the thought was, what would happen if we repeal the 17th amendment, which provides for the direct election of senators, and replace this amendment with a random selection from the populous of each state.  the selected person must fill some basic requirements, such as:1) have at least a high school diploma or equivalency2) pass a federal background check3) pass a mental health checkthe nominated person will serve 1 term, be compensated with a base salary, and complimented with a bonus after being graded by the constituents on the nominee's performance while in term.  after their term, they get an additional year's salary for service to the people to give the nominee time to find a job (instead of requiring their previous employer to hire them back).  maybe even give them 5 yrs of no income tax.someone suggested that the nominee wouldn't be required to accept the position, but i'm leaning a little toward making it mandatory.  the idea of civil service should be the one of the highest honors place on an individual.what are your thoughts?talk amongst yourselves and post what you come up with...

|pandora - evanescence - "whisper"]taken from http://gizmodo.com/5050639/mccain-aide-john-mccain-invented-the-blackberry:when asked for comment, obama's campaign spokesman bill burton said: "if john mccain hadn't said that 'the fundamentals of our economy are strong' on the day of one of our nation's worst financial crises, the claim that he invented the blackberry would have been the most preposterous thing said all week." oh snap, bill burton!

|pandora - feist - "limit to your love"]i did a lot of driving this weekend... saturday was up to chattanooga and sunday was down to warner robins.in chattavegas, it was a rugby day!  the atlanta bucks played the b-side of chattanooga.  it was a hard game and we lost.  i came out near the end of the first half as i got stepped on in my stomach.  i'm ok and i had 40 min to ice it while the 2nd half was played (i was out of the game at that point).  we put in a good first 5-10 min, but everything kinda went downhill after their first score.  i think the newer players weren't ready for this.  i have to give props to the new guys... they played a great first game. (230 miles round-trip)for sunday, my mom had been in town to take care of my sister after some minor surgery.  my brother was selling his house on monday, which happens to be my parents old house and the house that i was born and grew up in.  so i drove my mom down to wr to visit my brother's family and to see the old house.  i took a bunch of pictures, which i'll post later.  they're mainly just the house.  the outside has mostly stayed the same, but my brother has done a lot of improvements on the inside. after being recruited to move a few things, i stopped at the rec center near the house where i used to play soccer.  then we headed to my brother's new house.  after we dropped off the few items i was going to help with, my mom and i stopped at the old church (sacred heart) and elementary school of the same name.  i was so surprised that they had built a new church on property taken over from rafb.  the old church was still on the property, but i think they closed it due to mold.  after that we headed back to atlanta... that's a long time talking to my mom.  (218 miles round-trip)
