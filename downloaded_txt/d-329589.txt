what it means to be a part of rc...





joe welch
dean of student activities/ german teacher
âthere are many things that make rc special, but the first and foremost are the students. the campus is gorgeous and the location amazing, but it is the interaction with these amazing kids that make it all worthwhile. i get to teach young men and women, who want to learn and are ready to be challenged.â





bilge tayyar
rc 20, graduate
âat rc, i learned that i can and should question societal norms. rc is a multicultural environment, therefore many different ideas take root here. we are allowed to be ourselves and experience what we want. at the same time, students learn to respect one another. this is what i love most about rc and, and what sets it apart from other schools.â





mehmet uysal
turkish language and literature department head
âone essential thing about this school is that rc always respects and believes in its community. rc respects and nourishes diversity, making possible a free environment for each individual.â

									âi feel that i was empowered at rc to become more courageous in going after things i want in life. i was involved in many activities at rc, and that taught me to appreciate the importance of teamwork. and finally, the friends i made at rc are still the people closest to me and their support through the thick and thin has made me the person that i am today.â
								
nil gã¼ral, rc 07, biomedical engineer, mit






									âif i werenât a robert college graduate, would i be so successful? i donât know. but there is one thing i know; that underlying many of my successful efforts is the fact that i am from robert college."
								
hã¼snã¼ ãzyeäin, ra 63, business person






									âwhen i look back, i see that i have learned the value of individualism at this school. i also learned here that there must be a struggle before every achievement and that nothing comes easy with shortcuts.â
