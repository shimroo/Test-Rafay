computer video editing magazine closes
its doors
editor bob crabtree
moves onto the net, relaunching
dvdoctor as  "world-best" video editing & authoring site
computer
video editing magazine was closed without warning in early december
2004 and the extracts you see on this page are from the last issue
published - feb, 05.
the magazine's launch-to-burial
editor, bob crabtree left publisher hhc
mid january and has been working since to set up what he and his
colleagues at dvdoctor intend will be the "world's best" web site for
video editing and dvd authoring and all associated hardware and
software.

check out phase-one, on the home page, and by visiting the new-look, enhanced dvforums available for help 24/7.
digital
video editing software
pinnacle liquid edition 6 pro
with
version 5 of edition pro, pinnacle introduced a combined agp graphics
card and real-time accelerator. for the new, feature-packed, v6, this
is replaced by an external box with no acceleration - requiring the
user's pc to already have a powerful cpu and graphics card.
in the previous incarnation of liquid edition pro - v5 -
pinnacle provided an agp graphics card that doubled as a real-time
accelerator. this was a good solution, feeding video overlay out
through analogue channels for high-quality monitoring on a tv set, but
the board had the disadvantage of only supporting one computer monitor,
and left users stuck with one particular graphics card rather than
being able to upgrade to something better. more...

digital
video editing software
pinnacle studio plus 9
the
latest version of pinnacle's well-spec'd budget video editor adds a lot
of welcome new features, but is it any more trustworthy than what's
gone before?
pinnacle
has always amazed us with its studio software for entry-level dv
editing. unlike many other programs at this level, studio has been
designed with the actual job of editing in mind, rather than simply
being loaded with tacky special effects. the interface is visual and
intuitive, and the package on the whole has always been packed with
genuinely useful (and often quite ingenious) features. in recent years,
however, we've been equally amazed at the program's flakiness and
pinnacle's inability to keep studio's head above water. more... 
three-ccd
consumer camcorder
panasonic nv-gs400b
panasonic's
nv-gs400b looks to be an appealing package, but is it good enough to
steal the sony dcr-trv950's mantle as the best low-cost, semi-pro
three-chip camcorder?
although
the top end of the prosumer market is hotly contested by sony's vx2100
and canon's xl1s - along with some of the cheaper professional models -
there are fewer choices for those with less than £2,000 to spend.
canon's xm2 is a great camcorder, but for value, sony's three-ccd
dcr-trv900 and its replacement, the 950, have been hard to beat.
however, sony has discontinued the trv950, and replaced it with the
dcr-hc1000. but this is aimed at a slightly different audience, leaving
vacant an important slot in the market. more...

three-ccd
consumer camcorder
sony dcr-hc1000
can sony's new
sub-£1,000 three-chipper live up to the hugely popular dcr-trv950
it replaces?
the dcr-hc1000 marks a change of direction for sony. even
though it's supposedly the successor to the dcr-trv950, it's a rather
different beast. for a start, the trv range has been discontinued in
favour of hc, which is rather more consumer-oriented. as a result, the
hc1000 is intended to be a lot more automated, while maintaining the
high video quality its heritage would imply. 
the camera body itself is a completely new design. the combined tape
transport and hand stock rotates, like a sharp viewcam. more... 
graphics
tablet 
wacom intuos 3
wacom's
graphics tablets have found a home in many video editors toolkits since
they started coming available so cheaply, but do higher-spec'd models
merit attention? the intuos 3 range boasts increased sensitivity and a
programmable keyset. we take a look at the a4 version.
the
appeal of graphics pads that enable direct input with a stylus is clear
when they cost less than £50 - as was the case with the volito
when we looked at the a6 version. the last wacom package to grab our
attention was the a5-sized graphire 3 studio xl - which was made even
more attractive by the inclusion of pinnacle's studio editing program
and adobe's photoshop elements image manipulation software, although it
carried a weightier price-tag of £180. more...
