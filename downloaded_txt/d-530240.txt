putting research into action to improve lives


we aim to improve the lives of low-income children and their families by delivering our research to advocates and policymakers seeking to craft effective policies that promote healthy child development, and strong, nurturing families that are economically secure.
we delve into issues that contribute to child poverty and make sure our ideas reach those in a position to make meaningful change that reduces the number of families experiencing hardship.






our recent publications and resources


our research sheds light into all areas of children and their families who are living in poverty, covering early childhood education, public benefits, paid family leave, immigration, disability, and mental health.
