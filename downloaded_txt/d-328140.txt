    pure magic
 travel through a dazzling wonderland of over 750,00 lights at bright nights at forest park. this three-mile drive-thru spectacular features festive scenes, iconic characters, and peaceful gardens, all illuminated for a joyous holiday experience.since 1995, bright nights has been a unique public/private collaboration between the city of springfield’s department of parks, buildings & recreation management and the spirit of springfield, a private non-profit organization. together they have welcomed more than 7 million visitors. it has been calculated that if every bus that had visited were lined bumper to bumper, they would go from springfield to cape cod. the cars would go as far as california.
