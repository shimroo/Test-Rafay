about us
making a statement and living by it are two very different concepts to reconcile. at titan, it's what defines us. our employees are reminded that they are craftsmen and craftswomen before all else. pride in craftsmanship is our mantra. at titan, we do not compromise on quality or sacrifice performance for speed and sheer profit. that's not what we're about. we produce world class products that we're proud of, products that we ourselves would choose to use. after that, we figure everything else will fall in line.
