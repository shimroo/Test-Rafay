genealogy site for david k. woods

a couple of notes:
1.  this applet requires version 1.2.2 of the java runtime engine.  if you don't have it, you will be asked if you want to download it.  once it is downloaded, you must install it before returning to this web site.  it takes a little time, but is worth it.
2.  this applet reads a considerable amount of data (over 1/2 meg) when it starts up.  if you are on a slow line, please be patient, as this takes a couple of minutes.
3.  this applet is designed for systems running in 800 x 600 resolution screen mode or higher.
4.  you can click anything in blue.  if you click the person who is at the root of the tree, you will get an individual family display.
5.  if you have any comments, or want to find out how to get your family data set up with this interface, please e-mail me at drshrink@home.net.  in fact, since this site is new, please send me a quick e-mail telling me if the java applet worked or not and what os and browser combination you are using.  i see that a few people have found it, but i can't tell if people are getting what i expect.
that being said, this is the family tree for david woods.
