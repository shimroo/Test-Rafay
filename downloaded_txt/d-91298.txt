trans tasman
nov 17


          this is a biennial event between australia and new zealand, held every even year since 1996.
          it was held in new zealand this year.
        
each player plays 24 games of scrabble over three days in a double team round robin i.e. each of the 12 players from each country plays each of the 12 from the opposing country twice. an intense three days of scrabble with 288 games in all. 
congratulations to new zealand who won the event this time 165 to 123, for the first time since 2010. the best player overall was howard warner who won 18 of his 24 matches. the top australian was russell honeybun who won 16. a full breakdown is on the nz elixs site.

new zealand did a superb job of streaming one game each round with commentary by several international and australasian commentators. the streams are still there to watch on youtube.
