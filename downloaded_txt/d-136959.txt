our mission






to cooperatively meet the evolving needs of all learners, educators, and district partners.




















our vision






as an educational organization, monroe one actively engages in fostering an equitable, diverse, and inclusive culture that will empower every student, family, and staff to grow and thrive.




















equity pillars



expand all




commitment

monroe one is committed to being a champion for diversity, equity, and inclusion. this includes identifying and eliminating racism, institutional bias, and inequitable practices that have an adverse impact on those of all social identities. these values are at the core of who we are as we continue to provide the opportunity for all to succeed.  
this will be done while remaining committed to the overall mission of a boces; to serve our students and school partners while being fiscally responsible and meeting their individualized needs. monroe one is committed to doing so in a transparent and efficient manner so that all school staff, students, families, and school partners are active participants in the decisions made. by continuously evolving and understanding, we will foster a school community where everyone is included.





collaboration

collaboration is the foundation of a boces organization. as part of a cooperative network, we operate within a well-defined structure of accountability for effectiveness and efficiency. we partner with and support school districts and students as educators for all ages and abilities. we will collaborate with our internal and external partners in the leveling of power and privilege so that every voice matters. we understand relationships are at the heart of growth and healing. as leaders in education, we are dedicated to working with our partners in identifying and supporting actions and policies that centers on learning for all. 





community

we envision a school community where everyone is included. we will actively engage in work around diversity, equity, and inclusion. this includes identifying and addressing inequitable practices to ensure a culture where all feel safe and supported. this will be done by bringing diverse voices from our community into the conversation, so those of all social identities are heard. the commitment to these values is unwavering.





compassion

to be a fully inclusive and equitable community, it requires a mindset steeped in compassion and a willingness to connect. to generate real change, we must provide a learning and working environment where people are respected and appreciated. this allows individuals of all backgrounds to share a safe space in understanding and connecting with one another. it aligns with our restorative and trauma-responsive practices which centers around the social-emotional wellness of all staff, students, their families, and the community.
