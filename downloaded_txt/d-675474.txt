learn laughter yoga for health and happiness
are you stressed out, depressed and having health problems? do you want to bring more
                    laughter and joy into your life? laughter yoga is the right choice for you.
                    laughter yoga (ly) is not a comedy. it is an exercise program developed by indian physician
                    dr madan kataria where anyone can laugh without relying on humour, jokes or comedies. it is
                    practised in more than 110 countries. 
it combines laughter exercises with yoga breathing techniques (pranayama) which brings more
                    oxygen to our body and brain making us feel more energetic and healthy. ten to 15 minutes of
                    ly exercises can reduce stress, make your immune system stronger and keep your mind positive
                    during challenging times.
