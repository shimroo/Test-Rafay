 stray no more, inc., is a 501c3, not-for-profit, volunteer organization dedicated to reducing the number of animals euthanized in palm beach county through our pet education and permanent care of fostered pets. it was co-founded in july 1994 in an effort to rescue 50 dogs that were abandoned after hurricane andrew struck south florida (homestead & miami).
stray no more is run completely by volunteers. over the years, three of our volunteers have been awarded palm beach county animal care and control kindness award. stray no more also ran a series of very successful p.e.t.s club in area schools for over 20 years.
donated money is tax deductible and 100% goes to benefit the animals, not people!
