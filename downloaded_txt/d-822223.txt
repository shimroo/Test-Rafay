i'm back!





yeah, i know... it's been a while.between the last year with work and some overseas travel, i've been really busy and really had no time to post. spending the lion's share of that time with the most beautiful woman in the world is a huge reason...anyway, i'm back writing... not going to know really how frequent it'll be, but i'll be writing as much as i can because i'll be back at work here in a few days...every year before i start back to work i have a complete physical... and since turning 40 i mean complete physical... working the job i do you have to have one, which is no real problem, and since my doctor here in town is pretty cool and i can talk to him. that's a definite plus.so yesterday i go and get my physical... poked, prodded, vampires come and take my blood... lab work came back normal i found out today. still a little congested from a cold i caught on the flight from sydney, but other than that i'm just doing spiffy!ekg reading says the old ticker is doing fine, in fact my doctor tells me i've got the heart of an eighteen year old, pumping along nice and strong. lungs are clear and my flexibility is just fine. psa is great too, no trouble passing a nice strong steam so no worries about prostate troubles.no problems with the weight, although he did suggest i rearrange it a little and get rid of the spare tire i have, so i've started doing crunches today, which i absolutely hate. but i'm still at the optimum weight for my height, 200 lbs at 6'2" and my flexibility is really good. which i attribute to my ongoing practice of thai kwan do and aikido i started doing while i was in the army, which i never gave up on.he complimented me on my full head of hair... going a little gray now, but him being only a few years older than me and almost completely bald, told me he's quite jealous of my locks... so no worries about going bald there... for a long, long time!next came the "male" question... "you're pushing 46 here tommy... do you think you might need a little help? i can write you a script for viagra or cialis maybe?"doc, no problem there at all... i've been having the best sex of my life... i can go two and three times a day and could drive nails with the equipment, no hydraulic problems there!so all in all i got a clean bill of health... ticker is good, hydraulics work great and i've got a lot of years ahead of me to spend even more time with the most beautiful woman in the world!copyright 2011 thomas j wolfenden

yes you are...





a little blast form rt's past...sunday, june 05, 2005     what year is this?        or should i ask, what century are we in? the apartment next to  mine is being used as a substation for the local rescue squad on the  weekends, and what started as a real pissing contest with one of the  paramedics has become a pretty good friendship. yesterday was fairly  good weather-wise after four days of continuos rain, so around 2 pm i  decided to sit outside on my tailgate and shoot the shit with my buddy. we  were sitting there and he was keeping up his steady but good humored  pressure to get me to join the athens volunteer fire department, and i  was kindly declining (everyone else runs out of burning buildings and he  want’s me to run into them? not.) when we noticed a little neighborhood  drama unfolding at the house across the street from our complex. i  had seen what we both believe is the owner of the house several times,  just sitting on the front porch drinking beer. neither of us thinks this  guy has a job. as we’re watching him drink himself into his afternoon  drunk, a minivan pulls into the driveway and a harried woman emerges  with five kids. the kids all run into the house, and the woman starts  unloading several grocery sacks. we both counted seventy-two, by the  way. it took her several trips from the van to the house and back, and  twice the bags broke, spilling the contents down the driveway. not once did this guy get off his ass to help what i believe was his wife with the groceries. neither did her kids.i  don’t know about you, but i wasn’t raised that way. even if i were  drunk, i’d have been at the van before she even stopped and would be  unloading the groceries and i would have been kicking the kids’ asses  for not even attempting to help. it gets better. she finally gets done unloading the groceries and he yells to her to bring out another beer for him. my buddy and i just look at each other in amazement. the balls on this guy. she brought out a beer for him and they exchange words we can’t hear. we see her nod and she goes off behind the house. i  so wanted to say or do something, like beat the living shit out of this  guy when the wife came back around to the front of the house with a push lawnmower and started to mow the front lawn. i’m not talking about a gas powered push-type lawnmower, but an honest-to-god pusher mower, the kind with the big cylinder blades... from the 1920’s or something. he  is not only at this time watching her mow the front lawn with this  medieval grass manicuring device while he rapidly gets drunk, he starts  to yell at her about missed spots and to re-mow other areas because she  didn’t do it right the first time. i’m seething at this time, and  my paramedic friend is talking me though my obvious impending  near-eruption... i’m about to go ballistic. he doesn’t want to have to  treat this asshole for any damage i would most probably inflict, and he  also doesn’t want to have to bail me out of jail for attempted homicide,  justified or not. he succeeds in calming me down, and i light another  winston. what a complete shit this guy is. my friend and i  talk this over and decide this kind of behavior is endemic in this  area. the appalachians i’m referring to. i saw the same kind of stuff,  though not as blatant in appalachian pennsylvania also so it’s not just a  southern thing, so i'm not implying that. it was like a return to the dark ages. i  wasn’t the best husband in the world when i was married, but jesus! i  did more than my fair share of the housework and helped my ex all the  time. it was the way i was raised, i guess. my father wouldn’t be caught  dead acting like this asshole, and i believe my father raised me right.  you’re supposed to put women on a pedestal. open doors for them. carry  the umbrella when it’s raining. carry the groceries in. mow the fucking yard. the  saddest part of this little story isn’t the asshole husband, it’s the  wife putting up with this bullshit, and the very real fact that the kids  will grow up to believe this is the proper behavior and the right way  to treat women. it tends to be passed down from generation to  generation. i know what you’re thinking... why didn’t my  friend and myself go over there and help? well, from experience, we both  knew it would have made matters worse for the woman and the kids. he  would have taken what little kindness we would offer as an affront to  his manhood, and she would have probably gotten a good beating later for  our efforts. i will tell you this though. i’m a firm believer in that some people are alive merely because it’s illegal to kill them.   copyright 2005 thomas j wolfenden
