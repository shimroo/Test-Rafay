civilization calls

























july 07, 2005



we are with you, britain

we hold you in our hearts and minds and prayers. 
let us all stand together and cry no more!.
let the words of france and spain and russia and germany be more than the empty platitudes they proved to be not very long ago, on another black day.
let us all join together to hunt down and destroy the cowardly forces of barbarism currently cloaked in jihadist islam.
let the terrorists resposible for planning and carrying out the attack in london be fearful â britain has sometimes been likened to a slumbering giant, but never forget that the british once ruled most of the known world.
you have pricked the lion.
awake, britannia. you will not fight alone. america is with you.

the islamofascists should recall the words of admiral yamamoto in wwii: "we have awakened a sleeping giant and have instilled in him a terrible resolve". first we will pray to the diety of our choice for the healing and safety of our brothers across the pond. then we will hunt down the cowards responsible for this act, and make them wish that they didn't believe in an afterlife.
and welcome back, linda.
