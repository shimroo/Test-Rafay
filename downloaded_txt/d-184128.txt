featured golden: champ






















champ is a loving 92-pound golden looking for a caring home. he was diagnosed with glaucoma and lost his sight in may 2024. grrom covered his medical expenses which included removing champ’s painful eyes and giving him beautiful prosthetic eyes. champ has made a full recovery and is eager to explore the yard in his foster home. his favorite activities include going for walks, chewing on toys, and cuddling with you.champ knows basic commands like sit and shake, and he comes when called with clapping. he waits patiently to eat, as he loves food. a fenced yard would keep him safe due to his blindness. while he interacts well with other dogs, he would prefer to be the only pet. he is indifferent to cats and gets along with children, but he thrives best in a quieter adult environment.champ struggles with travel and anxiety in a moving vehicle, something his foster family is working on with him. if you work from home, or spend a lot of time around the house, champ would love to be your “furever” companion.
