sara janz and roz varon 







honoring sara janz
 



beloved wife of staff sergeant darien jackson. loving daughter of roz varon and edward janz. dear sister of amy (neomi luna) janz and brian janz. 



it is with deep sadness that we share the heartbreaking news of the passing of sara janz, a brilliant and beloved young woman, at the age of 29. sara’s life was far too short, but her leadership, dedication and compassion will long be remembered by those whose lives she touched.
 



sara is the daughter of retired abc-7 traffic/feature reporter roz varon and followed in her mom’s footsteps with tireless efforts on behalf of the chicago/midwest chapter of the national academy of television arts & sciences. sara was instrumental in founding the natas chicago/midwest chapter’s junior board. it was sara who recognized the need for a space where younger voices could come together to create meaningful change, and her spirit will continue to guide the junior board’s work for years to come. 



a former natas chicago scholarship recipient, her gratitude for that opportunity never wavered. through her hard work and dedication, sara demonstrated the kind of commitment that inspired those around her to strive for excellence. she volunteered her time at countless natas events and helped foster an environment where future leaders can thrive. sara was, above all, a kind and generous person who touched everyone she met with her warmth and intelligence.  



sara’s passing leaves a void, but her legacy of kindness and leadership will never be forgotten. for all who knew her, sara was a guiding light, and we are forever grateful for the time we had with her.  











in honor of sara’s memory, her family has requested that donations be made to the natas chicago foundation to support a scholarship in her name, entitled the sara janz "take your shot" memorial scholarship. donations can be made at tinyurl.com/natasgive. please indicate that the gift is in honor of sara. the natas chicago foundation is the charitable arm of the national academy of television arts & sciences (natas) - chicago/midwest chapter, inc. and is a public charity under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code.
