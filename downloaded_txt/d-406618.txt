"amidst the sea of change to which the new hampshire association of realtors has played witness in its 85 years, one thing that has remained constant is the realtor 'r' and the value we bring to every real estate transaction in which we take part. we are part of a unique community where our familial cooperation transcends our business competition. these are not mere platitudes, but our living ideals, and they are, in fact, the foundation on which we conduct ourselves in our day-to-day affairs."

susan cole, 2025 president, new hampshire realtors 


















the new hampshire association of realtors works in conjunction with the national association of realtors and the local boards of realtors to provide its members with support and resources to serve consumers in an efficient, effective and ethical manner; and to advocate for private property rights.
