1. think of the loved one
the first step towards giving a unique gift hamper is to think of the things that the recipient loves or needs most. for instance, giving a new mum a gift hamper with baby stuff will appear mindful and make more sense than an expensive bottle of wine. the best way is to put yourself in the recipient’s shoes and imagine the kind of gifts you would like if you were in their position.
2. go for priceless gifts that will leave a mark
chocoloate and sweets are always a big favorite of everyone, young and old, but just be careful not to overdo it!  however, you can make the gift more personalized by adding a priceless item that will remind your loved ones how much you care for them. this could be a favorite book, an antique, a painting, a laptop, or a wrist watch.

the christmas tradition is centuries old and its takes a personalized touch to make it unique. this is because most businesses tend to capitalize on the holidays to make money by selling gourmet hampers. therefore, for a unique hamper you need to think out of the box and make a hamper with contents and demonstrate that you truly care for your loved ones. if you take your time and follow these guidelines you will definitely end up with a personalized gift hamper.
