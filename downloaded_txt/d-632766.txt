what people are saying



 academic video online—with its massive library of more than 62,446 titles running nearly 30,000 hours—matches well with the conventional liberal arts curriculum....the case for acquiring academic video online is compelling.

 a remarkable site... in all, this rich and versatile site repays the time spent to explore it in depth. 
the journal of american history






 between its people and its content, it feels like alexander street is just walking off the shelves. 
diane costello
council of australian university librarians





 if alexander street’s positive feedback from its customers and its grand ambitions to expand its video offerings are any indication, the academic publishing industry may well be in the midst of a paradigm shift that even librarians can get excited about.

 academic video online’s content is used throughout the university – in the arts, the sciences, and in historical research, to name a few. its academic-focused tools and features, including clip-making and scrolling transcripts, are useful in all disciplines. key distributors, like sony picture classics, and film platform, bring rich film and documentary content to the subscription.
