congratulations to our top doctors!drs. baumel, crawford, garber and rosselot were named to the boston magazine list of top doctors for 2025.  we are so proud of their accomplishment.  













expert pediatricians in framingham, ma



at framingham pediatrics, our team consists of experienced, compassionate providers and friendly, nurturing staff members who take pride in giving our young patients the personalized pediatric care that they deserve.
we understand that you have a choice of child care providers in the framingham area, and we appreciate your consideration. we can assure you that you'll feel confident in our ability to meet all of your expectations.
all of our providers are highly educated professionals who have undergone rigorous academic and clinical training in pediatrics. we maintain a high level of expertise through continuing education in order to provide the most up-to-date care for the young patients we are privileged to serve.
all of our pediatricians are board-certified pediatricians.  we are all interested in helping with your children's developmental, behavioral and school problems in addition to their medical problems, and we encourage you to bring these issues to our attention.  we all feel strongly that each of our patients should have one individual primary care physician who knows them well and not simply be a patient of a group practice.  whenever possible, you will see your own doctor when visiting our office.  if your doctor is off at that time, another one of us will always be covering.
