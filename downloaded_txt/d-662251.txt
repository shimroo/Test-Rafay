lodge brothers funeral directors new malden have first-hand experience when dealing with the painful consequences of 2020 and the corona 19 pandemic which affected, afflicted and shut down the uk, leaving families reeling as they faced the loss of freedom of choice, freedom of movement, loss of jobs, loss of finances and most difficult of all, loss of life. funerals are highly emotionally occasions but even more when a person loses their life to a global pandemic, which appeared unexpectedly a year ago and proceed to upset our normality and shake us to the core. the passing of someone who has succumbed to covid-19 is even more raw and emotional when that life becomes part of the painful statistics, which the country faces on a daily basis.
lodge brothers funeral directors ascot do not treat your loved ones passing as if it were merely a statistic, but rather as family. lodge brothers have been assisting families with their loss and grief for more than 240 years and are sensitive to the fact that losing a loved one is simply heart-wrenching. organising a funeral can be a daunting task however with caring and professional people by your side can make it more bearable; leading your family through the process, providing you with solutions to problems, you have not experienced before. arranging a funeral becomes seamless as lodge brothers alleviate any additional and unnecessary pressure for the family.

additional constraints have been placed on funerals, which must be adhered to during these times, but the uk government has provided guidance for the arranging and attending a funeral during the coronavirus pandemic. these guidelines were developed to ensure that bereaved families are treated with sensitivity, dignity and respect and that funerals can continue to take place while minimising the risk of infection. lodge brothers funeral directors shepherds bush are very familiar with these stipulations and our staff strive to balance the requirements of the grieving, allowing them to mourn, with the need to minimise the spread of covid-19 infection.

coronavirus/covid-19

face coverings must be worn when entering our branches (unless you are exempt)
only two clients in the funeral home at any one time.
the 2 metre distancing rule will be upheld
hands to be sanitised on entry & exit

yours sincerely,

inevitably, life tends to have a way of getting away with us. we leave school as young adults, searching for incomes which will allow us the independence that we so covet. earning money means we have the power to make the choices about our own lives that feel so important to us at the time. whether our goals are to grow our careers, or to start a family, independence generally decreases as we become more financially viable. what begins as an endeavour to be the best person that we can be, results in the accrual of material things and people. the car you save for to empower freedom of choice in your life becomes an asset. the type of social interactions which you choose, leads to you meet likeminded individuals and perhaps eventually results in a joining of kindred spirits in matrimony or the like. families grow, houses are built and the need for a more stable income grows. all of these things that you need to build to sustain your life, become your assets. you have a choice over them in life. so too, do you have a choice over them in death.

life unwittingly takes hold of us and often, the administration of your life is left at the bottom of the list of things to do. stats show that 38% of adults living in the uk passed away last year without a will. your will is your last chance to make voice heard and to have your final choices carried out as you would have done if you were still able. failing to plan for your estate your estate via your will, you leave a lot to chance. and if you have not lived your life leaving all things to chance, why let it be the case in your death. no one person knows your wishes and desires as well as you do so when you pass away without a will and your estate is then governed by the laws of intestacy which means that everything that you have worked your whole life to attain is now governed by a set of rules enforced by the courts. only married or civil partners and some of your close relatives are able to inherit your estate under the laws of intestacy which means that the courts may assign your possessions to someone who you had never intended them to.
lodge brothers attorneys specialise exclusively in probate, wills and power of attorney. probate weybridge is the process, which confirms who will handle a person’s estate after their death and it is important to have, as it is a legal requirement. probate sunbury is a complicated system that is advisable to be handled by a competent probate attorney. aspects of the probate shepperton process include, establishing the value of your assets and liabilities, finalising inheritance tax, applying for probate registry for the grant of probate or grant of letters of administration. lodge brothers probate west byfleet offer caring and practical legal advice efficiently and professionally to make your life easier during distressing times.
