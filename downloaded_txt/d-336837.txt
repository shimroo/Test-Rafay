you can master this method of breathing without much effort!you may not get used to this method easily!but, remember!any new path may seem difficult to tred!human nature is set so!it may seem a trifle strange at first!it is a must that you must work a bit hard!perseverance is the key word!i have instructed you to breath in through the nostril and exhale through your mouth!continue this pattern only for the first three inhalations!from the fourth inhalation-exhalation cycle onwards change the way!that is you inhale through the nostrils and exhale through the nostrils only!during the inhalations and exhalations all through you should raise your toungue and keep it close to the roof of your mouth!overdoing anything is like never-doing anything!this is the case with this excercise also!don't overdo!anything between thirty to fourty cycles will do!just relax and relax and relax all through the process!keep your back straight all through the excercise!your legs may ache and your back may give you a real testing time!if you feel it uncomfortable stop!don't continue!our body and mind should be completely relaxed for us to achieve anything!carry on with the excercise at the next session!you will feel the accumulated stale air clearing out of our system!you will actually feel your system becoming refreshed!revitalised and energised!a new sheen appears on your face withing no time!you attain a clarity of thought which you have not experienced in the past!regularly do this and know the immediate calming effect to your system!the chi or the life energy permeates your whole body!who needs tranquilisers when nature has inlaid us with tranquilisers of immediate effect!great is the ways of our ancient savants!so get going!tramsform yourself!transform your life!empower yourself!now!now!now!

guruji is back again!human nature is incomprehensible!we use only a small portion of the immense energy innate in us!we are by nature ignorant of our potential!we use only ten percent of brain power!we use only an iota of our creative power!by nature we fail to recognise our true potential!we deride ourselves!we belittle ourselves!we diminish ourselves!you can shed this nature!tan tien breating will help you!now the path!always remember that the lungs are a measure of strengthweak and abused lungs using only a fraction of their total capacity!this results is an ability to concentrate!strong and healthy lungs, emptied at regular intervals of stale air, result in strength of mind and body!this is a universal truth!ironically, babies and young children instinctively breath using their diaphragms!only as they grow older do they acquire the habit of shallow thoracic breathing!you are indeed anxious to improve your physical condition!you should strive to breathe like a new born child!now the real training commences!the posture for tan tien breathing is the horse riding posture!this posture is similar to the posture we adopt when riding on a horse!stand with your feet apart for about  two shoulder width!the feet are parellel pointing forwards, knees bent, body upright!fists are held at sides parrellel to the ground and pointing forwards!this is the horse stance of the chi kung path!this is a stance the great warrior masters of the east has used for centuries!do not doubt its power!try it now!you will experience it!it may be uncomfortable to take this stance for long at first!but soon you will come to enjoy the power of this stance!the leg pain you suffer in the beginnig will disappear soon!regularity of practice is the thing!don't compramise on it!now, what is this tan tien!you must acquire some understanding about this power centre in our body!immense power is pent up in some points of our body!great eastern masters have discovered this long time ago!indian sages discoveredsix power centeres in our body!mooladhara!swadhishtana!manipuraka!anahatha!visudhi!ajna!and now the culminating point, sahasrara chakra, at the crown of our head!for now we are concerned with swadhishtana only1this is the tan tien of the chi kung path!the point about three inches below the navel with the hypogastric region!know this as the tan tien!you are going to vent the immense potential and power pent up here!breathe in deeply through your nostrils!do not expand or move your chest!chest must be as relaxed as possible!absolutely relaxed!use your diaphragm muscle only to breath!this is very important!don't exert pressure on your chest!tan tien breathing centres on this truth!concentrate on the lower part of your body!imagination plays a key role in this breathing excercise!imagine the air being drwn in through your nose into your lungs!air swells your belly only!not your chest !exhale through your mouth!let the diaphragm force the air out of your lungs through your mouth!don't make any strenuous effort!keep a regular cycle for breathing!smooth and relaxed is the key word for this excercis!do this for two or three days and master the technique!i will be back soon!
