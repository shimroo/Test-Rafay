“the best !!! loved the place! everyone was very friendly and accommodating. the location was so perfect for the sandcastle fest, just a short walk and we were at the beach. the texan convenience store was located very close and that store had everything you would ever need.”

“we have been staying at the courtyard for 30 plus years. it’s our go to spot. close proximity to the beach and town. place is always well kept and clean. nice pool and rooms have all the necessary amenities to have an enjoyable stay. the staff is friendly and have been here longer than we have been coming. we come almost every year and sometimes twice.”
