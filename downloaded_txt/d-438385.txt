about us 



the shave beverly hills 













while you might be focused on what lies ahead, we ensure that our range of hairstyles has you revisiting the past. with the latest hairstyling trends, our modern-day menâs club and barbershop have it all; think of the 70sâ heavy shags, bangs, and locks.â for anyone who loves the retro vibes, we have low-maintenance cuts like the caesar cut, comb-over, and other great options that will hold for months. this will get you sorted and keep your visits to a minimum as you uphold covid-19 restrictions.â and for those who do not have the patience to grow their hair or are not ready to part with their bob, we have great extensions to give you a cool look. we also help you relieve stress by offering body massage and top up your look with a crystal-like shoeshine service. all this because we are a modern-day barbershop for the modern-day man
