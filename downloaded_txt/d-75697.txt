        02/02/15 ~ hello kaipo, i ordered an airport lei greeting for my son and 
        daughter in law this past may through your company.



i was so happy with your service! i am now ordering 
        a second airport greeting for my second and daughter in law



        for this friday 2/6 as they fly in from san francisco to lihue, kauai.

         

        02/06/15 ~ thanks so much!!! the lei's looked beautiful and they were 
        thrilled with the greeting!



         




        aloha,




monica cattano






hello frank/kaipo
 
      on behalf of the entire eastern region, the brothers of phi beta sigma 
    fraternity, inc. thank you for the wonderful job!


      you guys were superb from start to finish. the 350 orchid leis arrived on 
    time as promised. and
      beautiful as promised. we could not have asked for anything more. despite 
    the troubles in thailand with regards to the
      flooding, we were worried we would not have any fresh leis for such a 
    special event, and be reduced to silk leis and that would
      
      be a first.
we must have called 30 companies 
    from all over the net. there were a few who said they might be able to 
    provide us with 100
      or so but they could not guarantee them. you promised and delivered!!


      leis of hawaii came through for the brothers of phi beta sigma fraternity, 
    inc. expect a call from our national office along with
      some local chapters. we have our centennial celebration to look forward to 
    in 2014. so be prepared for 2,500 plus order.
 
      have a wonderful day!!!





        thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

 


        what a wonderful reception and greeting. you made our arrival perfect.


        what a delightful way to finish 11 hours on the plane. 



        you helped us find the luggage area, find the transportation to our 
        hotel, and made the transition so easy!


        the flowers are just as beautiful today. 



        we will tell all who are traveling to hawaii to arrange a greeting by 
        your company.

mahalo with appreciation,
i want 
      to take a moment to thank the man who took my order over the phone on
      tue afternoon. this was a very emotional order for my friend who was
      
      terminally ill at a young adult age. it was a difficult order as i was 
      emotionally charged with
      sadness. the flower leis arrived thursday morning to his home about 1030 
      as promised. 
      my friend who lived aloha always slipped rather sudden and as he could 
      smell the
      
      flowers and dream he was in maui again. the card i asked to be sent along
      
      said aloha today, tomorrow and always. the pastor and his family could not
      believe the timing of the arrival as steve was expected to live a few more
      weeks, it really was a gift of aloha.
      
      mahalo for the beautiful flowers in time as the last smell he had leaving 
      earth ..
sheryl d 
      miller




thank 
      you so much;

      i can't even begin to tell you how much this mean to me. 
      when i was on the phone yesterday placing my order,
      
      and the guy asked me what i wanted the sign to say ... i almost cried ...
      my brother has advanced cancer, and won't live much longer. 
      he's never been to hawaii, so my husband and i are bringing him and his 
      wife
      
      sue with us. the first time we ever went, we got leis when we got of the 
      plane,
      
      and it's such a fun thing and makes you feel special ... and i wanted to 
      surprise 
      them with that. that's why we ordered leis only for them ... not us.
it does 
      my heart a world of good. thank you so much. 
      they will both be so happy and so surprise. they're very excited about 
      their
      
      maui trip.

      mahalo!
bonnie 
      call



kaipo,

      the leis for our party arrived on friday in great condition. i followed 
      your 
      instructions and kept them chilled but not wet, and they were perfect. the
      
      guests were thrilled! im glad that i ordered a few extra because the band
      
      members were dying to wear one. the crowns look beautiful, however, my 
      crown 
      started to fall apart halfway through the evening (the purple one). im
      
      surprised at how long tropical flowers last because i thought they were
      
      temperamental. if i have to order leis for another event i will reorder 
      from 
      your business.

      thanks,
maureen 
      thompson



order,

      the lei that i ordered from you on 3/2 for my grandson-in-law's funeral 
      arrived this morning. although the 
      stupid fed/ex man neglected to ring my doorbell, the lei arrived in 
      perfect condition. it is beautiful and i can't
      
       thank you enough for your help in getting the lei for my 
      granddaughter to wear at her husband's funeral.


      thank and again,

      kathy johnson
p.s. i 
      also read through the newspaper used for packing - it brought back 
      memories of past trips to hawaii!
