what to look for in an online university
selecting an online university is not a simple decision. each student should carefully evaluate his own preference and research highly rated schools before creating a list of potential schools. once this list is established, you might wonder what to look for in an online university. create a list of variables such as reputation, size, location and cost. this can help the student determine which online university is the best choice for him. creating a spreadsheet can help the student to easily see how the schools compare to each other and to his preferences.

is distance learning right for you?
 obtaining an accredited degree online has become easier than ever as literally thousands of colleges and universities offer a wide selection of courses and programs to choose from. however, before choosing an online university or degree program there are a few things each prospective student should consider about their own situation. 
first, do you have a computer you can depend on and is your internet service provider reliable? when taking an online university degree program you will typically be required to sign in on a regular basis and participate in online discussion forums in addition to submitting work through a technology platform. computer problems can quickly cause you to fall behind and negatively impact your grade. before enrolling into any accredited degree programs request a copy of the suggested computer and technology requirements. most accredited online degrees will gladly provide a list of compatible computer and software requirements suggested for the program. in fact, if you need to upgrade your computer or software to meet the minimum requirements, be sure to request information about student discounts which are frequently made available to students enrolled at an accredited university. 
next, are you self motivated and disciplined? if you have a tendency towards procrastination then online learning may be challenging for you. it's important to realize that although convenient and often more flexible than traditional courses, online programs still require substantial investments of time and energy. it's highly recommended that a person who is new to the distance learning format begin slowly by taking only one or two courses to begin. 
finally, are you comfortable communicating online and using a variety of software programs? when selecting a graduate or bachelor degree program request information about training if you are not certain. a large number of schools will provide orientation courses for new student for free. it's a great way to become familiar with the technology and structure of an online course or program!

											can i use life experience to obtain a bachelors degree
									 	

using life experience to obtain a bachelors degree
although it is possible to use life experience toward fulfilling the requirements of obtaining a bachelors degree, it is not common. most colleges or universities only accept specific types of professional experience for credit toward fulfilling degree requirements—a process called credit by portfolio evaluation, which is typically restricted to students with particular types of formal professional training such as nurses or police officers. 
occasionally, other types of professional training may be considered on a case-by-case basis, but life experience rarely results in credit conferral. 
many less reputable programs claim to confer a degree based largely on prior skills or portfolio credit so be cautious when seeking to use life experience to obtain a bachelors degree. it may be possible but it's rarely easy and very unlikely to result in the majority of coursework toward an online degree. in fact, most colleges and universities require a minimum number of course hours to be taken through the university in order to confer a diploma on a student. any claims to the contrary should be regarded with caution. 
if you have extensive experience in a given skill or subject area then one way to gain valuable credit, time and money savings is to “test out” of certain core subjects. for instance, if your program requires a foreign language and you happen to be fluent in another language then it is often possible to sit for an examination that demonstrates your mastery of the subject. however, it's important to note this will rarely result in allowing you to take fewer credit hours for the completion of your degree! 
another option that may be available if you desire credit for real life experience is an independent or supervised study course. these are typically less structured and require advance approval but are flexible in providing credit toward “real life” experience. because this will require advance planning and a sponsoring faculty member who agrees to supervise your progress; plan to present a clear goal and rationale when requesting an independent study program. it is a great way to enhance your hands-on training while obtaining course credits toward your college degree!

											how can i pay for an online university degree program? 
									 	

paying for an online degree program
if you are considering returning to college to pursue an online university degree program you're probably also looking for ways to fund it. college tuition is an investment in terms of both time and money. fortunately, there are many options available when it comes to financing or paying for an online degree. 
if you are employed then one of the first places to begin is the hr department of your company. if you are fortunate enough to have tuition reimbursement then find out what is covered and the requirements for reimbursement. many employers will pay for or reimburse tuition, books and even supplies required to continue your education particularly if the college is accredited and the degree is related to your job. 
standard sources of federal, state and local online bachelors degree financial aid as well as scholarships, grants and loans are all available to students of most accredited colleges and universities. contact the office of financial aid for the college or university program to request application forms.
finally, for those who are self-funding or “paying out of pocket” for their education, deferred or installment payment plans are often available. be sure to inquire with the financial director and fill out the forms in advance.

											how can you determine the extent of support and services to be expected from your online degree program? 
									 	

it's the little things that count when choosing an online bachelors degree program
online education is flexible, convenient and a great investment. today more than ever it is possible to obtain a prestigious university degree from top ranked colleges and universities like penn state, university of florida or even harvard without leaving your home. in fact, many programs provide transcripts and diplomas that are indistinguishable from those earned in the traditional format. but all colleges are not equal and much of the difference hinges upon the support and services provided. 
it is important to determine the extent of support and services you can expect. what is available and how can you access it? 
a reputable online university degree program like that of penn state's world campus provides a variety of technical assistance programs ranging from academic advisement to technical assistance and career placement. an online degree program should not be an inferior degree in any way shape or form. if the program you are interested in doesn't provide the same level of services as found on a traditional campus then you should keep searching for a program that supplies all of your needs.
at a minimum here is what you should expect:
admissions counselors to show you how to choose a college major or assist you in selecting the program that will best meet your personal and academic goals. career services to assist in finding employment, internships and networking opportunities. online access to library resources to assist in research and study related information.financial aid advisors and counseling to inform you about scholarships, loans or other aid opportunities. student records and advisement counselors who provide help with the administrative aspects of your courses (e.g., lesson tracking, exam requests, dropping a course, recording grades) technical support for assistance with computer and software issues, online tutorials, and training resources.
