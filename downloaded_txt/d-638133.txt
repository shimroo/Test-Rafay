we are cathedral square
we are housing developers, caregivers, maintenance specialists, health care professionals, social workers and public-policy advocates dedicated to promoting healthy homes, caring communities and positive aging. at cathedral square, older adults and people with disabilities and other challenges can live their lives to the fullest -- in communities where age and wisdom are valued and respected, where diversity in all its forms is welcome and celebrated. 














our homes
stable, affordable housing is the foundation of health, financial stability and quality of life. this is especially true as we age. at cathedral square, we offer a range of housing and support -- for older adults living independently, for people with disabilities, and for those needing extra help to remain living at home -- that is second to none.











our services
our residents have on-site access to the programs and services of sash® (support and services at home), a free program of health and wellness shown to improve health and quality of life, reduce medical expenses, and help people remain living at home as they age. sash includes activities, special events and outings, and regular check-ins. 











our 'why'
at cathedral square, the work we do and reason we do it is simple and straightforward: we believe that every person, regardless of financial means, personal circumstance or stage of life, has the right to quality, stable housing and the supports they may need to live their life to the fullest in the place they call home.

oped: we must care for our most vulnerable


            long-term care communities support our most vulnerable.  for far too long, direct care staff have been underpaid and underappreciated. during the pandemic, they were our heroes – caring for people 24/7. during covid outbreaks, they went to work in gowns and shields, continuing to offer compassionate care, often risking their own lives. yet the governor’s budget doesn’t seem to care for them. while we are grateful that the budget does include necessary funding for our sash® (support and services at home) model, the sfy26 budget does not include an increase in funding for long-term care providers and communities that accept medicaid.
        














advocacy
speak up for affordable housing with us!


            the vermont housing & conservation coalition (vhcc) is hosting its annual legislative day at the state house in montpelier on friday, february 14 and we hope you will join us! vhcc advocates for the state to allocate funds to the vermont housing & conservation board, allowing for more affordable housing to be built and more open space and farms to be conserved. 
this is an opportunity for you to speak directly with your elected officials about why affordable housing is important to you. several of our staff will be there throughout the day to help you connect with your legislators and share your story.
