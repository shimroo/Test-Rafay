this 
                month's article

this is the 10th anniversary of the us invasion of iraq. the pain and deception of that war continue as a wound to our spirit. many lives lost and broken and our nation's soul twistedand split by the failures of leadership and mission. read a poem from that time...
march          madness
(march          28, 2003 – ncaa          basketball tournament and unfolding war in iraq.) 


no, it is          not the game,
                            that elegant dance
                            of dark and light brothers
                            with ball and moves
                            and arching shots sublime
                            like a ballet
                            of earth-defying demigods
                            thrilling people on the edge
                            of time....(cont.)
