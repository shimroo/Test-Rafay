better each day





yesterday was a good day. we even went to a 4th of july party for a little while. i've caught a terrible cold and i haven't had a cold in years. i'm sure my immune system has been greatly compromised with the stress and the surgery. i can do anything i feel like doing today, but i know i'm not up to driving. i tire too easily.i'm spending the day knitting and spinning. i did take a very short, very slow walk around the block. enough exercise for today.

cute!





well, this isn't exactly a repurposed item, but it's sewn & knit, so i think perfect to share (mod, feel free to delete if you disagree!).  i just finished kathryn ivy's summerlin, you knit a bodice then sew a skirt to it and it is beyond cute!  i made this for my best friends daughter.  i can't wait to get a picture of her in it!there are more details on my rav page here, or on my blog!carly

pimp my ironing board





i had some material sitting around for about 3 years with no idea what to do with it. so - i chose the repurposing project as a chance to update my ironing board. my camera acted up so i don't have a before picture but the original cover was gross. i have had that cover for almost 8 years. the pad still works great, so that is why i opted to cover it with new material. i didn't have to spend $30.00 to replace it and i got the chance to use material that was taking up space in my fabric stash. here is the final product:more on my craft blog!!

something old, something new....





i believe this started life as a curtain panel from ikea.  i saw it and knew it had to be an a-line skirt.  i used the book "sew what! skirts".  both skirts are the basic a-line from the beginning of the book. curtain skirt easter skirt, new fabric from walmart.thanks for looking. :)
