new youth group teaching series
  
in youth group we are beginning a new series titled "teaching to change lives" in an effort to pass along to students the skill of how to teach the bible to someone else!this will pay out huge dividends into their future as they become leaders, parents, and have many opportunities to make disciples of others through informal and formal biblical teaching settings.uniquely to this series, students will have the chance to purchase an accompanying book to utilize during this study and prepare for each week's content. this is my favorite ministry resource i've personally read through 3x and recommended countless times! parents/guardians, i would encourage you to purchase a copy for your student, and enjoy reading it yourself too!
