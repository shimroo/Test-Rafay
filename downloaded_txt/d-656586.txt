this is the most extensive book on cue building written to date. 
as the title suggests, it takes you through the complete cue-building process from the sawmill, to the finished cue, to marketing your cues. it covers many things that the videos don’t. 
however, it is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. it covers doing work on wood lathes, metal lathes, and of course, cue lathes. 
it shows the table saw tapering machine, how to build your own spray booth, kiln, wood stabilizer dipping tank, collets, linen presses, inlay patterns and much more. it shows how to put on the finish with and without spraying, irish linen and leather wraps, v-groove and butterfly points, inlays and much more.
