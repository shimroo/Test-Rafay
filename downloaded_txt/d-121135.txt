  a nature print is a monoprint of a natural object such as flowers, grasses, and even insects.  the object is inked and applied to paper, to make a print.  i like to hand-color my nature prints.  in my site you will also see examples of my work in gouache, ink transfer drawings, acrylic paintings, and more.
