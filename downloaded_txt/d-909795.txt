              alvins l.a. times 2000 cover story. 





june 28, 2020




dave alvin reports: "i'm 
              very happy to announce that on july 3rd, yep
roc records will be 
              releasing a new album, via bandcamp, called dave alvin: from an 
              old guitar - rare and unreleased recordings. this 13 song 
              collection features studio performances that i've recorded over 
              the years for my own albums or for tribute albums but mainly 
              they're just things i did for the pure kicks of playing music i 
              love with musicians i love and admire. the songs range from some 
              originals to interpretations of compositions by dear friends like 
              peter david case, chris smither and the late bill morrissey to 
              tunes written by heroes like willie dixon, bob dylan, lil hardin 
              armstrong, earl hooker and marty robbins. the music ranges from 
              acoustic blues and ballads to electric barroom blues, folk/rock 
              and even a little country/rock. there are contributions from 
              dearly departed comrades like chris gaffney, amy farris and bobby 
              lloyd hicks as well as from old blasters pals like gene taylor 
              along with various members of the guilty men/women/ones plus help 
              from brilliant accompanists like greg leisz, cindy cashdollar, bob 
              glaub, don heffington, danny ott, skip edwards, rick shea, chris g 
              miller, wyman reese, dale spalding and david j. carpenter. i 
              consider myself extremely lucky to have had such a stellar 
              collection of musicians to make some noise with and to say that 
              i'm proud of the performances on this release would be a gigantic 
              understatement. and, yeah, of course i played beat up, old guitars 
              on all the songs."
