bipolar child

 saturday, january 14, 2012 at 3:54pm 

this made mary and i laugh. these series of photos were all taken within 10 minutes of each other. a perfect example of how many mood swings and emotions a 9 month old can go through in such a short period of time.

really bad at posting things

 tuesday, december 6, 2011 at 9:04pm 

so here i am and somehow 3 months have passed. since then a lot has happened which would normally be a lot of little posts; or at least they should have been. instead i dumped them all into two galleries. one is a ryan gallery as usual and the 2nd is apple picking.

enjoy!

photoshop, after effects and a creepy baby

 saturday, september 3, 2011 at 5:42pm 

i took a quiet spot i had this afternoon to play with after effects seeing its been 5 years since i used it in a production environment.
what i came up with is both awesome and creepy.... i know there are problems with it, but it was a fun first attempt. i think i am going to make an effort to create more of these cinimagraphs.

we're onto solids people

 sunday, august 21, 2011 at 12:04pm 

4 months and counting so we moved onto rice mush for ryan. he's getting better with it everytime we try it out. also we bought a jogging stroller and a high chair from kijiji. worth $500 bucks between the two. i picked them up for $120! should have done that with the stroller in the first place. live and learn i guess.
anyways, click here to see the gallery.

rollercoaster whirlwind

 tuesday, august 2, 2011 at 11:36pm 

july has been a crazy month and already i can see in the distance summer coming to a close. with that, i was getting antzy because we really havent done much this summer and i worry we are running out of time. mary and i went to canadas wonderland!
woot! i think she might start getting on board with the whole roller coaster thing.
anyways, as always the only real reason i am posting is because i posted new picts of ryan in the gallery. one album is random photos and the other is bathtime fun. enjoy!

i feel bad. i havent posted anything in a while. no pictures, no tweets, nothing!
i've been too busy. weddings and its summer. who wants to be cooped up inside posting on the interwebs.
anyways, i posted a couple of random shots that sums up july so far. i will do my best to post more.

time to go out and do things. a feel a zoo trip will be in our future soon. i posted some new picts of ryan, check them out in the gallery. i've been bad the last 2 weeks.. the weather has been garbage and it put me in a funk. i would rather play la noire than take photos but now its nice i'm back to it.
my dad bought me an sb700 yesterday out of the blue. shocked i wuz. so i can finally start doing 2 point flash photography.
im pretty stoked! almost makes me wish i knew what i was doing.

3 weeks

 thursday, may 12, 2011 at 10:13pm 

so we made it to the 3 week point. amazing up's, defeating lows but it's been an amazing experience overall. it's all about the little victories and taking it one step at a time. we bought a bjorn which has been awesome. the travel system is big and bulky... the bjorn has been great because it allows us to do fun things like geocaching!
yes, it's the geocaching time of the year and already ryan has helped us find 4 geocaches!
he's a natural!
below is a picture of the three of us. he's in a sweater grandma bought him.
i finally posted a couple of new picts. check them out in the gallery
