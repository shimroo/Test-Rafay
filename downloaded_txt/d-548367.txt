				four decades of record breaking victories
			






$104,000,000
child sex abuse
we're proud to have secured a landmark $104 million settlement for victims of abuse against kamehameha school. this ground-breaking case marks a significant victory for the victims, with the school agreeing to settle.



$29,400,000
medical malpractice
physicians at tripler army medical center failed to order a crucial test that would have detected a twisted gut in a 1-month-old baby, resulting in the loss of 95% of the baby's small intestine and leading to lifelong disability.



$15,400,000
wrongful death
the state has agreed to a $15.4 million settlement in a civil lawsuit filed by the families of two hikers who fell to their deaths on a kauai hiking trail in 2006.



$15,000,000
vacuum/forceps injury
the hospital improperly attempted to deliver a post-date baby using a traumatic second-stage vacuum extraction. this extraction and the delay in delivery resulted in permanent brain damage to the baby.



$9,975,000
brain injury
the hospital's failure to monitor an infant's rising bilirubin levels led to bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus, resulting in severe and permanent brain damage. a settlement of $9,975,000 was obtained.



$9,500,000
medical malpractice
surgeons at tripler army medical center reattached the small intestine backward during gastric bypass surgery, leading to complications that ultimately resulted in the death of a 31-year-old army wife and mother of three.
