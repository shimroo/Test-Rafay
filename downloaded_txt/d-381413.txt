taps is an independent, local, non-profit organization working to serve homeless dogs and cats. we provide life-changing services for homeless pets that come to our shelter every day. animals arrive in need of medical care, training, foster care, and in need of loving homes. we hope you’ll consider adoption and submit an application to adopt today.
if you are not in a position to adopt, we hope you’ll consider a donation to support our mission.

 
 






 




about us
tazewell animal protective society (taps) is a no-kill animal shelter that gives dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens a home until permanent homes can be found. we are located in pekin, illinois, which is just outside of peoria in the central illinois area. please take a few minutes to look around and meet some of the terrific animals we have up for adoption. please consider adopting your next companion from taps no-kill animal shelter. we have dogs and cats of all sizes, breeds and colors. if you don’t find a companion animal that is right for your family now, please check back often as we take in new animals almost daily. while located in central illinois, we do adopt outside of the area as long as all members of the family can travel to the shelter to meet your potential new family member.
