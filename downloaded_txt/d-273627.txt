welcome to howie’s high sierra comedy vaultthe high sierra comedy vault podcast is up and running. listen to the current episode above or previous shows on the right. on this site you can find the podcasts, “appetizers” from my stand-up comedy, radio show or some of my original musical compositions. you can also take a look at my photo albums  and my collection of photos where you’ll discover i’m a photo-hound.
i have been performing for audiences since my college days at humboldt state university where i first played live music during what was then called “coffee house concerts.” since then, my love to entertain has led me between music, comedy and writing, all of which are genres in which i continue to enjoy today. on any given day you can find me on a comedy stage, entertaining at corporate events or writing one of my movie reviews or op-ed pieces.
drop me a line anytime via email (howienave@aol.com) or message me on my facebook pages (howie nave or howie leslie nave) and if you’ve never been to lake tahoe do come up as there’s nothing better than living up here in the high sierra.
