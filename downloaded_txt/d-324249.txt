the state of utah history





when brigham young led the persecuted american sect  of mormons into the deserts of utah in 1847, he found refuge in a land  that no one else wanted. the determined mormons, however, made the  desert bloom through their hard work and skill. the descendents of these  original settlers still make up a majority of utah's residentsthe land of utah covers 85,000 square miles, and is home to some of  the most spectacular and unique natural formations in the country. some  of these unique sites have been designated national parks -- famous  among them are zion national park with its natural monuments, the towers  and spires of bryce canyon, and the spectacular red rock of the canyon  lands. natural bridges, gorgeous canyons, and mysterious moonscapes are  all part of utah's landscape.
and the mountains of utah offer great skiing and a great place for  the 2002 winter olympics. visit the site of the 2002 winter olympics in  salt lake city, utah.
