dartmouthstudent government















our names are chukwuka odigbo ’25 and jon pazen ’25, and we’re dartmouth’s student body president and vp for the 2024-2025 academic year! we are so excited to be working as your representatives this year to make our community a safer, healthier, and better place.as the president and vp, we were elected in the spring to lead dartmouth student government (dsg), the official representative body for all dartmouth undergraduates. this organization currently consists of twenty-eight (28) elected student senators, one from each housing community and two from each class year, across the sophomores, juniors, and seniors at dartmouth. there are also at-large non-voting dsg representatives and other appointed executive positions in our organization! as the official student government spanning all year levels, we represent student concerns to the administration and outside community groups, whether that’s around mental health, dining and food insecurity, elections, or infrastructure and housing. we also manage a $70,000 dollar budget directed towards various initiatives. any issue affecting the quality of undergraduate life or education falls within the jurisdiction of dsg.we hope that you join us! students can join dsg as an elected senator of their house in the fall 2025 elections or as an at-large representative. the dsg representative role is the perfect position for students interested in our projects and initiatives that prefer more flexible participation, attendance, or are not interested in running in their house election. all you have to do is reach out! feel free to contact dsg on social media or at the dartmouth student government email with any questions, concerns, or ideas: student.government@dartmouth.edu. you can also reference our public calendar to see when, where, and who we are meeting with to advance student interests.we hope everybody can get involved and help make dartmouth a better place for all students! working for you!- chukwuka odigbo ’25, student body president.- jon pazen ’25, student body vice president.
