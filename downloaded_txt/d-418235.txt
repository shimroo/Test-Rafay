this is the start of the march at stevens creek and winchester boulevards on inauguration day which was also mlk day. we had a lot to sing and say about our civil rights endangered!  silicon valley immigration committee invited us to start the event with our songs. the march consisted of upwards of 600 people and was covered by several local news tv channels and yahoo news. organized by silicon valley immigration committee.
