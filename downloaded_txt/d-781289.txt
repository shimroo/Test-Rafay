an introduction…
the detroit church is an independent baptistic congregation that strives to hold fast the doctrine that was “once delivered” to the saints by the lord jesus christ, and his holy apostles and prophets. as a church we strive to worship and to serve god according to the simple pattern of the new testament, without man-made additions, associations, and holy days.
