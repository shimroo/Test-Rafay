"resilience in the face of adversity:a journey of surviving cancer"
matthew shares his remarkable journey of surviving pediatric brain cancer in this powerful and inspirational keynote speech, drawing from his personal experiences dating back to the mid 1990s. matthew takes audiences on a profound and emotional exploration of the challenges and triumphs of battling this devastating disease, including real-world issues of the day, as he celebrates 28 years in remission.



"navigating nonprofits: challenges, rewards, and the role of nonprofit leaders"
matthew explore the multifaceted journey of starting, running, sustaining, and leading a nonprofit organization. nonprofits play a crucial role in addressing social and community needs, but the path to success is fraught with rewards and pitfalls. we'll delve into the challenges nonprofit leaders face, the importance of community building, and the inspirational impact they can have on their communities.



"empathetic consumerism in healthcare:the death of the impression"

healthcare is fraught with increasing demand for more authentic engagement, with a delicate balance sitting between abysmally low patient trust and well-intendedbut often empathy-deficientmarketing and communication initiatives. matthew deconstructs these complex dynamics and their impact on the stakeholder relationships, with a sprinkle of strategy on a solution hiding in plain sight.



"the art & business of podcasting:does anyone care what you have to say?"


matthew presents a masterclass in podcasting, a medium that has rapidly evolved from a niche hobby to a mainstream communications platform. but is it worth it? his perspective takes audiences through a historical, cultural, anthropological, and societal journey through the art and theater of audio and the known and unknown pros and cons that come with defining goals and success in this content frontier.
