understanding preferences over borders
                        ﻿ 
                    


lipps, jana; sczepanski, ronja; malet, giorgio (2025)


international studies quarterly

the governance of international borders has evolved into a contentious issue of political competition along the cosmopolitan-nationalistic divide. despite a strong polarization over the level of border openness, many border security policies are carried by a strong cross-partisan support base. this puzzle suggests that public preferences toward border security might be more context-dependent and prone to framing strategies than previously ...

repacking-driven compaction in the spirit mountain batholith, southern nevada
                        ﻿ 
                    


florez, darien; huber, christian; bachmann, olivier; et al. (2025)


journal of petrology

mechanical phase separation in crustal reservoirs is one of several processes that influences chemical differentiation in magmatic bodies and the generation of potentially eruptible horizons of magmas. the rate of melt-crystal separation in magmas remains hard to constrain, notably because of the poor understanding of the processes that govern phase separation, such as crystal settling and mush compaction. to that end, it is necessary to ...

on the timescales of the response of the brewer-dobson circulation to an abrupt quadrupling of co<sub>2</sub>
                        ﻿ 
                    


calvo, n.; garcia, r. r.; chiodo, g.; et al. (2025)


journal of geophysical research: atmospheres

changes in the brewer-dobson circulation (bdc) in response to increasing co2 concentrations can arise from the direct effect of radiative cooling in the stratosphere or the indirect effects induced by warmer sea surface temperatures (ssts). this study aims to disentangle these two contributions in the whole atmosphere community climate model (waccm) by analyzing the timescales of the tropical upwelling response to an abrupt quadrupling ...

mathematical modeling of elbrus glaciers in the 21st century. part 2. forecasting glacier evolution and lake formation under various ssp scenarios
                        ﻿ 
                    


postnikova, t. n.; rybak, o. o.; gubanov, a. s.; et al. (2024)


led i sneg-ice and snow

probable scenarios of future changes in the elbrus glaciers and associated with them phenomena such as formation of glacial lakes and remaining ice masses buried under the debris cover are considered. the ssp scenarios (ssp1-1.9, ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5) were used for of future climate forcing. glacier dynamics was simulated using the glogemflow model, which was improved by including a module of evolving debris cover. ...
