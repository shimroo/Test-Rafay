it’s true, we’ve moved!this summer we voted to sell our building in order to invest in our future. we’ve had a lot of transition and some financial struggles, but we still have a sneaking suspicion that god isn’t done with us just yet. so as we close the southside chapter of hot metal’s story and say goodbye to our building on jane street, we’re opening a new chapter in hazelwood!hazelwood is a neighborhood that is diverse in age, race, and socioeconomics; not unlike our own community. it is a neighborhood with some real needs, and also where incredible things are happening and where local organizations work hard to support the neighbors they love.the spartan center, in particular, is home to a plethora of neighborhood service organizations, ministries, entrepreneurs, and artists. there are so many exciting friendships to be made as we learn about and learn from our new neighbors, and begin to let our roots regrow in new soil.
