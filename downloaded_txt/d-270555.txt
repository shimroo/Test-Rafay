carolina bible camp provides seven affordable summer camp sessions centered on a community of campers and volunteer staff dedicated to knowing and sharing the love of christ. children and teens (ages 9-19) come to cbc to create strong friendships, have meaningful worship experiences, learn the bible, and have a great time outdoors and unplugged. our facilities in mocksville, nc, can be rented august-may for retreats, weddings, meetings, and more. we have 2 large indoor facilities and several sheltered outdoor locations. our 12 cabins each host 20 guests overnight with heating and air conditioning, bathrooms, and showers. 











































after over 30 years of hosting thousands of campers, staff, and renters at our mocksville campus, improvements and repairs need to be made. as important and needed as those things are, we are daring to dream together of new possibilities for our campus that will make the camp and rental experience even better for thousands of future cbcers! we want to continue contributing to the spiritual growth of our young people and serving the churches across our state. to be a safe and competitive camp destination for our children, youth, and families, the time for updates and repairs is now!

what people are saying about:events at cbc



“when we began planning for our daughter’s wedding we toured multiple venues but kept coming back to cbc. it had all the amenities we needed: a beautiful outdoor space for the ceremony, a large covered area which was needed due to rain, cabins for the men to get dressed in, a spacious new building that was perfect for capturing those pre-ceremony photos, and a spacious dining room complete with a kitchen and the best chef around! it was where they met and was the perfect place to begin their life together!”-bonnie watkins















“we have been using carolina bible camp every spring and fall since 2017 for our two boot camps. this was the fifth camp we have tried in north carolina and we are here to stay! the reasons are simple: our attendees love the food, the accommodations, and the sense of god's presence. i would also note that there is nothing like people who know what they are doing. we are very grateful to god for carolina bible camp.”-robbie dilmore, good heart ministries
