our sustainability


 





 









 





our philosophy


 








 











we work closely with many charitable organizations and shelters in boston and cambridge, giving food donations valued at approximately 10% of our net profits each year.


 










as a certified sustainable business leader, we recycle and compost over 90% of our waste and we are happy to pick up your used catering-ware to be sanitized and reused.


 










we offer a wide selection of clean food options including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free items. we work with local suppliers and carry rainforest alliance certified farm-to-cup coffee.


 










bringing our values home, we provide a positive work environment and treat employees with respect. we offer health and dental coverage, as well as paid time off to all of our staff.


 









 





all of this, and more, is at the heart of the basil tree’s philosophy: to make a difference where we can.


 








 






testimonials

 




the food was delicious and i was excited to try your catering for the first time. it was delivered promptly during the time requested and your driver was even kind enough to come all the way through our building to deliver the food to the correct room. this was an a+ experience, and i really appreciate all your efforts.

i have used basil tree numerous times for the past 6-7 years. i had them cater boxed lunches for almost 250 people. every person, from ordering to delivery, that i have interacted with have been professional and friendly, quick to respond and a pleasure to deal with. the food was delivered on time even with a complicated loading dock issue, and was delicious.

basil tree has been catering for me for years. love the quality of the product, presentation, and the taste. from boxed lunches to major events, the staff is creative in suggesting ways to serve our guests and make it memorable. they have their own delivery person which i tend to lean towards because they always deliver on time. thank you basil tree!

loved this food so much!!  i couldn’t get enough – best catering i’ve ever had. i am dairy free so i sometimes struggle with catered meals – they were super inclusive writing “dairy free” or “gluten free” on labels which allowed me to relax and enjoy my meal. i even took some extra for leftovers – it was that good!

we have a monthly lunch for 300 people. when plans with another caterer fell through about two weeks before the event, i got in touch with basil tree and they were fantastic. (they) provided me with three different quotes so i could compare serving sizes, prices, etc. in order to pick the best option for our group.  leading up to the event, they were very responsive about any additional questions and modifications to the order.

once again, we had an amazing experience with basil tree.  i would like to share with you the reason for ordering – foundation medicine is officially participating in the boston pride parade. (the) team was so grateful for the reach out (about supporting the lgbt community) and for the exceptional food.  we killed it. the bin for returning serving ware is just the icing on the cake. you have truly set basil tree apart from the many catering organizations that we engage.

the catering manager, delivery staff and chefs are consummate professionals that provide world class service with incessant attention to every detail while creating a preeminent, extraordinary customer experience.

first time using basil tree catering and they were top notch! with my multiple food orders over a three day conference, their staff was helpful in recommending the type of food, quantity, suggesting where to reduce or add perfectly. their menu lists ingredients as well as indicates v / vg / gf / df which was beyond helpful feeding such a large group. delivery is by their own vehicles and staff so that you are not dependent on a separate delivery service. can’t thank them enough for their expertise, fresh quality food and would highly recommend basil tree catering.

we love that it is possible to support a local business and get fresh/healthy food served in a sustainable manner all at the same time.

as an event planner, i am constantly working with different catering companies in the area and around boston. basil tree is definitely up in the top 5 of my absolute favorites. i usually get their boxed lunches. their food is delicious, packaged clearly with a label in a paper, green-friendly but sturdy box, with paper goods. they arrive on time, and will call if they expect a traffic delay. the office staff is very reachable and helpful. their prices are reasonable given the quality of their food, set-up, and service.

i really appreciate this find, because i can order the business day before, the menu has so much to choose from, so i can order it often (as we can afford it) and no one is sick of it.
