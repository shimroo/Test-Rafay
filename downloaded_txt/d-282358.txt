 new research shows genetic discoveries apply across human populations





a new study published in nature genetics and involving researchers from the universities of oxford, bristol, ucl and regeneron has revealed that genetic mutations have remarkably consistent effects across populations. the work shows that most biological factors operate similarly in all of us.






















 smartbiomed: a new international pioneer centre





the university of oxford (ou), the university of copenhagen (ku), and aarhus university (au) are delighted to announce the launch of the recently established pioneer centre for statistical and computational methods for advanced research to transform biomedicine (smartbiomed) this centre will become a vital international partner for data-driven medical research.

 research groups 


 

we feel enormous pride in the quality and the diversity of our research. in the research excellence framework (ref) 2021, research from the mathematical institute and the department of statistics in oxford was submitted together under unit of assessment 10. overall, 78% of our submission was judged to be 4* (the highest score available, for research quality that is world-leading in terms of originality, significance, and rigour).






















statistical theory and methodology





the statistical theory and methodology group develops novel underpinnings for statistical practice, and implements them in new methods.






                                    find out more about statistical theory and methodology
                                    































statistical genetics and epidemiology





the group carries out a broad range of computational biology research including genetics, genomics and epidemiology. the research is both theoretical and applied, generating both new methods and genetic and epidemiological insights as well as computational tools and software. 






                                    find out more about statistical genetics and epidemiology
                                    































probability





the probability group in the statistics department carries out research in random graphs and networks, random trees, branching processes, lévy processes, interacting particle systems, queueing processes, models from statistical mechanics, coalescent processes and random walks.






                                    find out more about probability
                                    





































oxford protein informatics group





the oxford protein informatics group (opig) is an interdisciplinary group that works across the boundaries of statistics and computation and biology and medicine. we investigate both proteins and small molecules. collaborating with academic and industrial partners, we develop cutting-edge computational methods that use the latest experimental data to yield valuable insights into immunology, in silico drug design, and protein folding.






                                    find out more about opig
                                    































econometrics and population statistics





the group creates and analyses algorithms that extract insights from complex datasets in economics, finance, population health, and ecology. our novel methods for finance, population behaviour, and biological mechanisms overcome limitations of traditional statistical methods from unobserved confounders and uncertain models.






                                    find out more about econometrics and population statistics
                                    































computational statistics and machine learning





our research spans the whole range of modern computational statistics and machine learning with particular strengths in probabilistic modelling, nonparametric methods, monte carlo, variational inference, deep learning, and applications in genetics, genomics and medicine.

computational biology and bioinformatics





the analysis of biological data such as dna sequences, gene expression arrays and single cell data can reveal new insights into intracellular mechanisms as well as evolutionary processes. this research group develops computational and statistical methods for the analysis of such data, with particular emphasis on methods for biological networks and biological sequences.
