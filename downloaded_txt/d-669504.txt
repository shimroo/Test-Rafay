                          dear future subscriber,
                            i founded grant’s interest rate observer in 1983 as an independent investment publication searching for opportunities in unconventional places. i peered into the future with a historian’s knowledge of the past to identify actionable financial market insights.

grant’s ”, the podcast current yield and, of course, our world-famous annual investment conference.
we value original thinking, thorough financial analysis, clear writing, and smart, demanding
readers like you. welcome to the world of grant’s interest rate observer.







at your disposal,
