        fighting a pet's cancer takes getting the right information. and three 
        other factors. . .

what we discovered that 
        can make all the difference
         


        sparky was diagnosed with
        non-hodgkins lymphoma in august of 2000. he was given only a few weeks
        to live without treatment. chemotherapy, we were told, could extend his
        life, perhaps by a year.
our
        wonderful sparky was fully one-third of our family. given these two
        choices, we naturally chose to treat him.
during the course of his treatment we began to explore ways that
        might extend his life even further. we investigated holistic treatments,
        diet, anything that might help and not hurt.
we
        were successful.
sparky 
        lived as his puppy-like, frisky, stubborn, clever, funny and 
        affectionate self for more than eight more years. he finally passed away 
        of general old age conditions in january, 2009, still cancer-free at the 
        age of 14 1/2.
why 
        did sparky remain in remission all those years?
what
        singles out the fortunate survivors from those not so fortunate? we
        learned that there are three factors that seem to always be
        present in successful cases.
