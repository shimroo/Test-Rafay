we aim at 
                     helping members of the indian community to live by the principle of ahimsa – 
                     fundamental to indian philosophy -- in the american context.  having as our guiding motto, our 
                       objectives are to educate, promote, and support lifestyles that are harmless in 
                       theory and in practice.  we can live, even in this country, without exploiting 
                       poor animals.

we put a 
                                      strong emphasis on a strict plant-based vegetarian diet.  we are also against 
                                      using animals as ingredient or for testing cosmetics and other household items.  
                                      we believe in simplicity of life that is friendly to us, animals, and 
                   environment.
