clarke family tree

clarke tree
clarkeology.com is mostly our clarke family tree stuff site, set up to host the tree information
dug up by my dad, barry leslie clarke,
and turned into web pages by me, paul clarke.
click on any of the names on this page to get climbing the tree from that point, or see the family names,
or the family tree forum (that is not really a forum any more, sorry).
there is a page for each person in our tree
with links to their parents, children, + siblings, + some other stats.
plus it's all formatted up with schema.org microformats.
i wrote it a while ago in php
so have redone it in javascript now.
this is also now a static site, split over several repo's, how exciting.
still hoping to add more branches to our
family tree! if you'd like to traverse our family tree you can pick a person (say
me or
charles valentine clarke or
the famous harry clarke
and then follow the links up + down the tree.
maybe start with dad below ð
we made some progress on
john samways,
matilda grant,
samuel rainey,
james lyman
so we now have a complete set of great-great grandparents for dad! still more info to be had from the
census and
bmd records,
we're adding new family very very occasionally. it's really exciting when you find new family,
but then it's a struggle again when you feel you have exhausted all the tree info you can find.
we used up our free allowance on myheritage and have decided it's not worth paying them any more.
new family will definitely appear on the site if we find any.
no royalty or surprise family fortunes yet, but we have tracked down some distant cousins we knew nothing about, + found we had
relatives on the titanic.
searching for stoke newington or folkestone info here?
man alive you've been coming here a long time! best off heading to the blog...
