the kingâs grove is located in a historic royal location where kings, 
nobility and invited guests came together
to hunt, train for war, test 
their skills amongst each other, and  most importantly to 
celebrate at a medieval festival.

	the weapons used for hunting are the same as those used for war and 
	competitions: bow, 
	crossbow, lance or spear, knife and sword. the horses they ride are the 
	most important animal of a great medieval household or army, and are used in battle 
	as well as during a show of chivalry at a joust. 


	on this august bank holiday weekend, all members of society are invited by 
	the âkingâ to come to experience and revel in the sights, sounds, 
	skills, food, and drink at the annual england's medieval festival.
