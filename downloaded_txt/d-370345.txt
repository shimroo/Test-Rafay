                not so well known by most americans, but it is worth                  
                consideration as our country stands in peril of loosing                  
                everything we hold dear. at a time when our financial solvency                  
                and our national security are more vulnerable than we have ever                  
                been, what will save us from the doom that lurks at our                  
                doorstep? i chose to paint this vision at the triumphant moment                  
                when the angel of liberty bursts upon the scene. whether or not                  
                the vision is authentic, is debatable, but the message it                  
                contains is timeless. read the vision and learn more at:  http://jonmcnaughton.com/

				country!
heavenly                  
                father, we come before you today to ask your forgiveness and to                  
                seek your direction and guidance.                                                                                        
                we know your word says, 'woe to those who call evil good,' but                  
                that is exactly what we have done.                                                                                        
                we have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed our values.                                                                                        
                we have exploited the poor and called it the lottery.                                                                                         
                we have rewarded laziness and called it welfare.                                                                                         
                we have killed our unborn and called it choice.                                                                                         
                we have shot abortionists and called it justifiable.                                                                                        
                we have neglected to discipline our children and called it                  
                building self-esteem.                                                                                        
                we have abused power and called it politics.                                                                                         
                we have coveted our neighbor's possessions and called it                  
                ambition.                                                                                         
                we have polluted the air with profanity and pornography and                  
                called it freedom of expression.                                                                                         
                we have ridiculed the time-honored values of our forefathers and                  
                called it enlightenment.                                                                                         
                search us, oh god, and know our hearts today; cleanse us from                  
                sin and set us free.
amen!'                                                                                        
                with the lord's help, may this prayer sweep over our nation and                  
                wholeheartedly become our desire so that we once again can be                  
                called 'one nation under god!'
