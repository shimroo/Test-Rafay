the monday pearl is provided by the third district history and archives committee and is a bi-weekly sharing of fraternity content, commentary, and research of historical value we hope brothers will enjoy and from which brothers will draw inspiration. previous “pearls” can be found here. the committee encourages your feedback. should you have reactions, comments, information, anecdotes, documents, and the like, related to any of the content we share, we’d very much like to hear from you. please send all communication to 3dhistoryandarchives@gmail.com.
