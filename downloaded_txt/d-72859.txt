fast wifi        


        our wireless invention lies at the heart of what is now the most popular way to connect computers without wires. it is used in offices, public buildings, homes and coffee shops - often called 'wifi hotspots'. the invention came out of our pioneering work in radioastronomy.
      
where did wifi come from?







aerogard        


        aerogard has been keeping flying pests at bay since the 1960s, helping prevent diseases that infect animals and humans. in 1938, doug waterhouse was working on a repellent for sheep blowfly. with the arrival of world war ii, he turned to protecting allied troops from mosquitoes.

world's first hendra vaccine        


        in 1994, a deadly new virus threatened to stop australia's premier horse race – the melbourne cup. over 16 years, 18 outbreaks of hendra virus were recorded. in may 2011, we announced the development of a prototype vaccine for horses. by march 2013, our scientists confirmed that horses were immune to hendra virus six months post vaccination.
      
how it happened







plastic banknotes        


        australia's introduction of plastic bank notes with optically variable devices (ovds), developed by csiro, was a world's first and represented a paradigm shift towards a currency secure against forgery. this was one of our longest  and most successful research initiatives.

raft polymerisation        


        raft polymerisation is a new technique for creating plastics that allows a higher degree of control over the way molecules link together. plastics are essential elements of modern life, created through the process of polymerisation to give them a range of different attributes.
