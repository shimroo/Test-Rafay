welcome to waa

 atlatl = estolica = miru = propulseur = spear thrower = speerschleuder = woomeraatlatls are ancient weapons that preceded the bow and arrow in most parts of the world and are one of humankind’s first mechanical inventions. an atlatl is essentially a stick with a handle on one end and a hook or socket that engages a light spear or “dart” on the other. the flipping motion of the atlatl propels the dart much faster and farther than it could be thrown by hand alone.
