hello.sup ya'all. hahah its 3.26 am nw and i feel like blogging. this is what ive been doing fr the past days, stay up till late night and woke up by noon the next day, enjoying to the fullest fr this 5 weeks of my holiday bfre im back to school, daily and boring routines. hahaspending my late nights with lappy in my living room, been sleeping in the living room since 1st day of ramadhan, it feels good la, so spacious, and i have the space all by myself. ((:so practically ive been enjoying the days at home, haha sound bored staying home everyday, but not to me, haha and some things have already occupy my time, im back tutoring with a new "kid" still related,haha my own cousin la. tutoring is always fun for me but it's hard to encourage the kids to study, i mean like auto mode like that, like the kids dont have to be forced to study you see, i wonder if im like that when im in primary school, kids nowadays are really pampered, no doubt. motivate them can be really hard, how can i make a 2 hr lesson interesting? haiz, google will help i guess. haha.hari raya is nearing and i have nt prepared, dont know if i need a new shoe and a bag, will be gg to shop with mum later, i hope! this year ramadhan is a little diff and i must say its the best ramadhan so far. iftar with the family every weekend is always great, smth to always look forward on a weekend. and also suprisingly this yr ramadhan, i nvr did a countdown for raya like i used to last time, haha and this year, time flies fast eh, suddenly its already a week left to raya, i never feel tired,draggy or anything this ramadhan, feels different, feels really good and ofcourse i am so looking forward for raya this yr, hey still can collect duit raya tau! hehe. so what you guys always excited about raya? for me it would be dressing up part, the foodsand the visiting and then being very tired and lay flat with my baju kurung in the living room. lol. besides the maaf memaafan part,i hate the crying part, isk promise i wont tear this year. haha, okay thats not impt, but to be around with yr loved ones is always the best.  i guess most of the people have baked cookies and kuih fr raya, i will only start next week with granny, very very excited.and so an advance selamat hari raya to all ((:imy
