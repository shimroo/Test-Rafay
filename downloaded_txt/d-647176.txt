what is dpa?
 

dpa new zealand is run by and for disabled people. it is a disabled people’s organisation (dpo) that includes people with all types of impairments. we work in collaboration with others to achieve equity and inclusion for all in aotearoa new zealand.
since our formation in 1983, dpa has brought disabled people together and shaped our collective input in a way that drives system level change; significant outcomes have included influencing the human rights act 1993, disabled persons employment promotion repeal act 2007 and the writing and adoption of the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (uncrpd).
