come on along!  here's the schedule of club activities through december 7, 2024. 
loch raven christmas bird count, december 15, 2019
75th anniversary: on march 11, 1945, the newly formed maryland ornithological society (baltimore bird club) held its very first bird walk, at lake roland.  seven members participated; and they observed 15 species of birds, plus an unidentified woodpecker.  
irving e. hampe, the first president of society, wrote this account of the walk.  here is a link to the first issue of maryland birdlife, where hampe's report originally appeared.
on march 11, 2020, the 75th anniversary of that first walk, we held another walk: 23 members identified some 48 species, but we missed some of the ones that the founders saw on their trip.
we are grateful to book karnjanakit for letting us put up a pdf of birdland, a short comic she created about birds and people in baltimore, 2019.
