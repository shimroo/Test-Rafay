still an outlaw in their eyes...
docweasel.com puts the ecch in eclectic. it's a compendium of articles and projects by our team, which has changed, grown and shrunk over the years, encompassing the work of 40+ people. much of docweasel.com is nsfw but there's no real pr0n here, only nude models, but they are everywhere and in unexpected places so beware. there are also erotic stories by some of the greatest and most prolific writers in the trade which cover every flavor from vanilla to monkey-brains, so beware again. most of the writers used pseudonyms and the anonymity gave them freedom to write really out-there stuff because they didn't have to defend it or take responsibility for it. this resulted in some cool stuff. it's all here in the archives.
there's humor, a huge monty python section with the tv show, movies and albums - politics - music - movies - erotica - comics games  and so very much more. explore the feature sections in the menu on the left and the articles in the category menu on the right.
