songs in service - amplifying powerful stories and collective healing through musical activismas a conscious musician, it has been an honor to write songs and articles about topics close to my heart.  music has the unique ability to spark powerful emotionally charged awareness and community building around local and worldly issues.  when we experience a deep sense of emotion around a particular subject, even for just a few minutes, we are much more likely to seek out further information and engage in growth and healing activities that support positive change in that area of life.
