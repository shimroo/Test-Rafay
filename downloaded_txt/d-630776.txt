we will give 
			anyone $500.00 if they can show a saddle, bit, or riding technique 
			that we do more for any horse or rider. 


please show a 
			saddle, bit, or riding technique that we do more for any equine. 
			lets see if anything has come close in the past 80 years, since the 
			legendary horseman monte foreman from colorado created and designed 
			it, and i have spent over 45 years perfecting it? 


 

five 
			major reasons why the top 1% of the best and strongest riders in the 
			world would never ride your saddle.

 

#1. if it has a rigid saddle tree it will never fit 
			one horse on this planet and thats a guarantee you can count on.

 
#2. if it 
			needs a nasty saddle pad to make it fit.
 

#3. if the stirrups are hung behind the cinch like a 
			western pleasure or dressage saddle which causes a huge lack of 
			balance, security, agility, control, and speed.
 

 #4. if the seats are built up in front shoving every 
			rider to the rear like youre riding double but the guy in front got 
			off.
 
#5. if it 
			takes two people to put it on the horse because it's so heavy.
 


 


"the 
			laws of physics and common sense"

don't be 
			fooled; a wooden saddle tree only fits a wooden horse, mule, or 
			donkey. it is impossible to fit a rigid object to a moving object, 
			no matter how you pad it, period, and that is a proven fact. 




			 



			boz perfect balance ride spring-flex saddles



			us patent # 5101614



			are the most scientifically designed and built saddles in the world.
 
the boz saddle is 14 lbs. for 
			pleasure and 16 lbs. to rope ready to ride. these saddles never need 
			a saddle pad on any horse, mule, or donkey; you ride, and they are 
			always a perfect fit. because the padding is built into the saddles, 
			eliminating all bulk, weight, and heat. this is just one of the 36 
			things which makes us #1 and nothing even comes close. 


 
please 
			watch this video to prove what i am talking about, the 
			slow-motion shoulder movement
			of the horse,
			


			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieic33ggjse 
			

 

1. 
a saddle tree with the us. patent # 
			5101614, which will fit any horse, mule, or donkey, you put it on 
			the same tree on everyone, please show me an animal it will not fit?
			
the question is, why would 
			anyone use a solid wooden saddle tree on their horse, mule, or 
			donkeys back, which is three times harder than the back of 
			superman's head, and try to tell everyone how great it works; do 
			they think we are all that stupid, this is 2023, not 1902?

2. riding by reasoning video' will show 

why you're having 
			so many problems with your saddles.
			it will also show 
			how to build the #1 saddle in the world and why the top 1% of the 
			best and strongest riders in the world never ride a saddle with the 
			stirrups hung behind the cinch, never, so why would you? your saddle 
			is built wrong, and that is why you are having so many problems. 
			changing your saddle and bit will change your life forever, and your 
			horse, mule, and donkey will love you for it. 


			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hed0h3ctyfy.


 

3. this pdf file,
			


			http://www.bozsaddlery.com/anniespdf.html


will explain the rest of the story of why your 
			saddles are built incorrectly. just think what you and your horse, 
			mule, or donkeys could 
achieve 
			if you were in the #1 saddle ever designed for the equine world, and 
			there has never been anything designed to come close for over 82 
			years since the legendary horseman monte foreman from colorado 
			created it.


			 


4. 
there has never 
			been a saddle made that can even come close to a "boz perfect 
			balance ride spring-flex saddle," us. patent # 5,101,614, 36 things 
			it will do that no other saddle can, and this link will show why.



			http://bozsaddlery.com/36%20things%20a%20boz%20saddle%20can%20do%20that%20no%20other%20saddle%20can.htm


 

5. this is 
			precisely what we have been saying for over 80 years, but just take 
			2 aspirins, not the whole bottle. this is unbelievable; feet are not 
			tied in, no hanging on the horn to stay on, two hands guiding not 
			just one, and that alone will give anyone 50% more control, and her 
			butt is not pounding the seat, this is a racing sport not out of 
			control western pleasure class. she also rides over the top of the 
			horse's shoulders just like racing, jumping, polo, and saddle broc 
			riding. ten-year-old katie is running the barrels on her 3-year-old 
			standing up, now thats riding folks and it doesnt get any better 
			than that!!! for everyone else, its guiding with only one hand, and 
			giving up 50% of their control, now hanging on with the other so 
			they dont fall off, now pound your ass in the seat like a 
			jackhammer, and beating the wind out of them with both legs. no 
			folks dont kid yourselves this is not balanced riding it is only 
			showing that it is a battle to stay astraddle on top of a so-called 
			counterfeit barrel racing saddle, and no one is balance riding here, 
			period.

6. here is 
			another example of being able to ride on your feet and not your seat 
			if your saddle is built correctly.

			quarter horse congress freestyle reining winner, pickup chic ridden 
			by laura mae schoeller  
			


			https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=lzon5qe9lg0


 

7. here is what 
			you can achieve when you can ride on your feet and not your seat 
			with the stirrups hung in front of the cinch at your horse's elbows 
			in a boz perfect balance ride spring- flex saddle. just like racing 
			for speed, jumping for balance, polo for agility, and saddle bronc 
			riding for maximum security. these riders all ride saddles with the 
			stirrups hung in front of the cinch, not behind it, like the saddles 
			you are using now. riding and having a horse trained to this level 
			will make you a champion in any discipline; also, this level of 
			training or riding has never been achieved in any other saddle or 
			bit ever made, and it will never happen in what you are using now. 
			so what are you waiting for? it is time to change your life forever, 
			and we would love to have you on the "team." 


			https://youtu.be/1azjbahxxfe?t=1


			 

8. here is the 
			link to the number one saddle in the world and nothing comes close.
			


			http://bozsaddlery.com/race%20trainer%20saddles.htm


 

these 8 things 
			show why we have such a significant advantage over everyone else 
			when it comes to riding and training a horse to this level. please 
			consider changing what you have been doing, and let us help you 
			become the best you can become and the safest you can be. if i can 
			ever be of any more help, please call any time. we would love to 
			help you and your horse, mule, or donkey. we have been in business 
			for over 45 years as a monte foreman instructor doing as many as 800 
			clinics and setting world record symposiums that will never be

without a great handle you have nothing,

			will never achieve a great handle and thats why they only use 
			bozzage eq. so the eq you choose is not just eq it is everything!
yours truly, only after 90 days of training him 
			plus 12 more rides, so when people tell us all about the 90- day 
			wonder training we just say, wait until we get 6 months to 1 year on

			and full-run, two hands, one hand, no hands on the reins, all in the 
			correct leads, etc. then i will show the 23 ways to pick up the 
			correct leads. then i will show the 26 ways to change leads. then i 
			will show the 8 ways to do a 180- degree roll, 4 from a left lead

boz

14lbs. ready to ride and they never 
			need a saddle pad on any type of horse you ride!!

patent # 5101614,
if you ever want to achieve more speed, balance, 
			security, agility, and control like you have never had before. this 
			video called riding by reasoning, how to build 
			the #1 saddle in the world, for the horse and rider. 

			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hed0h3ctyfy.
 and the pdf file, riding by reasoning,
a must read if you want the truth, and 
			why your saddle is your #1 problem, 

			http://www.bozsaddlery.com/anniespdf.html 
 both were designed and created by the great monte 
			foreman. they will both prove without a question or doubt, that the 
			strongest and best riders in the world, like jockeys for maximum 
			speed, jumpers for maximum balance, polo for maximum agility, and 
			saddle bronc riders for maximum security, never and i mean never, 
			ride any saddle with the stirrups hung behind the cinch or under the 
			rider at any speed or direction, so why do you? quit following 
			people that dont know what they are doing and your life will change 
			forever. i will give $500.00 to anyone that can prove that the video 
			and pdf file is wrong. there is only 1% that will see it and get it; 
			the other 99% never take the time to see it and that is why they 
			never get it, but they always want to tell everyone how to do it. 
			now the true question is how many of you really love your horse 
			enough to do something about it. i hope this helps those that want 
			the help. sincerely boz at bozsaddlery.com

#6.
something new!  
  
when i was 
			asked to build and design the #1 racing saddles in the world i said 
			i would not do 3 things.

#1. i will not build 
			a racing saddle out of a block of wood because 
we cant 
			argue with the laws of physics and common sense, it is impossible to 
			fit a rigid object to a moving object, period, and no one can, not 
			even you.. 

#2. i will not hang the stirrups behind the cinch 
			like a western pleasure or dressage saddle, they will be hung 
			forward of the cinch like a jockey, jumper, polo or saddle bronc 
			saddle and they all 4 get more speed,  balance, agility, and 
			security than anyone in the world because their stirrups are hung in 
			front of the cinch.

#3. and it will fit so perfectly that it needs no 
			pad on any horse you ride, from 5 miles to 500- mile races.

so here it is coming in at 14-lbs.ready to ride and i 
			hope you like it because your horse will love you for using it, and 
			i promise it will change the horse world as we know it forever.

(this is racing folks not out of control western pleasure)
tell me my students can't 
			outrace anyone seating on their ass running cans nothing comes 
			close to what you see here racing cans in and out of every turn in 
			the correct leads, and it has never happened until now. we ride on 
			our feet not our seat at any speed or direction, this is racing not 
			out of control western pleasure, and unless you change from what you 
			are using for saddles, bits and riding technique, you best not try 
			this at home, your stirrups will run the rear into the flanks of 
			your horse and dump you on your face pushing the horn out your back.
			look how far she has been taught by me to ride with her heels 
			down, and look how far the horse lead right hind foot goes up and 
			under the girth, this saddle will teach anyone how to ride at a 
			level they thought they never could do, and the last pic here really 
			shows what i am talking about, no flopping around here.  no one 
			wakes up one morning and starts riding to this level unless you have 
			been taught bozzage. ask her or everyone else that owns one if they 
			would ever sell it?  sincerely boz at bozsaddlery.com

2017

mmf thunders echo+/, owned by cheri briscoe


echo says, "here i am with my fourth 
(and probably last) championship. i say its my last because its also cheris 
10th. my dad, aerc hall of fame dr thunder bask+// won it five times, 
and she won it once on my uncle mmf faramir+//. she says shes getting old and 
creaky and 10 is a good place to stop competing and just do rides for fun.
however, one goal does remain - taking 
my 3/4 brother mmf elendil into aercs decade team. she and "elly" have five 
years through 2017 and, if the lord allows them five more, he would be cheris 
fourth decade stallion. 
2017 was challenging as we were trying 
to do just enough miles to keep my cousin hcc elessar+/ in my rearview mirror, 
cheri bred elessar for hyannis cattle co.s ted jeary and was all too aware of 
his capabilities. sired by my uncle mmf faramir+//(x koszar) and out of a 
double-bred *kosciusko mare, elessar represents the very best of the renowned 
(and now sadly vanishing) "hcc" bloodlines. cheris wish for the future is a 
foal by him from one of my daughters. 
2017 turned out great for karen donkey 
and my son mmf aragon out of elendils dam mmf melian). congratulations on their 
four 50-mile wins - all bc
as always, my thanks go to boz saddlery 
for his fantastic saddles. with over 12,000 miles on it, mines a bit worn, but 
it keeps my back happy and lets cheri keep my cinch (very) loose - even when is 
naughty. and without the protection of kirt and gina landers renegade boots, my 
feet never could have gone all those miles (almost 8,000 to date)! and to mary 
casey, farrier extraordinaire, who keeps my renegades fitting perfectly.
cher adds: "most of all, none of this 
could ever have been possible but for the undeserved blessings from my lord and 
savior jesus christ to whom i owe it all"
trust in the lord with all your heart - 
lean not on your own understanding. in all your ways acknowledge him, and he 
will direct your paths. proverbs 3:5, 6

boz saddlery/bozzage training presents 
			introduction to "world horsemanship" by 
			monte foreman


the trick to great horsemanship is to be at the right place at 
			the right time with the least amount of fuss as possible.
foreman was probably the most controversial author to ever talk 
			about horsemanship. because most of its action is faster than the 
			eye. he was the 1st to use slow motion cameras so all 
			being said, foremans horsemanship should of been called 
			"introduction to world horsemanship"


teaching the world what to look for in performance and why it 
			works. lets see what makes a working horse work. because the 
			majority of horse owners ride without reason - system or knowledge.
			
the rider must not only know more than the horse, he also must 
			know how to help the horse. like barrel racing when disunited in the 
			hind legs he has no pivot or weight caring leg, this is the riders 
			mistake. thats why the hind quarters falls to the outside. going to 
			the barrel in the wrong lead and coming out in the wrong lead. 
no folks, the horse is not being helped by the rider, 
			instead they are being thrown off balance and the rider believes the 
			horse should be good enough to figure it out on his own. not going 
			to happen! without leg aid control and training. the horse is always 
			guessing . the riders legs aids must control the hind quarters other 
			wise the horse is always at a disadvantage to handle with maximum 
			efficiency it takes competent riding and training to stop 
			disuniting. when the withers go lower than the croup, too much 
			weight goes on his front legs making it harder and taking too much 
			time to turn. with leg aids, a rider can stop the hind quarter from 
			displacing or disuniting in a turn, rhythm and agility go together, 
			you must learn as a good rider. rein-weight and leg aids for maximum 
			control of the hind end to get much done.

  its 
the footwork that counts! 
 a monte foreman film presented by boz saddlery/bozzage 
training/ john "boz" bozanich ( a monte foreman accredited instructor)
over 80% of it is in the use of leads. 
 leads are the left handiness and 
right handiness of galloping horses. this film demonstrates more about left 
handed and right handed footwork, that has ever been known before by horseman 
all over the world.  it is hard to believe that less than 1% of all riders in 
the world can do flying changes of leads on call.
monte foreman was the 1st. in the world to do a front foot first 
and hind foot first flying change on call.  horses become chronically one sided because riders who do not know leads make 
them that way . horses are not one leaded by nature. the horse doesnt have to 
be in the correct lead for every turn, but the rider must always know what lead 
the horse has and when it is necessary to change it.the only maneuver a cutting horse needs is a rollback. a right lead rollback 
to a left lead then rollback to a right lead and stay head to head to whatever 
is in front of you, that simple!  
"monte foreman developed the first complete basic handle ever assembled."
the horses accurately use of the leads account for over 80% of their agility. 
everything is done in balance with ease and in rhythm because of a well trained 
rider in our riding system. its like dancing the rider has to guild, because he is the only one who 
knows where theyre going. this also prevents pattern sore horses. even in stops we stand up in the stirrups and check the horse down in 
balance. monte foreman was the main influence to the world on how to do slide 
stops with no slide ground, no slide shoes and no slide boots, just good old 
regular dirt and deep too. you can see now why it really is the footwork that 
counts. may you always ride a great horse and your great horse enjoy you more 
through "bozzage". hope to see you at the next bozzage clinic. 559-542-1269 or

					boz, your leather treatment is awesome! just got my leather 
					agility racer back, i had sold it to a friend years ago when 
					i was raising down payment money for a house. she didn't 
					condition it for 9 years. needless to say it was more than a 
					little stiff. one application and its soft and supple again. 
					my hands love it too! thanks for another great product! 
					looks like i'll be using it on all 3 of my boz saddles. 
					merry christmas!
