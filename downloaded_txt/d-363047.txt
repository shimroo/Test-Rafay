                      	 ggp proposal and my thoughts on one aspect ggp's presentation
	                       
                          

ggp presented their proposal for a zoning regulation amendment and a general plan amendment to allow them to redevelop downtown columbia.  you can watch their presentation here.tomorrow at 7pm the county council will hear economic analysis from the county's economic development authority and the columbia association will present its plans for symphony woods.  the presentations will be at the board of education building on route 108 across from cedar lane.over the next couple weeks we will delve into the details in the proposal, but for know i wanted to reflect one interesting aspect of the presentation:it was nice to see that ggp has finally recognized the extension of mass transit rail as an important part of the transit solutions.  it is something i have been pushing for during the past four years, both in conversations with the county executive before and after he got elected, with ggp officials, and on this blog.  ggp several times put up the proposed map of the extensions of the baltimore light rail.  they should also take note of the proposals to extend the dc green line to ft. meade, which is roughly the same distance north as columbia from greenbelt.   as i repeatedly have pointed out the key to mass transit is ridership density and to maximize ridership density you want to maximize connection of where  people are with where they want to go.  the proposals that currently are being looked at to extend the baltimore light rail and the dc metro don't do that, but a system like this would:the dc metro took 15 years from the start of construction to the completion of the number of new stops that are in the above extension with roughly the same numbers of above and below ground stations.if ggp and the county elected officials want walkable communities, then creating a system like this with a significant portion of eastern howard county's population within a 10 minute walk of a station is the way to go.the previous traffic studies on downtown columbia show that our biggest traffic problems if they approve the development will be our local roads which will have intersections that are worse than traffic on rockville pike.  park and ride mass transit alone will not solve our traffic problems or allow us to manage growth pressures.  a walk and ride system with some park and ride stations would relieve pressure on local roads and allow the county to absorb growth in a managed smart growth way.labels: downtown columbia, metro, zra 113

ca selects mobile dredging and pumping co. for lake elkhorn dredging the columbia association (ca) has awarded a contract to mobile dredging and pumping co., of chester, pa, for the dredging of lake elkhorn. the proposed dredging plan follows the permitted plan and requires no amendments to the permits obtained for this project.the lake elkhorn dredging project has been in the planning and development stages for several years. ca solicited the input of residents, board members and other stakeholders to develop a plan that responds to community, environmental and traffic concerns, and presents a responsible approach to accomplishing the dredging within budget.  after canceling the first request for proposal, re-issuance of the request for proposals for lake elkhorn dredging was released on july 22, 2009. proposals were due on august 18, 2009 and ca received four proposals. a five-person, multidisciplinary evaluation team was established and the proposals were evaluated. mobile dredging and pumping co. had the highest rated proposal which was satisfactory in all terms of methodology, performance time and cost, and met all of the minimum requirements of the request for proposal.construction of the staging area, which is located at the parking area accessed by broken land parkway and adjacent grassy area, is scheduled to begin early october 2009. active dredging and material de-watering is scheduled to occur from november 2009 and continue into the fall of 2010. this includes the hydraulic dredging of approximately 52,000 cubic yards of accumulated sediment from the forebay pond, main lake and the tail water pond. at the staging area, the hydraulically dredged material will be de-watered and hauled by truck to off-site locations for disposal.# # #10221 wincopin circlecolumbia, maryland 21044switchboard: 410-715-3000fax 410-715-0389

byron macfarlane has filed to run for register of wills.  this sets up what might be one of the more competitive races in howard county in the 2010 election cycle.  incumbent kay hartleb is one of the last republicans elected countywide.  she has served as register of wills for the past 23 years and we all know how hard it is to defeat an incumbent, much less one that has served for over 2 decades.  yet byron macfarlane brings to the table a specialty in wills, estates, and trusts and a vision to make the register of wills office more accessible:from byron's website:howard county residents deserve improved access to the office of the register. whether it is in person, over the phone, or online, i am committed to howard county residents having improved access to important information and more easily finding answers to their questions.  i will overhaul the register of wills website for howard county to provide detailed explanations of the services of the office, the probate process, filing requirements, information on estate and inheritance taxes, announcements about where and when i and my staff will be in your community, and links to other resources that are helpful to residents. i have posted some of these links on this website. i will also work with other registers of wills around the state, and the attorney general’s office, to explore implementing an e-filing system that would expedite estate administration, cut down on costs to families, and reduce environmental waste.i have know byron for a number of years and he is someone with a deep passion for service and making people's life easier.  when you combine this with his vision and deep roots in howard county and this shapes up to be a potentially very competitive election.labels: byron macfarlane, register of wills

                      	 ca's proposed design plan for symphony woods park
	                       
                          

  the proposed concept plan begins the evolution of symphony woods into symphony woods park. the goal for this plan is to develop the site into an attractive setting for public recreation and community events while protecting and enhancing the site's natural features. this proposed park will be a bold gateway to the woods and the pavilion, and for the first time, a year round destination as a park.  the central focal point for the park will be a plaza to include an interactive water feature and a small café with restrooms. green technologies will be used in the design of these structures. a place to play, relax and watch people, the park will become a destination that enhances the lives of those living and working in columbia. three other activity areas are proposed: a children's play area, sculptures, and future park related uses. a bold circular walk tucked inside the woodland setting is designed to establish a 'sense of place' and provide for pedestrian circulation. this walk will define the natural topographic bowl and reinforce the visual axis connecting town center with the pavilion. the center of the circle, with a modest amount of tree thinning, will be a special outdoor room for the community to gather. more intensive activities will be located around the outside of the circle and its center will be left open for passive use. a boardwalk on the eastern side of the circle will allow natural storm water drainage and ensure that the walk will meet accessibility standards by not exceeding a 5% grade. the boardwalk will also minimize re-grading which is detrimental to tree roots.  parking on the western edge of the park will ensure easy access for park users. the 120-space parking lot and some of the activity areas on the periphery of the circular walkway will support community events, minimizing compaction of existing tree roots. many new trees will be planted for the park to replace those removed in park construction or due to decline. they will be located to provide shade and aesthetic appeal as well as to provide habitat and to absorb storm water.  a 'woodland garden' located in the eastern section of the park will showcase a variety of native and woodland plants. this special garden will be a destination by its own merits and will add to the experience of visitors to symphony woods park. the woodland garden will link to the walkway system encircling the pavilion grounds and to columbia's pathways. park visitors will be able to walk one mile by completing a loop around the pavilion. a special gathering place for the people of columbia and howard county, symphony woods park will add life and vitality to columbia's town center. the concept for the proposed park establishes a definitive plan based upon a program of family-oriented recreation activities. the measure of any great civilization is in its cities, and the measure of a city's greatness is to be found in the quality of its public spaces, its parks and squares. john ruskin

                      	 columbia association's position on symphony woods
	                       
                          

late last year, ca reviewed plans for symphony woods presented by general growth properties (ggp) as part of their submittal for the general plan amendment. after review, the ca board chose to work with independent landscape architects and land planners (cy paumier and john slater) to study options for symphony woods. the goal for this plan is to develop the site into an attractive setting for public recreation and community events while protecting and enhancing the site’s natural features.columbia residents are encouraged to attend one or both of the following meetings:wed, sep 16 • 7:30pm__visual presentation of symphony woods concept plan* slayton house • 10400 cross fox ln • col 21044 • 410-715-3118sat, sep 26 • 10:30am-noon__walking tour of symphony woods concept plan• symphony woods • 5950 symphony woods rd • col 21044 • 410-715-3118designers will then lead the walking tour through symphony woods to help residents visualize the possible future of the park.for more information, please call 410-715-3118.ca encourages residents to attend one or both presentations and provide feedback on these concept plans.the message below appeared in the columbia flier on sept 3, 2009 (full-page ad)symphony woods: preserve, enhance, admirea message from ca to columbia residentsthe columbia association is aware that the howard county council will be considering zra-113 and the general plan amendment (gpa) presented by general growth properties (ggp). the purpose of this letter is to provide the columbia association position with regard to the area identified in the gpa as the merriweather portion of the town center redevelopment. we are aware that ggp was required by the county to create a comprehensive master plan for all of downtown, including property they did not own. to this end, ggp offered a concept for the use of symphony woods, and stated their understanding that it was not their property and that it would ultimately be up to ca to propose a plan.in july 2008, the ca board of directors approved a resolution that protects and enhances symphony woods by creating a park-like environment. the resolution states: “future plans for symphony woods should include the following: (1) restoration and maintenance of a vibrant natural ecosystem, (2) provision for a gathering place for individuals and community events, (3) merriweather post pavilion will be an exciting and active destination, (4) limited roadways or buildings of a park-related scale, and (5) connectivity and accessibility to the rest of downtown.”our intent is to make symphony woods more attractive to residents by improving the grounds, adding walking paths, and introducing an interactive water feature and other park-like amenities. ca staff has been working with consultants to create an exciting design plan for symphony woods park. the concept plans will be introduced to the community through a communications plan over the next few months and additional input will be sought from thecommunity. the funding for the proposed symphony woods park plan will be included by staff in the draft fy 11-12 budget to be presented to the ca board for approval. ca is committed to enhancing cultural activities and opportunities in columbia; it is our belief that these can be best accommodated in the lakefront district, as opposed to symphony woods. ca’s intent to preserve symphony woods is reinforced by the county’s vision plan for downtown that calls for preserving symphony woods and enhancing it with park-related features.we ask that any master plan recommended by the planning board acknowledge ca’s intentions as owner of symphony woods.for the board, phil kirsch • chair, columbia association board of directors

                      	 county council leadership
	                       
                          

the powers of a legislator are to propose bills, amend bills, vote on bills and amendments, and if they can rally the support of their colleagues pass bills.thus one important way a legislator can show leadership, particularly if they were not the original drafter of the legislation, if the bill that is before them has problems is to amend that bill.tonight we saw the county council show this type of leadership.  they took county bill 29 (cb-29) that came to them without a comprehensive community driven master planning process and they amended it to create a comprehensive community driven master planning process that each of columbia's villages can undertake.  you can find the bill language and amendments here at the bottom of the page.the following amendments passed:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14(in revised form), 15, 16, and 18amendment 14 passed, but the amendment itself was amended to add "and not overwhelm" so that the version of 14 that passed read: "if appropriate, secondary residential uses to support and enhance and not overwhelm other uses in the village center."  the following amendments failed:12 and 13the following amendment was withdrawn:17sometimes the community requests lots of changes and it takes lots of amendments to get the bill to reflect what the community has been asking for.  as i have told a number of people more amendments can be very good, if the amendments are enacting the changes county residents are asking for and if it improves the bill.county council members jen terrasa, mary kay sigaty, and calvin ball listened to there constituents and made sure that there was a comprehensive master planning process in this bill.  this is the legislative process working as it should.soon we will have the downtown rezoning bill to deal with.  it is very important that we keep clearly communicating with our elected officials what we want.  in the case of cb-29, the testimony of kings contrivance, which proposed specific amendments to the bill proved very effective and nearly all of the changes they requested were incorporated into the bill.  i strongly suggest that the testimony on all bills focuses in on specific amendments.labels: calvin ball, cb29-2009, county council, jen terrasa, mary kay sigaty, village centers

 assist the board in distinguishing between   budget centers that should be subsidized versus unsubsidized by the annual   charge. o     initiate for board review and approval short   and mid range fiscal policies document that will provide the board with the   realities of ca capabilities for financing programming.     issue 4   columbia association encourages   community engagement,

                      	 md moves ahead with the dc purple line and baltimore red line
	                       
                          

governor o'malley sent out the following email tuesday afternoon:three years ago we came together united by a statewide vision for transportation that includes mass transit and roads -- and today i've got some great progress to announce in our work to make maryland smart, green, and growing. this morning i announced our plans to move forward on the construction of the purple line, a light-rail line that will run between bethesda in montgomery county and new carrollton in prince george's county. the purple line won't just help us reduce traffic congestion and the air pollution that comes with it. it'll also give marylanders an inexpensive, reliable, and environmentally friendly way to reach the places where they work, play, and worship. how will the purple line affect your daily life? i want to hear what you think -- please share your thoughts here: http://www.martinomalley.com/purpleline at 16 miles, the new line will connect major employment and activity centers to residential areas. it'll also link up three marc commuter rail lines, amtrak, and local bus services. the purple line project will now be submitted to the federal transit administration as we seek approvals to begin engineering work and secure $1.5 billion in federal funding to complete the project. along with the purple line, we're also moving forward this week on the red line -- a light-rail project in baltimore that will better connect east and west baltimore to each other and to regional transportation lines. these investments mark the beginning of the next generation of maryland's transit system, and it's a new era that will yield benefits for commuters and non-commuters alike. take a moment now to share your thoughts on how the purple line will affect you: http://www.martinomalley.com/purpleline i look forward to hearing your comments! thank you, gov. martin o'malleythis is a major step forward in improving our regional transportation infrastructure.  the next step will be to connect the two metro systems.  a couple years ago i laid out on this blog one example of how this could be done to maximize the ridership density needed to bring in revenue to the system, reduce congestion on local roads and enabling managed growth in already developed areas, and protect and improve the county property tax base for many years into the future, while staying committed to being a mixed income community.labels: metro

                      	 netroots nation panel on local blogging
	                       
                          

i will be moderating a panel on city and county blogging at this year's netroots nation.  though i  took a hiatus from posting on this blog while i served on the columbia council and i have only slowly been getting back into posting since my term ended, i think i bring to the panel both an understanding of the pros and cons of posting while serving in elected office and the challenges of trying to build a group blog.  all the longtime readers here have seen the waves of guest posters and know of my strong desire to try to build a sustained group blog.  i also think howard county has had an interesting mix of local blogs of varying styles and i hope to contribute that perspective. the panelists that will join me in this discussion come from all over the country and have had a wide range of blogging experience at the local level and all have been more successful than i at establishing strong local blogs. the other panelists are:dan urevick-ackelsberg of philadelphia blog young philly politicspaul hogarth of san fransisco blog beyond chronjosh kalven who covers chicago on progress illinoiseli ackerman of the new orleans blog we could be famousit will be a great discussion and if you can make it to pittsburgh on august 13-16th i encourage you to register for netroots nation and come join the discussion.

one of the great things the county council has done to promote good dialog with county residence is put the draft language of the amendments they are considering online, so residence can read them in advance to help them prepare testimony for the county council hearing on monday, july 20th at 7:30pm at the board of education building on route 108 (near cedar lane).i hope to post my thoughts on the amendments in the next day or so.labels: county council, using technology well

party party party a longtime columbia establishment in dobbin center is closing.  i have always appreciated having this high quality party supply store in our community and am very sorry to see them closing.  the initial notice they sent to longtime customers was that their lease was not renewed.  if anyone knows the full story, i would be interested in knowing more.  when the lease in dobbin center was not going to happen, did they try to get a lease in other space?labels: dobbin center, party party party

what are your favorite things to do in howard county on the fourth of july?while we all enjoying time with friends and family, it is also a good time to reflect on both the courage of our founding fathers and the courage of other people who stand up for the right to select who governs them, such as the iranian people have been doing for the last two weeks.the national archives has a transcription of the declaration of independence online.howard county is the home of some of the descendants of charles carrroll, one of the signers of the declaration of independence.

                      	 local voices in the health care debate
	                       
                          

as the nation dives into the health care debate a number of howard county residents taking part as well.first up, what you can do:there is free event at amherst house, in the kings contrivance village center this saturday, june 27, 10:30 – 11:30 am where you can whatever your health care problems/concerns, and regardless of your political affiliation stop by and write letter to your elected officials expressing your views on the critically important issue of affordable health care for all americans.a kings contrivance resident is organizing this event and will provide the tools: paper, pen, envelopes and stamps,, as well as, a list of addresses for u.s. senators and representatives elected to congress by howard county residents.  and conveniently there is a mailbox right outside the door to amherst house.second:abc news’ charles gibson and diane sawyer moderated a conversation this evening with president obama about health care. a special edition of primetime “questions for the president: prescription for america” will air on wednesday, june 24th from 10:00-11:00 pm et on the abc television network.  the conversation with the president will continue on “nightline” at 11:35pm et.  president obama will answer questions in the east room of the white house from an audience made up of americans selected by abc news who have divergent opinions on the health care debate.  one of those selected is local businessman brian england, owner of british american auto care.third:two friends of mine, adam green and stephanie taylor (who are not howard county residents, but i still thought there effort might interest howard county residents), are organizing an effort to advocate for the inclusion of a public option within the health care plan.  if you also support the inclusion of a public option then you can sign up to have your name listed as a supporter in an ad they are putting together.  click here to go look at the ad and find out how to sign up.i personally would like universal health care and think the current health care system is inefficient and a drag on our economy.  the more our elected hear support for either universal health care or the public option, the more likely we will get a workable health care system that isn't just another bloated give away to insurance companies.  as adam and stephanie's ad makes clear special interests are pouring huge amounts of money into trying to block meaningful health care reform.labels: brian england, health care
