research interests 
brian's research interests include object-oriented programming,
			design, reuse, languages, frameworks, software architecture,
			patterns, reflection, metalevel architecture, and software evolution,
			for starters.
		
			i've managed to come up with electronic copies of all my
			publications and workshop position papers (and several talks as well)
			going back to 1985. these can be accessed via the links below. these
			are organized into the following categories. some probably belong in
			more than one category. direct hypertext links are given for papers
			for which html versions exist (such as  designing
						reusable classes). links to versions in other formats are given after
			each paper's pseudo-bibliographic entry.

smalltalk


			i have been working with smalltalk-80 for over ten years, beginning
			with dave ungar's bs, and the apple smalltalk that appeared on the
			lisa and macintosh during the mid-80s. from there, i've worked my way
			though the succession of parcplace smalltalk-80 incarnations. i was
			exposed early on to smalltalk-v as well. smalltalk has been at the
			foundation of much of my work, including designing
				to facilitate change with object-oriented frameworks and reflective facilities in smalltalk-80.
		
		
			i am a member (a charter member, in fact) of ralph johnson's
			smalltalk
				group at the dept. of computer
				science at the university of
				illinois at urbana-champaign. the smalltalk group curates the uiuc's
			smalltalk archive.
