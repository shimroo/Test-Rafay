geoceramica® now available
experience the beauty of porcelain combined with the practicality of concrete. click on the image below to explore.




built-in spacer bars allow for rapid placement and consistent joint widths throughout the project.




the popular porcelain face will never fade or experience unsightly efflorescence. its slip resistant surface is remarkably durable, repelling stains and scratches while being very easy to maintain.




the patented stabikorn® base layer is made of open structured concrete, which prevents excessive
capillary water from rising, and allows for differential rates of expansion and contraction between the tile
and base.




the aquaferm® adhesive permanently connects the porcelain tile with the base layer during production.
