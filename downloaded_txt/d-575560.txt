iris is proud to honor and remember dr. david polzin















dr. david polzin was one of the profession’s true leaders, thought provokers, innovators, and advocates. he was an active and long-time member of acvim (saim) and member and past officer of the asvnu. dr. polzin was also an important member of the iris board and inspirational in development of many iris agendas since its inception. dr. polzin was co-editor of the authoritative textbook, nephrology and urology of small animals. he was substantially involved in the establishment of specialty designation for nephrology from its initiation and served as an organizer, founder, and honorary member of the american college of veterinary nephrology and urology (acvnu). dr. polzin’s considerable intellectual contributions have helped forge the current status and understanding of urinary disease in animals. his inspiration, leadership, and contributions will be greatly missed.
