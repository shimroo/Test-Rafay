does exactly what it says on the tin. some of the nonsense contained herein may be very loosely related to the sisters of mercy, but i wouldn't bet your paypal account on it. in keeping with the internet's general theme nothing written here should be taken as gospel: over three quarters of it is utter gibberish, and most of the forum's denizens haven't spoken to another human being face-to-face for decades. don't worry your pretty little heads about it. above all else, remember this: you don't have to stay forever. i will understand.

sisters chat
the place for your sisters-related comments, questions and snippets of sisters information. for those who do not know, the sisters of mercy are a rock'n'roll band. and a pop band. and an industrial groove machine. or so they say. they make records. lots of records, apparently. but not in your galaxy. they play concerts. lots of concerts, actually. but you still cannot see them. so what's it all about, alfie? this is one of the few tightly-moderated forums on heartland, so please keep on-topic. all off-topic posts will either be moved or deleted. chairman bux is the editor and the editor's decision is final. danke.

trading
have you established a good reputation at hl and got some sisters stuff to sell or trade with the community? or are you searching for that elusive ultra rare live bootleg from 1988? ever had a bad experience with a trader on ebay? let us all know here. outdated threads will be purged over time. 

warning: newcomers posting here first will be treated like spammers. at least have the courtesy to say hello in general chat first...

joke of the day
new rules: one thread per day only. if there's a thread for today already started, post on that. and if there isn't? then you get to start one. aren't you the lucky one?

sisters resources
do you do a tsom-related website? do you know any cool tsom websites? sites listed here may be about anything to do with the sisters: lyrics, tours, photos, biographies, interviews, etc. post your urls along with a short description of the website here.

note: please post links about trading sisters memorabilia or your personal collection in the trading section.

reviews and interviews
post your reviews of sisters-related material or interviews with sisters-related musicians here. and don't believe the hype: 1985 most definitely is a fashion statement.

lyrics
got any interesting thoughts on a set of lyrics? any that don't involve the word "indeed"? find yourself struggling to decipher all those obtuse references von makes? read "1959 and all that" and still no clearer? nope, us neither. postcards found lying in a skip around the back of the chemists can be found here... don't say you weren't warned.
