latest news




on june 7, 2009, pastor david j. meyer preached a 
		sermon entitled, "there's 
		no place like home." in this message he beautifully expressed his 
		desire to reach his home in that heavenly city whose builder and maker 
		is god. almost exactly one year later the longing of his heart was 
		fulfilled and god took him to his everlasting home on june 8, 2010.

in memory of pastor meyer, we have revamped our 
		online audio library which includes "there's no place like home" and 
		nearly two hundred other messages. the library also includes three 
		sermons which are personal favorites of mine and were of great comfort 
		to me in the days following my father's passing. these messages are 
		entitled, "there 
		was no more sea," "flowers 
		in the desert," and "god 
		hears and remembers us." for quick access to all the sermons of 
		pastor meyer that we have available online, you may
		click here. thank you for all your prayers, consideration, and support.
