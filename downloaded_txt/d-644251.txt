driving economic equity through mentorship



























the streetwise partners missionstreetwise partners advances economic equity by connecting underrepresented talent to mentorship and career opportunities within the new york and d.c. metro areas. our programs empower adults, ages 18-65 with the skills, resources and access to networks to secure and maintain employment.  today, professional skills and networks are just as important as an education, but they are not distributed equally.  where you grow up, go to school and whether your parents are college educated make a difference, sometimes 12x the advantage in gaining access to career opportunity.  this is your time to become a mentee, to volunteer with us, to partner with us, to fuel change.

“i would sometimes have doubts that i’m not smart enough to sit at the table i wanted because i didn’t go to the most prestigious school or have family who worked in corporate. my mindset changed after networking with professionals who are thriving and have the same background as me. they were also first-generation college students or first-generation working in corporate, with parents who were stay-at-home moms or worked blue collar jobs. i realized that if they can do it, i can do it too.”
