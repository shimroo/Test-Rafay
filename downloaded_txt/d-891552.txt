wtix-fm: a part of the new orleans story














wtix 94.3 fm is new orleans’s greatest hits station. locally owned by fleur de lis broadcasting, the station operates at 100,000 watts and serves the city of new orleans and the gulf south. tix also streams online.










wtix 94.3 fm’s heritage call letters originate from the legendary top 40 am station wtix 690 am, “the mighty 690.” wtix 690 am new orleans dominated the airwaves from the 1950s into the 1980s as america’s first top 40 radio station, and the fm station debuted initially as its sister station in 1995.today tix fm continues the legacy of the original tix am featuring the classic hits, heritage tix jingles, and the famous “chime time” that rings when the personalities give the time on the air – a feature that was also a staple of musicradio wabc new york in its heyday.
general manager and program director michael costello developed tix fm and is committed to preserving the legacy that is wtix. costello is best known as michael in the morning (m&m), host of the station’s weekday morning show.








the announcers of wtix 94.3 fm are all veteran broadcasters. after m&m hot rod glenn picks up the mid-day duties, pal al nassar covers afternoon drive, and jay douglas a.k.a. jd the dj follows with the rock and roll flight to midnight. sgt. t-ben’s daily morning segment “the news you need now!” is a tongue-in-cheek mock news report lampooning politicians, celebrities, and topical news stories, concluding with his signature catchphrase, “but nobody cares!”
weekends also feature breakfast with the beatles and casey kasem american top 40 70s show.
