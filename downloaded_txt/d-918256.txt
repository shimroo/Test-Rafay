event description
 
welcome to the 42nd annual shiprock marathon, half marathon & 5k
shiprock youth center – friday, may 2 & saturday, may 3, 2025
 
the 2025 shiprock marathon will provide a unique and memorable running experience the first weekend of may in shiprock, new mexico!
 
the shiprock 5k trail race will take place at 5:00 p.m. on friday, may 2 on the blueberry hill course, beginning and ending at the youth center.  there are awards for top individual (overall and age-group top three) and team winners.  all runners will receive a performance t-shirt, race poster, swag and post-race snacks.
the marathon will begin at 7:00 a.m. with the start/finish area in shiprock.  runners who expect to compete for overall or age-group awards should start in the front of the mass start at 7:00.  shiprock marathon is a usatf certified course.
 
the half marathon will start at 7:30 a.m.
 
we offer team races for both the 5k on friday evening and the half marathon on saturday.  the team race provides an opportunity to get out there and run with your friends.  whether your team is out there to compete to win or to run as a group and have fun, this event is for you!  in the team races, each member of your team runs the full race and we score the event just like a cross country race.  both events need a team of 5 to compete (qualify for awards).  thinking about registering for the team event?  find four of your friends and do it!  there is no extra cost.  during registration just answer yes to the question: would you like to join or create a team?  only the first person in the group needs to create the team name, and the other members can join the team.  make sure everyone knows the correct name!
the out-and-back road course includes views of shiprock pinnacle and a gentle long downhill slope on the return.  there will be great course support and live music along the way.  expect to see the likes of dark sky, red hawk, pinon pickers, mountain spring and skoolboykook, sharing a variety of traditional, country, navajo blues, classic rock and rez metal sounds.
packet pick-up will take place at the large shiprock youth center parking lot on friday from 2:00-7:00 p.m. and again from 6:00-6:45 a.m. on saturday morning.     
saturday’s race day parking 
race day in shiprock is exciting and busy, so please take a minute to review this information about parking.  
from farmington hotels – drive west on hwy 64, approximately 30 miles.  once in shiprock, continue straight through a stoplight (near wells fargo and church), across the san juan river and to the second stoplight (near gas stations).  keep going straight again, past basha’s and the post office until you see event parking on your right.
farmington has a vast array of lodging options, for all levels of comfort and price.
if you are coming from the south, you will encounter the event parking on your left just as you enter shiprock.  our parking team will help you get parked and situated for your big event!
