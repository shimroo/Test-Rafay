i was totally impressed with [shinn's] ability to problem solve when we ran into a problem that could have left us dead in the water. [shinn's] innovative solution kept us on track and enabled us to complete the project.

when we work with shinn mechanical, it seems like a partnership. the complete process is overlapped with an understanding of each other’s business and goals. the project transition is exceptional. as the project is constructed, their team is professional and never loses sight of the goal. the project planning was superior from every aspect.

project manager, trane





today [we] were recipients of accolades for safety on the job... this project went three years with no recordable or lost-time accidents, which is remarkable to say the least... the dedication and hard work of shinn mechanical played a huge part in this and i want to express my deepest appreciation for the great work performed by our partners on this job.
