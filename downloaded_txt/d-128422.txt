why us?







“sms is a trusted partner of endress+hauser automationwe can count on reliable equipment, skilled and prompt service and application support. kaltenbach equipment is very well designed and robust, and the couple of times we needed parts and/or service sms, inc. had the parts in stock and got someone to us same day.”




leo b.







“kaltenbach are not the cheapest machines out there, but in my experience with multiple machines that we run hard, they work great, and they are extremely durable. sms, inc. also has the people and the know-how to support them: in fact, after several years of 24/7 operation we routinely send our kaltenbachs back to sms for a technical refurb’ … and they go right back into production and do it all over again.”
