welcome to mystical blaze! 
        

the purpose of this site is to examine 
        and explain the facts and fiction of paranormal phenomena and provide resources 
        for experimentation and individual research.  

in our scientifically-oriented society, 
        many tend to dismiss the strange and often spiritual phenomena that occur 
        virtually every day somewhere on the planet.  admittedly, the unknown 
        can be quite frightening, but dismissing it outright definitely does not 
        make it disappear.  the fact remains that we are spiritual beings, 
        and nobody can dispute the assertion that there are ways to come by knowledge 
        and experience without the rigors of scientific research.  meditation 
        is a classic example, to name just one.  unexplainable things also 
        happen every day to normal, intelligent people - they see things, hear things, 
        feel presences, observe phenomenon, move objects without touching them, and 
        even sometimes become aware of what the future holds.  none of these 
        things can be explained scientifically, but there is a huge amount of anecdotal 
        evidence that suggests that there is indeed some basis of truth to many 
        of the stories, even some that are quite bizarre at first glance.

having said that, these pages will cover 
        some very intriguing subjects, from monsters to ghosts, to the power of 
        the mind, so get comfortable, as you are in for a fascinating journey into 
        the strange, unusual, and bizarre.  this is an ongoing project, so 
        please excuse our "under construction" pages and be sure to bookmark, as 
        we add new material almost daily.

lastly, and especially with topics here 
        related to the mind and controlling your environment, consider the implications 
        and your own motives before attempting to take  on  such responsibilities.   
        most of us are in the middle and do not extend auras 25 feet or control 
        the actions of others.  


 


enjoy!
