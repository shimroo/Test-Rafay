                collie rescue of greater illinois, inc. is a nonprofit corporation established in 1995. we provide shelter and care to purebred
                collies which have been abandoned or turned in to shelters. the collies are placed in temporary foster homes until a permanent home can be found. our commitment is to place the collies
                in the best possible permanent home to give them a second chance in life. we have successfully placed collies ranging in age from five weeks to twelve years. prospective families that
                wish to adopt a collie will be interviewed. basic information about the family, pet ownership history and why they want a collie is requested. our goal is to achieve a successful match
                between the collie and the adopting family. we want a happy ending to every rescue story, and part of that process is selecting a suitable collie to fit into the lifestyle and needs of the adopting family. 
            
each rescued collie has a modest adoption fee which covers most of the dog's expenses.
all rescued collies receive the following veterinary care:



spaying or neutering
da2pp & rabies vaccines
heartworm test, then placed on interceptor
microchip implant for permanent identification




                after veterinary care and a complete grooming, the collie is placed in a foster home for a minimum of two weeks for socialization and evaluation of temperament, 
    quirks, likes and dislikes until adopted.
