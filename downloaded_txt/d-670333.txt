transforming emptying houses of worship

february 05, 2025











real estate investors who want to make more money on their rental property can increase rent, decrease costs, or work more efficiently. over the past ten years, rental rates have increased by 31%. renters typically pay 30% to 35% of their income on housing. increasing rent would therefore be difficult to justify. in addition, construction input costs (steel, lumber, gas, asphalt, etc.) are 46% higher than pre-covid, so cutting costs would also be challenging.
