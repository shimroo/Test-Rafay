	 proviso township high schools worst in illinois in multiple categories
	 
    

in the most recent school year proviso township high schools (district 209) had the lowest percent of students that meet or exceed standards on standardized tests in the state of illinois. results were obtained from the illinois interactive report card sponsored by northern illinois university.proviso scores went down absolutely (less students meet or exceed standards) and relative to other districts. last year proviso could at least claim to have more students meeting standards than bloom.district 209 has the lowest graduation rate in the state. [orion corrected in comments.]district 209's dropout rate is tied with odin (marion, il) for #1 in illinois.district 209 has the second highest rate of chronic truancy.district 209 has more low income students than most districts. however, many districts have more low income students. and even in these poorer districts, more students meet or exceed standards.and district 209 spends more per pupil than most districts.who is to blame?the district 209 board of education, especially, board president emanuel "chris" welchthe unionsthe mayorskaren yarbrough, the democratic committeemancharles flowers, the former regional superintendent of educationillinois state board of educationcook county states attorneysuperintendent nettie collins-hart and her predecessors, especially robert libkau.s. attorney northern illinois districtboard members of proviso's elementary school districtsgov. pat quinnthe votersin different ways, all these people could have made a difference and improved d209 and the education received by d209 students. and all of these people did too little.flowers might be able to plead that he was simply a fuck-up and didn't really have the ability to make a difference. but let's be honest. when he got elected regional superintendent he was more focused on taking care of his people than making a difference in the quality of education received by students.quinn's influence is weak and extends through the illinois state board of education. but i suspect if he lit a fire under the ass of the state superintendent of education, things could be made better.proviso property owners pay taxes for services. they don't like getting ripped-off, but they aren't mad enough about it to take effective action.    1 new trier 90   2 northfield 81   3 elmwood park 78   4 lyons 75   5 riverside-brookfield 72   6 township hsd 214 70   7 lemont 69   8 oak park & river forest 68   9 con hsd 230 67   10 maine 66   11 township hsd 211 66   12 homewood flossmoor 63   13 evanston 62   14 niles 61   15 reavis 59   16 ridgewood 58   17 evergreen park 57   18 oak lawn 54   19 bremen 53   20 leyden 46   21 argo 44   22 chsd 218 39   23 rich 37   24 thornton fractional 35   25 thornton 30   26 bloom 28   27 proviso 25    labels: d209, test scores

	 charles flowers arrested
	 
    

daily southtown (duaa eldeib):regional supt. charles flowers was charged today with theft by the cook county state's attorney's office....flowers turned himself in about 1 p.m. to sheriff's police in maywood. he was accompanied by his attorney, tim grace.i linked to eldeib's article first because he's been the most vigilant about covering flowers at the regional office of education.the following media outlets also have coverage:chicago breaking news center (matthew walberg)wbbm 780 amchicago public radio (links to an interview with flowers)what to say?having dealt with flowers and his staff, i can attest to the office being run in an unprofessional manner.i did a small amount of work for the roe making video recordings of meetings. while flowers and his staff were accustomed to manufacturing thin excuses to eat and drink on the office credit card, it was difficult to get them to pay me relatively small amounts of money for recording meetings.on one occasion i arrived to record a meeting which necessitated leaving another job early. i arrive to complaints from various people, including flowers. i was accused of not returning phone calls. apparently, one of flowers' assistants had given him the wrong number for me.members of flowers' staff claim the office has never had sufficient resources to fulfill its mandates without either going in to debt or getting subsidies from the cook county board. this is probably true, however, mismanagement and misprioritized spending were a problem.based on what i saw of putting meals on the credit card and an attempt to put a bar tab on the credit card, it seems credible that flowers and his people got sloppy and crossed the line and spent taxpayer money on stuff that was clearly personal expenses.flowers has been abyssmal at handling the media. he has avoided taking questions from duaa eldeib and in one instance flowers' sister called and left a snotty voicemail.labels: charles flowers, cook county state's attorney, daily southtown

	 lipinski weathers tea party activists
	 
    

advocates of health care reform don't like the tea party activists who have been loud and obnoxious when members of congress have held public meetings.the pro-health care reform people shot video of a recent town hall meeting by u.s. rep. dan lipinski where tea party activists heckled a woman telling the story of her pregnant daughter-in-law dying after being denied the care she needed because she was uninsured.h/t jeff wegerson (prairie state blue)i would prefer the united states enact health care reform based on a deliberative discussion of what's wrong with the current system and how we can make it better.but the republican party seeks to defeat any health care legislation because it perceives that the gop will do better in the 2010 elections if they can say the democrats have not accomplished anything on the democrats top legislative priority.generally americans want health care reform. and generally they want something similar to what the democrats are proposing or something more radical, like single-payer health care. since the tea party activists don't have the people on their side and they don't have good arguments for maintaining the status quo they yell louder, make extreme claims and are generally obnoxious.labels: dan lipinski, prairie state blue, tea parties

	 edgar endorses sheahan for state rep
	 
    

if you care what former-governor jim edgar thinks, he's supporting brien sheahan for the 41st illinois house district. state rep. bob biggins is retiring. see daily herald animal farm (john patterson).btw, the blog entry mentions the professions of the other candidates, but not mike manzo. doesn't it seem manzo should be identified as an employee of commissioner tony peraica? it seems at least as relevant as mentioning the professions and employers of the other candidates.labels: brien sheahan, daily herald, jim edgar, mike manzo

	 who did rolt endorse for gop primaries?
	 
    

the republican organization of lyons township (rolt), aka team tony, endorsed patrick hughes for u.s. senate, jason plummer for lt. governor, judy baar topinka for comptroller and mark thompson over liz gorman for cook county board in the 17th district. see illinois review. more members voted for dan proft than the other governor candidates, but insufficient for the organization to endorse.labels: anthony peraica, rolt
