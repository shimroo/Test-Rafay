on the last couple of scenes on anniversary cruise.  the only thing i need now is someone to proofread the thing for me.  especially for continuity.  i know i screwed up the two female leads and the two male leads several times.anyways, still have a major sex scene to write which always slows things up a bit.  otherwise, the rest of the story can go to proof at this point.  now, we just need another story fest so i can release it :)  how about sex on boats as a theme? ;) lol.

mood: sad

this morning, reggie white, former nfl player, passed away.  it's unclear if it was a massive heart attack or something to do with his sleep aponea (a condition from which i myself suffer and am being treated for).  i know most, if not all, of the people who read my journal are not religious, and i know that i'm not either.  reggie white did a lot of contreversial things i did not agree with, including his adament opposition to gays.  still, he tried to do good in his life and football was his vehicle to get the press and money necessary to do his works of good.  in an era of spoiled players in the nfl that do bad, including murder and rape, it's refreshing to see a player who's actions off the field were genuine and noble.  while i don't agree with the religion, his works of good make him someone worth honoring.i live in wisconsin and while reggie white played football, he spent a lot of his career in green bay.  people here venerate reggie white as a saint who brought the green bay packers back to an age of glory.  his decision to come to green bay brought a lot of other great players and coaches in along the years.so here's to number 92, the minister of defense, may he rest in peace, and may he find the glory of the god he prayed to throughout his life.

many of you don't know this, but i tend to be something of a perfectionist.  i wrote bellaire belles as one of my first stories and while it was well received, i was never really happy with it.  a lot of the writing is for shit, and poorly edited.  the story has some unrealistic twists and turns.  greg gets way too whiney during the course of the story.  worst of all, the ending is rushed and happens way too quickly.  so last night, i sat down and worked on rewriting the first chapter of belles.  here is a link to the story on storiesonline.  what follows is my rewrite of chapter one of bellaire belles...( bellaire belles, chapter onecollapse )please tell me what you think.  is it better?  is it worse?  does it even make a difference?  am i wasting my time?by the way, this may be leading into the much anticipated book two of belles being written...

subject:a review from 54vette on "one night stand"
security:public
mood: accomplished

with "one night stand" in the books now, i was disheartened to see that it is dropping in rating every day.  i guess if there's no teenage sex in the story, then it's not worth reading, at least to storiesonline standards.  the thing is, with the positive comments of encouragement i've been getting on this story, i really am feeling on top of the world.  even if the story never gets nominated for a clit, it's reviews like the one that follows, that make the writing worth it.review by 54vettereviewed: 2004-10-27--------------------------------------------------------------------------------want to read an excellent romantic tale that will bring tears to your eyes? this is it!!! "freeze" does it again. with style and class as well. while waiting for freeze to make up his mind on whether or not he's gonna finish "academy of love", which happens to be an excellent story in it's own right, i figured, i'd wait to see if he'd at least finish this one. he didn't disappoint me. in fact, he made me cry. the story was that good. it hit the 'heart' of this old 'softy' so, you're thinking, "go on and tell us a little about the story damnit!". well, it's literally a 'boy meets girl' story taken to a level that many of us can relate to. kevin nash (our story's hero) is working his ass off trying to get over his personal pains. he decides he needs a drink, goes to a bar and meets stacia. a beautiful redheaded goddess who's only interested in a "one night stand" (hence the title). however, the old phrase, "magic happens..." but, it ain't that simple. no, not that simple at all. in fact, she feels something she hasn't felt before and instead of embracing it she runs from it. women! who knows how their minds work? :) but, never fear, because this one ends up just like a beautiful fairy tale and they 'live happily ever after'. so, why read it? it's the way this story was told and the 'journey' it goes through in a relatively short story. this one will not disappoint you and will definitely tug at your 'heart strings'. i highly recommend you have a box of kleenex nearby you for more than just the hot sex this delightfully written story contains. enjoy!!!plot: 10 | stroke ratio: 10 | technical quality: 10 | appeal to reviewer: 10here's the thing that makes this even better.  this person's been saying the same thing that many people have written to tell me.  i really think i communicated what i wanted to in my story.  it's just a wonderful feeling. all the more motivation to continue working on anniversary cruise. :)

subject:a rant about ratings and other things
security:public
mood: annoyed

i know it's stupid to be concerned about the ratings on sol, but when i have so many people sending me glowing comments and saying "this is one of the best things i have ever read" or "this is the best thing you have ever written", then why is this my most underperforming story that i have?  i guess i'm just being overly concerned.  the comments have been wonderful and that has been really encouraging.  it's probably just me and my normal low self-esteem.  still, i shake my head and wonder when stories like gina marie's "spitfire and messhersmidt" are doing better.  her popularity confounds me.  her characters, mostly teens, are usually more grounded and more mature than most adults i know.  definately more philisophical than even me at 36 years of age.  none of them talk like teens, none of them act like teens, and her stories end up being preach-fests on decent sexual morality, if there even is such a thing.oh well.  like i said, i've been blown away by the comments i've gotten from those that commented on my stories.  that has meant a lot to me and provided me with a ton of motivation to continue writing.  i got some really constructive and useful criticism from one person, and i really appreciated that.  i'm glad that i turned off the anonymous comment option.  it really cut down on the people making hit and run attacks of my writing and not offering something of value.  anyways, i'm working on two stories right now.  i'm finishing the story that i started writing for friday's last story fest and that i left hanging about the anniversary cruise.  the second story i'm working on is a sequel to "one night stand" that focuses on one of the other characters in "one night stand".  i won't say which one right now, but i think it should be pretty obvious by the time you finish reading "one night stand".  i have one more chapter of "one night stand" to release along with the epilogue.  i'm still debating whether to release the final chapter and the epilogue together, as the epilogue is quite short, or if i should spread them out as i have been doing with the chapters.  maybe someone can provide some insight on that.also on the writing plate is a rewrite of "first true love", a story which i consider one of my best "stories" but some of my worst writing if that makes any sense.  secondly, i'm looking at rewriting the first 8 or so chapters of aol, and maybe re-releasing the story up to the point at which i was at before, and having it be a story that gets updated when i have time.  thirdly, i have four days worth of an naked in school story written, have edited monday, and the rest is unedited.  it's a pretty big story, however, with monday weighing in at 13k words.

subject:a story that i started writing...
security:public

i've been doing some writing lately.  after receiving such negative criticism in my last attempt at writing, i am reluctant to put anything out on the internet, yet i want to share what i have written.  such a quandry, it seems.  i think i need to mature a bit and learn how to take criticism before i post anything on sol or on the fkwriters board again.  i don't think i'm ready for that just yet.  anyways, i wrote this first part to a short series (not more than five or six chapters from what i have scripted thus far.)  it isn't edited.  i'm sure there are grammatical and style errors in it.  what i would like, knowing that this is not edited, is an honest evaluation of this part of the story.  if it sucks, tell me.  if it's good tell me.  be honest.  i'm hoping these comments will help me deal with the comments that come from those people that i don't know.anyways, here it is...  codes for the entire story are mf rom cons( one night stand - part onecollapse )

subject:an apology
security:public
mood: melancholy

i want to make an aplogy to those that have been reading my works and who have been cut off by my recent decision to stop writing and pull my existing series from the internet.i guess in some way i should explain myself and offer you whatever reason i feel justifies pulling my work from the internet.i've been becoming more and more disenfranchised with writing over the last month.  ever since releasing aol, i've seen it have less than stellar ratings for something that i thought was quite good, and certainly better that some of the stuff that is out there right now earning 9.75's.  i know it sounds silly to worry about ratings, but i'm not one that deals with rejection very well.  it comes from my upbringing and i don't wish to talk about it at this time.  let's just say i have a problem with dealing with rejection and that i crave praise and leave it at that.  i'm not saying it's a good thing, because it's not.  the fact is that it isnt something that will easily be changed with me.anyways, this last week had been very unusual in that i was getting a ton of negative comments from my readers about the last chapter of aol that i had released.  the fact that i thought it was one of the better chapters in the saga made it even harder to take.  the fact that a lot of those comments were coming from regular readers and regular commenters that up to this point had all been positive made it even worse.  to further drive the knife in the wound, it wasnt one single thing they all attacked.  everyone had something different to say that was negative.  then, my editor gets my latest chapter and completely shreds it.  it's like the story is completely unredeemable.  faced with the daunting task of rewriting several chapters that are already done and waiting to be edited or giving up completely, i chose the later.  i came to realize that i couldnt be an adult and accept the criticism of others even when it was very warranted.  i decided that if i couldn't be an adult and deal with the stress of weekly complaints and valid criticisms then i have no business writing for a hobby.to netwolf, i thank you for editing my stories and being harsh like you should be.  i apologize to you first and foremost for not being adult enough to handle the valid criticisms you made and to deal with them and learn from them.  i know you blame yourself for what happened, but nothing could be further from the truth.  this was all me.  my only hope is that we remain friends through this because that means a lot to me.to my fans and other readers, i offer a heartfelt apology for disappointing you.  i put out a piece of work that i promised to post on on a weekly basis.  i promised a backlog, which really does exist and am not giving you the benefit of seeing how the characters that you have grown to like get through things and how various plots turn out.  i did not make good on that promise.  for those in the lounge i started a story about some people on a cruise that is also unfinished.  again i have broken a promise to finish that as well, including a promise to someone very special to me who was hosting the story festival.  i know what i've done is selfish but it is the only thing i can do.for those of you that have asked about other mitigating circumstances, i can tell you that my wife is very ill right now.  while it isn't the reason that i am giving up the writing, it is a big part of why i collapsed so easily under the pressure i was feeling in doing my writing.  i won't go into details as to why she is ill.  that is in my friends only postings and isnt meant for public knowledge.for those that have given me words of encouragment and thanks over the past few days, i thank you, the readers, the fans, and my friends who stood by my decision and supported it even with great sadness of losing my writing off the internet.  i have reconsidered my previous stance and i will be keeping all other existing stories on the internet.  aol will stay off as it is an unfinished story and i dont need to hurt anyone else by getting them started on abandonware writing.thank you all, and good night.  don't forget to tip your waitress on the way out.cheers,bob aka freeze.

i got this from a random astrology website.  my comments are in brackets.your personal ruling planets are moon and uranus.[ hate to say it, but the moon isn't a planet.]an "electrical" aura pervades your being, which can brand you a bit of an unusual individual. [unusual?  that's an understatement.  i'd like to think of myself as misunderstood... ]conversely, the influence of uranus on the moon can interfere with the ..... functioning of your emotional responses. relationships can be stormy with your erratic and sometimes volatile demands.[i wouldn't say i'm erratic.  i can be volatile though as i tend to bottle up my emotions and let them all out at one time.]a powerful sex drive and desire for exciting or stimulating sexual encounters, may not always relieve you of the high stress and anxiety you tend to attract as part of your day to day routine. off to my meditation cave with you.....[i agree with everything in that statement.  i always felt i have a more powerful sex drive than normal and everyone knows how much stress i deal with on a daily basis.  guess that's why i write my stories.  something to stave off the sexual drive and give me something stimulating.  i think i'd kill poor shannon if i subjected her to my entire sex drive ;)]your lucky colours are electric blue, electric white and multi-colours.your lucky gems are hessonite garnet and agate.your lucky days of the week sunday and tuesday.[i often get lucky on sundays ;) ]your lucky numbers and years of important change are 4, 13, 22, 31, 40, 49, 58, 67, 76.[13 has always been a lucky number of mine.  how come 69 isnt in that list? ]famous people born on your birthday include john dee, harrison ford and patrick stewart.[let's not forget cheech marin!  who the hell is john dee?]
