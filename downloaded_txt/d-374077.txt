we only want to provide the best
our goal is to offer high-quality medicine that combines modern technology with old-fashioned comfort for your pet. we also pride ourselves on client education regarding prevention and treatment of disease to ensure your pet remains a healthy member of the family for years to come. sunrise pet clinic honestly believes no one knows your pet better than you, which is why we work closely with you to develop a health care plan that is unique to you and your pet.
get to know our team


















what to expect
our primary focus is on wellness and prevention for companion animals through a holistic approach, focusing on the whole body and lifestyle of the patient.
our team is trained in “fear free” techniques, which means we will do everything we can to make your pet’s visits a positive and comfortable experience. it is based on the belief the body has an inborn ability to balance and heal itself with individualized care. we do this through the complimentary alliance of western (also known as allopathic) medicine, using the best medicines and/or surgery advances and alternative modalities, including acupuncture, foods and nutritional supplements.
