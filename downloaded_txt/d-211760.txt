 if you have any results from any of the missing years in the 1990's that you are willing to scan and send me in pdf form, or if you are willing to snail mail me a paper copy of any of the meets from the 1990"s that are missing from the results list, i would be happy to include the meet on our county results page. 
a special memory and a special "thank-you!" to joe suriano for supplying me with most of the results from the 1990's from his scrapbook!	that	will	remain a precious gift joe has given to our association for years to come!

coaches and athletic directors!!!!

"warning for those teams with multiple coaches between the boys team and girls team, milesplit accounts are not supposed to be shared. one reason being that  if two of you are entering meets at the same time one might log the other out without knowing it before they hit save, or they might save over the previous coach's entries. either way it can lead to entries not being entered. each coach should have their own account, not a shared one. there can be multiple admins attached to a team page.â â 
any questions, send an email to john schwarz , or robert kellert
