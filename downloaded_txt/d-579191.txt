  "after some research and discussion, we decided to use radio as a primary source for marketing glg in the kc area... we met kurt, steel media and the q104 team in the spring of 2023. with the use of morning show talent, we produced a variety of ads that ran on q104. as a result, 2023 glg made huge strides amongst golfers at the clubs and on social media ... i would highly recommend him to anyone."
