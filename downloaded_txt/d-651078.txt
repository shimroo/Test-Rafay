youth & family services




we believe that families and youth are equal partners in identifying and developing services. the needs, strengths, beliefs, and culture of families and youth determine what services are provided. specifically, we believe in providing services that are youth-guided, family-driven, community-based, trauma-informed and culturally and linguistically responsive.

be stigma free




at isk, we lift up the people we serve and celebrate their successes. we want to make stigma a thing of the past. living with a mental health challenge, substance use disorder, or disability is simply part of being human. asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. hear from individuals we’ve served about their hopes, concerns, and accomplishments.

kalamazoo protect and connect (kpac) was created in 2021 to foster collaboration between law enforcement, first responders, and mental health professionals throughout kalamazoo county.2024 was a busy year for kpac, with a focus on improving crisis response and creating alternatives to police intervention in behavioral health crises. kpac analyzed behavioral health call data to target responses and expanded its team of clinicians embedded with law enforcement. isk is also developing a 24/7 mobile crisis response team that can respond independently from law enforcement.kpac also prioritizes crisis intervention team (cit), with law enforcement and first responders participating in training on how to respond to individuals in behavioral health crisis and provide support to individuals seeking resources. kpac and the cit training team plan to continue expanding crisis response programs and cit training, leveraging partnerships to address behavioral health challenges.see the full report for fiscal year 2024 atiskzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kpac-newsletter-fy24-general-data.pdf
