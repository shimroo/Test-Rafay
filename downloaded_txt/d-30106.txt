welcome to holstein manufacturing







a leader in commercial grill manufacturing and development 














nearly 50 years ago, to promote the midwest pork and beef industry, we began manufacturing the first towable grill and hog roaster.  from day one our expectations were not to simply offer a manner in which to ‘cook meat’ but to create a product that delivered grilled and roasted melt in your mouth flavors for any item placed on a holstein product.
 



this starts by developing cutting edge commercial food equipment, made of stainless steel and/or black carbon steel. state-of-the-art engineering and fabrication, quality parts, and materials, with the experience of men and women who use the products in their own back yards.
 



nsf and ul certifications are another indication of our commitment to excellence. we go to extensive lengths to ensure each of our products are certified, high quality, dependable and reliable.
