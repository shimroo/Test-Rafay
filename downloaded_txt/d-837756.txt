natural dyed bundles








beat the heat and use it as a means to dye your fabrics for you, easy peasy!lay out  your fabric, sprinkle with dye stuffs such as onion skins, finely ground tree barks, walnut shells, etc., wrap tightly, soak with vinegar, wrap tightly in aluminum foil, or plastic wrap, and place in a sunny area that gets really hot, like your garden shed roof, or deck off of your house.allow to remain bundled for a couple of days.after a couple of days open your bundle and allow to air dry.after it's "cured" open your bundle, remove the vegetation, and rinse your bundle prior to washing.i wash my fabrics with a gentle detergent.to learn more check out my ebook compost dyeing and other fermentation dyeing techniques.

solar dyeing season is here!!!









now is the perfect time to start a solar dye vat, all you need is a sturdy glass jar, a lid that'll seal tightly, and some natural dye elements such as coreopsis blossoms, oak bark, onion skins, etc. add these items to the jar, add your scoured and pre-mordanted fabrics, top of with water, seal jar with lid, and place in a hot sunny location.depending on the temperature, and the dye stuffs used you should have lovely piece of naturally dyed fabric within one to ten days.remove from jar, rinse, and the give a good wash using a gentle soap, dry, and your fabric is ready to use in your next project.to learn more about natural dyes click here.
