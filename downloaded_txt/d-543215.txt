hey all, well it’s been a long time since you looked in to my eye… well that’s what “the fog” would tell you… but anyhoo, i thought i’d spend some time away from being a nerd and put together a new mix for you all.  it’s the first mix i’ve done in about 8 months and it covers most of my fave tunes during that time and a few rarities i haven’t had the chance to put on a mix yet.
expect downtempo, meets minimal, meets disco, meets nu disco and every variation in between.  i’ve tried to give it a bit of a journey with a peak a little more than half way through.
download: keltec – nu disco 2012 part 1.mp3
playlist can be found on facebookor soundcloud
