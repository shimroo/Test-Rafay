we are dedicated to the rescue and welfare of german shepherd dogs.
      our volunteers help foster and adopt dogs to willing homes. please help us in our efforts, for their sake. 
 “every dog has a story, how it ends depends on you...” 
      our homeless furry friends are in desperate need of a loving and caring home.
      if you cannot adopt, any act of kindness while they wait, will change their lives forever.

foster homes urgently needed

 not all of our rescue shepherds are lucky enough to go directly into a foster home; some have to start in a kennel.
	            every rescue dog must be in a foster home before it can be adopted.  in a foster home it will experience the love, care,
	            and attention it needs and deserves while it is waiting to be adopted and we will observe the personality of the dog
	            to help place it in the best possible forever home.
 you can foster a german shepherd dog! our network of rescue volunteers is there to help you with advice, 
                    and rescue pays for the care of the dog including food and authorized veterinary expenses.
                    won't you consider fostering a german shepherd who wants a second chance at a happy life?
                  fostering is a very rewarding experience, not only for you, but for the dogs too!

tara


tara's story:

tara is a beautiful, 70 pound, long legged 5 year old kind, sweet and generous dog who is thriving in her foster home.

tara is smart and curious and is responding well to training. she is crate trained but sleeps quietly on her doggy bed and waits patiently until her family wakes up.

tara has great house manners. she doesn't chew inappropriately and stays off furniture. in the backyard, she doesn't dig and isn't destructive. tara is not a demanding dog and happily waits until her foster family is ready to play.
