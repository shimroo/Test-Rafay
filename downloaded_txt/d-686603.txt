nicole murraydivision president, shea homes®“from my involvement in the early days of nextgen to my current role on the governing board, the bia has always provided a great opportunity for me to connect with peers and have a better appreciation for this amazing industry. no matter where you are in your career path, the bia has something to offer you.”
eric nelsondivision vice president of community development, trumark homes, southern california“in a world where the path to sustainable and innovative development is fraught with challenges, biasc emerges as a beacon of guidance and support. their role in mobilizing supporters and advocating for our projects is invaluable, driving positive change and industry growth.”dana kovachceo, kovach marketing"as a proud member of the building industry association for the past 30 years, i can attest to its invaluable impact on my career and the success of my business. i've had the privilege of forging enduring relationships with inspiring individuals, leading to partnerships that have fueled relevant and impactful strategies and evolved into priceless friendships that have stood the test of time."alan j. boudreaupresident, boudreau pipeline"i cannot emphasize enough the invaluable support provided by the biasc. while the networking opportunities they provide are immensely beneficial, connecting us with industry peers and potential clients, it's the advocacy on behalf of the industry that truly stands out. time and again, the biasc has proven to be our faithful allies, diligently working to safeguard our interests and pave the way for our success. without their dedication and expertise, navigating the complexities of regulatory frameworks – especially ones that could potentially hold back businesses like ours – would be significantly more daunting. thanks to the biasc, we can focus on what we do best: building a better life for community and family; we dig your future!™

building together! 
										building authenticity into our collective voice 
										biasc’s role as the voice of these constituents in southern california – home to the most diverse businesses per capita in the united states – demands authenticity for that collective voice to be both genuine and effective.  and this means that as a trade association, it is incumbent upon us to embrace and leverage the broad spectrum of talent from diverse racial, ethnic, gender and socioeconomic backgrounds.

authenticity means that our leadership, staff, membership and suppliers must increasingly reflect this diversity – not to mention the communities that we serve in building a wide range of housing types, sizes and costs that support an increasingly diversified array of lifestyle choices.

people from all walks of life should be able to share in the american dream, and bia is committed to serving as one collective voice for our building workforce.
