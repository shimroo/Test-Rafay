nicole espinosa, also known as short sale queen, 35, plano, texas; stephanie smith, also known as stephanie parks, 44, midlothian, texas; and selena baltazar-hill, 28, dallas, texas, were indicted by a federal grand jury on november 20, 2024, and charged with federal violations related to a mortgage fraud scheme in the eastern district of texas.
according to information presented in court, beginning in 2017, espinosa, smith, and baltazar, along with others, are alleged to have operated a mortgage fraud scheme using various companies, including short sale queen, l.l.c.  the defendants researched and located properties that were in the pre-foreclosure short sale process and approached the homeowners about listing the properties for sale.  after signing a listing agreement with the homeowners, the defendants submitted various fraudulent documents to financial institutions and mortgage companies for the purpose of freezing or halting the foreclosure process.  such documents included falsified purchase agreements from purported “buyers,” as well as altered “proof of funds” letters showing the “buyers” had the means to purchase the property.  based on these representations, the financial institutions halted foreclosure proceedings, waived fees collection, and unknowingly allowed the defendants time to find a real buyer, or in other instances, cancel the deal when they could not locate a legitimate buyer.  all told, the defendants are alleged to have fraudulently submitted documents for at least 88 properties totaling over $8 million in sales, obtained at least $390,000 in commissions and processing fees, and caused at least $2.5 million in losses to these financial institutions.
the two-count indictment charges them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and conspiracy to submit false statements to a federally insured financial institution.  the defendants have been arrested and are scheduled to appear before u.s. magistrate judge aileen goldman durrett on december 4, 2024.
if convicted, the defendants each face up to 30 years in federal prison.
this case is being investigated by the department of housing and urban development, federal housing finance agency, and department of veterans affairs.  this case is being prosecuted by assistant u.s. attorney anand varadarajan.
a federal indictment is not evidence of guilt.  all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

brooklyn business owner convicted of fraud scheme

avraham tarshish (also known as “avi tarshish”), 45, queens village, new york was found guilty yesterday for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and related wire fraud counts, in connection with a scheme to defraud mortgage loan holders, including the federal national mortgage association (fannie mae), the federal home loan mortgage corporation (freddie mac) and other mortgage lending businesses.
the defendant was an employee of my ideal property inc. and an owner of exclusive homes realty group, inc., exclusive homes ny, llc and homeowners solutions group ltd, queens- and brooklyn, new york based companies formed to buy and sell real property.  as proven at trial, between march 2013 and november 2018, the defendant and others conspired to defraud mortgage lenders, misleading them into approving short sale transactions at fraudulently depressed prices.  in a short sale, with the approval of the mortgage lender or servicer, a mortgage loan borrower sells his or her property for less than the outstanding balance of the mortgage loan.  the proceeds from the short sale, less approved closing costs, are applied to the outstanding mortgage loan balance owed to the lender, who typically agrees to forgive the borrower’s remaining mortgage loan balance.  here, the defendant fraudulently manipulated the short sale process and immediately flipped properties for prices well above the short sale prices.
among other things, the defendant and his co-conspirators paid homeowners in foreclosure to lock them in to conducting short sales with them; took steps to preclude other prospective purchasers from making higher offers for properties by failing to market properties as required by the lenders; placed fraudulent liens on properties; and further depressed the properties’ values by removing toilets and plumbing, and causing other forms of property damage—a process that the defendant and his co-conspirators referred to as making the homes “pretty.”  in furtherance of the scheme, the defendant and his co-conspirators also provided the mortgage lenders and servicers with false and misleading information in transaction documents and failed to disclose either payments made to the borrower and others related to short sale or contemporaneous agreements to transfer the properties at inflated prices.  many of the affected mortgage loans were insured by the federal housing administration or owned or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac.
at trial, the government introduced evidence that the defendant participated in a conspiracy spanning years that involved dozens of fraudulent short sale transactions.  from among those dozens of transactions, the government introduced specific evidence relating to eleven examples of brooklyn short sales through which the defendant and his co-conspirators defrauded lenders and servicers of more than $2.4 million.
the verdict followed a 12-day trial before chief united states district judge margo k. brodie.  when sentenced, the defendant faces up to 30 years in prison.
breon peace, united states attorney for the eastern district of new york, robert manchak, special agent in charge, federal housing finance agency, office of inspector general, northeast region (fhfa-oig), vicky vazquez, special agent in charge, u.s. department of housing and urban development, office of inspector general, northeast region (hud-oig) and thomas m. fattorusso, special agent in charge, internal revenue service-criminal investigation, new york (irs-ci) announced the verdict.
“the defendant defrauded taxpayer-funded mortgage loan holders out of millions of dollars and took advantage of programs designed to help distressed property owners in need,” stated united states attorney peace.  “short sale mortgage fraud not only harms lending intuitions, it also depresses real estate values throughout our neighborhoods and prevents community members from gaining fair access to housing.  today’s guilty verdict should serve as a reminder that my office, together with our law enforcement partners, will continue to vigorously prosecute those who corruptly line their pockets at the expense of mortgage lenders and borrowers.”
mr. peace expressed his appreciation to the united states department of homeland security, homeland security investigations, new york field office (hsi), and the hsi el dorado financial crimes task force for their work on the case.
“the defendant and his co-conspirators corrupted a process meant to assist homeowners facing foreclosure. by undermining the integrity of this process, fannie mae, freddie mac, and other lenders were deprived of millions of dollars,” said robert manchak, special agent-in-charge of fhfa-oig’s northeast region. “today’s verdict demonstrates the resolve of the federal housing finance agency office of inspector general and its law enforcement partners to pursue those who defraud the government-sponsored enterprises.”
“tarshish and other co-conspirators engaged in a $2.4 million scheme to cause fha-insured mortgage lenders to approve short sale transactions at fraudulently depressed prices by misrepresenting material information for his own enrichment,” said special agent-in-charge vicky vazquez with the u.s. department of housing and urban development (hud), office of inspector general (oig). “no one is above the law. hud oig will continue to work with the u.s. attorney’s office and our law enforcement partners to investigate individuals who jeopardize the integrity of fha mortgage programs.”
“in this elaborate scheme to prey on people facing foreclosure and manipulating the mortgage loan system, tarshish’s fraud resulted in a multi-million dollar loss to his victims.  with this conviction, tarshish now faces time behind bars where he can longer line his pockets at the expense of his community and their lenders,” said thomas m. fattorusso, special agent in charge of irs-ci new york.
co-defendants who previously pleaded guilty:

iskyo aronov (also known as “isaac aronov”), 37, miami, florida
michael konstantinovskiy (also known as “michael kay”), 38, rego park, queens
tomer dafna, 53, great neck, new york
michael herskowitz, 45, brooklyn, new york

when sentenced, aronov, konstantinovskiy and dafna face up to a 30-year max sentence. herskowitz faces up to a 5-year sentence.
anyone with information concerning similar mortgage-related fraud can report it by contacting the federal housing finance agency office of inspector general hotline at 800-793-7724 or via the web at: https://www.fhfaoig.gov/reportfraud#hotlineform.
in july 2022, mr. peace was selected as the chairperson of the white collar fraud subcommittee for the attorney general’s advisory committee (agac).  as the leader of the subcommittee, mr. peace plays a key role in making recommendations to the agac to facilitate the prevention, investigation and prosecution of various financially motivated, non-violent crimes including bank fraud and wire fraud.
the government’s case is being handled by the office’s business and securities fraud section.  assistant united states  attorneys shannon c. jones, john vagelatos, joshua b. dugan and russell noble are in charge of the prosecution, with the assistance of paralegal specialist liam mcnett.  assistant united states attorney tanisha payne of the office’s asset recovery section is handling forfeiture matters.

christopher j. gallo, 44, old tappan, new jersey, and mehmet ali elmas, 32, a u.s. citizen who resided in turkey until the time of his arrest, were indicted by a federal grand jury on oct. 24, 2024, on charges related to their roles in a large-scale mortgage fraud scheme.
according to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
gallo and elmas were previously employed by a new jersey-based, privately owned licensed residential mortgage lending business. gallo was a senior loan officer and elmas was a mortgage loan officer and gallo’s assistant. from 2018 through october 2023, gallo and elmas used their positions to conspire and engage in a fraudulent scheme to falsify loan origination documents sent to mortgage lenders in new jersey and elsewhere, including their former employer, to fraudulently obtain mortgage loans. gallo and elmas routinely mislead mortgage lenders about the intended use of properties to fraudulently secure lower mortgage interest rates.  gallo and elmas often submitted loan applications falsely stating that the listed borrowers were the primary residents of certain proprieties when, in fact, those properties were intended to be used as rental or investment properties. by fraudulently misleading lenders about the true intended use of the properties, gallo and elmas secured and profited from mortgage loans that were approved at lower interest rates.
the conspiracy also included falsifying property records, including building safety and financial information of prospective borrowers to facilitate mortgage loan approval. between 2018 through october 2023, gallo originated more than approximately $3 billion in loans.
they appeared today before u.s. district judge brian r. martinotti in newark federal court and each pleaded not guilty to on one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, eight counts of bank fraud, eight counts of false statements to a financial institution; and one count of aggravated identity theft.
 the charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, and false statements to a financial institution each carry a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest. the aggravated identity theft charge carries an additional consecutive mandatory minimum term of two years in prison and a maximum fine of up to $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest.
u.s. attorney philip r. sellinger made the announcement today.
u.s. attorney sellinger credited special agents of the fbi, under the direction of acting special agent in charge nelson i. delgado, and special agents of the federal housing finance agency, office of inspector general, under the direction of special agent in charge robert manchak, with the investigation leading to the indictment.
the government is represented by assistant u.s. attorney shontae d. gray of the economic crimes unit in newark.
the charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

nicholas espinosa, 38, randolph, massachusetts, pleaded guilty today to two counts of wire fraud conspiracy; one count of conspiracy to make false statements to a mortgage lending business (mortgage fraud conspiracy); 16 counts of wire fraud; six counts of unlawful monetary transactions (money laundering); and one count of making false statements to a mortgage lending business.
espinosa was arrested and charged in march 2023 along with alleged co-conspirator daniel cleggett.
according to the charging documents, cleggett was the founder of the sober home business, a vision from god llc (avfg), with locations in in boston, wakefield, quincy and weymouth under trade names including brady’s place, lakeshore retreat and lambert house. espinosa managed the day-to-day affairs of cleggett’s business.
espinosa, and allegedly cleggett, along with a sober home client entered into a conspiracy to defraud a new york-based family trust that was paying for the client’s room and board at brady’s place in quincy. specifically, espinosa, and allegedly cleggett, overcharged the family trust for room and board by up to $12,500 per month by submitting false and fraudulent invoices to the family trust. espinosa, and allegedly cleggett, would then issue “refund” checks to the client in furtherance of the fraud scheme.
according to the charging documents, from approximately october 2019 to december 2021, cleggett personally, and through straw purchasers including espinosa, purchased the three residential properties in weymouth and boston to use as sober homes. espinosa falsely represented that one of these properties was intended to be purchased as a primary residence for himself when, in reality, it was intended to be a sober home.
in addition to the sober home business, cleggett operated numerous insulation contracting companies that participated in the mass save program: green save energy corporation; environmental construction objective inc. (eco); green giants, llc; and insulation situation, llc. mass save is a massachusetts public/private partnership sponsored by gas and electric utility companies that funds energy conservation projects and improvements via energy efficiency funds charged to massachusetts residents’ utility bills.
specifically, green save and eco received millions of dollars for residential insulation work from a lead vendor company under the mass save program. it is alleged that, from 2018 through mid-2021, green save and eco fraudulently billed the vendor company for required permits that were not actually obtained. green save and eco were ultimately terminated from participating in the company’s program in june 2021, and cleggett was banned from participating in the mass save program. in response to this, espinosa, and allegedly cleggett and others, formed green giants as a new lead vendor with the same company under a straw owner. as a result, espinosa, and allegedly cleggett, obtained a total of $509,326 in payments from the company to green giants, despite a ban from participating in the mass save program.
the charges of wire fraud and wire fraud conspiracy provide for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. the charge of making false statements to a mortgage lending business provides for a sentence of up to 30 years in prison, five years of supervised release and a fine of up to $1 million. the charge of unlawful monetary transactions provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the u.s. sentencing guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.
u.s. senior district court judge william g. young scheduled sentencing for march 11, 2025. espinosa was arrested and charged in march 2023 along with alleged co-conspirator daniel cleggett
acting united states attorney joshua s. levy; jodi cohen, special agent in charge of the federal bureau of investigation, boston division; and harry chavis, jr., special agent in charge of internal revenue service’s criminal investigations in boston made the announcement today. valuable assistance was provided by the kingston, randolph and quincy police departments. assistant u.s. attorneys john t. mulcahy and dustin chao of the public corruption & special prosecutions unit are prosecuting the case.
the details contained in the charging documents are allegations. the remaining defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

scheme to defraud distressed homeowners gets man sentenced

terrylle blackstone, 37, woodbridge, virginia, was sentenced today for participating in a conspiracy that fraudulently promised thousands of homeowners across the u.s. legal help in avoiding foreclosure. the scheme generated at least $15 million for the conspirators but never provided any legal services to the client-victims.
according to court documents, from january 2018 until february 2021, blackstone worked with attorneys david maresca of virginia, scott marinelli of new jersey, and sam babbs of florida. the co-conspirators told homeowners that they operated a “national law firm” based in washington, d.c.; that attorneys would review the homeowner’s file and provide legal representation to the homeowners; that an attorney in the homeowner’s local area would be assigned to assist them; that the homeowner could meet and consult with those attorneys about the case; and that attorneys in their law firm could help the homeowner, if necessary, file for bankruptcy.
from 2016 until 2019, the conspirators marketed synergy law with telephone, television, and internet advertising which told homeowners that attorneys at maresca and marinelli’s synergy law (synergy) in manassas could help them avoid foreclosure. during 2018 and 2019, bankruptcy judges, synergy clients, and the u.s. trustee’s program raised concerns about synergy’s practices in bankruptcy matters. blackstone attended court hearings on behalf of synergy where he made false statements to the court about the firm’s operations. in early 2019, marinelli was incarcerated in pennsylvania. yet blackstone, maresca, marinelli, and others continued to operate synergy and collect monthly payments purportedly for legal services. during this time, there was no attorney who was a member of synergy who could practice law. synergy never had attorneys review all homeowner files and synergy never had attorneys contact a client’s lender to discuss a mortgage resolution. they also continued to use the interstate wires to operate their “law firm” in ways that were essential to the scheme, such as soliciting clients by telephone.
from 2019 until at least 2022, the conspirators marketed another firm, themis law, with television and website advertising which told homeowners that attorneys with themis could help them avoid foreclosure. themis operated a call center at an office in manassas, virginia. call center workers used scripts during their phone calls with homeowners in which themis falsely promised that an attorney would review the homeowner’s case file; that this attorney knew their lender’s “internal guidelines” for a “mortgage resolution”; and that an assigned “legal team” would contact the homeowner’s lender to negotiate a resolution. themis required homeowner-clients to pay an initial retainer amount followed by a monthly recurring amount for as long as the firm represented the homeowner. when themis clients faced imminent foreclosure, themis advised those clients to consider filing for bankruptcy to save their home and referred the clients to babbs at the babbs law firm. those clients then signed a new retainer agreement and paid additional fees to babbs.
during his dates of employment at synergy law and themis law, blackstone received no less than $159,145.35 in direct payments from the companies. judge moss ordered that blackstone pay a forfeiture money judgment in that amount.
the sentence was announced u.s. attorney matthew m. graves, special agent in charge david geist of the fbi washington field office criminal and cyber division, and special agent in charge kareem carter of the internal revenue service – criminal investigation (irs-ci) washington, d.c. field office.
blackstone pleaded guilty on june 6, 2024, to a count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud before u.s district court judge randolph d. moss. in addition to the prison term, judge moss ordered blackstone to serve three years of supervised release and pay $159,145.35 in restitution.
this case was investigated by the fbi washington field office and the washington, d.c. field office of irs-ci.
it is being prosecuted by assistant united states attorney john borchert.

kevin smith, 52, of melrose park, illinois, a loan originator was found guilty on september. 6, 2024, of orchestrating a mortgage fraud scheme that bilked multiple financial institutions out of $2.6 million.
smith was a loan originator for mortgage lending businesses that originated and processed loans for real estate purchases in the chicago area.  evidence at the two-week trial revealed that smith engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain approximately $2.6 million in federally guaranteed mortgage loans in connection with the purchase of 14 properties in chicago.  smith recruited buyers at real estate investment seminars held in chicago-area churches and hotels and caused them to make false representations to lenders about, among other things, the source of their down payments and their intention to occupy the properties as their primary residences.  smith provided or caused others to provide funds to the buyers for use as down payments, knowing that the lenders would be falsely led to believe that the money belonged to the buyers.  after a closing and the issuance of the government-insured mortgage loans, smith made payments to the buyers – describing them as “grants” – and then pocketed payments from the sellers without notifying the lenders.
each count is punishable by up to 30 years in federal prison.  u.s. district judge john f. kness set sentencing for dec. 17, 2024.
the conviction was announced by morris pasqual, acting united states attorney for the northern district of illinois, machelle l. jindra, special agent-in-charge of the u.s. department of housing and urban development’s office of inspector general in chicago, and gregory billingsley, special agent-in-charge of the department of veterans affairs, office of inspector general, central field office.  the government is represented by assistant u.s. attorneys rick d. young and misty n. wright.
“loan originators and other mortgage professionals are entrusted with protecting the integrity of the government-backed mortgage program,” said acting u.s. attorney pasqual. “our office will continue to hold accountable any individual who violates that trust to line their own pockets.”
“smith abused his position of trust as a gatekeeper of fha-insured mortgage loans and used his real estate knowledge to circumvent the rules to secure his own self-interest,” said hud-oig sac jindra.  “hud-oig will continue to work with its prosecutorial and law enforcement partners to aggressively pursue and bring to justice those who seek to profit by abusing hud’s mortgage insurance and housing programs.”
“this guilty verdict demonstrates the va office of inspector general’s commitment to protecting vulnerable veterans from fraudulent lending practices,” said va-oig sac billingsley.  “the va-oig thanks the u.s. attorney’s office and our law enforcement partners for their efforts in this investigation.”

man sentenced to prison for fha fraud scheme

jason trador, 46, scott depot, west virginia was sentenced today for fraudulently obtaining a $223,870 fha-insured home mortgage by making a false statement to federal agents, willfully overvaluing property on a loan application, and making a false statement to the united states department of housing and urban development (hud).
a federal jury convicted trador of the five felony offenses on april 10, 2024, after a two-day trial. evidence at trial proved that trador fraudulently obtained a $223,870 home mortgage insured by the federal housing administration (fha) from his then-employer, victorian finance llc, a mortgage lending business. at the time he applied for the fha loan in august 2018, trador was delinquent on paying his federal taxes for a prior tax year. because of the tax debt, trador was not eligible for an fha loan under existing fha program rules. trador deceived victorian finance into approving the application and the fha into insuring the mortgage by providing a series of falsified documents including a falsified internal revenue service (irs) tax transcript purporting to show a payoff of the delinquent $8,151 tax debt.
trador also submitted three heavily edited bank statements to victorian finance. each falsified bank statement substantially inflated the balances in trador’s bank accounts. two of the falsified statements reported balances of approximately $27,000 and $15,000 for trador’s personal bank account when in fact the account had negative balances. line items, such as for insufficient funds fees, were removed from the falsified bank statements and a line item was added to deceive victorian finance into believing that he had paid off the delinquent $8,151 tax debt. evidence at trial proved the purported payoff never occurred and that trador was still delinquent on the federal tax debt as of march 2024.
on september 4, 2018, trador willfully overvalued his assets on a loan application when he signed a uniform residential loan application that included the false balances from the falsified bank statements.
on may 6, 2022, trador lied to investigators with hud’s office of inspector general (oig) and the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) when they interviewed trador at his scott depot residence about his application for the fha-insured mortgage. trador denied submitting false bank statements with his loan application, and blamed his fellow employees of the mortgage lending business for the inclusion of the false bank statements in the fha loan file.
trador was sentenced to one year and six months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $65,302.16 in restitution
“jason trador was a loan officer with a duty to keep fraud out of the mortgage lending industry when he betrayed that position of trust and tricked his then-employer with his sophisticated criminal scheme,” said united states attorney will thompson. “since the fraud was discovered, mr. trador has chosen to attempt to deceive rather than own his mistakes. he lied to federal investigators. he took the stand and made over 30 false statements during his trial. he has shown no acceptance of responsibility or remorse for any of his crimes.”
thompson made the announcement and commended the investigative work of the u.s. department of housing and urban development, office of inspector general (hud-oig) and the federal bureau of investigation (fbi).
“jason trador took advantage of his knowledge of the mortgage industry to circumvent the rules and abused the position of trust he held as a loan officer and gatekeeper of fha-insured loans.  he created and passed false documents allowing him to qualify for a loan he knew he would not otherwise qualify for,” said special agent-in-charge shawn rice with the u.s. department of housing and urban development, office of inspector general.  “the sentence handed down today serves as a warning that significant penalties await those willing to commit fraud involving hud-funded programs. hud oig remains committed to working with our prosecutorial and law enforcement partners to aggressively pursue those who engage in activities that threaten the integrity of hud programs.”
“fraud activity of any kind has far-reaching consequences, and showing no remorse underscores the seriousness of this crime. the fbi will not stand for individuals who abuse their position for personal gain at the expense of others,” said fbi pittsburgh special agent in charge kevin rojek. “the fbi remains resolute in safeguarding our financial landscape, providing a level playing field for honest consumers, and ensuring the public maintains trust in the integrity of our institutions.”
united states district judge robert c. chambers imposed the sentence. assistant united states attorneys andrew j. tessman, jonathan t. storage and erik s. goes prosecuted the case.
a copy of this press release is located on the website of the u.s. attorney’s office for the southern district of west virginia. related court documents and information can be found on pacer by searching for case no. 3:23-cr-117.
