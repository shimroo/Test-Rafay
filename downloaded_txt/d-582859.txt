mindy s.

 i wanted to say what a really great staff you have. we attended a convention at the disney yacht club saturday evening and use the childcare facilities for my three year old grandson. i got to see all the interaction and attentiveness by the staff. they were very caring and wonderful with the children in their care. they had a safe and loving environment for the children there and we couldn’t have been happier. my grandson had a wonderful time and even got to see buzz and woody. very friendly staff, they also smiled and were very upbeat with all the children.
sandy d.i am writing you to recognize several employees in your organization who far exceeded my expectations for care of my mother at animal kingdom lodge from 1/4/22-1/9/22. of note, your office manager carol, went above and beyond to assure me that competent caregivers would spend the day with my mom, and provide her with anything she needed. what i didn’t expect was to meet three different caregivers, who all treated their job with; pride, compassion and humility. angela, emily and carol frye were all: on time, respectful, honest, good listeners and compassionate companions for my mom- she raved about them all.

your services are enhanced because of these four people. i hope you will give them a bonus, recognition and understand that without their professional ethics and demeanor, coupled with the love of their jobs, our time at walt disney world with our grandchildren would never have been as successful.jackie m.the deciding factor for me, however, was when i located a personal story on a trusted theme park blogger’s website about the amazing experience her family had with a particular kno sitter. i knew then that it was time to pull the trigger and book the sitter in this story for my sons. link to full reviewmary w.my family and i want to thank you and all those who watched over my father and granddaughter during our vacation.  everyone, especially kathleen, was very patient and kind, which made my father feel safe and comfortable.  and isabella had a great time with paula. our month in florida was amazing and it wouldn't have been the same without you and your team. one of the days there, my son spoke to another guest who brought up the subject of a company who helped take care of her father, which was kids nite out.  she told him that they never had someone take care of her father who felt like family, like your cast did.  

i personally believe it has to do with the disney connection your company has.  again, thank you.  we will definitely call on your services the next time we visit.  and let others know as well.amy g.julia watched our two kids on june 11th at a disney resort and she was fantastic. her warmth and ease made the kids comfortable with her immediately. she came with tons of age appropriate toys for the kids to enjoy while keeping their eyes off the tv. she texted pics and checked in at just the right time and had our kids asleep earlier than we had the whole trip (quite the accomplishment). when my daughter woke up the next morning the first thing she asked was where julia went because she wanted her to stay. she's a stellar employee for sure. if we return next year we would be sure to try kids nite out again. thank you for a perfect date night for us and our kids!lindsay c.we had maria come to our resort twice to watch our 3 girls. she was absolutely fantastic! she had a suitcase with activities for the girls to do (coloring, play doh, stickers) and she even put on a tea party with the new disney tea party set we had just bought for the girls. they had a blast and it was great she was able to come both nights as the girls were already comfortable with her. with the background checks the company advertises, we definitely felt comfortable leaving our girls in her care for the evening. maria was the sweetest, we definitely appreciated her calm demeanor and friendliness. we will absolutely recommend kids nite out to our friends who are planning a disney trip in the future and when we come back, we plan on using their services again! 
christie g.we had a great experience with kid's night out! from the time i made the reservation, the process was easy and clear and everyone i spoke to was very professional and kind. it's always hard to leave your little ones in someone else's care, especially when on vacation, but monique made it so easy for us. she showed up right on time with a bag of toys and our 19 month old was comfortable with her right from the start. we got text message updates while we were away so we didn't have to worry and came home to a happy, sleeping baby. we will definitely use kid's night out again -- thank you!
colleen p.we just used kids nite out for the first time on a disney vacation. our babysitter was emily cuevas. i just wanted to write to say how impressed we were with the service and with emily in particular. she was prompt, professional and friendly. i felt totally secure leaving our toddler with her for the evening and i appreciated that she texted with us to let us know how our kid was doing. we will definitely use kids nite out again if we are back in the orlando area and i will request emily if we do.kevin s.kid's nite out has done a spectacular job 2 years running in watching our children. we loved the sitter we had last year so much that we requested her to watch our kids again during our trip last week.  her name is maria. both times she watched our 7 year old boy and 4 year old girl.  she came with an amazing personality that the kids fell in love with. we were able to enjoy a great night out as a couple while maria played fun and engaging games with the kids, texting pictures along the way to keep our peace of mind that they were safe and enjoying themselves.  she even put the kids to bed at bedtime. so we were able to return to a quiet room with two children sleeping soundly. this is a challenge even my wife and i have trouble with. our kids woke up the next morning asking about her and when they were going to see her again. they couldn't wait to tell us about the fun they had with her. we were nervous the 1st time using kid's nite out,  leaving our kids with a stranger, but our experience with maria has been wonderful and professional. we will definitely be using kid's nite out on our next vacation and certainly will be requesting maria again. 
margaret c.i was reluctant to use a babysitting service for my 9 month old while at a conference. but as soon as teresa arrived, my baby lit up, smiling and reaching for her. i was immediately at ease.  she was very knowledgeable about infants and passionate taking care of my baby. i hope to have her again tonight! thank you for providing a reliable service!
sophie & robertwe were very lucky to have rebecca sitting for us for 4 very early mornings this year. rebecca took exceptional care of alexander (1 year old) and was great at singing to him and showing him the buses. she also managed to get him to go back to sleep (which is something we rarely manage to do). we were worried about leaving him with someone new, but rebecca's friendly approach and professionalism was very reassuring.  we also appreciated the proactive approach of your administration staff in contacting us and making sure that rebecca knew where she was going when she arrived. we could not have asked for a better sitter nor a more professional service. thank you so much.
kelli h.i just wanted to send a letter of praise for kid’s night out and specifically miss joy. i could not be more pleased with kid's night out as a company and i am over the moon thrilled with the sitter, joy. i was initially very nervous about contacting a service for childcare but my husband had arranged for the after hours event as a surprise and he really wanted us to have a night out. kid’s night out was very responsive and professional. the person we spoke with on the phone was sure she could find a great sitter for my son for the time frame we needed, even on short notice. let me just say, my son was immediately smitten with miss joy! she arrived early, looking very professional with a name tag and polo shirt clearly indicating who she was and the company she was with. she could not have been nicer to this nervous mom. she brought all kinds of activities for my son to do. he was so enthralled with a set of blocks she brought that he didn't even glance back as we went out the door. throughout the night we received texts and pictures of the activities they were doing. blocks and painting and puzzles oh my! he absolutely had a ball. i was a little nervous about how bedtime would go. he's never been with anyone but his parents for bedtime. this was a first. right around 9ish i received a text that my little guy was asleep. wow. miss joy is magic. she allowed for my husband and myself to really be able to enjoy a rare night out. i'm incredibly grateful we had this evening, not only for us but for my son. there is so much value in children being able to adapt and engage with new people. he had a wonderful evening and i know he will talk about miss joy and the fun they had for a long time to come. thank you kid's night out and thank you miss joy. you will always be our sitter of choice when we come to florida!! ps-when my son woke up this morning i heard his little voice say "miss joy?". he was more than a little bummed that she hadn't spent the night! that is highest measure of praise in my opinion!







safety is our top priority
with event childcare services, children and parents are assigned child identification (id) numbers. children get bright arm bands with their names, ages and id numbers. parents get a kid’s nite out claim card with an id number that matches their children’s id numbers. the arm band and card number must match for a child to be released, unless otherwise noted. details regarding emergency numbers and appropriate health conditions are recorded. for our large convention services, a separate ballroom is reserved adjacent to restrooms at events.
a professional certified staff is guaranteed and policies are stringent.
