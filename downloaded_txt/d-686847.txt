searching for the perfect architectural hardware or bath fittings for your home design project?
imagine bringing your dream kitchen or bathroom to life with the perfect finishing touches.
the right hardware and plumbing can transform your home because it has personality. just like you. don’t settle for generic fittings from a big box store. create the home you’ve always wanted by finding the right hardware and plumbing for your project.
shopping for fine decorative hardware and plumbing fittings on the internet can be confusing.
even if you know exactly what you want your home to look like, there are so many ideas and brands online. wading through the sea of information can be overwhelming.
the only way to experience hardware is to hold it in your hands.
you wouldn’t pick a new color for your living room online. instinctively you know that you can’t get a feel for what a color would look like by seeing it on the internet. it’s the same with fine hardware. looking at pictures online isn’t enough.
to understand how a piece of hardware will fit in your home, you need to see it in person. is the color of that decorative doorknob exactly what you are looking for? do you like the way that faucet feels as you turn it? decisions like these can’t be made through a computer screen.
our showrooms are the perfect place to explore your options with the guidance of knowledgeable experts.
you wont find generic hardware and fittings in our showrooms. instead you will find quality faucets, luxury sinks and fine decorative doorknobs that stand the test of time. whether your style is contemporary or rustic, our in-store experts will help you find exactly what you’re looking for.
