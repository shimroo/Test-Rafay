											what can i do in turks and caicos?
									 	

take a dive at turks and caicos
turks and caicos are a divers dream. the islands are surrounded by an enormous coral reef that is about 65 miles across and around 200 miles long.
additionally, the island geography has created a 22 mile wide channel between the turks islands and the caicos islands which has become a major migration area for whales, turtles, dolphins and manta rays. you can also find ship wrecks and other sites in close range of the island.
one of the best reasons to go diving in turks and caicos is the fact that the reef is close to the island, so you can actually do beach dives. this avoids the sometimes excessive costs of directed scuba dives off boats and other touristy type diving trips. so bring your gear, get some good directions from your hotel, pack a picnic and dive away!

											how can i make my bahamas vacation different?
									 	

alternative travel to the bahamas
you can always fly to the caribbean, but have you considered going by boat? no, we don't mean a cruise - we mean a ferry! 
if you live in florida, or just feel like traveling to the islands in a fun and creative way, consider the bahamas day ferry our of fort lauderdale. you can actually go for the day, but with a one way trip of about 5 hours, why not stay the weekend?
you can certainly find a good all inclusive resort package, or just find a little bed and breakfast or local inn. either way, start and end your vacation in a relaxing way, rather than with all those security check points and lines.

											what are some travel tips for my puerto rico vacation?
									 	

puerto rico - an easy american vacation
puerto rico is one of the easiest locations to vacation if you are an american. not only is it close in terms of distance, you don't need a passport or really anything more than your license and they use the us dollar as their currency (even though they sometimes call them pesos).
there are 17 airports into puerto rico. when you choose your resort, try to pick an airport in close range to eliminate your taxi costs. your estimated travel time from new york city is approximately three and a half hours and travel time from europe is around eight hours. if you are in miami, you have it easy—it is a quick two and a half hour plan ride!
*puerto rico is on ast (or atlantic standard time) which is eastern standard time plus one hour.

											what are the logistical details of flying into aruba?
									 	

getting to aruba
when you fly into aruba you will be landing at queen beatrix international airport. there are a variety of ways to get around the island and you can rent a motorcycle, scooter or car. there is also a departure tax from the airport, around $36.50 (it should be included in the price of your plane ticket).
there is taxi service all over the island as well. one great travel tip - some web sites will tell you the average fare of your taxi ride from the airport to a given location. additionally, your aruba resort may have the typical fare (or better yet a free shuttle!)
with anything you do on your aruba vacation, figure out what you should be paying and make sure that is what you pay! there are a lot of people out there who are waiting for an ignorant or naive tourist - don't be one!
