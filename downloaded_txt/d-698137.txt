northern california medical weight management clinics

 

eat right. live right. feel right.













physician's plan medical weight management has offices in two locations in northern california: redding and chico. we help patients lose weight and maintain weight successfully with the help of qualified medical practitioners. our programs treat the whole person by combining the principles of nutrition, exercise physiology, pharmacotherapy (ethical medications), and behavior modification all in a caring and compassionate setting.we have also found that as our patients lose weight, they start to look at other ways to feel better about themselves. that's why we offer additional services such as facial aesthetics and eyelash lengthening.

meet dr. powell...



a dieter just like you!i was amazed when i looked at myself at the age of 38 and saw a 250 pound man in the mirror. i was at least 75 pounds over weight. i hated myself. i looked at my wife and wondered, “how can she be attracted to me when i am so fat?”i was in my second year of my emergency medicine residency. yes, i was a doctor who was morbidly obese. how did that happen? aren’t doctors supposed to know how to stay healthy? with hard work, knowledge, and determination, i have been able to lose weight and keep it off. you can too! just remember, struggling with weight loss is not a personality flaw!



a certified professionaldr. powell is also a physician who has helped many people lose weight with low carb diet products, low fat diet food, and through his medical weight loss clinic, physician’s plan.over the course of his career, dr. powell has made an extensive effort to continue training and expand his certification to the medical boards mentioned below.these certifications are an important indicator for patients and prospective patients that dr. powell is not only knowledgeable about the latest advances and best practices in the areas of his certification, but also that he is able to provide the best care possible to his weight management patients.

the easy way to eat rightdr. ray powell teaches his medical weight loss patients that the secret to losing weight is eating! through the use of the sneal®, low-calorie, single serving foods that pack a nutritional punch, patients and non-patients alike manage hunger and nutritional needs with small food portions that contain good carbohydrates (fruits and veggies) and lean protein. sneal® products, available through the carbessentials store, support dr. powell’s physican’s plan patients, or those who are following meal plans offered through dr. powell’s weight loss tool kit. whatever your need, dr. powell has a weight loss solution for you.



































what our patients are saying

 









 


“what i would say to someone who’s thinking about going to physician’s plan and starting snealing is, “go now!” don’t waste another month. don’t think about the short term and what you’re going to have to sacrifice or what you won’t get. instead think of what it’s going to give you.”
