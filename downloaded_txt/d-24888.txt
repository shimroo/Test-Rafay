february 3, 2025 surprise at retromobile, and at osenat auction 

the surprise can be found at the booth of julien dubrulle, hall 1 - a049.

i do not have further info.... yet.

bugatti vise and legs from the family collection

at the osenat auction, an auction of automobilia, there are various bugatti items (see also the banner advert above).
however, what i did not know were some special informations on the bugatti vise especially, but also on the legs.

the descriptions in the auction catalog state the folowing:
bugatti workshop vise

the vise designed by ettore bugatti is an adjusting vise - he didn't intend it for the heavy-duty work for which conventional vises are generally used. it was used by workers to adjust mechanical parts on cars at a time when machine tools were not as advanced as they are today. this is what gave this precision tool its letters of nobility. early in the design process, ettore bugatti had a wooden mould made to cast the core for the sand moulds. in this impression, the logo is carved into the wood. early versions of the vises had a groove on the moving part and two guide screws in the fixed body. later, the wooden mold was modified by the insertion of an aluminum logo. this will ensure a higher quality of the logo in the foundry. they are easily 
recognizable, as the logo is more prominent on the body. a sheet metal dust cover with three screws and felt gasket will also be added to prevent impurities from getting trapped between the moving and fixed body. after the war, there was less need to adjust finished parts, and vises had to be more versatile. pierre marco made the final modification, removing the two guide screws and machining the fixed body to fit a much stronger square slide.

the vise presented here is therefore a version of the first series made by ettore, who will have seen bugatti automobile parts between his jaws. it bears the number 34, which can be found on almost all components.

some models also had the number behind the bronze piece where the crank rests, as is the case here. a second number, 046, was added after the war. in its long career, the vise has only had one of its jaws replaced by number 18. it is functional and has kept its original black paint. it has remained in the family to this day.
two bugatti cast-iron workbench legs

cast-iron, each leg stamped in relief on both sides with bugatti mounting holes; original condition.
from the former molsheim workshops
h. : 81cm ; l. : 69cm ; diameter at base of legs : 15cm

there are many stories about bugatti vises, workbench legs and workbenches. we won't go into detail here, but will explain a few points. to do so, we'll use an archive photo of the post-war factory. we can see that there are 2 versions of the legs, one with the bugatti logos in the same direction, the other with the logos reversed. the factory photo confirms the existence of these two models, but cannot tell us why they were created.

mate rimac: "our bugattis are sold until 2029" 
brussels autosalon 2025

the prodigy at the head of bugatti rimac has a harder time selling his electric hypercars than his bugattis, but his technology is hidden under the hood of a series of bmws, porsches or hyundais.

"often, visitors rush to us to have access to the cars. then, they are already in hall 11 where they can look at the more accessible cars from d'ieteren." this little phrase whispered at the motor show illustrates the power that prestige brands have in the automotive sector.

"all our bugattis are sold until 2029," mate rimac, the child prodigy of the european automobile industry, tells us. the boss of bugatti rimac receives us in a small group on his stand on which the cars of all superlatives are presented.

"here you have this bugatti bolide, the car with the most powerful thermal engine in the world, and the rimac nevera r, the fastest electric car in the world," smiles the croatian.

rimac made a name for himself in his younger years by combining his two passions, electronics and cars, to create an electric racing car. from this fame, he created a technology company that sells his findings to other manufacturers "to survive" and be able to produce racing cars.


in 2021, his group joined forces with porsche to create a company for prestige hypercars. 900 people work for bugatti rimac and 1,300 for rimac technology. apart from 200 people in moselle, 2,000 people work in croatia.

today, the man admits that his electric neveras sell less quickly than the bugattis. but he insists, his nevera r is "a car that beats all the others in performance".
residual values

but hypercar customers are not all convinced by electric cars yet. also, the central question is that of residual values, a subtle play on the prestige car as an investment.

what will an electric hypercar be worth in 10 years? what about its batteries in 15 years? this type of question slows down the purchase of this new type of vehicle.

"there is clearly a business to be developed to keep these cars on the road in the future. we can already see it with the first tesla roadsters that are repaired by small specialist companies", explains mate rimac who indicates that his teams are working hard on this type of concern.
brand heritage


heritage also does a lot. bugatti customers are often customers who already have bugattis. the thousand bugattis in circulation in the world are in the hands of around 500 customers. "our cars only drive 800 kilometers per year on average," adds marta longin, head of communications at bugatti rimac. "that's normal when you have 30 cars," she adds.

at the show, mate rimac stops to answer a few fans who also take a few selfies. those who don't know him may have parts of rimac technology, his other company, in their car, particularly in battery systems and electric powertrains.

"our biggest customer is bmw. we also have porsche or hyundai," mate rimac reminds us. "some cars at the show have my technology, but i can't contractually tell you which ones," he says.

rimac divides his time 50-50 between his position as ceo of bugatti rimac and that of ceo of rimac technology. he did the latter business out of necessity in the past and out of an interest in technology, he explains. "but my real passion is making cars," he says.

bugatti rimac finances itself and is coming out of two years of losses. mate rimac promises profitability in 2025.


among his various businesses, mate rimac has also launched verne, which intends to compete with the big players in the robot taxi field. his ambition? to offer autonomous taxi rides from 2026 in zagreb before tackling other european cities.

"on the timetable, one thing is already certain: i will not respect it," jokes rimac. "we think it is technically possible. the regulators are helping us in europe and particularly in croatia," he says more seriously.

currently, he is working with mobileye technology, but he explains that he will take the technology of whoever is the best. "once the technology is safe, it is no longer on autonomous driving that we will be able to differentiate ourselves," he explains.

in fact, it is on the quality of the service that mate rimac intends to differentiate itself by ensuring, for example, that the car is always clean and the service is qualitative and the vehicle designed for this type of service.

300 people already work for verne in zagreb. when it comes to autonomous driving technology, mate rimac explains that he doesn't like the in-between. "either you drive or the car drives itself, but i don't like all these things like lane assist," he insists.

december 30, 2024 bugatti t57 grand raid in the bugatti museum altlussheim 


the former world premiere at the paris motor show in 1934 now enriches the exhibition.

in the exhibition of the autovision museum (including bugattimuseum), a bugatti t57 series 1 chassis with engine no. 12 (from the chassis number 57112) is shown as a rolling chassis. for museum visitors, it is very clear that in the first construction phase of the successful "type 57" series, the engine itself was an important part of the chassis frame. in addition to its actual task to power the vehicle, it was largely responsible for the strength and stiffness of the chassis. however, this meant that the engine could not be flexibly mounted in the chassis, as was standardized in later t57 models.
true-to-original wall relief instead of body
the wall relief decorated in the autovision exhibition was implemented in the style of the t57 grand raid body. this means that visitors can still get a true-to-scale impression of this sporty roadster from 1934, despite the exposed chassis. the model name "grand raid" already suggests that this vehicle was not intended to be a normal civilian luxury automobile for the road. rather, it was intended for demanding racing events and therefore had a streamlined body with extended fenders, a v-shaped windshield and very distinctive, aerodynamically tapered headrests. 

it was precisely this design that the type 57, created by jean bugatti, was first presented at the paris motor show in 1934, which was a world premiere for this series that is still legendary today. that same car, chassis number 57221/57222 is now in the louwman museum in the hague, the netherlands.jean bugatti also presented such show cars from the same t57 series at the most important automobile shows over the next five years, as they caused a great stir there and were therefore very effective for advertising. the trade press in particular was thus able to be lured to the bugatti exhibition stand, in order to then report in international trade journals on these always very elegant automobiles from the t57 series in words and pictures. in addition to the success of a vehicle brand in international automobile races, this type of indirect advertising was one of the most effective and at the same time most cost-effective!



the original engine no. 12 of the bugatti t57 112 in detail.



in the bugatti museum of the altlussheim museum autovision, 15 vehicles from the french bugatti series t57 to t64 can now be seen. address: hauptstraße 154, d-68804 altlussheim, germany, tel.: +49 6205-307661, e-mail: post@autovision-tradition.dewww.museum-autovision.de

only from a bird's eye view can the full scope of the technology in this t57 grand raid be seen, which otherwise lies dormant under a body. here, the significance of the engine, which still partially takes over the task of the chassis, is also made clear in the truest sense of the word.

december 11, 2024 the ex king leopold 1934 type 59 bugatti voted ihma car of the year 


its like an ancient insect trapped in amber. or an unopened cask of century-old single malt scotch. thats the kind of time-bending accomplishment achieved by this 90-year-old car, a car that has never been restored, winning the coveted 2024 car of the year honor at the international historic motoring awards presented by lockton insurance, which took place at the peninsula london on friday november 22.

rené dreyfus drove this beautiful 1934 bugatti type 59 sports to victory in the 1934 belgian grand prix at spa. the bugatti also finished third at monaco in 34. ettore bugatti transformed this type 59 from single-seat race car to sports car, removing the supercharger, and adding a second seat and doors. it kept racing, winning gp events in algeria and france in 1937. but more changes were to come. king leopold iii of belgium purchased the car in 1937, and had it repainted from french blue to belgian black, with yellow accent stripes. it stayed unraced and unrestored in the private collection of king leopold iii, and four subsequent owners of the car all kept it as-is, eschewing any restorations or modifications.

the bugatti changed hands again in 2020. swiss collector fritz burkard paid a staggering £9,535,000 ($12,681,550) when the final hammer fell at the gooding & company auction. it was the most expensive car sold anywhere in the world that year, and burkard continued the tradition of keeping the original parts and patina on the car.

to the surprise of nearly everyone, including car owner fritz burkard, his bugatti won the coveted best of show at the 2024 pebble beach concours delegance, the first time a preservation car has ever won the award. it was also the first time for a european winner at pebble beach.


the 1934 bugatti type 59 sports resides among the 90 remarkable machines in burkards private pearl collection in zug, switzerland.
if you would like to find out more about this special bugatti (chassis no. 57248), it was written about twice already in the bugatti revue, see:

type 61 chassis in the auction catalogue 2024




december 6, 2024 bugatti type 61 discovered! 

believed to be a replica t41 chassis when offered at auction in april 2024, this turns out to be the chassis of the rather unknown type 61!
from jakub stauch of the czech bugatti club, i received the following message recently:
before the auction of part of the mullin collection in april this year, i made a bad joke to my friend tomas krause. i knew there was going to be an auction by gooding & company of a railcar engine that was based on the engine for the bugatti royale and i said: if you want a royale you have to buy this engine. 

his was the winning bid. his plan was to renovate the engine and sometimes start him to make his neighbors and wife happy. the auction also included a frame that was described as a replica production royale frame from the 1970s. 

type 61 chassis in czech republic, 2024


when he finally brought the frame and engine to the czech republic, it was discovered that the chassis was 700 mm longer than the bugatti royale frame. tomas got a drawing for the t41 and found that the entire frame was extended at the rear, and the cross members were completely different. a search of the history revealed that the frame had been purchased by the mullin collection in 2008 from the widow of fritz schlumpf, who, a few years earlier, had been restituted part of the reserve collection from the schlumpf museum in mulhouse through the courts. 

this collection was created by the schlumpf brothers mainly during the sixties, who formed a private collection. the whole history is quite well known and traceable on the website of this national museum of the schlumpf collection. the schlumpf brothers bought cars all over the world and of course there are several bugatti cars with czechoslovak history and from our coachbuilders in the collection. at the time when the bugatti factory was purchased by hispano suiza, in the 1960s, the schlumpf brothers bought parts from the bugatti factory. now we have the photo that among these parts were the frames from the never-completed bugatti t61 and spare frames of type 57 and type 44.

we were together at the beginning of november at the bugatti owners club and the trust (image on the right), where we met all the archivists, including those who are retired, such as richard day. in their archive, a further 62 drawings for the unknown type 61 were found. we also met greg morgan, who is a great expert and knows all details on the type 41 and who helped resurrect several royales. 

type 61 chassis drawing, lower right: identification on the drawing: "assemblage des longerons", 61ch-8, 12-1-34. 



thanks to greg morgan, tomas also managed to obtain the original drawing for the type 61, which is identical to the frame purchased at auction. he confirmed that this frame is really for type 61 and really original from production from molsheim. greg helped us with many informations  thanks again.  

in the trust is note that this type was billed as type 61. very large luxury car with a 4-speed gearbox in unit with the rear axle". greg morgan believes that this is a type intended for military personnel carrying purposes. we have information that part of the factory archive has been sold, thus, if anybody out there has more info on the type 61, please let us know!

after this, the musée national de l'automobile, collection schlumpf came forward with one other detail: the esders roadster replica which was built at the museum, has in fact a 4-speed transaxle gearbox! in fact, this has a very low gearing, thus is specially designed for low speeds. thus, this gearbox is actually of the type 61!

it may be that more t61 drawings and / or parts will be unearthed in the near future, maybe even in the schlumpf collection!

november 21, 2024 bugatti bicycle stolen in australia! 

the (replica) bugatti bicycle was stolen recently from the property of greg smith in brighton, victoria, australia.

please, all bugatti friends, keep a look out to this unique piece of bugatti design, which was featured many years ago in this article in the bugatti revue of september 2, 2002.

just after attaining a new world record speed in an open-top automobile, bugatti has a new goal in mind: breaking the 500 km/h barrier. although the chiron super sport has already reached 490 km/h and the new mistral reaches 453 km/h in convertible form, ceo mate rimac is determined to go even further. crucial to this is the development of tires that can handle these speeds.

the chiron super sport set an impressive speed record of 490 km/h, but for rimac that is not enough. in an interview with top gear, he explains that he is working with michelin on the development of tires that can withstand the extreme forces at 500 km/h. "can we put a five at the front of the speed record? maybe, we'll see," he says.

breaking the new limit requires more than just a powerful engine and advanced aerodynamics. the tires play a crucial role, because they not only have to withstand enormous speeds, but also offer maximum safety. a blowout at 500 km/h is a scenario that must be avoided at all costs. bugatti and michelin are therefore intensively testing whether this is technically feasible.

with the introduction of a brand-new v16 hybrid power train, bugatti has the technology to set a new record. the merger with rimac has separated the brand from the volkswagen group, which gives bugatti more freedom in development and objectives. ceo rimac wants to build a legacy similar to ferdinand piëch, who once broke the 407 km/h barrier with the bugatti veyron.

november 14, 2024 bugatti sets new speed record for open-top car. 
the bugatti vvr16 mistral attains a top speed of 453.91 km/h


 

in a growing legend punctuated by iconic moments, bugatti has engraved its name into the annals of automotive history. in its pursuit for innovation and top performance, three icons of the bugatti legend have broken world top-speed records: the veyron 16.4 super sport world record edition; the veyron 16.4 grand sport vitesse world record edition; and chiron super sport 300+. now, another incomparable feat of engineering and driving skill has been accomplished  with the w16 mistral world record car setting a new top-speed world record for an open-top car, at 453.91 km/h.

realized at the world-class track facilities of atp automotive testing papenburg gmbh, germany, this record-breaking occasion followed in the footsteps of world-record runs that have been immortalized in automotive legend. in a story that began more than 14 years ago, in june 2010 with a veyron 16.4 super sport reaching a record of 431.07 km/h, bugatti has charted a historic course in the pursuit of unparalleled speed.



with the closed-cockpit world record broken once more in 2019 with the mesmerizing chiron super sport 300+ achieving 490.48 km/h, in search of ever-more challenging innovation bugatti's masterful, history-making engineering also extended to open-top vehicles. three years after the momentous achievement of the veyron 16.4 super sport, this chapter in the automotive history books was opened with the veyron 16.4 grand sport vitesse, reaching 408.84 km/h with the roof down, open to the elemental force of air.

 

 

as the pages of bugatti's legend turned to the present-day, so the storied marque sought to exceed that endeavor once more with an open-top vehicle. building on the foundations of the incredible accomplishments already immortalized, the pursuit of another landmark moment in bugatti's rich history reached its crescendo in the wake of months of intricate preparation, and meticulously planned testing to explore the car's immense capabilities.


and so that journey led to the project-zenith in papenburg, on november 9th. from the esteemed guests in attendance, to ceo of bugatti rimac, mate rimac, the senior management team, the project crew and the intensely focused vehicle technicians  all immersed in overwhelming emotion as the run-briefing concluded, and the historic moment arrived.

 

 

andy wallace  bugatti pilote officiel and winner of the le mans 24 hours  assumed the controls of the one-off w16 mistral world record car, warming up the vehicle's bespoke high-performance tires on a first anticipatory lap. ascending to a specified speed of 200 km/h into the banking of the track, andy increased the speed before unleashing the full power of the vehicle as the straight opened up coming off the banking, taking it to new heights of record-speed. under the meticulous control of sgs-tüv saar gmbh, the achievement of a new world top-speed record for an open-top car was officially confirmed at the end of the run, with andy reaching an incredible 453.91 km/h.

 

"throughout the testing program leading up to this moment, it was incredible to feel how stable the car felt  i got the sense that it wanted to go faster," explained andy wallace. "and when it came to the moment itself, the experience was overwhelmingly thrilling; feeling the elemental forces from the open-top cockpit, the sound of the immense w16 engine emanating from the air scoops next to my ear  it made the achievement incredibly emotional. a record like this pushes the boundaries of automotive innovation, and requires immense focus, dedication, and teamwork to realize. its a true testament to the passion that everyone at bugatti has for making history."


for the first time in bugatti's history, the customer of the vehicle was in attendance to witness a record-breaking event for the ages, he was offered the opportunity to immerse himself in an exclusive, exquisite experience throughout the weekend in honor of the momentous day. reinforcing the purely unique and landmark nature of the occasion, the customer was bestowed with the incredible opportunity to join andy on another high-speed run in the wake of the world record, almost reaching the same speed  and likely setting an unofficial record for the fastest-ever passenger ride.

 
 

like each bugatti owner, the customer of the w16 mistral world record car had a unique vision to cement the legacy of their rare bugatti collection: to own each of the bugatti world record cars; the veyron 16.4 super sport, veyron 16.4 grand sport vitesse world record edition, and chiron super sport 300+. each icon joins the w16 mistral world record car in this exceptional collection, while forming a unique representation of the marque in the singh collection  an incredible private car collection showcasing the aspirational achievements of the community from punjab, india.


 

in addition to the world record cars' monumental accomplishments, a unifying thread runs through the w16 mistral world record car and each of its illustrious forebears. signifying its membership of a truly incomparable collection, the unique 14m w16 mistral world record car features unmistakable accents on the lower body and wheels in vibrant 'jet orange'  a color that has evolved from the original signature hue of the veyron world record cars to define the record-breaking chiron and w16 mistral, married with a pure, visible-black carbon exterior. the spirit of this unique design language continues in the interior, with a plethora of orange-accented features throughout the cabin immersing the driver in the aura of record-breaking triumph.


reflecting on the immense moment in the history of bugatti and indeed the automotive world, mate rimac, ceo of bugatti rimac, said:

 

"since the inception of bugatti in 1909 (1910, ed.), the marque has sought to supersede the perceived realms of possibility in luxury, elegance, and performance. the bugatti world record cars throughout the marques history have represented the epitome of speed and power, setting new boundaries and redefining again and again, what bugatti vehicles are capable of. and now, with the unparalleled achievement of the w16 mistral world record car etched into the history books, we see history not just repeating itself, but new history made. we are immensely proud of the whole team that made this incredible achievement possible  an achievement defined by passion and the pursuit of perfection. that is what defines bugatti  and what makes its achievements truly incomparable."

november 14, 2024 project for bugatti baby replica's. 
a new project for building quality replica bugatti baby's, has recently been started by pierre-henri raphanel.


in 1926, ettore bugatti sought to celebrate the fourth birthday of his youngest son, roland, with a uniquely special gift. inspired by an icon close to his heart, he decided to build an exquisite half-scale interpretation of the inimitable bugatti type 35  the legendary vehicle that would go on to become the most successful racing car of all time  and marking the birth of the bugatti baby, also wrongly known as "type 52". it is now reinterpreted as a piece of art, a quintessentially special limited series of collectors' sculptures infused with the vision of ettore bugatti himself, and realized by bugatti's first pilote officiel, pierre-henri raphanel.


today, around 100 to 150 of the extraordinarily beautiful baby's remain, of which about 500 were built. the press release says that only a handful remains, while in fact it is closer to one third, ed.. these are relics of an era that celebrated both luxury and pioneering design. now, through pierre-henri raphanel's deep-rooted passion and lifelong dedication to bugatti, this iconic configuration has been meticulously recreated. his company, 'nations racing legends', has brought the baby back to life as a limited series of artful masterpieces, crafted to be admired and cherished as heirlooms of automotive and artistic heritage.

 

pierre-henri's journey with bugatti began in 2005, and since then, he has become synonymous with the brand's uncompromising standards and visionary spirit. having conducted more than 10,000 road-tests around the globe, he has amassed a depth of experience that few can rival. his celebrated career in racing  including competing in formula 1, the legendary 24 hours of le mans, and setting a world-record top speed of 431.072 km/h with the bugatti veyron 16.4 super sport in 2010  adds a unique dimension to his role at bugatti. pierre-henri now channels his extensive experience, profound historical knowledge of the brand, and deep automotive expertise into every detail of the bugatti baby t52 series. pierre-henri knowingly names his creations baby t52, to differentiate his creations from the orginal baby and the bugatti baby ii, which is made by the little car company.


this exclusive series, limited to just 99 hand-crafted pieces, embodies bugatti's near-century of celebrating luxury and excellence in a 'baby' package. each artwork has been created with an unwavering commitment to authenticity, employing original crafting techniques and the highest-quality materials that ettore bugatti himself had chosen. the result is a collection of timeless artworks, reflecting the marque's dedication to elegance, precision, and unyielding passion for perfection.

 

 

each baby t52 creation is far more than a replica; it is a masterful reinterpretation, paying homage to bugatti's heritage while celebrating pierre-henri's own legendary journey with the brand. designed to be treasured and displayed as pieces of art, these creations not only preserve bugatti's legacy but elevate it, bringing together nearly a century of tradition, pierre-henri's unparalleled expertise, and the finest craftsmanship that french artisanship can offer. in each baby t52, bugatti's storied past and pierre-henri's personal devotion to the brand unite to create a tribute worthy of exhibition and admiration for generations to come.

"pierre-henri has been a wonderful brand ambassador for almost two decades. his incredible knowledge of the bugatti brand and his passion for our inimitable legacy and ettores visionary spirit and philosophy  as well as his great love for detail and ambition to being faithful to the original car  brings so much authenticity and uniqueness to his oeuvre d'art. we are incredibly proud to complement our portfolio with these state-of-the-art sculptures designed for bugatti enthusiasts and art collectors."  wiebke stahl, managing director at bugatti international

  
 

 

with each work individually numbered, 60 of the examples are dedicated to privileged customers to individualize according to their preferred color-palette, with some appointed in official vintage racing liveries. these iconic hues represent nations from france to italy and monaco, all woven into the fabric of motor-racing's long and star-studded history. reflecting the unique artistic flair of bugatti's special-edition vehicles, 39 of the exquisite models represent bespoke versions of the iconic baby; defined by exclusive configurations and materials, the series includes 12 'silver legends'  eight of which are finished in mirror-polished aluminum and four in unique artists' proofs  and 12 'gold legends', with eight replete in highly complex mirror-polished brass and four also finished in artists' proofs.

 

 

concluding his reflections, pierre-henri elaborated on the symbolism of the project:


"the remarkable group of craftspeople and artists i have assembled,  share a common vision to honor bugatti's truly unique story  reviving the spirit of inimitability that the original bugatti baby represented, and embodying the ethos that has made each bugatti model incomparable. the artworks we have created, with incredibly intricate crafting processes and precious materials, is entirely faithful to the original vision. designed as sculptures, these timeless bespoke creations are a beautiful testament to the spirit of legacy that compelled ettore to bestow the original baby to his son, honoring the brand's legacy and customer-centric approach."

 
priced from 95,000 (exclusive of taxes), a series of 99 examples will be produced  with a third of models already reserved by brand enthusiasts and collectors.

november 4, 2024 michel perridon bugatti museum will be in europe 
dutch financial magazine quote announces the following:
the michel perridon bugatti museum which was planned to be in dubai is off the table, entrepreneur now looks to france
bad news for arab car enthusiasts: michel perridon will not be opening his 'bugatti experience' in dubai. the museum with his impressive collection of sports cars will now be located near the company's factory in france. perridon says he has already agreed to a collaboration with bugatti.
recent communications with the perridon organisation indicate however, that the final decision has not been made yet; the museum may also be in the netherlands, in the area of perridon's home town rotterdam. ed.
 details of what can be found in the perridon collection can be found here.
the collection comprises:
7 modern bugatti's, one eb110ss, 3 veyron's in various versions, two chiron's one of which is the 300+ version, and the bugatti bolide
over 20 classic bugatti's, ranging from 1913 to 1947
around 15 rembrandt bugatti bronzes, and one by ettore bugatti's daughter lidia
the world-wide largest collection of carlo bugatti furniture
lots of original drawings, painting, photographs and other "small" items.

quote 500 member michel perridon claims to have the largest bugatti collection in the world and dreams of showing it to the world in a museum. it is part of the legacy that the founder of computer accessories store trust wants to build in the autumn of his life.

the intended location for that bugatti experience was dubai, he told us three years ago. but his efforts to open the museum there have failed, as we understood when we recently visited him for the quote 500 in south africa (where he is also building that legacy, more about that later).

instead, the entrepreneur now wants to open the museum in molsheim, in the french alsace, near the factory where the luxury cars are produced. perridon even says he already has a deal with bugatti about a collaboration. the company does not want to confirm that to quote (yet).
perridon less in dubai
the turnaround is remarkable. in recent years, perridon has been full of praise for dubai, where his entrepreneurial vision was better understood than in the netherlands, for example. in the quote 500 interview, he says he still visits the desert city regularly, because he has real estate projects there and his daughter lizzy lives there. but perridon can now be found more often in the netherlands and south africa.

in the latter country, he is converting 28,000 hectares of former hunting grounds into a nature reserve where tourists can go on safari from the beginning of 2025. perridon is so proud of that project that he was happy to give us an insight for the recently launched quote 500 edition. and rotterdam, that remains his home. he owns the luxurious city villa welgelegen there, among other things.
'everything from bugatti on its home base'
why exactly perridon is leaving dubai remains a bit of a guess. in south africa, he said that regulations in the united arab emirates do not allow him to hold positions at companies there and in the netherlands at the same time. that is why his museum plans in dubai fell through. inquiries with the endb, which advises dutch entrepreneurs on their move to the united arab emirates, show that such a rule does not exist at all.

when we confront perridon with this again (back in the netherlands), his earlier statement appears to have nothing to do with it. he simply states that he has come to the conclusion that molsheim is a much nicer location for the museum. this is much better. everything from bugatti on its home base. really great.








october 27, 2024 impressive wire bugatti t35 sculpture 
this wire sculpture was constructed by the seller (in the bring-a trailer auction, it sold for $15000), artist terry lawrie, to resemble a bugatti type 35. features include a four-spoke wood-rimmed steering wheel, leather tie-down straps, a bugatti emblem, a hood ornament, a faux aero screen and starting handle, a mesh grille, a side-mounted faux spare wheel, and #8 race numbers. the sculpture is constructed from wire finished in blue and measures approximately 14' 8" long, 6' 9" wide, and 4' 3" tall. this type 35-style wire sculpture is now offered with a wooden shipping crate at no reserve in san francisco, california, on a bill of sale.

australian artist terry lawrie has produced several automotive-related wire sculptures, and this example is 
constructed to resemble a bugatti type 35. wire framing comprises 3/8th zinc-coated tubes that have been sandblasted and powder-coated in french blue. vented side and hood panel segments are finished to match, while the horseshoe-shaped radiator features a faux radiator temperature sight gauge and cnc-punched mesh grille. other features include a two-eared fuel filler cap, a leather hood strap, and outlines representing an aero screen and rear-view mirror. number 8 race numbers adorn the grille and rear framework.

the faux side-mounted spare wheel is attached by a leather strap and has a silver metal simulated tire tread, magnesium spokes, and black-finished internal sections. laser-cut dunlop, 4.50×19, and cord yellow-finished script are attached to the outer sections.



the cockpit is equipped with a four-spoke wood-rimmed steering wheel aft of a fold-down faux aero screen and rear-view mirror surrounds. the simulated seat is finished in brown paint, and a chrome-polished faux handbrake is mounted on the right side.

leaf spring suspension is present front and rear, while a hollow front axle and a faux starter handle are fitted up front.

the style is vaguely similar to that of antoine dufilho, who however uses flat metal plates, constructing also a bugatti t35 themed sculpture, see for example    the last report of retromobile in the bugatti revue.






october 22, 2024 bugatti movie to be made by producer andrea iervolino, who also did the same on ferrari, lamborghini & maserati
plus rembrandt bugatti movie from 2015.... 

exclusive: andrea iervolino, the italian producer of sports car biopics ferrari, lamborghini: the man behind the legend and the upcoming maserati movie, is revving up a biopic of ettore bugatti.

bugatti is slated to film late next year in italy and france for iervolinos new banner, the andrea iervolino company.

the movie is set to tell the life story of bugatti, the founder of the iconic automobile company, who was known for transforming the automotive world with his creative genius and relentless dedication to design and technology. the italian-born french designer and manufacturer also designed aeroplane engines and was no stranger to tragedy: bugattis son, jean, was killed on 11 august 1939 at the age of 30 while testing a bugatti car near the familys factory in molsheim, france.

iervolino is in talks with writers and directors on the project, which will feature a u.s. and international cast and be english-language. the producer is hoping to get buy-in from the bugatti family.

iervolino said today: after the success of our films on lamborghini and ferrari, i am thrilled to bring another global automotive icon to the screen. bugatti will be a film that honors the passion and innovation that have defined one of the most iconic car manufacturers of all time.

prolific producer iervolino is soon entering production on car movie maserati: the brothers, which will star anthony hopkins and michele marrone for director bobby moresco. morrone will star as alfieri il maserati in the biopic about the family behind the high-performance automobiles. hopkins will play an italian financier who bankrolls the maserati brothers.

recent films produced by the italian include johnny depps san sebastian entry modi starring al pacino, jean-claude van dammes franchise sequel kill em all 2 and thriller skincare starring elizabth banks. previous credits include waiting for the barbarians starring mark rylance, johnny depp and robert pattinson and drama to the bone starring lily collins and keanu reeves.



a movie on ettore bugatti is new, one about his brother rembrandt had started in 2008 though. a filming company had started near the barr museum (see picture above), to shoot scenes for a movie on the animal sculptor. 

the german director jean-charles wolfarth, 35 years old, was planning to relate an episode of rembrandt's life in 1912, in which he visits his brother ettore in molsheim. there would be 4 to 5 weeks of filming in the alsatian area. the actors are all french: frédéric lanoue interpretes rembrandt, olivier guillermain is ettore and céline france incarnates barbara bugatti, ettore's wife.

somehow, that project was suddenly stopped, but finally finished in 2015! (i now come to know about this...) the actors and actresses are all different now, the only character that remained the same is the 8-valve bugatti, chassis number 670 of 1914. the scene of the movie now is 1913, but still a visit of rembrandt bugatti to his brother ettore and sister-in-law barbara.
 details on the movie: "rembrandt bugatti renaissant"

august 19, 2024 bugatti type 59 "roi des belges" best of show at pebble beach 
pebble beach, calif. (august 18, 2024)
for the first time in the history of the pebble beach concours delegance, best of show was awarded to a preservation cara bugatti type 59.

this year, 214 cars from 16 countries and 29 states pulled onto the competition field, and the car named best of show was a 1934 bugatti type 59 sports presented by fritz burkard of the pearl collection in zug, switzerland.


concours chairman sandra button noted, this storied bugatti, the first type 59 built, is a rare factory race car that recorded multiple grand prix victories at the hands of several important racing greatsand it also has ties to royalty. perhaps most importantly, it wears all of its history to this day, having been preserved in the livery it was given when redressed by king leopold of belgium.

thrilled owner fritz burkard exclaimed, im so happy for the car, so happy for bugatti. this car is incredible. its so much historyone of the most successful bugattis in historyand to win with this car means a lot to me. first time a swiss, first time a european wins, first time a preservation wins. its important that preservation also gets recognition, because a car can only be once original. and it drives so beautifully.



preservation cars have appeared on our show field for decades, and we have hosted formal classes for them since 2001.

with this win, bugatti and mercedes-benz are tied for the most best of show awards at pebble beach: ten wins each. 

this years race for best of show featured other strong contenders, including the 1948 talbot-lago t26 grand sport saoutchik fastback coupé presented by robert kudela of chropyne in the czech republic; the 1934 packard 1108 twelve lebaron sport phaeton presented by harry yeaggy of cincinnati, ohio; and, perhaps most surprisingly, the 1970 lancia stratos hf zero bertone coupe, which was presented by phillip sarofim of beverly hills, california, in our history-making display of wedge concepts and prototypes. 

the competition got underway on thursday when the majority of concours entries participated in the 26th pebble beach tour delegance, which traces about 70 miles of scenic coastal roads. entries that complete the tour have the advantage if they tie in the concours class competition.

the pebble beach concours has already raised more than $3 million for charity this year, bringing the events total charitable donations to over $41 million to date. through the pebble beach company foundation, the primary charitable partner of the concours, these funds will benefit nearly 100 local nonprofits focused on youth education, impacting the lives of more than 10,000 children annually in monterey county. 

apart from best of show, there were a few more prizes for bugattis:

august 11, 2024 bugatti sas honors 100 years of t35 with landscape detail. 

as can be seen on the photographs above and right, bugatti sas built a special landscape detail next to the atelier, on their grounds at molsheim / dorlisheim. it is a large type 35 cast aluminium wheel, in grey bricks. diameter seems to be about 35 meters. 

here it is photographed with the type 35 owned by bugatti sas, as well as the new bugatti tourbillon. from directly above the design can be clearly seen, from the side it is a bit more difficult. the t35 on the photographs is not an original t35, it started it's life as a t37, chassis # 37178. parts of the frame of this car are from 37178. the engine  
is a new crosthwaite & gardiner unit, as is the body. rear and front axles are original, while the gearbox is an original, though from a brescia.

however, who knows where bugatti took the inspiration for his cast-aluminium wheel? some say it was from miller, who actually patented a design for a car with (6-spoke) aluminium wheels. wheels that were never actually made. 

my guess is that it was during a walk through the center of molsheim, at the place de l'hôtel de ville, that ettore took his inspiration for the design of his revolutionary wheel. the pillar on the old fountain there is decorated with a sculpture on top. of course the quality of the stone has faded a bit over the past 101 years, but the 8-spoked wheel on the shield, held by a lyon and decorated with two angel's heads, can be clearly seen! 



 
below the text from bugatti sas:
bugatti type 35: the race where it all began exactly 100 years ago

 

a century ago, on august 3rd 1924, the bugatti type 35 was introduced to the world for the first time as five examples of ettore bugattis new racing car took to the starting grid at the grand prix de lyon. with one held in reserve to showcase to the media, there was an immediate appreciation of the elegance and beauty of the type 35, but no one could have imagined just how quickly, and how far, the legend of this lightweight grand prix racer would grow. even 100 years later, it continues to inspire the direction of new bugatti hyper sports car and bugatti enthusiasts all over the world celebrate its impact.

the series of grand prix races between 1922 and 1925 was a period of great innovation in the automotive world, requiring cars to have engines of no more than 2 liters in capacity, weigh a minimum of 650kg and with a minimum width of 80cm, allowing for mandatory passenger mechanics. it did, in effect, drive the evolution of roadgoing sports cars, and required manufacturers to derive more power with new inventions in engine technology rather than simply increase capacity. ettore bugattis latest entry into this elite tier of motorsport was the type 35.



 

the lyon-givors race itself was globally renowned, and attracted more than 100,000 spectators, making it the ideal launchpad for bugattis newest racing car. over 500 miles and 35 laps, the races regularly lasted more than seven hours so to compete was not just to prove your speed but also to prove reliability. and as if seven hours of full throttle racing wasnt enough of a test, ettore bugatti asked for the type 35s to be driven from the factory in molsheim to the race, on public roads, and back again  a journey of five hours each way even today.

 

the revolutionary cars made the road journey to lyon without trouble but the race would turn out to be not quite as straightforward. however, the type 35s main issue during its debut race was caused by a component bugatti had no control over: the vulcanized tires. characteristic of bugattis meticulous attention to detail, mechanical failures were rare, but a manufacturing defect within the tires caused many of the cars to retire, but not before one of them could secure a fastest lap of the whole race.


testing within the intensity of a motor race such as the grand prix allowed ettore bugatti to identify the type 35s weaknesses and improve them consistently; a formula which he continued to apply as the type 35 evolved over its six years of production. during its active period, the beautifully proportioned, sublimely engineered racing car won some 2,500 victories across multiple disciplines, including road races, rallies, speed trials, and hill climbs. at the most demanding road competition of the age  the targa florio in italy  the bugatti type 35s star shone brightest and burnt longest, with five consecutive victories between 1925 and 1929, a record that stood right up until the last targa florio happened in 1977. it was such an astonishing motorsport achievement that it is celebrated to this day, with the international bugatti meeting 2024, hosted in sicily in may, welcoming a number of historic bugatti models to take part and celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the type 35.

 

achievements such as this exemplify how the iconic bugatti model sparked a period of innovation in racing and road car design, as manufacturers hurried to develop faster cars, only for further ingenuity to emerge from molsheim, including supercharged variants of the type 35.

 

the type 35 is one of the all-time greats, not only as a racing car but also as a piece of design and engineering. this year alone, for the centenary year, we have seen bugatti enthusiast clubs from around the world celebrating this legendary car and its debut at the grand prix de lyon. and that isnt because this is the site of one of the type 35s greatest victories, but in recognition of the fact that this was the moment that the world of motorsport changed; for the next five years the type 35 would be almost unbeatable, as its inherently fast fundamentals evolved to become even more advanced and even more powerful.

bonhams' bugatti to lalique auction - 
the mullin collection, july 24, 2024 


this auction, unique as it is to see so many carlo and rembrandt items in one sale, is most remarkable for one particular event: it marks the recognition of lidia bugatti as an artist in her own right. 

both a series of paintings as well as a sculpture of a horse went well over their estimates. in case of the paintings, this was even more than 40 times the maximum estimate, while the horse reached $150k (without premium), while the maximum estimate was just $9000! 

below all prices attained at the auction, family members are ordered with the youngest first, this time. prices are including premium (28.5%). images of all items can be found in the complete catalogue of the auction. numbers at the beginning of each line are the lot numbers.

july 11, 2024 peter mullin collection of carlo / rembrandt / lidia bugatti art to be auctioned by bonhams in los angeles 
this extensive collection of bugatti art items comes from the collection of peter mullin, who deceased september last year, aged 82. most of these were shown at the "art of bugatti" exhibition in oxnard in 2014.

while most of the car collection from mullin has already been sold (most in the gooding & co auction held on april 26, 2024), it was unsure if the art collection, encompassing not only bugatti but also lalique radiator mascots and some other art and furniture, would be sold privately or in a public auction. as it turns out now, it will be a public auction, where most, if not all, of the bugatti art will be sold. estimates for all the items on auction can be found in the complete catalogue. estimates range from around 1,000 for the drawings or paintings by carlo, rembrandt or lidia, to over 200,000 for the most special rembrandt bugatti sculpture.




"the mullin automotive museum has been created to honor the breathtaking 
cars that grace its floors. yet is my sincere hope that this museum will come to 
be known not just for its automobiles, but for the homage it pays to the art deco 
movement. art deco was an unstoppable artistic force all through the late 1920s 
and into the 1930s, influencing sculpture, furniture, lighting, crystal, painting, 
architecture, and many other forms of expression. it was a golden era of design"
-peter mullin, preface for the art of bugatti: mullin automotive museum

the art deco period was a brief era of art and design that was born in the 1910s and quickly
faded with the chaos and destruction of world war ii. for some, it quickly flashes before our
eyes as we gaze at the empire state or chrysler buildings, but for peter mullin, art deco was
the supreme expression of artistry and industrial design during the 20th century. the art deco
movement is unique in that it bridged the gap between the handmade and factory produced,
between the warmth of ivory, gilt and mahogany and the polished coolness of rolled steel.
mr. mullin was fascinated with this transitional period in design history, and the collection he
built reflected not only his impeccable taste, but his discerning eye that only sought out the
best examples.

peter mullin - philanthropist, businessman, and collector - was known far and wide for having
the most impressive collection of pre-world war ii bugatti vehicles in the world. however, his
passion for the bugatti design aesthetic and art deco movement was not limited to cars but
extended to the entire bugatti familys artistic output and to masterpieces of design from that
period. to that end, peter and merle mullin amassed one of the most extensive collections
of carlo bugatti (father of ettore bugatti, celebrated car maker) furniture in the world, and
certainly the largest collection of the storied makers oeuvre to ever come to auction. of
particular note is an extremely rare silver dragonfly bowl made towards the end of carlo
bugattis artistic career, perhaps the only one of its kind in existence. solidifying the mullins
holdings were superlative examples of bronze animalier sculptures by rembrandt bugatti
(brother of ettore) and lidia bugatti (ettores daughter).
in addition to the impressive selection of works from the bugatti family in their collection,
mr. and mrs. mullin bought furniture by such historied makers as jules leleu and maurice
dufrêne, and sculpture by maurice guiraud-rivière and pierre le faguays. magnificent in
its depth and breadth is a stunning grouping of molded glass car mascots by rené lalique
offered within this auction. designed for a brief period between 1925 and 1931, these art
deco masterpieces were specifically produced for french automobiles prior to world war ii,
bridging peter mullins interest in industrial and artistic design.



focus of the auction is the carlo bugatti furniture, of which many examples will be sold, see the complete catalogue. however, mullin had some rarer carlo bugatti items in his collection, one silverware "dragonfly bowl" from
circa 1907, see above and the top photo for a detail. apart from that, three oil-on-canvas paintings:  one of his daughter-in-law barbara (married to ettore bugatti), one of his wife thérèse,  and one of a landscape. also, one of the relatively rare stringed instruments.





rembrandt bugatti is a bit less prominent in the collection, with four sculptures like the one of the crouching jaguar above. more special is the one of the same barbara bugatti, his brother's wife (below left), and said to be the girl he loved all his life. interesting also some relatively well-known drawings, plus a study of a man's bust (below right).







lidia bugatti, 2nd daughter of ettore bugatti and barbara bolzoni, was not much recognized for her artistic work, before the exhibition in 2014 already mentioned, and an article in the bugatti revue. of her, a couple of bronze horses (above) will be auctioned, as well as a collection of 4 paintings. in these paintings, oil on paper and made from 1932 to 1956, the automobiles of her father ettore play a prominent role. 







ettore bugatti is not really the focus of this auction, however one of the items on auction is a 1927 "baby" electric bugatti, numbered 379a (estimate:  93.000 -  120.000). furthermore a trunk (below) from an automobile, said to have been the property of ettore, and a replica radiator mascot for the bugatti royale. the mascot of course was sculpted by his brother rembrandt.

july 6, 2024 quartet of significant 1930s bugattis from the jack braam ruben collection consigned to the london auction (by gooding & co) at hampton court palace 
the official auction partner of the annual concours of elegance at hampton court palace will offer for sale an early bugatti type 57 atalante, a bugatti type 43a roadster, and other selections from the jaap (jack) braam ruben collection.

global auction house and international market leader gooding & company is proud to return as the official auction partner of the concours of elegance at hampton court palace later this summer, where it will host its annual london auction on friday, 30 august. gooding & company today announces a quartet of historic, significant classic bugattis from the world-class collection of jack braam ruben, based in maastricht, the netherlands. this grouping includes one of the earliest surviving examples of the bugatti type 57 atalante, a remarkably well-preserved and patinated bugatti type 43a roadster, an award-winning, unrestored bugatti type 57 stelvio, and a show-quality bugatti type 57 ventoux.


jack braam ruben is widely recognized in our industry as one of the foremost traders and collectors of classic and prewar cars in the world, and he has an especially keen sense for the most significant examples from the bugatti and alfa romeo marque, said gooding & company president and co-founder, david gooding. we are privileged and delighted to present these very original bugattis from his premier collection at our london auction, and look forward to offering these exceptional motor cars on the historic grounds of hampton court palace.

1935 bugatti type 57 atalante (estimate: £3,000,000  £4,000,000)
the atalante is undoubtedly one of the most distinctive, attractive, and important styles of the venerable bugatti type 57. this example, chassis 57252, was built in november 1934 as a first series grand raid chassis, featuring a lowered steering column angle compared to a standard type 57. though originally intended to be clothed in grand raid roadster coachwork, the car was bodied by the factory in early 1935 with jean bugatti-designed atalante coupe coachwork. this was the third such chassis to be equipped in this way. a mere 10 atalantes would be produced throughout 1935; this very early example features a beautifully tapered tail section, which gives the entire car a lighter, more sporting design. this is achieved through convex wheel covers featuring special hand-formed tear drop shapes, as well as rear fenders which sweep up behind the wheel openings, resulting in the delicately tapered appearance not present on later atalantes. chassis 57252 was the third of these 10 type 57s to receive atalante coachwork, and of these, only three examples are known to survive today. 

ordered new by bugatti agent monestier in lyon for its first owner, mr. perrot, it was equipped with 18-inch wire wheels and lockheed hydraulic brakes, per special customer request. 57252 would pass through a succession of french owners for the next two decades before being sold to famed belgian bugatti restorer and dealer jean de dobbeleer of brussels in 1956. in 1957, the atalante was exported to the us by bugatti collector lyman greenlee. the car would eventually make its way back to europe, first to guido artom in italy, and then to peter rae in the uk. mr. rae correctly restored the car to its original specifications, including scintilla headlamps and lalique-style running lights mounted atop the fenders. 57252 remained in the uk before joining mr. braam rubens collection in 2019. the dutch collector commissioned a thorough restoration, tasking bugatti specialist classic skills of lomm, the netherlands, with the work. the exterior was refinished in its original two-tone smoke and sage green color scheme, the interior was reupholstered, and the dashboard and bumpers were returned to their original configuration. confirmed to still retain its original engine, no. 195, per documentation on file, this incredibly well-restored and historically important type 57 atalante, with its visually distinctive early design, presents a rare opportunity for any discerning bugattiste and collector.

1933 bugatti type 43a roadster (estimate: £3,000,000  £4,000,000)
the type 43, and its successor, the type 43a, were conceived as road-going counterparts to the bugatti type 35, the most successful and important of prewar grand prix racing cars. while a standard type 43 was equipped with grand sporting coachwork, a 43a signified a car clothed in elegant jean bugatti-designed roadster coachwork. mechanically, the 43a was equipped with a supercharged 2.3-litre inline eight-cylinder engine, based on the engine of the race-winning type 35b. bugatti built just 18 examples of the type 43a, and of these, less than 10 are accounted for today. this type 43a, chassis 43309, has the penultimate chassis number, and was delivered new to edouard michel of paris in may 1934; it would remain in europe for the next four decades. during this time, it was displayed at serge pozzolis famed montlhéry motor museum, as well as the le mans museum. around 1978 the bugatti was acquired by noted german bugatti collector and historian uwe hucke. after nine years in huckes ownership, it passed to dr. joachim jantzen of essen, who entered the car in a number of historic driving events. 

next, 43309 joined the collection of manfred dolleschel, who entered the type 43a in the international rally in the uk in 2004, and the international rally in tuscany in 2009. in more recent years, 43309 was exhibited at the concours of elegance at st. jamess palace in 2013, as well as the 2022 pebble beach concours delegance® following completion of the pebble beach motoring classic. this type 43a has a gorgeously patinated, two-tone gray finish, with subtle evidence of original black and yellow paint in small sections throughout the exterior. retaining many important original components according to an accompanying report by marque authority mark morris, including its original semi-roller bearing crankshaft, much of its original leather upholstery, and original engine, stamped no. 106. in place of the standard wooden dashboard is a two-piece aluminum dashboard. it is beautifully constructed, shifting all of the gauges from the center of the dash to a panel surrounding the steering column, giving unrestricted access to the centrally-mounted magneto ignition. 43309 represents what is surely an unrepeatable opportunity for the discerning collector to acquire what is widely recognized as one of the best examples of the type 43.

1935 bugatti type 57 stelvio (estimate: £900,000  £1,100,000)
this gangloff-bodied 1935 bugatti type 57 stelvio cabriolet, chassis 57181, was equipped with engine no. 30 and fashioned with a light-colored soft-top hood upon completion. the car was sold new to france and was acquired after world war ii by a swiss owner, before being sold in the late 1960s to david mize in the us in exceptionally original condition, having traveled only 27,000 km. an avid bugattiste, mize would later become the president of the american bugatti club. the stelvio was later sold to collector john risch, an american of dutch origin, who won best in show with the car at the new hope automobile show in pennsylvania in 1968. mr. risch was the long-term owner of 57181, lovingly retaining it for several decades until his passing in 1991, after which point the car remained with his estate. in 2016, 57181 was displayed at the pebble beach concours delegance® in the prewar preservation class, where it was awarded second in class, and also completed the tour delegance. in 2018, the stelvio was shown at the amelia island concours delegance before joining mr. braam rubens esteemed collection in the netherlands. surely one of the finest unrestored examples extant, the stelvio retains a wonderfully patinated original red leather interior, beautifully complimented by a subtle two-tone black and maroon paint scheme. 

1938 bugatti type 57 ventoux (estimate: £550,000  £650,000)
built on a series iii rolling chassis with engine no. 523 in october 1938, this bugatti type 57 ventoux, chassis 57724, was completed near the end of the assembly line before the impending war brought production to a halt. factory finished with a gris deauville (gray) body with havane (tan) leather, the car was sold through british agent colonel sorel to its first owner, l.w. young in 1940. it remained with mr. young for a decade before passing on to h. archer-smith, who reportedly won the bugatti owners club taylor trophy with the ventoux in 1958. in 1972, the ventoux passed to john frears, who displayed the car at the stratford motor museum. in 1982, 57724 was acquired by geoffrey perfect of penn in buckinghamshire, a serious and respected bugatti collector. it was during his ownership that the car captivated the attention of mr. braam ruben, who would eventually add it to his collection in 2021. this exceptional, show-quality type 57 ventoux, with known provenance from new, has been displayed at some of the most prestigious events throughout its lifetime, including the earls court london motor show in 1989, techno classica essen in 2019, and the concours delegance paleis soestdijk in 2022.

june 22, 2024 presentation and details of the new bugatti tourbillon  



the crowd anxiously waiting for the presentation to start, and andy wallace stepping out of the tourbillon


today, i was present at the "enthusiast's presentation" in molsheim. a flashy presentation with of course the tourbillon on center stage.

many details were already known, but there is (of course) more. more photograps also, these ones were almost all shot by me.

unfortunately, mate rimac was not present, but i had some conversations with christophe piochon and andy wallace.

highlights and details of the bugatti tourbillon:
new 16 cilinder naturally aspirated engine, 8.3 litre, 1000hp, max rpm 9000

the engine developed by cosworth weighs just 252 kg
engine drives rear wheels, helped by a 200 hp electric motor
two electric motors drive front wheels, 300 hp each
total power 1800 hp, weight 1995 kg, slightly less than a chiron
2300 nm of torque
25 kwh battery allows for an electric range of more than 60 km
performance: 0-100: 2.0s, 0-200: <5s, 0-300: < 10 s, 0-400: <25s. top speed 445 kmh (limited)
watch-like instrument panel in the center of the steering wheel, with the latter revolving around it
price: 3.8 million euro, 250 will be made. production starts in 2026


all this effort to only make 250 cars seems strange, considering all the development 

work which has to be put into it. maybe a follow-up will be introduced 
relatively soon. in all, bugatti now produced over 1000 cars, 450 of them veyron's, 500 chirons and over 50 specials like the voiture noire, centodieci, divo and more. the mistral and bolide are still being produced.
around the presentation of the tourbillon, an entire exhibition of bugatti's classic and new was presented. some of the classic bugatti's were brought by the vistors, which came from many different countries. overview of this exhibition can be found here.

the bugatti tourbillon: an automotive icon pour léternité

in 2004, the reborn bugatti brand transformed the world of automotive performance and luxury with a 1,001 hp hyper sports car: the veyron. the first road car with more than 1,000 hp was succeeded in 2016 by another engineering feat so ambitious it reset all expectations of performance, the worlds first 1,500 hp car: the chiron. at the heart of these cars was the worlds most advanced automotive engine: an 8.0-liter quad-turbo w16. now, 20 years after bugatti invented the hyper sports car, it redefines the concept completely with an entirely new powertrain and platform. this is the bugatti tourbillon.

name and philosophy


mate rimac, ceo of bugatti, said: the development of the bugatti tourbillon was guided at every step by the 115 years of bugatti history and the words of ettore bugatti himself. his mantras if comparable it is no longer bugatti and nothing is too beautiful were a guiding path for me personally, as well as the design and engineering teams looking to create the next exciting era in the bugatti hyper sports car story.

 

icons like the type 57sc atlantic, renowned as the most beautiful car in the world, the type 35, the most successful racing car ever, and the type 41 royale, one of the most ambitious luxury cars of all time, provide our three pillars of inspiration. beauty, performance and luxury formed the blueprint for the tourbillon; a car that was more elegant, more emotive and more luxurious than anything before it. quite simply, incomparable. and just like those icons of the past, it wouldnt be simply for the present, or even for the future, but pour léternité  for eternity.

 

as the first bugatti in more than 20 years not powered by the iconic w16 engine, the tradition of naming core models after legendary bugatti racing drivers of the past is no longer applied. instead, the name tourbillon was chosen as the perfect encapsulation of this cars character. a french word, and a subtle reference to bugattis french heritage and home in molsheim, the tourbillon is a watchmaking invention of a swiss-born genius living in france in 1801. a completely original creation without compare, it is both complex and beautiful, helping to counteract the effects of gravity on a watch to ensure more consistent time-keeping. and over 200 years later it is still revered as the pinnacle of watchmaking.

 

this sense of mechanical timelessness was a core part of the bugatti tourbillon journey. for a car that will be displayed on the concours lawns of this and the next centuries, technology can easily date  especially large digital screens  so its important that it uses as many timeless components as possible. the tourbillon therefore utilizes a number of design and engineering techniques that will never age, including a completely analogue instrument cluster crafted by swiss watchmakers and finished with the same care and attention you find in the worlds greatest timepieces. just as these become heirlooms over generations, the tourbillon is designed as a car for eternity.
design & aerodynamics

as with every bugatti of the modern era, the tourbillon is shaped by speed. the ability to travel at more than 400 km/h requires every single surface, inlet and ridge to be finely honed to ensure it is not only aerodynamic but also beneficial to the cars thermodynamics. this is the guiding principle of the tourbillon, which is then evolved around four bugatti design elements inspired by history: the horseshoe grille, the bugatti line, the central ridge and the dual color split.

 

frank heyl, bugatti director of design, said: the creations of ettore and jean bugatti are ingenious in their aerodynamics, innovation and enduring beauty. we draw from the bugatti type 35, where the whole shape of the car was guided by the shape of the horseshoe grille, tapering back into this streamlined fuselage shape. we find inspiration in the type 57sc atlantic  the s stood for surbaissé, which essentially meant lowered  bringing down the frontal area, lowering the roofline, lowering the driver and creating this wonderful stance and proportion. thats something that was very important for us, carefully curating the placement of volumes that are both functional but also supporting the extreme proportions of the car. if the car is lower, it looks wider and the size of the wheels are emphasized; it looks like there is tension in the muscles, a posture ready to pounce. every design decision is geared towards creating a sense of speed even at a standstill.


ever since jean bugatti began to apply bold dual-tone paintwork to his cars, it has become an important part of bugatti design dna, and in the tourbillon, we evolve it once more in an authentic but modern way. that split happens around our fourth key design element: the bugatti line, inspired by the color split lines of the type 41 royale and reborn as a core design element of both veyron and chiron. in-keeping with our new proportions, and lowered roofline, the bugatti line now curves around more sharply, leaning forwards slightly as it winds its way around the roof, imbuing the side profile with a leaping motion.

although beautiful in its design and proportions, every surface, intake and vent is carefully honed to balance the enormous aerodynamic forces of a car travelling at over 400 km/h as well as the thermodynamic requirements of a v16 engine, electric motors and battery at full performance.

 

using over 20 years of expertise from the veyron and chiron, the tourbillon features a number of patented technologies. as a result, the rear wing even remains submerged during top speed runs, with a perfect equilibrium of forces generated by these new innovations. the wing is utilized to establish higher downforce at slower speeds and as an airbrake for improved stability under deceleration.


much of this aerodynamic equilibrium is thanks to the new diffuser concept, which starts to climb from just behind the passenger cabin, rising at an ideal angle to keep the tourbillon in perfect balance. the diffuser is built around a completely new crash concept, which is fully integrated within the structure of the diffuser itself, keeping it both enormously effective but also hidden from sight, enabling the open rear-end design.

 

at the heart of the tourbillons design ethos is the iconic horseshoe, from which all lines of the car originate, shaping the central fuselage volume. docked onto that left and right are the flying fenders that allow to stream air underneath the headlights to boost air mass flow into the side intakes. this intricate interplay of airflow is further exemplified by the frontal design, which, while maintaining the dimensions of a sculpted overhang, ingeniously houses an ultra-efficient cooling system that directs air through and out of the front bonnet, augmenting downforce while ingeniously packaging a sizable frunk in between the two radiators.



a set of advanced, electrically actuated dihedral doors not only allow for easy entry into the vehicle but provide a dramatic sense of arrival, able to be opened and closed from the key fob, the door opening button found just underneath the bugatti line and on the center console.
interior

ever since car manufacturers began to embrace digital screens and touchscreens in cars, the rate of progress has been so rapid that within less than a decade, the technology appears outdated. imagining the tourbillon on concours delegance lawns not just in 10 years but perhaps in 100 years, the design philosophy of the interior focused on timelessness. inspired by the world of horologie, in which wristwatches over 100 years old can still be worn and used today, integrated into modern fashion and lifestyles seamlessly, the design and engineering teams pioneered an authentic analogue experience in the cabin.


the centerpiece of this takes the horologie philosophy to its most literal conclusion; an instrument cluster designed and built with the expertise of swiss watchmakers. made up of more than 600 parts and constructed from titanium as well as gemstones such as sapphire and ruby, the skeletonized cluster is built to the largest tolerance of 50 microns, with the smallest at 5 microns, and weighs just 700g. this intricately engineered masterpiece remains a focal point of the driving experience, fixed in place as the rim of the steering wheel rotates around it  a set-up known as a fixed hub steering wheel. through this ingenious concept tourbillon drivers have an unobstructed view of their instrumentation independent of the steering angle because the spokes reach around the back of the instrument cluster






the center console is a blend of crystal glass and aluminum, revealing the intricate workings of the switches and the engine start pull lever that it hosts. this glass was developed over 13 separate stages to ensure it was both perfectly clear and extremely strong and safe in the event of an accident. the aluminum parts of the console are anodized and milled from a single block of metal, while the knurled aluminum switches sit at the head of a complex mechanism that is fully visible beneath the crystal glass  entirely developed in-house. the act of igniting the all-new naturally aspirated v16 engine and electric powertrain has been crafted to be a physical experience, a nod to the rituals of historic automobiles  a pull to start and a push to cease.

 

but hidden from view until desired is a high-definition digital screen, which displays vehicle data and offers seamless mobile connection. an intricately engineered mechanism deploys the touchscreen from the top of the center console; portrait mode for the reversing camera in just two seconds and full landscape mode in five seconds.



every interior decision  just as it is with the exterior  is made with ultimate performance in mind, without compromising in any way on practicality or comfort. the seats, for example, are fixed to the floor to be as light and as low as they can possibly be, the pedal box can be electrically adjusted forwards and backwards to ensure a comfortable driving position for everyone. thanks to this new solution, the interior is spacious, making it ideal for longer trips and daily use. even the audio system is being engineered without traditional speakers and woofers, opting for an advanced system that features exciters on the door panels and throughout the car to use existing interior panels as speakers. it is a lighter and more efficient system than traditional audio set-ups.

christophe piochon, president of bugatti, said: as well as the spectacular analogue innovations that have gone into creating a timeless interior such as this, we focused on authenticity of materials and perfection in every part. informally we say that what you see is what you get, describing the fact that if you see a piece of what you think is titanium, then thats what it is. or if you see carbon fiber, or leather, then it will be exactly that  and always the best possible. with the tourbillon, we are taking this impeccable authenticity and craftsmanship to the next level. our completely new bugatti platform has been designed in every single detail to express the pursuit of engineering excellence. it is clear from looking at any of ettore bugattis creations that every component  even if it is never seen  is a work of art, and that was our intention with tourbillon, too. it is stunning in every detail, recognizably bugatti and also a masterpiece of packaging and engineering.
powertrain and performance

the bugatti w16 engine was unlike any other automotive engine in the world when it was revealed. with its four turbos and prodigious power figures, it set a new benchmark for the limits of combustion engine technology, and two decades after its creation its still unmatched or replicated. following in its footsteps is another incomparable masterpiece of internal combustion engineering, paired with the immediate torque and flexibility of electric motors.






this next-generation bugatti hyper sports car is powered by an all-new 8.3-liter naturally aspirated v16 engine  engineered with the help of cosworth  paired with a front e-axle with two electric motors and one electric motor mounted at the rear axle. in total, the tourbillon produces 1,800 hp with 1,000 from the combustion engine itself and 800 hp from the electric motors. its an extraordinary achievement  delivered thanks to a host of cutting-edge materials and technology  given the veyron achieved 1,001 hp from its 8.0-liter capacity engine with four turbochargers, and the new v16 is completely naturally aspirated. constructed from lightweight materials, the engine weighs just 252 kg.

 

the electric motors are powered by a 25 kwh oil-cooled 800v battery housed in the central tunnel and behind the passengers. with four-wheel-drive and full torque-vectoring, it offers ultimate traction and agility. the front e-axle houses two electric motors, with a further motor on the rear axle, for a total of 800 hp from the electric powertrain system. the electric powertrain, with the electric motors spinning up to 24,000 rpm and a fully integrated dual silicon-carbide inverter, is amongst the most power-dense in the world. the e-axles are delivering over 6 kw per kg of e-axle mass, including inverters, motors and gearboxes. while power, throttle response and torque-fill are priorities for the electric powertrain, the relatively large energy content of 25 kwh allows for a very usable all-electric range of more than 60 km / 37 miles.

 

in the automotive industry, it is expected that each new model is heavier than its predecessor. especially in case the new model adds a hybrid powertrain or more performance. but with a new bugatti, the unexpected should be the norm. the tourbillon boasts significantly improved performance, a very powerful electric powertrain system, a large battery pack and yet, it weighs less than the chiron, which is a testament to the incredible engineering behind the tourbillon. with its lightweight construction and instantaneous torque from the electric motors, the bugatti tourbillon delivers extraordinary performance.

 

thanks to the combination of an extremely advanced hybrid powertrain and lightweight engineering, efficient packaging and advanced aerodynamics, the tourbillon will be reducing significantly the emissions in comparison to its predecessor but still enhancing the driving experience and bringing to new levels the pinnacle of automotive industry.

 

emilio scervo, bugatti cto, said: the tourbillon had to be incomparable in every respect. our philosophy has been to take any single aspect of chiron and elevate it, looking for elegant and sophisticated engineering solutions and new technologies to deliver a timeless masterpiece. we wanted someone to be able to take any piece of this car, from inside, outside or under the skin, and believe that it could be placed in an art gallery. the result is a car which is beautiful inside and outside, the most powerful bugatti to date which simultaneously elevates mechanical fascination and technical beauty to a whole new level.

 

the powertrain was perhaps the most important decision that we had to make, considering every option available to us; reengineering the w16, going fully electric or creating something entirely new. ultimately, we chose the hardest possible option, creating a powertrain from scratch and pairing it seamlessly with a complex system of e-motors, a new generation eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox and more, all developed from the ground up specifically for the tourbillon. but it was important to us that this car retained that pure and raw analogue feel of a naturally aspirated combustion engine, while pairing it with the agility and ability provided by electric motors.

 

we have already heard what it sounds like when this car reaches its 9,000rpm redline under full throttle, and it is a visceral, awe-inspiring experience that will echo for eternity. with the tourbillon, we have engineered a car that delivers the best of combustion technology and electrification; free from compromises and built with a timeless dedication to creating a memorable driving experience.
engineering


the tourbillon is designed around entirely new chassis and body structure. the structure is made from a next-generation t800 carbon composite, which incorporates a number of weight-saving innovations, such as integrating the battery as a structural part of the monocoque and an unprecedented crash composite rear diffuser, inspired by top level motorsport. the front composite airducts that flow through the front of the car are also integral to the structure, ensuring that each and every part of the rigid, lightweight structure is optimized. for example, the front and rear frames exhibit low pressure thin wall aluminum casting and 3d printed structural braces, contributing to a structure that is significantly lighter and stiffer than its predecessor!

 

the completely new chassis integrates multi-link suspension front and rear, forged from aluminum, moving on from the double wishbone steel construction found in the chiron. by opting for a new organic-designed suspension arm and upright, 3d-printed in aluminum, engineers have saved 45% in suspension weight compared with the chiron. the rear also features an ai-developed 3d-printed hollow airfoil arm to enhance vehicle dynamics and aerodynamic performance.

 

the brakes are equally advanced, featuring the ultimate carboceramic technology. a bespoke brake-by-wire system is introduced, fully integrated with the moveable pedal box, and blended seamlessly through an integrated vehicle non-linear controller developed by bugatti to the hybrid powertrain. michelin pilot cup sport 2 tires  285/35 r20 at the front and 345/30 r21 at the rear  are a bespoke development for the tourbillon.

 

within the new chassis, the new ultra compact and lightweight front e-axle with dual independent motors, including the dual-inverter, fits within the same package space that was available in chiron, adding more complexity without requiring more space. designers and engineers also freed up more storage space and a larger luggage component, as part of the clean-sheet chassis and bodyshell design, allowing owners to fit a set of bespoke bugatti tourbillon luggage.
coming in 2026

mate rimac, bugatti ceo, said: we look back through bugatti history at the creations of ettore and jean and you can immediately see that they refused to compromise. the amount of patents ettore had to his name was incredible, because he didnt ever want the simplest solution, he always wanted the best solution, even if it didnt exist yet. hed go away and hed build it, test it and refine it until it was perfect. and then hed make it beautiful. it is why the cars are so revered today, and it is the driving force behind everything we have done with tourbillon.

 

so yes, it is crazy to build a new v16 engine, to integrate with a new battery pack and electric motors and to have a real swiss-made watchmaker instrument cluster and 3d-printed suspension parts and a crystal glass center console. but it is what ettore would have done, and it is what makes a bugatti incomparable and timeless. without that kind of ambition, you might create a great hyper sports car, but you wouldnt create an icon pour léternité.



the bugatti tourbillon now enters its testing phase, with prototypes already on the road in anticipation for customer deliveries in 2026. a total of 250 examples will be built, with a starting price of 3.8m eur net. hand-assembly will take place at the bugatti atelier in molsheim, following the final w16-powered bugatti models, bolide and w16 mistral.right: the author posing in front of the new bugatti.

november 16, 2024 - october 2025 bugatti queen exposition museum art & cars, singen, germany 


hellé nice  the fastest woman in the world

a pioneer, a myth, a legend

in paris in the 1920s, amid the glamour and turmoil of the jazz age, hellé nice began her career as a dancer and (nude) model. but the parisian stage was not enough to satisfy her hunger for freedom. her true passion unfolded in a completely different area: on the racetracks, where she would become an icon of motorsport.

hellé nice, born mariette hélène delangle, entered racing at a time when women were an absolute exception in this field. she took the wheel as an expression of her freedom and independence - the roar of the engines as the music of her time. with style, elegance and an indomitable boldness, she conquered the racetracks of europe and the world. her name was always associated with the bugatti brand, whose perfection and aesthetics reflected her own passion and willingness to take risks.
life in the fast lane
hellé nice was more than just a racing driver. she was a symbol of freedom and female strength in an era when the unthinkable became reality. her life took her from the parisian salons to the world of film and the world's most dangerous racetracks. she competed against the greatest drivers of her time and kept pace with them, even though she was often considered an outsider.

but despite her triumph on the racetracks, hellé's career ended tragically. a serious accident in são paulo in 1936 and later false accusations during world war ii cast a shadow over her legacy. nevertheless, she is remembered as an icon of motorsport - the woman who, against all odds, became the bugatti queen and redefined the boundaries of what was possible.
hellé nice was not always the fastest woman however, see the article on emma munz in the bugatti revue!
about the mac museum art & cars
selected vintage cars in the context of art, sensational light art in spectacular architecture, artificial and artistic staging in a natural landscape directly on the hohentwiel - these opposites do not repel each other in the mac museum art & cars, but rather attract each other.

supported by the southwest german art foundation and the gabriela and hermann maier foundation, the museum ensemble with the mac 1 and the mac 2 forms a very special highlight with a unique atmosphere.

december 6, 2024 - april 13, 2025 bugatti: reaching for perfection academy art museum, easton, maryland, usa



featuring loans from two important private family collections never-before seen together, along with pieces from the museum of fine arts, houston, and the virginia museum of fine art, this bijoux exhibition of cars, sculpture, and furniture will illuminate the multigenerational ambition and creativity of the bugatti family and their place in the history of art, design, and cultural modernity. among the highlights are eight bronze sculptures from the arsidi-scuderi collection of lugano, switzerland, and five rare bugatti cars from the north collection: two grand prix race cars, two type 57 touring cars, and a miniature "baby." 






the exhibition will explore the rich artistic and technological legacies of the peripatetic bugatti family, beginning with patriarch carlo bugatti (1856-1940). his fin-de-siècle furniture designs, which debuted at international expositions in london, paris, milan, and turin, are noteworthy for their fanciful combination of materials: ebonized wood inlaid with copper, brass, ivory, mother-of-pearl, and vellum, which he often decorated with leather tassels, geometric marquetry, and painted designs. sons ettore (1881-1947) and rembrandt (1884-1916) inherited their fathers artistic passion but pursued different paths.  rembrandt had a tragically brief career as a sculptor, producing deeply empathetic and impressionistic portraits of animals. ettore, meanwhile, became a celebrated automobile designer and manufacturer. although he famously declared, perfection is never reached, he pursued it throughout his career. the cars that he and his elder son, jean (1909-1939), designed came to epitomize the speed and dynamism of modernity. but the cars were much more than machines. as automotive scholar and guest curator ken gross has observed, "everything about bugatti was artistic: the cars, their advertising, and the enduring joie de vivre associated with the marque."  






 
visitors to the exhibition will be able to immerse themselves in the bugatti family story as they view the furniture, cars, sculptures, photographs, advertisements, and other ephemera. these pieces and the stories behind them will provide a deeper understanding of the family's creative passions, their pursuit of perfection, and their place within the history of cultural modernity. although ettore bugatti famously declared, perfection is never reached, he obsessively pursued it throughout his career, said senior curator lee glazer.




marylands eastern shore is a major destination for car collectors, thanks to the annual st. michaels concours delegance. bugatti: reaching for perfection aims to attract concours attendees and car collectors who are not necessarily regular academy art museum visitors. special hoods up days and other programs will offer behind-the-scenes experiences and special access to subject-matter experts. 
the exhibition supports the museums commitment to education, outreach, and inspiration for all. with no admission fee, bugatti: reaching for perfection will be accessible not only to car enthusiasts and collectors, but to art and design lovers, and the broader community, including students and residents of the mid-atlantic region and the eastern shore.

1929 bugatti type 37, chassis: 37363


one of approximately only 220 examples of the type 37 built from 1926 to 1930
matching-numbers 1.5-litre four-cylinder engine
known ownership history from new in france; retained by prominent collector jean-michel cérède for 43 years and bought by the consignor in june 2013
attended the 1966 opening of the bugatti circuit and 2009 international bugatti meeting
documented and inspected by renowned marque historian pierre yves laugier

a more attainable version of the legendary bugatti type 35 grand prix, the type 37 of 1926 shared its bigger brothers chassis and beautiful bodywork. trading a straight-eight engine for a new single overhead camshaft inline four-cylinder motor, it delivered 60 horsepower via a four-speed manual transmission. it is thought that only 220 examples were completed.


marque historian pierre yves laugier reports that the engine numbered 252 was built in december 1927 and mated to chassis 37363 the following month. a letter dated december 1956 from the factory (available on file) notes that the completed car left molsheim in september 1929 before being driven to limoges to be delivered to its first owner, bugatti dealer léon boucher. a regular hill climb entrant, he is said to have a hit 180 km/h on a stretch of road between paris and limoges aboard his type 43 grand sport.

chassis 37363 was likely spotted in public wearing dealership numberplates, since it was not formally registered until may 1934, when it was acquired by mr andré fayette of paris. the type 37 then returned to limoges in august 1935, having been bought by 21-year-old jean-pierre labuze. remaining in the city, the car was purchased by maurice jean gaume in the spring before an august 1936 sale to entrepreneur jean benoit.

come june 1946, the car was residing in paris and surfaced again in april 1951 under the care of car and motorcycle repair business owner, jean renard. he sold the type 37 to journalist jacques levy before, in december 1955, it was purchased by yves leriche. the following december, chassis 37363 moved to fellow saint-cloud resident, francis muel.

mr muel also owned a type 37a, chassis 37374. when the supercharged car was damaged by fire, he swapped the two chassis plates. the example offered here then took part in the 1958 equivalent of the le mans classic, where it was driven by george delaroche, the runner-up in the 1934 edition of the 24 hours of le mans.
muel had the engine rebuilt in time for his wedding before selling at the end of 1961, with the car registered in the december by jean-michel cérède of vésinet. the collector retained chassis 37363 for the next four decades. notably, during his custodianship, this type 37 appeared at the first public event held at the permanent bugatti le mans circuit in 1966.

the car was sold to an enthusiast in normandy in february 2004, at which point it was mechanically and cosmetically recommissioned. in may 2009, chassis 37363 was exhibited at the international bugatti meeting in maremma as the manufacturer celebrated its centenary. meanwhile, the owner of the type 37a called upon the expertise of laugier, which ultimately led to both cars being formally paired with their original chassis plates.

purchased by the paris-based consignor in june 2013, the car received restoration work from bugatti specialist garage novo in marolles-en-hurepoix. this type 37complete with its original chassis and plate, plus cam cover numbered 252boasts a fascinating known history and is presented with beautiful patina. it would make for a wonderful addition to any discerning collection.

1933 bugatti type 49 drophead coupé by van rijswijk, chassis: 49570

a rare and attractive example of bugattis luxurious type 49
coachwork by the dutch royal coachbuilder, b.t. van rijswijk & zoon of den haag
outstanding provenancedisplayed when new on the van rijswijk stand at the 1934 amsterdam international motor show
inspected by pierre-yves laugier with assistance from kees jansen
retains its original chassis frame and plate, engine, front and rear axles, and gearbox
presented in its original colours

chassis number 49570 was built at the molsheim factory at the end of may 1933, using a long 3.22-metre wheelbase chassis and it was fitted with engine number l458. the running chassis cost 38.000 french francs and was invoiced to the european agent b.u.c.a.r. of zurich, being transported by rail on 21 november 1933.

the first owner was a car dealer, later jaguar agent, called n.v.j.w. lagerwij of la haye, holland. it was registered "hx 31549", and in early 1934 it was displayed in pride of place on the van rijswijk stand, no. 100, at the amsterdam international motor show at the rai. it was described in the 15 february 1934 issue of magazine de auto as having a black body, black leather hood, and red leather seats.

lagerwij did not keep it long as it was sold to mr e. blaisse. it appears it passed to blaisses son erik steven, later owner of the distillery, van zuylekom, and other bugattis. erik steven sold chassis 49570 to wilhelm anton te gussinko of alten on 25 march 1946, who in turn sold it to h. james a.m. coebergh of the coeberg bessen jenever distillery on 30 august 1952. he kept it for less than a year when it is sold on 15 june 1953 to p. deelen jnr of lekkerkerk.

deelen kept this wonderful type 49 for nearly a decade when ownership passed to garage limborg in 1962 and they rebuilt the engine. it then went to bugatti collector henk groenwegen of rotterdam, who passed away in 1974, and it later joined to the world famous collection of evert louwman. gert jan moed bought the bugatti in 2000 and a restoration was completed in april 2005, returning 49570 to its original colours. in 2011, it was purchased at auction by the curated collection.

an inspection of this wonderful bugatti by pierre-yves laugier shows that the mechanicals of this type 49 are highly original, with the engine, gearbox, front and rear axles all bearing the stamping of 458. both crankcases carry the assembly number of 22 proving their originality. the chassis plate is also the original item. all six of the aluminium bugatti wheels are numbered, five of them are dated from july 1933 and the sixth is from the end of august 1933.

the central part of the body is original and was conserved during the restoration, and the rear, as well as the wings, were recreated as the originals were modified after world war ii. the red leather in the interior appears to be original apart from the drivers seat which has been retrimmed. it should be noted that the engine runs but the block has a previously repaired crack which is no longer sealeda repair or replacement block would be recommend prior to proper use.

a truly special bugatti, which has remained in holland for most of its life, this rare and attractive type 49 is worthy of a place in any pre-war collection.
below some pictures indicating the uniqueness of this "dutch" bugatti, with images from it's time in the netherlands.







1936 bugatti type 57 cabriolet by gangloff,  chassis: 57431

a highly desirable cabriolet stelvio by esteemed coachbuilder gangloff
features special profiled wings by gangloff
importantly retains its original body, chassis, chassis plate, engine and gearbox
known history for much of its existence
inspected by pierre-yves laugier with assistance from kees jansen

this type 57 was assembled at the molsheim factory during april 1936 and it was transported to gangloffs workshop at colmar on 25 july 1936. the attractive four-seat stelvio body was finished on 9 september 1936 and was invoiced at a price of 16,000 french francs with a further 450 ff for creating a special profile for the front wings. the running chassis cost 45.000 french francs.

chassis 57431 was delivered to its first owner mr muracciole on 16 september 1936this is believed to be etienne muracciole. etienne was a lawyer and general counsel, whilst a noted car and aeroplane enthusiast having served as the president of the automobile club of constantine and the aeroclub in 1928, before being elected president of the automobile club of algeria in 1934. it then passed into the hands of emile knecht, the importer for algeria of terrot motorcycles. it was then sold to a certain pasha who raced stock cars in alger.

in 1962, an american called david mize travelled to algeria and discovered pashas collection of delahayes, delages and this type 57. in the summer of 1963, he purchased chassis 57431 and exported it to marseille. it was received by guy huet and rob noorlander, who drove it back to holland in the rain without a hood! during 1964, it was stored at noorlanders garage in pijnacker, sat amongst other bugattis awaiting shipment to new york. it disappeared after guy huet delivered the car to antwerp and it was left on the side of the port for several weeks.

at the start of the early seventies, it was acquired by jacques antoine de biolley of brussels, before being purchased by edmond perry on 29 june 1976. perry is best known for his company apal, which built vw-porsche specials. perry sold the car to ennio gianaroli of liège in 1994. gianaroli was an italian émigré collector of ferraris and bugattis. he sold the car to jos vander stappen, whos son pascale sold this bugatti to the curated collection in november 2016.

analysis by pierre-yves laugier shows that the car retains its original chassis plate, and the engine is stamped with 57431. its original number, 314, has been erased and restamped with 108, but the two crankcases retain the original assembly number 81 so it is the original engine. the frame number 84 is in the series of the new design of mounting with a suspended engine and redesigned crossmembers.

the gearbox is stamped 314 and corresponds with the original engine number. the gangloff body is entirely original, and the wood frame appears to be old. the paintwork has been completed more recently. interested parties should note that this bugatti has been on static display for many years so it will require some recommissioning prior to use.

2022 bugatti centodieci, chassis: vf9se3v33nm795006

one of just 10 examples produced
a stunning tribute to the eb110 series, the celebrated italian bugatti of the 1990s
features chiron-based mechanical elements adorned with heritage-influenced coachwork
shocking performance envelope of 0-100 km/h in 2.4 seconds with a top speed of 380 km/h
benefits from fastidious care during a single dedicated swiss-based ownership
displays extremely low use with just 437 kilometres (272 miles)
factory finished in the opulent colour combination of quartz white and grey carbon over a full leather interior of beluga black and gris rafale hides
documented with original purchase contract, build-spec sheet, and tüv paperwork

over the past 17 years, the modern bugatti automobiles sas has built several limited-production variants of its two legendary hypercars, the veyron and the chiron, many of them paying tribute to a driver or model from the companys prewar golden era. but in august 2019, at the exclusive the quail, a motorsports gathering, the molsheim-based hypercar manufacturer unveiled something even more specialthe centodieci.

for the first time, molsheim was officially acknowledging the importance of the brief but beautiful italian foray into the bugatti genealogy, romano artiolis early 1990s embodiment of the long-dormant bugatti marque. named for the number 110 (in italian), the centodieci was not only a tribute to artiolis iconic bugatti eb110 and eb110 ss models, but a commemoration of the marques 110th anniversary, having originally been founded by ettore bugatti in 1909.

the chassis and drivetrain of the centodieci were closely derived from the concurrent chiron, while boasting a more highly developed version of the 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged w-16 engine, now making 1,600 ps (a specification soon followed in subsequent chiron variants). in addition to the uplift in power, the newest bugatti shed 20 kilograms of unladen weight, and featured revised steering algorithms for more dynamic handling. with these improvements, the centodieci could reach 100 km/h from a standstill in just 2.4 seconds, with an electronically limited top speed of 380 km/hastonishing performance figures that remain competitive today.

in tribute to the great eb110, the centodieci featured entirely novel coachwork that hinted at its forebears wedge-themed design motifs, including a small horseshoe grille, pointed front splitter, extremely narrow headlamps, circular inlets in the c-pillars, and a fixed rear wing. just 10 examples of the centodieci were slated for production, and by the time of bugattis august 2019 introduction of the model, all 10 cars had been reserved by eager buyers.

with the final example delivered in december 2022, the centodieci remains one of the rarest and most distinctive of the special models based on the chiron, featuring exquisite coachwork and heritage associations. the fascinating tribute to the italian bugatti supercar justifiably sits at the top of molsheims celebrated line of heritage-based models, sure to enjoy continued appreciation within the hypercar market.

as the bugatti brand now embarks on a new hybridized v-16 era, limited edition w-16-powered models are spotlighted as the most significant creations of a pivotal era in the 125-year history of the marque. for two decades, the w-16 was at the apex of internal combustion development and remains one of the most complex road car engines ever built.

as clarified by a purchase contract and bugatti specification sheet on file, chassis number 006 was ordered new in august 2019 by a swiss collector. the magnificent centodieci was finished in a two-tone livery of quartz white and grey carbon over an interior trimmed in beluga black and gris rafale leather with black anodised trim parts and glacier door sills.

the bugatti has been ideally maintained and only minimally driven during its sole ownership, displaying an incredibly low 437 kilometres at the time of cataloguing. having enjoyed such little use, it is understandable that the centodieci has never undergone a service appointment, although bidders should note that bugattis four-year manufacturers warranty went into effect upon delivery in september 2022, implying that the car remains eligible for service under warranty until september 2026.

as an extremely rare and distinctively styled speed machine built during molsheims modern era, one that furthermore has accrued only 437 kilometres, this bugatti is undoubtedly one of the most highly desirable luxury/performance cars in todays market. ideally suited for the dedicated marque collector or hypercar completist, the centodieci beautifully evokes one of the marques most celebrated chapters, sure to strike the hearts of enthusiasts far and wide.

baby bugatti, short chassis n°454
the automobile held a special place in the bugatti family. roland, ettore's youngest son, could not be left out. for his fourth birthday in 1926, ettore built him a faithful 1/2 scale replica of the celebrated bugatti 35 grand prix, then at the height of its glory. this would become the famous baby bugatti.

presented on the marque's stand at the milan motor show in 1927, rich and famous clients acquired them for their offspring.
 it was a modest commercial success. less than 500 examples were built as ettore bugatti realised that not all children were comfortable with the 1/2 scale. the chassis was soon lengthened, with 22 louvres on the bonnet in place of 20 on the rare first models like the one on offer today.

this model enjoyed its own catalogue and was displayed at bugatti dealerships alongside its big sisters. often to be spotted at fashionable beaches such as deauville and nice, it gave rise to fiercely contested competitions with its top speeds of 15 to 18 km/h. proud owners included the future kings hassan ii of morocco and baudouin of belgium.

this baby bugatti, chassis n°454, is known as a short chassis (20 bonnet louvres). it features aluminium bodywork and wheels, with a steel chassis. dashboard with bugatti-branded ammeter and gear change lever (forward, neutral and reverse). fitted with a 12-
volt electric engine operated by a rheostat-accelerator, "dunlop cord balloon" tyres on removable spoke wheels. leather bonnet straps, seat and spare wheel strap. boyce motometer type radiator cap and 2-eared petrol cap. brakes on all four wheels operated by external lever. restored in the iconic blue, presented in working condition. it rests on four correctly sized jack stands.

february 12 - 16, 2025 art deco festival napier, new zealand



part of this festival on the southern hemisphere is a series of classic car activities, with bugatti being the featured marque this year.
next month, the hawkes bay vintage car club, in collaboration with the art deco trust, will host the annual art deco rally in napier. this year, the focus falls on bugatti, the french marque being the art deco festivals featured car.

from february 12th to 16th, expect to see a number of bugattis and other cars from the 1920s cruising the streets of napier and the wider hawkes bay region, participating in the various rally events organised by the hawkes bay vintage car club.


the highlight of the weekend will be the gathering of cars on saturday the 15th in front of the napier sound shell. of the 15 known bugattis in new zealand, 12 will be present, including an impressive collection of four type 57 models. 

one of these is a type 57 atlantic recreation. of the four atlantics originally produced, only two are known to survive. tom andrews from the classics museum in hamilton, new zealand, acquired a barn-find type 57 (57579) in france ten years ago. as andrews set about fully restoring the type 57 ventoux, he was inspired to also build a faithful recreation of one of the lost atlantic models too. this recreation will be unveiled to the public on thursday, february 15th, at the masonic hotel on napiers marine parade.

part of the indianapolis motor speedway museums collection since 1960
retains its original chassis frame, engine, and rear axle
a provenance-rich competition bugatti, from 65 years of distinguished ownership
the bugatti type 35

with the bugatti type 35s first appearance at the 1924 french grand prix held at lyon, there was no doubt to anyone who saw the car run that this was an automobile that had it all: durability, mechanical functionality, and a wonderful sporting exterior design. the type 35s best finish for that race was a respectable 7th overall, but it was clear that the car had the potential for greater success following future tuning and refinement. indeed, in its many variations, it would eventually become the most successful racing car, in number of total victories - a record which it still holds today and likely will never lose.

bugattis final iteration of the type 35 would be the type 35tc, or as the model came to be called, the type 35b. this new model, which bore the same 2.3-liter, eight-cylinder motor as the earlier type 35t, was outfitted with a supercharger that was similar to the one in the type 35c, albeit slightly larger and more powerful. in its day, the type 35b boasted incredible performance figures, and these figures are still respectable today. it was capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in just six seconds, and it had a top speed of 125 mph.

the type 35b in the indianapolis motor speedway museums collection, chassis number 4947, was completed in the autumn of 1929. while the american bugatti club register postures that the car was retained and raced by the factory in the european grand prix, there were no significant races on the schedule between the cars completion and its final sale in march 1930 to romanian racing driver georges bouriano. bouriano is best-remembered for his 2nd-place finish in a bugatti type 35c at monaco in 1929, behind only the famous bugatti works driver william charles frederick grover-williams, also known as w williams, in a type 35b. bouriano registered this car, chassis number 4947, on temporary plates 1656-ww5 and drove it away from molsheim.

according to historian pierre-yves laugier, bouriano recounted that his successes in his previously, used type 35 had resulted in ettore bugatti selling me a new car at a very special price. i entered the new 35b in the 1930 monaco race. i slowly gained on chiron and bouriat; we all three arrived at a certain corner. it is characteristic of me that i will not accept to be passed and i came out first, but had hit a sandbag, sand got into the carburetor, and then into the compressor which seized, and i had to abandon [the effort].

his subsequent entries in the car included the bordino grand prix, where the car survived a rather spectacular accident only to be repaired by the factory. it was also run in grand prix races at dieppe and comminges, both in france and important circuits in the early days of motor racing; bouriano retired in both cases, with unspecified mechanical issues and a broken piston ring, respectively.

the last known racing event for 1930 was the bugatti grand prix at le mans. held from 1928 through 1930 at the venue that is famous for its 24-hour endurance race, the bugatti grand prix was an interesting event open to all bugatti owners; although both amateur and professional drivers were eligible to compete, no factory-backed cars were permitted. unfortunately, bouriano retired from the 1930 event with a bent steering arm after hitting an animal on the track.

no records exist of bouriano racing the car in 1931, but in 1932 he returned to chimay, belgium for the grand prix des frontières, held on 15 may on an approximately 6.5-mile street circuit. there, he led the race in the first lap and set a lap record for the circuit at 125 km/h, only to dnf following a carburetor fire.

in 1934, bouriano sold the car to a prolific competitor and three-time winner at chimay, belgian racing driver arthur legat, who upgraded from his prior type 37a. legat dubbed his new bugatti la boule ii and also competed with the car, and with much greater success than its original private owner. legat continued to compete at chimay until 1939, driving chassis 4947 with the exception of 1936, when the event organizer asked him to use his type 37a instead. although outright victory eluded him, he placed 2nd in 1937, 7th in 1938, and 2nd again in the 1939 running of the grand prix des frontières.

yet circuit racing was not the type 35s only strength, and legat also put his la boule ii through its paces at hillclimb events. not long after acquiring the car in 1934, he took 2nd at the hillclimb held at opbrakel in belgium, as well as 1st in both the bomerée and wavre hillclimbs, also in belgium.

during world war ii the car was sold to pierre vingerhoedts of antwerp, who modified it with an aerodynamic body that would be used until 1948. as shown in a photograph taken in 1946, however, this new body was in fact a superficial update of the original molsheim sheet metal, consisting largely of a streamlined radiator surround and a tailfin that was attached to the cars original tail section.

despite vingerhoedts ownership, he continued to allow legat to drive the car in events for at least two years. its first post-war outing was on familiar turf: the grand prix des frontières in chimay, belgium, where legat, and the car, retired during the 10th lap with engine trouble. the car once again retired from the 1947 edition of the race due to drive shaft issues, again with legat driving. that june, chassis 4947 again proved its mettle as a hillclimb contender: vingerhoedts piloted it to victory at the 1 km hillclimb at huy, belgium, at what would be that events final running. it would prove to be chassis 4947s final european race outing, as well.
fearless feltons bugatti

following a crash in 1948, which reportedly occurred during preparations for that years grand prix in chimay, vingerhoedts fitted the bugatti with a modern, maserati-style single-seat racing body. the car was apparently never raced in this configuration, however, and by 1955 vingerhoedts had resold the car to the prolific dutch (belgian, ed.) bugatti dealer jean de dobbeleer. a photo on file shows the car in de dobbeleers garage, wearing this updated bodywork.

de dobbeleer handled an enormous number of cars in the post-war era, dealing many of them to enthusiasts elsewhere in europe and the united states. in this instance, the car was sold to colonel george s. felton. fearless felton was one of the best-known figures in the early automobile hobby on the east coast, famously serving as the first vice-president of the vintage sports car club of america. he had the bugatti restored by another notable participant in the dawn of the hobby, edgar roy of roxbury, massachusetts.

it is presently unknown whether felton received chassis 4947 (which he called it 'decibelle') - from de dobbeleer with the updated monoposto bodywork still fitted, or whether it had been returned to its original configuration prior to its export to the united states. close inspection of the bodywork, including by rm specialists, indicates that the hood, belly pans, and tail sections of the bodywork are original, molsheim-made components, with only the cowl area showing evidence of later fabrication or significant repair.

further, the winter 1956 issue of bugantics includes a photo of chassis 4947, with a caption indicating that the car was then nearing the end of a rebuild and showing the cowl, tail section, and belly pans already fitted to the chassis. the spring 1957 issue shows felton behind the wheel of his completed bugattia relatively rapid restoration timeline that further supports the fitment of original body components with minimal fabrication work.

alas, after racing the bugatti only once, colonel felton passed away suddenly in november 1959. edgar roy sold the car on behalf of the estate to anton "tony" hulman jr. for the indianapolis motor speedway museum, which took receipt in 1960 and has now owned this special automobile for a remarkable 65 years.

inspection of the car today shows that it retains much of the roy restoration, with certain liberties often taken by even the best craftsmen in that early enthusiast era of collecting, including non-original instruments, an ac fuel pump, and a zenith 38u carburetor, likely for durability in racing, just as the hydraulic brakes were fitted for safety, although the latter was done with minimal modification and utilizing the original backing plates and shoes.

yet underneath is an excellent and correct grand prix bugatti, one that retains its original chassis frame, engine, and rear axle, as confirmed by laugier, and, in fact, numbers in nearly all the areas that a bugattiste would seek to find then. the gearbox cover still bears the correct original number markings, although the gearbox itself is believed to be a factory replacement casting. the fuel tank is even the original, and the replacement front axle is an original bugatti piece, albeit from a type 51!

this is an unusually mechanically pure supercharged grand prix bugatti, with, even more remarkably, continuously known history back to its original ownerindeed, it has had only six owners in its nearly century-long lifetime. with its record of european racing both before and after wwii, it contributed to the type 35s immortal motorsport legend, and it has been fittingly preserved on the grounds of one of the worlds great temples of speed, within the indianapolis motor speedway museum, for over six decades.

its offering here marks an exquisite opportunity to acquire a car of character and personality, still very much the automobile that bouriano experienced at speed on some of europes greatest circuits.

september 24 - 29, 2025 crossing the alpes 2.0
 chiemgau, germany




bugatti club deutschland cordially invites to "crossing the alpes 2.0", a logical consequence of the successful prologue "crossing the alpes" at the opening of the international bugatti meeting 2021 in chiemgau and a special experience for ambitious bugatti enthusiasts. 

the chiemgau, the landscape around chiemsee, the largest lake in bavaria, also known as the "bavarian sea" is situated between munich and salzburg. in view of the beautiful mountain scenery of the bavarian alps and our neighboring country austria with its regions tyrol and salzburg, we will take our tours on four riding days - original, rustic, idyllic and with breathtaking views. highlight is the crossing of the alps via the grossglockner high alpine road, probably the most spectacular alpine road in europe, with an overnight stay in the hohe tauern national park. as in 2021, the limitation to 25 teams allows for a family atmosphere in which, in addition to the joy of driving, there is also enough time for an interesting programme of visits, lively communication and the enjoyment of regional specialties in restaurants and inns.
