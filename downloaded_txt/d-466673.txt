the reality is that your favorite hair cut hairstyles might not work for you. besides your face shape, you must consider other important factors such as  type and thickness. styles suited for thick, coarse hair probably won't work for thin hair. if you do a little bit of research before you go for your haircut, you might end up with a more suitable look. some issues can't be solved immediately. however, there are many things that you can do to kick things up a notch.ï¿½you can try out new styling products. maybe deep condition. try a new shampoo.ï¿½add layers.ï¿½add bangs. see  bangs collection get extensions.ï¿½the options are virtually limitless.  photo: eva longoria, glenn harris, pr photos
