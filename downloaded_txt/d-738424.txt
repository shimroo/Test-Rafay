	 shouts & murmurs
	 
    


if you have ever read the new yorker, you are familiar with the shouts & murmurs section, where a writer makes every effort to be clever and, oh so witty, when talking about, seemingly, everyday occurrences, while putting a slightly skewed twist on, say, mixing a gimlet (see this month's edition). well, lately, shouts & murmurs has been a little too cute for my taste and even less clever. it's almost as if the writers are in a constant state of frenzy, worrying that what they are writing is not clever enough for the sophisticated palette of the average reader of the new yorker (or the editor, suppose). it has not been witty or sophisticate, recently. i can see why some might find the witty urbanite insufferable; if you have been reading shouts & murmurs, of late, i would have to agree.labels: random, the new yorker

	 hello
	 
    


wow, it has been too long. i haven't been doing anything too exciting (except a trip to cambridge) and the state of politics has simply been too irritating and maddening to post anything (anytime i read about the state of politics, i just get depressed).  like i said, not much has happened lately.  i did go out to visit my friend mikey and his boyfriend greg in cambridge, ma last week - had a great time!  thanks, guys - you were great hosts!  had a nice lobster and cupcake dinner for my birthday while there-celebrated the big four-o(h).  as is usual, when i got back to the office, i realized how much i really don't like my job, i just don't know what to do about it (damn you economy!!) why do vacations do that?  i guess it's back to investing in the lottery.anyway, drop me a line anytime. email is trynottopanic (at) earthlink-dot-net.labels: random

via joeyes, it has been a long time since i've posted anything. my only excuse is i just haven't had the heart to keep this going. although, the way obama has been slapping the gay community in the face, i may have to start back up.i had such hope for obama on gay rights. truly, the fierce urgency of whenever.labels: barack obama, gay rights

welcome to america under bush/cheney.www.nybooks.com/icrc-report.pdfvia sullivannow why won't congress or the obama administration do something about this blight on america?via greenwald:"note how warped our political culture is: sen. dick durbin was forced to tearfully apologize on the senate floor for accurately comparing our treatment of detainees at guantanamo to the techniques used in soviet gulags and by gestapo interrogation squads, but those who perpetrated these war crimes have apologized for nothing, remain welcome in decent company, and are still shielded by our government from all accountability."labels: america, dick cheney, george bush
