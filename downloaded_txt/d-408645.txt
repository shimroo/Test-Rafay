acrylic paintings by artist joseph lapierre



























april 23, 1945 - august 
    4, 2009 
joe is greatly missed by family and friends since his sudden passing in 2009. 
    treasured memories and paintings continue to give comfort and pleasure to 
    those who knew joe and who own a 'piece of him'. his enthusiasm for life was 
    contagious and his personality manifested itself in both his paintings and 
    relationships, 
    as people who bought his paintings enjoyed the person of joe as much as the 
    artwork that he created for them.
joe's wife and children continue to reproduce joe's artwork in his studio, 
    on both paper and canvas, and participate in selected art festivals 
    where he was a major presence. as remaining originals are made available, 
    the web site will be updated, reconstruction being a process as time 
    passes and decisions are made.
for more information on obtaining prints or paintings, or for sharing a memory 
    of joe with his family, please feel free to contact 
    us.

hi. 
  glad you stopped by!
see where i find my inspiration
here you will find my most recent 
  paintings, and some of my past favorites
  using the palette knife, i create thick textures that catch the light and cast 
  shadows on the painting.
  as light angles change, the piece appears subtly different, creating a
  dynamic work not just a two-dimensional wall hanging.
  you can see my art in person at galleries and major fine art festivals on the 
  east coast of the u.s.
