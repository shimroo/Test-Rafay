victorian rose bridals: how to create a timeless wedding look
hey there, brides-to-be! kristen smith here from victorian rose bridals. let’s chat about creating that timeless wedding look you’ve been dreaming of. first things first: timeless doesn’t mean boring. it’s all about choosing elements that’ll make you swoon now and 20 years from now when you’re flipping through your wedding album.
the importance of timeless style

creating a timeless wedding look means you’ll love your photos for decades to come. your outfits will be elegant, flattering, and simple. future generations will adore looking through your wedding album. remember, classic style never goes out of fashion.
start with the dress
your gown sets the tone for everything else. think classic silhouettes like a-line or ball gown. lace is always a winner – it’s been around for centuries for a reason! avoid trendy details that might date your look. remember, simplicity is key. stick to neutral colors like white or ivory. focus on quality materials and craftsmanship.
groom’s attire
a well-fitted tuxedo or suit is always in vogue. black, navy, or gray are safe bets for a timeless look. encourage your groom to keep accessories simple and classic.
accessorize wisely
less is more when it comes to timeless accessories. a delicate veil or a simple tiara can elevate your look without overwhelming it. pearl earrings or a dainty necklace? perfect. skip the chunky statement pieces – they tend to scream “trend” rather than “timeless.”
makeup and hair
you want to look like yourself, just a bit more polished. stick to neutral tones and focus on enhancing your natural features. a classic red lip can be timeless if it suits your style. avoid heavy contouring or instagram-worthy brows – they’ll date your photos faster than you can say “i do.”
for hairstyles, updos are always elegant. soft waves or a sleek chignon? you can’t go wrong. avoid super trendy cuts or colors. remember, you want to recognize yourself in those photos years down the line!
bouquet basics
stick to classic flowers like roses, peonies, or lilies. white is always timeless, but don’t be afraid of soft, muted colors. avoid overly structured or avant-garde arrangements. a loose, natural-looking bouquet will never go out of style.
venue and decor

choose a venue that has a timeless feel. historic buildings, gardens, or classic ballrooms are great options. avoid venues that are too trendy or theme-specific.
keep your color palette neutral with pops of classic colors. candlelight always adds a timeless romantic glow. opt for simple, elegant centerpieces. avoid overly trendy decor items or diy projects that might look dated later. incorporate vintage touches like antique candelabras or old-fashioned photographs.
photography style
look for a photographer with a classic editing style. avoid heavy filters or overly stylized edits. candid moments and classic poses will always be in style. don’t shy away from candid photos – they capture genuine emotions.
the little things
choose invitations with classic fonts and simple designs. opt for traditional wedding favors or skip them altogether. keep your wedding party attire simple and elegant. consider a getaway car for that classic exit.
custom matching outfits: a modern twist

while not strictly traditional, custom matching outfits can add a personal touch to your wedding. this trend can work for:

the happy couple
bridal party squads
family members who want to show their unity
even guests who want to get in on the fun

if you decide to incorporate this trend, keep it subtle and elegant to maintain a timeless feel. consider matching accessories or small details rather than full outfits.
trending styles

hoodies and sweatshirts: comfy, casual, and perfect for those chilly evening receptions or post-wedding brunches.
embroidered details: names, dates, or cute little designs that make your outfit uniquely yours.
cultural fusion: blending traditional outfits with modern twists for a look that honors heritage and current trends.

think about the weather: hoodies are great, but maybe not for a beach wedding in july.
get creative: mix and match styles for a cohesive but not identical look.

remember, your wedding is about celebrating your love, so have fun with it! whether you go for matching tuxes or custom hoodies, make sure it feels like “you.”
conclusion
creating a timeless wedding look isn’t about following rules – it’s about choosing elements that reflect your personal style while standing the test of time. focus on classic silhouettes, simple elegance, and timeless details. your future self will thank you when you’re still in love with your wedding photos decades from now!
