tips, hints and troubleshooting

if you have trouble setting up or knitting on your ultimate sweater machine, follow the suggestions below. 
troubleshooting




 

setting up your machine:



use the non-skid mat on any flat surface, but be sure not to pull down on the hem as you set up. or, if you want to use the clamps, be sure to use a flat surface with a "true" bottom, similar to a piece of hardwood board. one of the long pre-cut shelves available at hardware stores and home centers is a good choice.  i can't stress enough that it is very very important to have your machine on a perfectly flat surface.be sure not to screw the clamps on too tightly. this could raise the back of the bed and cause the needles to go out of alignment.be sure there are no raised retainer bars across the bed. these are the green bars that hold in the needles. if any are raised slightly you can push them down with your finger or use a small hammer with fabric or rubber as protection to tap them down into place.





do not bear down on the carriage or it could be difficult to knit. just hold down the handle enough to keep the keyplate in place.



usm attributes:

(i made 3).  knit several rows using every needle on the bed, then bring row 1 up and hook it over your last knitted row, forming a hem for the steel rods.  then knit several more rows and bind off and remove from machine.  now when you want to knit, grab one row of stitches above the hem and hook them onto your needles.  i then use ravel cord.  pull down on the hem and you're good to go.deleterepliesreplyunknowndecember 15, 2018 at 9:24 pmi found several things for both my incredible sweater machine and ultimate sweater machine at very reasonable prices on ebay. recently my row counter went on the fritz and i really didn’t think i’d be able to find another one but when i searched ebay there they were. there are several places in the u.s. that still sell accessories for our wonderful machines. if you’re looking for keyplates, hems, carriages, pattern books look there. good luck.deleterepliesreplykriskraftermay 8, 2020 at 6:22 amstainless steel cast-on combs are now available for bond usm and other 8mm knitting machines.  see them here: https://www.kriskrafter.com/product-page/ultimate-sweater-machine-cast-on-combsdeleterepliesreplygrannymay 17, 2020 at 12:07 pmhey kris, make a 70 needle cast on comb, too! please, most of my project fall between 60-70 needles.deleterepliesreplykriskrafterjune 12, 2020 at 5:45 amgranny, i have a 30 st comb coming out any day now (at the polisher as i write this).  with one of the 50 st combined with the new shorter one you'd have 80 sts.  or some may want 2 of the "minis" so joined would have a 50 st.  etc...deleterepliesreplyreplycreations by foxfiredecember 11, 2018 at 2:19 pmi purchased a used incredible sweater machine - looking parts, dvd instructions, etc., can only find for ultimate sweater machine. can anyone help? thank you in advance.replydeleterepliespetunia mae witherbottomdecember 14, 2018 at 5:04 pmi have a usm and an ism. the keyplates for both are interchangeable. the only difference in the carriages for both are the ism has a yarn guard in the front and the usm doesn't. i prefer the ism carriage. everything else that comes with the usm and the ism is the same, i believe. the pattern book is just a bit different.deleterepliesreplycreations by foxfiredecember 21, 2018 at 11:14 amthank you!deleterepliesreplyunknownfebruary 15, 2019 at 10:18 amwatch youtube. that's how i'm learning how to use it.  i also need parts.  a.m. trying to find parts without having to buy another one. deleterepliesreplyreplydebbiedecember 18, 2018 at 8:13 amdo you know where i can buy the ribber for the machinereplydeleterepliespetunia mae witherbottomdecember 31, 2018 at 6:25 pmdebbie, i've heard they are extremely rare to find now.  i've been googling everything bond for about 5 yrs and have never seen one for sale.deleterepliesreplynevilleseptember 26, 2023 at 2:56 pmforget such thing for this machine.  i believe it was rubbish.  you must try hand knitting.  try garter st - if you don't like ribs.deleterepliesreplyreplyunknownjanuary 22, 2019 at 1:01 pmi just saw a bunch of listings on ebay...don't know if that helpreplydeleterepliesreplyunknownjanuary 22, 2019 at 1:18 pmi  recently acquired the incredible sweater machine, only problem is it didn't come with instructions booklet. any ideas where i may find onereplydeleterepliespetunia mae witherbottomjanuary 29, 2019 at 5:35 amyoutube is your best bet for learning.  diana (dianna?) sullivan has the best ones for learning your machine.  also on youtube "meet your bond".deleterepliesreplygrannymarch 6, 2019 at 9:45 amhttp://machineknittingetc.com/catalogsearch/result/?order=date&dir=desc&q=bonddeleterepliesreplyreplyunknownjanuary 24, 2019 at 12:13 amhi, i bought an ultimate sweater machine -second hand- and the green and yellow cards are missing. is it possible someone to give me the dimensions of them?replydeleterepliesreplysewnpaxjanuary 31, 2019 at 4:32 pmmachine came with (i think-..that's what i currently have) -(1) yellow card @ 2x8 in.

(i'm guessing.)  everything else that comes with it is the very same as the ultimate sweater machine.  this means that you can purchase regular knitting (bond ultimate sweater machine and bond incredible sweater machine) keyplates and they will fit in your carriage.  the usm keyplates are green and the ism keyplates are clear.  both will work for you.  the clear ones give you some half sizes.if your yellow keyplate is intarsia you can search youtube, etc. for bond intarsia how-to's.on the underside of your keyplate if there's a spring there it would be the intarsia keyplate.replydeletereplieselaphaeseptember 18, 2019 at 2:48 pmvery helpful - thanks.deleterepliesreplyreplypetunia mae witherbottomjuly 19, 2019 at 3:52 pmi should have added...intarsia is for pattern knitting with more that one color.  replydeletereplieselaphaeseptember 18, 2019 at 2:46 pmthanks just the information i needed.deleterepliesreplyreplycraziquilter9september 16, 2019 at 11:04 amhi  i picked up a bond knitting machine at the thrift store. i have made about 10 items on it. i have recently noticed that the hem plastic is tearing from stress. where could i find a new one or used one to replace it. replydeleterepliespetunia mae witherbottomseptember 16, 2019 at 12:10 pmhi, craziquilter.  you can find one on ebay, but you can make one yourself...i have made 2 so far and love them better.  youtube search "cast on rag" or "make your own cast on rag".  if you can't find what i'm talking about, post again and i'll go find the videos. - petdeleterepliesreplykriskraftermay 8, 2020 at 6:24 amstainless steel cast-on combs are now available for bond usm and other 8mm knitting machines.  see them here: https://www.kriskrafter.com/product-page/ultimate-sweater-machine-cast-on-combsdeleterepliesreplyterryddecember 3, 2020 at 11:34 pmordered!  exciteddeleterepliesreplyreplycraziquilter9september 16, 2019 at 3:23 pmthank you . i will try that this weekend. saved me at least 20$. they  want a mint because they are vintage. lol thanks again.replydeleterepliespetunia mae witherbottomseptember 16, 2019 at 3:46 pmi'm happy to help. deleterepliesreplyreplyanitajanuary 12, 2020 at 12:44 pmwhat are the dimensions of the yellow card. i think i can make one out of mat card stock. thanksreplydeleterepliespetunia mae witherbottomjanuary 12, 2020 at 4:39 pmfrom an earlier post:sewnpaxjanuary 31, 2019 at 3:32 pmmachine came with (i think-..that's what i currently have) -(1) yellow card @ 2x8 in.
