who said that






"if you’re looking to government to solve your problems, you’re going to be disappointed." 

wichita mayor lily wu. wu leans libertarian and notes that there are always going to be more demands on government than it can provide. with her city facing a structural deficit, wu says the city must prioritize its most urgent needs before it can consider funding programs that would be nice but not necessary to have. (governing feb. 18, 2025)
