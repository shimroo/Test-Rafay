do i need an injury lawyer?after an accident it can be easy to think that an insurance company will come through for you, but this is rarely the case. contrary to what they promise, insurance companies are usually on their own side instead of yours. at heart, insurance companies are a business first and foremost. this means they often care more about their bottom line than ensuring you get the proper compensation you deserve after an accident. a skilled personal injury attorney can you recover the compensation you deserve. additionally, a lawyer can:navigate you through the legal process to ensure all the correct procedures are followedthoroughly investigate your claim so no pertinent information is losthelp determine who is liable for your injuriesgather evidence when relevant to support your claimnegotiate with the insurance companies on your behalflitigate the claim, from complaint to jury verdictunlike insurance companies, levinson axelrod, p.a will act as true advocates on your side. we are committed to working for your best interest every step of the claims process, and we always fight for maximum compensation. our firm knows that after suffering a serious injury, recovering proper compensation is a big step in getting your life back on track. not only is our experienced firm committed to you, but we have also recovered over $1 billion and have been ranked by u.s. news on their “best law firms” list.






what should i do after i have been injured?



while every personal injury case is unique, there are certain factors that remain consistent. for example, you should always make sure to see a medical professional (preferably a different one in cases of medical negligence) to get the care and treatment you need. after that, make sure you record and document everything as best as possible. were you hurt in a car accident? take pictures of the scene of the collision and get the contact information of witnesses. was your loved one neglected in a nursing home? request the reports regarding their care so that you can keep a record of them. were you hurt on the job? report it to your employer as soon as possible to protect the validity of your claim. keeping track of important information related to your case and making sure you see a doctor can all be crucial in ensuring you can bring a valid claim forward in the future. most importantly, you should discuss your case with a nj personal injury attorney if you think your injuries were caused by negligence or malicious actions.



how do personal injury attorneys charge?



the supreme court of new jersey has set a fee schedule for attorneys who represent clients with personal injury cases. the fee is contingent upon winning the case through settlement or jury verdict. therefore, if the case is unsuccessful, there is no fee. if the case is successful, the attorney will charge a 33% fee after deducting litigation expenses from the settlement amount. fees for infants and incompetents are generally 25%, not 33%.



how do i decide which lawyer i should hire?



personal injury litigation is complicated. you should look for a personal injury lawyer who has been certified by the supreme court of the state of new jersey as a certified civil trial attorney. levinson axelrod, p.a. is fortunate to have a certified civil trial attorney at each of our eight neighborhood offices.



can you tell me how much is my case worth?



since all personal injury cases are different, telling you the exact worth of your case is nearly impossible. you should be very wary if a legal professional guarantees you any specific amount of compensation prior to accepting your case. at our firm, we look at a number of different factors to provide you with an idea of the potential value of your case. these include the amount of medical expenses caused by the defendant's actions, pain and suffering, lost wages and earning potential, the cost of any future medical or related expenses, loss of consortium, an even punitive damages in extreme cases. while we cannot give you a specific dollar amount, we can give you an estimate of what your case could possibly be worth if it were to go to trial or be settled out of court. at the end of the day, the final amount will have to be decided by a jury or through a settlement.



how do i find out if i have a case?



all you have to do is call us at one of our eight neighborhood offices and speak with one of our nj personal injury attorneys. if you would rather come to the office, just call and make an appointment. of course, the consultation is free. if you would rather not speak to an attorney initially, you have the option of filling out a form for a free consultation. it is always best to contact us as soon as you can so we can start an investigation.



how can a nj personal injury lawyer help me?



a personal injury is an injury to you—and it can happen in a hundred different ways. a nj personal injury lawyer will help explain what your rights are and help you to handle lost wages, medical bills, and, of course, the claim against the person who caused your injury. call us directly at one of our eight convenient neighborhood offices or make an appointment for a free consultation. we are here to help you however we can.















making a claim is easyproving it is what takes skill & experiencevictims injured by negligence have the right to seek a financial recovery by bringing a personal injury claim against at-fault parties. while the right to compensation is critical to helping victims recover for their pain and suffering, medical bills, and other losses, there is no guarantee compensation will be awarded or that victims will receive the recovery they deserve.because insurance companies are corporations that value profits more than people, prevailing in a claim demands the skill, insight, and experience of proven advocates.our new jersey injury attorneys have litigated against some of the nation’s largest insurers and have been recognized for their success by the best lawyers in america, super lawyers, and other leading legal organizations.at levinson axelrod, p.a., we are trusted by clients and colleagues across new jersey because we have the tools to help victims:investigate and consult experts to build the strongest possible case.communicate with insurers while working to negotiate fair settlements.take cases to trial if defendants refuse to pay victims what they deserve.



by leveraging the insight and expertise of our new jersey personal injury lawyers, we have recovered more than $350 million in compensation in the last 5 years and have secured settlements and verdicts routinely named among the new jersey law journal’s annual new jersey top verdicts & settlements list. this includes three of the top 50 verdicts in the state in 2019.when to contact a personal injury lawyercontacting a personal injury lawyer is advisable in various situations where you or a loved one has suffered harm due to someone else's negligence or intentional actions. personal injury lawyers specialize in helping individuals seek compensation for their injuries and losses. here are some common scenarios in which you should consider reaching out to a personal injury lawyer:car accidents: if you've been injured in a car accident, especially if the accident was not your fault, it's a good idea to consult with a personal injury lawyer. they can help you navigate insurance claims and pursue compensation for medical bills, property damage, and other losses.slip and fall accidents: if you slip and fall on someone else's property due to their negligence (e.g., slippery floors, inadequate maintenance), a personal injury lawyer can help you seek compensation for your injuries.medical malpractice: if you believe you've been a victim of medical malpractice, such as a surgical error or misdiagnosis, consult a personal injury lawyer. these cases can be complex, and a lawyer can help you gather evidence and pursue a claim against healthcare providers.product liability: if you've been injured by a defective product, whether it's a faulty car part, a dangerous medication, or a defective appliance, a personal injury lawyer can assist you in holding the manufacturer or distributor accountable.workplace injuries: if you're injured on the job, you may be eligible for workers' compensation benefits. a personal injury lawyer can help you navigate the workers' compensation system and, in some cases, explore third-party liability claims if someone other than your employer contributed to your injury.dog bites: if you're bitten or attacked by someone else's dog, a personal injury lawyer can help you pursue compensation from the dog owner's insurance or through a personal injury lawsuit.nursing home abuse: if you suspect a loved one is experiencing neglect or abuse in a nursing home or assisted living facility, a personal injury lawyer can help you protect their rights and pursue legal action against the responsible parties.wrongful death: if a family member has died as a result of someone else's negligence or misconduct, you may have a wrongful death claim. a personal injury lawyer can help you seek compensation for the loss of your loved one.catastrophic injuries: if you or a loved one has suffered a severe or life-altering injury, such as a traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury, it's crucial to consult with a personal injury lawyer to ensure you receive the compensation needed to cover long-term medical expenses and rehabilitation.in these situations, it's essential to contact a personal injury lawyer as soon as possible, since the statutes of limitations limits the time you have to file a claim. personal injury attorneys can provide you with legal advice, help you gather evidence, negotiate with insurance companies, and, if necessary, represent you in court to seek the compensation you deserve for your injuries and losses.
