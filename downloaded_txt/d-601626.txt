just did a collab w/mishka (nyc), here's what they said about in on their blog:we will be embarking on a taiwan only series of tees based around the my pal the crook character. we did one about a year ago for taiwan and now we’re going to start doing them regularly. they really love the crook out in taiwan who i think they refer to as “robbin”!the first t-shirt features mca of evil design’s take on the crook and also features plusupreme’s rather odd bird character along with him! the shirt will come in white, red & black and will be a taiwan exclusive item! this is the first in what will be an ongoing series of my pal the crook tees featuring various artists (including myself) for taiwan.this is becoming a busy year for the crook who will also be making an appearence in kid robot’s series 3 dunnys which will drop in a matter of weeks! check out:http://www.mishkanyc.comwww.slamxhype.com/index.php?cat=7
