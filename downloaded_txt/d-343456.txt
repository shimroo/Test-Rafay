get to know us
alabama symphony orchestra
the alabama symphony orchestra is a full-time orchestra, passionately pushing the boundaries of music through concert, education, and creativity. the aso began with the first performance by a group of volunteer musicians in 1921. that group would evolve from a volunteer ensemble to become the state’s only full-time professional orchestra.

education
aso education programming
the alabama symphony orchestra entertains, educates and inspires students in schools, concert halls, and public venues throughout the state. for many in our educational programs, the performance marks the first time they have heard a live symphony orchestra. and it is something they remember for the rest of their lives.
