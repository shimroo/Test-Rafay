				singleton marine reviews				






what our customers say 






 




									i recently bought a used regal from singleton marine and worked with craig degarmo as my sales rep. the entire team was super helpful, knowledgeable, and professional throughout the entire process. i would highly recommend visiting singleton atlanta if you are in the market for a new or used boat.								











andrew gibson 









									i can’t say enough good things about the guys down at singleton. from start to finish our experience with jamie was excellent. if you are in the market for a boat, ask for jamie. he is very knowledgeable and helped us make a great decision of purchasing a malibu.								











madison brooks 









									being new to boating we had a great experience at singleton.  austin gave great service and was easy to work with.  we love our regal ls6!								











eric tompkins 









									i highly recommend singleton marine for their outstanding customer care, expertise, and dedication to making boat-buying a memorable and enjoyable experience. thank you, austin, hutton, jeremy, eric, and the entire team!								











derek basaric 









									fantastic experience! jamie eichler was our salesman and did a wonderful job helping us build a brand new 2023 cobalt r8 surf! he walked alongside us through the build, purchase & delivery. 100% you should use this guy for your next boat purchase!!
