being a hospital social worker, i see how differently adoption professionals approach their clients. if i were adopting or placing, i would want abrazo to be my agency. they’re compassionate, professional, and ethical beyond reproach. i recommend them whenever possible, and this is why.

after countless failed infertility treatments, finding abrazo was like an answer to prayer. the staff is the best, and their approach to open adoption really is the only way to go. our baby girl is beautiful, her birthfamily is so special to us– and so is abrazo. 
– mark & stacy, houston, texas








my daughter put her kids up for adoption through abrazo. i didn’t agree at first. but open adoption has been so good for my grandkids, their adoptive parents and my daughter. we are so grateful for abrazo. this agency changes lives.
– frank m., harlingen, texas
