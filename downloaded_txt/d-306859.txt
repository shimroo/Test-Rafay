black lives matter.








pcrid stands with the black community and others around the world with a commitment to end racism, violence, and injustice. we acknowledge the horrific events which have led to the outrage being expressed all around the u.s. and the world in response to a long history of not being listened to and actions not being taken to end police brutality and systemic oppression.
we pcrid acknowledge that power and privilege, together with explicit and implicit biases have resulted in inequities in the field of sign language interpreting. we acknowledge the impact to black interpreters and to the black deaf community and stand with you— our community, colleagues, friends, and fellow humans— being a relentless demand that black voices are heard, and black lives are held vital.
