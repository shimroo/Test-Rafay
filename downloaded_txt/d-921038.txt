sandy hook tradegy





on everyone's mind is the sandy hook elementary school  tragedy. i mourn for all those affected by this horror. we must be careful here to not think solely with our emotions, but use our logic also. i do not believe the answer is restricting our constitutional right to bear arms. (certainly i agree mentally unstable people shouldn't have firearms) my view is that firearms are a tool that can be used for good or evil. firearms can protect innocent lives and disarming law abiding citizens will not stop criminals. criminals do not obey laws, that is why they are called criminals. in fact, it will only add to the tragedy by limiting the law abiding individual the ability to defend themselves. cars and alcohol killed more people in 2011 than firearms did, yet we are not talking about banning them. where does this kind of thinking stop? the argument may be that we do not need certain guns, but do we need freedom of speech, assembly, or the ability to have our grievances readdressed? no, but these are rights granted by our founding fathers that should be upheld for what they stand for: freedom.

evolution





evolution
(in this pamphlet we will deal with macro evolution not microevolution. macroevolution is one type of organism becoming another, ie ape becoming a man. microevolution has been observed and is true, ie a wolf becoming a dog, but it’s still of the canis genus. it’s still the same kind of animal)

evolution is part of observational science, which is a branch that deals with ideas that we cannot create a repeatable experiment for. no one has ever observed it working or not working. it’s little more than a creation myth.

evidence against evolution is intentionally being repressed.

evolution is not a fact; science does not consist of facts, but theories.” it is not part of science and the evolutionists defend their view with religious fervor and zeal. if it was real science it would be open to all observations.” kent hovind

the fossil record is not proof of evolution. we have never found an authentic missing link. all so called missing links were deliberate frauds or proved to be something else. we have never found any transitional species either.

the only place a complete geological column exists is in your textbook. there is no place on earth where we can find every rock layer in a continuous sequence.

"if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down."--charles darwin, origin of species

all creationists are not stupid nor are they anti science.
many scientists have believed in god: bacon(scientific method), einstein , copernicus, kepler, galileo, descartes, pascal, newton, boyle, faraday, mendel, kelvin,  planck  and there are  many more!

carbon dating is based on several assumptions: 
1. the initial conditions of the rock sample are accurately known.
2. the amount of parent or daughter elements in a sample has not been altered by processes other than radioactive decay.
3. the decay rate (or half-life) of the parent isotope has remained constant since the rock was formed.


for an elaboration of these arguments explore the resources.

bible quotes

genesis 1:1 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth.

john 1:3 through him[jesus] all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.

psalm 14:1 the fool hath said in his heart, there is no god…

job 38:4 "where were you when i laid the earth's foundation? tell me, if you understand. 5 who marked off its dimensions? surely you know! who stretched a measuring line across it?

romans 1:20   for since the creation of the world god’s invisible qualities— his eternal power and divine nature— have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. because, although they knew god, they did not glorify him as god, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible god into an image made like corruptible man-- and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.

2 peter 3:3   knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, 4 and saying, where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation.5 for this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of god the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:

revelations 1:8 "i am the alpha and the omega," says the lord god, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the almighty."

resources

john 8:32   and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
matthew 7:8   for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

paul scores sought after endorsment in south carolina





paul scores sought-after endorsement in south carolina
posted by
cnn political reporter shannon travis
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/15/paul-scores-sought-after-endorsement-in-south-carolina/


myrtle beach, south carolina (cnn) – six days before south carolina's presidential primary, ron paul scored one of the most sought-after political blessings in the state.

on sunday, state sen. tom davis endorsed the texas congressman in myrtle beach. davis is a rising star in republican circles and a highly regarded fiscal conservative who holds sway over many tea party activists.

tune in thursday at 8 p.m. et for the cnn/southern republican presidential debate hosted by john king and follow it on twitter at #cnndebate. for real-time coverage of the south carolina primary, go to cnnpolitics.com and on the cnn apps for iphone, ipad, android or other phones.

- follow the ticker on twitter: @politicalticker

paul himself told cnn the nod would bring "a lot of attention for me."

in a packed hotel conference room at a paul campaign event, davis stepped onto a stage in front of a few hundred paul loyalists and explained why he would support paul over his rivals in the gop presidential race.

"one of the nice things about being in south carolina every four years is you get to meet candidates first hand. and i've had that chance," davis said.

the state senator called former utah gov. jon huntsman "a fine man" and was equally kind to former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum, former house speaker newt gingrich and texas gov. rick perry.

"at the end of the day, when i sat down, i realized there were a lot of good people running for this race," davis said. "but there's only one person, there's only one person speaking to what i believe is the core problem of our country today. the biggest threat to our liberty comes from debt."

"there is only one candidate that is talking about this problem to the degree, at the scale and with the scope that it needs to be talked about. you can't nibble around the edges anymore."

davis' endorsement of paul could help the texas congressman ahead of south carolina's first-in-the-south presidential primary on january 21. a recent american research group survey in the state shows a tight race between former massachusetts gov. mitt romney, gingrich and paul.

yet davis' endorsement also highlights a problem seen among republicans nationwide: like-minded conservatives are unable to coalesce around one candidate.

among the state's republican leaders, gov. nikki haley has endorsed romney, popular state conservative rep. mick mulvaney has backed perry, and rep. joe wilson previously backed former minnesota gov. tim pawlenty, who dropped out of the race after a disappointing finish in the ames straw poll in iowa last summer.

senators jim demint and lindsey graham and popular tea party figure rep. tim scott have not endorsed a candidate.

after speaking at the event himself, cnn asked paul why the davis endorsement mattered.

"well because he's very popular. and he's going to get a lot of support and he's going to get a lot of attention for me," paul said. "and he's a believer."

why is porn bad?





why is porn bad?by conandate: 11/1/11philippians 4:8 finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. ephesians 6:12 for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------why is porn bad?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------sinful ingredients:  1. addiction1 peter 2:11 beloved, i urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.1 corinthians 6:12 “all things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “all things are lawful for me,” but i will not be enslaved by anything. porn more addictive than cocaine:http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/11/657722. immoral situations, against natureleviticus 18:22 you shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. romans 1:26-27  for this reason god gave them up to dishonorable passions. for their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. hebrews 13:4 let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for god will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.galatians 5:21 envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. i warn you, as i warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of god. ---by watching these things its like approving these actions, even if you may not agree with them. the money that website got from you paying for it, or for clicking a link to it is financially supporting immoral behavior.3. toleranceinternet pornography destroying men's ability to perform with real women, finds study.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2051902/men-use-internet-porn-likely-hopeless-bedroom.htmlneed increasingly more extreme stimulus to get same high, like drugs. first it was pictures, then softcore, then hardcore, then lesbian, then multiple windows with 10 movies going at once, whats next?4. waste of timethat could be spent doing god's will, reading the bible, spending time with family, etc5. separation from godisaiah 59:2 (niv)  but your iniquities have separated you from your god; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear. jeremiah 5:25 (kjv)  your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you.6. guilt/shame2 timothy 2:15 do your best to present yourself to god as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. romans 2:15 they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the holy spirit of god, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemptionrom 14:23  and he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. 7. money to support evil deedsif you just click on an ad/link you give them money. supports sexual exploitation just research the porn industry and tell me if its a business of virtue and wholesomeness.http://blog.beliefnet.com/roddreher/2010/03/finding-humanity-amid-pornographys-evil.htmlhttp://www.thebody.com/content/art28971.htmlhttp://www.porn-free.org/destruction_testimonials.htm8. selfishmar 12:31  the second is this: 'love your neighbor as yourself.' there is no commandment greater than these.romans 13:10 love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. ---it can and does destroyed marriages, relationships, etc.9. looking1 john 2:16 for all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the father but is from the world. matthew 5:28 but i say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. matthew 5:29-30 if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. for it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. and if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. for it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell. job 31:1   i made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should i think upon a maid?proverbs 6:25-28  lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? matthew 6:21-23 for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. “the eye is the lamp of the body. so, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. if then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!psalm 101:3 i will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless. i hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me. 10. temptationmatthew 6:13 and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. proverbs 7:25-27 do not let your heart turn aside to her ways. do not stray into her paths; for she has cast down many wounded, and all who were slain by her were strong men. her house is the way to hell, descending to the chambers of death.11. idolatry colossians 3:5 put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. 12. nakedness1 timothy 2:9  likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, exodus 20:26  and you shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not exposed on it.’ 13. do everything in faithcolossians 3:17 and whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the lord jesus, giving thanks to god the father through him. rom 14:23  and he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. 14. sinning against god's temple/your body1 corinthians 6:18-20 flee from sexual immorality. every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. or do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit within you, whom you have from god? you are not your own, for you were bought with a price. so glorify god in your body. genesis 1:27 so god created man in his own image, in the image of god he created him; male and female he created them.pro 6:32 [but] whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he [that] doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 15. impurephilippians 4:8 finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure,whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. 16. stumbling block to others, poor witnessromans 14:21 it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble. mark 9:42 “whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.17. promotes lying, hiding, done in the darkproverbs 28:13 whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.job 31:33 if i have concealed my sin as men do, by hiding my guilt in my heartluk 8:17 for there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.(would you want your mom, dad, grandmother, grandfather, and pastor to know what you have watched? how about god?)psalm 101:7 no one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes.romans 13:13-14 let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. but put on the lord jesus christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires. 18. serving the fleshgalatians 5:13 for you were called to freedom, brothers. only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.conclusion: porn is bad because of many reasons. satan is the lord of lies and wants you to believe that porn is permissable and good. he twists scripture and since we are all evil and want to believe him so that we can carry out our earthly lusts, we fall into the trap of believing a lie. trust the scripture and that it is the truth. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  how to fight the devil-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------galatians 5:19-21 now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity,strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. i warn you, as i warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of god. psalm 50:15  and call upon me in the day of trouble; i will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.matthew 24:44  therefore you also must be ready, for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.(would you feel good if jesus came back and you were wacking off to some perverted hardcore lesbian/gay orgy pornography???)1 peter 5:8 be sober-minded; be watchful. your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.james 4:7 submit yourselves therefore to god. resist the devil, and he will flee from you.romans 6:6-7 we know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so thatwe would no longer be enslaved to sin. for one who has died has been set free from sin. romans 8:5-6 for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit. for to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the spirit is life and peace. 1 corinthians 2:14 the natural person does not accept the things of the spirit of god, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.1 corinthians 10:13 no temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. god is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. galatians 5:16 walk in the spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. galatians 6:7 do not be deceived, god is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that will he reap.hebrews 13:4 let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for god will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous. 2 timothy 2:22 flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the lord out of a pure heart. jude 1:7 just as sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.jude 1:24 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, james 1:12-15 blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the lord hath promised to them that love him. let no man say when he is tempted, i am tempted of god: for god cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. ---  i have struggled with porn since i was about ten. the only way to have victory is of course to be born again, but a born again can still struggle. so we must believe in the power of the word to have victory. my next post will show you how to put on the armor of god and wield the sword of the spirit to defeat satan. as laid out in the scriptures!

we must not divide israel!





the palestinians want to unilaterally declare a state for themselves. they of course want to have some of israel for themselves. well this land was gifted to the jews by god in antiquity forever. however, it is predicted in the bible that this will happen and that the nations who divide his land are going to be judged!http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7254434.stm    "for behold, in those days and at that time when i shall reverse the captivity and restore the fortunes of judah and jerusalem, i will gather all nations and will bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat, and there will i deal with and execute judgment upon them for their treatment of my people and of my heritage israel, whom they have scattered among the nations and because they have divided my land." [joel 3:1-2; parallel bible, kjv/amplified bible commentary]lets hope we are not on the wrong side of the judgment! repent and believe!
