daniel schmitt & company is dedicated to providing our clients with the best possible classic, vintage and investment cars available in the world. for over 50 years, our family-owned and operated classic car dealership has offered classic car enthusiasts truly unique and beautiful cars. as our online reviews will attest, daniel schmitt & co. focuses on providing a world-class shopping experience, thorough descriptions and detailed images – an absolute must in the digital age when many classic and investment cars are sold online. while many of our clients buy our cars for sale online, we welcome you to visit our four-acre showroom, conveniently located near to the st. louis lambert international airport, just minutes away from downtown saint louis, missouri.
 
in our inventory, you can find a wide array of american classics, muscle cars, pre and post war cars and pony cars which include chevrolet, ford, pontiac, oldsmobile, packard, mercury, amc, kaiser, cadillac, lincoln, chrysler, hudson, gmc, dodge, buick, zimmer, excalibur, edsel, stutz, nash-healey and more. we also carry numerous import and exotic makes including porsche, mercedes-benz, aston martin, bentley, volkswagen, alfa romeo, austin-healey, mg, detomaso, facel vega, lotus, lamborghini, jensen, ferrari, rolls-royce, bmw, maserati, jaguar, triumph models as well.
 
we know that classic car financing can pose a unique challenge. although premium collector cars can be an excellent investment, some financial institutions attempt to apply standard “used car” rules for financing a classic car, which can make getting approved for a loan difficult. daniel schmitt & co. has developed relationships with financial institutions that recognize the collector value of classic cars and view them as an investment, which allows us to help you get the financing you need to get the car you are dreaming of. take a look at our inventory and find the classic car you have been searching for. if you have any questions or would like to arrange a showing, don’t hesitate to call one of our consultants at (314) 291-7000.





have you ever laid eyes on elvis presley’s 24-karat gold dream cadillac? have you ever seen jean harlow’s 1931 green cadillac roadster? how about the 1928 phantom i rolls royce springfield st. martin brewster town car that was featured in many movies, including the cotton club and the april fools?
 
the stories and details behind the cars in cars of stars will draw you in and make you want to keep reading. cars of stars honors a vast array of collector cars with more than just photos – each has a unique story of famous provenance and a special twist that only the author and world-renowned car collector himself, daniel j. schmitt, can claim.
 
from his st. louis and beverly hills dealerships, his father, charles schmitt, sold many of these cars to famous icons like cary grant, eva gabor, the rat pack, jack lemmon, fred astaire, and howard hughes, and many were in movies and tv programs like i dream of jeannie, the mod squad, and the movie, arthur.
 
all cars included in the book feature photos; some even have the original bill of sale signed by their famous owners. there are interesting car and celebrity facts, historical stories, and personal accounts of why daniel wanted these particular cars and how he came to own them. click here for more information.
