den of spies : reagan, carter, and the secret history of the treason that stole the white house


argo meets spotlight, as journalist craig unger, new york times bestselling author of american kompromatand house of bush, house of saud, reveals his thirty-year investigation into the secret collusion between ronald reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and iran, raising urgent questions about what happens when foreign meddling in our elections goes unpunished and what gets remembered when the political price for treason is victory. it was a tinderbox of an accusation. in april 1991, the new york times ran an op-ed alleging that ronald reagan's 1980 presidential campaign had conspired with the iranian government to delay the release of 52 american hostages until after the 1980 election. the iranian hostage crisis was president jimmy carter's largest political vulnerability, and his lack of success freeing them ultimately sealed his fate at the ballot box. in return for keeping americans in captivity until reagan assumed the oath of office, the republicans had secretly funneled arms to iran. treasonous and illegal, the operation-planned and executed by reagan's campaign manager bill casey-amounted to a shadow foreign policy run by private citizens that ensured reagan's victory."-- provided by publisher.











pickleballers


meg bloomberg is in a pickle. when meg's ex turns out to be a total dink, her bestie suggests a mood-lifting pickleball excursion to bainbridge island. it's supposed to be an easy lob, a way to heal--not the opening serve to a new courtside romance that's doomed to spin out. but no matter how meg tries, she can't shake her feelings for ethan fine. a charismatic environmental consultant and bainbridge local, ethan is eager to play with her on--and off--the court. but when meg discovers that ethan's pickleball promises are not the real dill, she decides the match is over. it's time for meg to take control of her own game. and maybe, just maybe... love will bounce back. 











other side of tomorrow

the starlets


the tension on the set of a big-budget epic turns deadly when two rival starlets discover that members of the crew are using the production as a front for something decidedly illegal and that they are willing to kill to keep their dealings under wraps. when the two women find themselves on the run, they are forced to figure out how to work together in order to save the day, the film, and maybe even each other. -- adapted from back cover.











wake up and open your eyes


"when noah's aging parents stop returning his calls, he travels to their virginia home and finds it in shambles. they have been violently possessed via the media they watch-and much of the country is succumbing, too. with his nephew-also unaffected-noah tries to return home to safety"-- provided by publisher.











american martyr in persia : the epic life and tragic death of howard baskerville


"as a student of woodrow wilson at princeton, howard baskerville was aflame not only with the gospel of jesus, but with the wilsonian gospel that constitutional democracy is the birthright of all nations. rather than become a small-town minister like his father in south dakota, he volunteered for missionary service in persia. tabriz in 1907 was a hotbed of democratic revolution. brilliant young firebrands were among baskerville's students at the presbyterian school-and became his devoted friends. he lectured on freedom; they dedicated their lives to it. soon he would join them on the battlefield. was howard baskerville the "american lafayette" of iran, or a naïve "white savior" stumbling into persian affairs? baskerville's story, like his life, is at the center of a whirlwind, in which americans must ask themselves, how seriously do we take our ideals of constitutional democracy and whose freedom do we support?"-- provided by publisher.

the ribbon skirt


"ten-year-old anang wants to make a ribbon skirt, a piece of clothing typically worn by women in the anishinaabe tradition, for an upcoming powwow. anang is two-spirit and nonbinary and doesn't know what others will think of them wearing a ribbon skirt, but they're determined to follow their heart's desire. anang sets off to gather the materials needed to make the skirt and turns to those around them - their family, their human and turtle friends, the crows, and even the lake itself - for help. and maybe they'll even find a new confidence within themself along the way."--provided by publisher.











didion & babitz


"journalist lili anolik uses babitz-babitz's brilliance of observation, babitz's incisive intelligence, and, most of all, babitz's diary-like letters-as the key to unlocking the mighty and mysterious didion"-- provided by publisher.











the queen's cook


"after gaining a position in queen esther's kitchens, roxannah discovers her dream job is fraught with palace intrigue. she must partner with adin, the jewish royal physician never far from her thoughts, in a race to save the life of a princess . . . despite the secrets their mission might uncover"-- provided by publisher.











opus : the cult of dark money, human trafficking, and right-wing conspiracy inside the catholic church


"for over half a century, banco popular was one of the most profitable banks in the world--until one day, in 2017, when the spanish bank suddenly collapsed overnight. when investigative journalist gareth gore was dispatched to report on the story, he expected to find yet another case of unbridled capitalist ambition gone wrong. instead, he uncovered decades of deception that hid one of the most brazen cases of corporate pillaging in history, perpetrated by a group of men sworn to celibacy and self-flagellation who had secretly controlled popular and abused their positions there to help spread opus dei to every corner of the world. drawing on unparalleled access to bank records, insider accounts, and exclusive interviews with whistle-blowers from within opus dei, gore reveals how money from the bank was used to lure unsuspecting recruits--some of them only children--into a life of servitude. he also tracks the ascent of opus dei within the united states, exposing its role in bankrolling many right-wing causes, including the supreme court's overturning of roe v. wade."-- amazon.com.

"after losing both their parents, bristol keats and her sisters struggle to stay afloat. when bristol begins to receive letters from an "aunt" she's never heard of who promises she can help, she discovers that everything she thought she knew about her family is a lie. desperate to save her father and find the truth, bristol journeys to a land of gods and fae and monsters."-- book jacket.











the rest is memory


"the story of a young catholic girl transported to auschwitz becomes a rashomon-like rondo. first glimpsed riding on the back of a boy's motorcycle, fourteen-year-old czeslawa comes to life in this novel, imagining her upbringing in a small polish village before her world imploded in late 1942. stripped of her modest belongings, shorn, and tattooed number 26947 on arriving at auschwitz, czeslawa is then photographed. three months later, she is dead. how did this happen to an ordinary polish citizen?
