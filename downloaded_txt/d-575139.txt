about 






the documentation center of cambodia (dc-cam) was founded and constituted in 1995 after the u.s. congress passed the cambodian genocide justice act in april 1994, which was signed into law by president clinton. the royal government of cambodia also formally supported dc-cam. dc-cam has received numerous accolades and awards for its work in support of memory and justice for victims of the cambodian genocide. in 2017 alone, dc-cam was the honored recipients of the judith lee stronach human rights award from the center for justice and accountability, and his majesty king norodom sihamoni made youk chhang a commander of the royal order of cambodia in recognition of chhang’s distinguished services to the kingdom of cambodia. in 2018, dc-cam also was a winner of the ramon magsaysay awards, which is regarded as ‘asia’s nobel’ prize, for preserving historical memory for healing and justice.+ our history
