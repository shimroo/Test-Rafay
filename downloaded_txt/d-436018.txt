reading playboy for the articles





i hope you good folks are following me over on substack, because i'm writing some pretty cool stuff. my ongoing series, "reading playboy for the articles," continues to be a fun and insightful glimps into the pop culture zeritgeist of decades past. here are links to my most recent additions, in case you've missed them:
august 1977
fonzie, kit cars of the 70s and a bridge too far
september 1972
the troubles, semi-tough and drugs galore
march 1967
orson welles, sharon tate and a fox river bachelor pad monument to mcm excess

if you want to keep up with all of my various goings-on, i recommend subscribing to gibberish on substack. it's painless, i promise.

friday night videos







sixpence none the richer's not a band i keep up with much. sure, i recognize their biggest songs but they've never intrigued me enough to dive deeper into their catalog. so why am i featuring them on friday night videos? because their new single, "rosemary hill," has an accompanying video that was filmed in and around new braunfels. seriously, the whole thing. i recognize every intersection, every hill, every gruene hall... well, that last one's a given, as there's only one gruene hall and it's five minutes from my house. so if you'd like a glimpse of where i live (generally speaking) this video will scratch that itch. 



previously on friday night videos... sergio mendes.

armadillocon in the rear-view mirror: 2024 edition





armadillocon took place in austin over the weekend. this is, for those unaware, an annual science fiction and fantasy convention that's been running for 46 years. this isn't a big cosplay-and-celebrity event like dragoncon or comicon you see on tv. it's a more intimate affair focused on authors and artists. it's a blast. i attended it for the first time way back in 1990 and hope to attend many more in the future.

my recap of the weekend, along with a goodly number of photos, may be found on my substack. as traffic here to my blog has gradually declined over the years, i'm shifting more of my writing over to the substack platform, which combines the blog concept with social media and a built-in newsletter, with the potential of reaching more readers. and as a writer, reaching more readers is the name of the game. i don't plan on wholly abandoning this space, but the main activity will happen over at the new digs.
