welcome to


dr. becker is a world renowned leader in plastic surgery. he is an innovator, medical patent holder, and highly sought after medical lecturer and professor. he specializes in challenging cases and excels in natural-looking results that look gorgeous without looking “done”.
dr. becker and his professional staff invite you to discover our plastic surgery clinic to experience the difference his expertise brings. beyond our compassionate, kind approach, you can be confident that you will be treated by an acclaimed authority in advanced, less-invasive surgical procedures that produce natural-looking, beautiful and arguably the best outcomes in plastic surgery boca raton has to offer.




non-surgical “facelift” with fat grafting
the becker non-surgical "facelift" utilizes stem cell-enriched fat grafts to rejuvenate your appearance. dr. hilton becker is an esteemed expert in fat grafting with extensive experience. the becker micronizer leverages your body's own fat, offering a completely natural method to restore youthful fullness that diminishes with age. the key to his outstanding results lies in the advanced technique of breaking down fat cells into smaller particles, creating a concentrated cellular matrix known as stromal vascular fraction (svf) rich micronized fat, which is abundant in collagen and stem cells. this approach effectively rejuvenates the skin, akin to immersing it in the "fountain of youth."
dr. becker’s innovative micronizer allows him to target all three layers of skin and tissue, achieving results comparable to surgery—without any incisions.

natural breast augmentation with fat grafting

wide awake minimally invasive breast enhancement (wami)
many women are generally satisfied with their breasts wanting only a modest increase in size often resorting to a push up bra. when considering volume enhancement, they don’t want down time or complications. for these patients the (wami) procedure is ideal. the small implants that are used  can be  placed through a small incision. the pocket for the implant is made using atraumatic hydro dissection and blunt balloon expansion, stretching the space with no cutting  of muscle, nerve or vessels. there is very little downtime with patients returning to normal activities the next day. another option is the use of absorbable mesh to perform an internal lift. further volume and contouring can be done with fat grafting.
dr. becker’s preference for routine breast augmentation is the use of the moderate profile plus smooth round cohesive gel implant. implants are usually placed above muscle but beneath the fascia (the outer lining of the muscle). when saline implants are used, dr. becker prefers to use the adjustable saline (spectrum®) as the volume can be changed after surgery. read his publications

pioneer of the virtually “scarless” breast lift
dr. hilton becker is a renowned authority in breast lift surgery, with numerous publications and contributions to plastic surgery textbooks on the subject.
he pioneered the development of the virtually "scarless" breast lift, also known as the sub-areolar mastopexy, which improves upon the traditional circum-areolar mastopexy. this advanced technique involves a discreet incision around the areola, and the use of buried tension-releasing sutures to minimize scarring.

correction of breast implant complications
breast correction may be necessary after complications from an earlier augmentation. issues may include asymmetry, implants that are too large, too small, or wrongly positioned, or issues such as capsular contracture, muscle distortion, implants that have drooped low on the chest or sag, or issues associated with excessive scarring. dr. becker is highly proficient in the correction of breast surgery complications. he has invented and patented several breast implants and teaches his techniques around the world.
