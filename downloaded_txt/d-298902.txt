in order to treat the pain, you have to reach it



rs-4i® plus sequential stimulator with intersperse®this true high-frequency device for in-home use helps relieve chronic pain in two ways. first, it delivers pain relieving interferential (inf) therapy that penetrates deep into soft tissue to excite the body’s natural endorphin production for long-lasting pain relief. then the rehabilitative effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (nmes) reduces muscle spasms, increases circulation and prevents disuse atrophy.exclusive to the rs-4i plus, patented intersperse technology provides the muscle contraction of nmes intermixed with pain relieving inf therapy. in this way, the patient gets intermittent contraction, then pain relief, then contraction throughout the duration of a session – enabling shorter, more comfortable and more impactful treatments.

 “this thing is a dream come true.”- marty, u.s. navy veteran and rs-4i patient

enjoy the freedom of at-home, self-managed treatment



the rs-4i plus can treat almost any area of skeletal muscle. electrodes can be placed on arms, shoulders, legs, hips and other locations for targeted treatment. when electrodes are combined with wearables, patients can conveniently and precisely target broader areas of pain – such as in the low, mid and upper back. it’s as easy as putting on the garment and starting the treatment with a few button clicks. the device comes pre-loaded with a library of standard treatment programs, and customized programs can be added for specific needs. to help ensure maximum benefit, patient care specialists from rs medical provide covid-safe, one-on-one instruction on the proper use of the rs-4i plus. an interactive pad placement guide, which offers an array of instructional videos, also helps patients prepare for their treatment sessions.
