what we do

central tool rentals' main business is the rental and sale of high quality, well maintained, late model construction and industrial equipment and tools to contractors. central tool rental also sells concrete related building materials and tools, new and used construction equipment, propane, parts and service for construction equipment and tools.











we service and repair most brands





we carry non-ethanol fuel
ethanol will start to absorb water over time, leading to poor engine performance. e10 gas absorbs up to 50 times more water than standard gasoline. it is recommended that you replace gas in your fuel tank every 2-3 weeks to avoid alcohol and water related engine issues. ethanol is also an excellent solvent.




we re-fill propane
