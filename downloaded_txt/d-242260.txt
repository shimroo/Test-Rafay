it all started with a mountain, a sewing machine, and a dream.
over fifty years ago, two young mountaineers started making quality outdoor gear to address a need for high-end mountaineering equipment. fifty years later, we’re still in the business of getting people outside.
all of our gear is proudly made in the usa, just like it was fifty years ago. with our premium ultralight fabrics, high fill-power quality down, and precise craftsmanship, we think our gear can keep up with you for another fifty. whatever your adventure, our mountain-ready down apparel and high-quality sleep systems are up for the challenge.
