unmatched quality for that perfect natural cowhide rug, area rug cowhides
one of the key advantages of cowhide rugs is their durability. made from the rugged hide of cows, these rugs are built to withstand the test of time. they are resistant to stains, easy to clean, and can handle heavy foot traffic, making them an ideal choice for high-traffic areas in your home. additionally, cowhide rugs are hypoallergenic, which means they won’t trap dust or allergens like traditional fabric rugs, making them a great option for allergy sufferers. rest assured that every cowhide rug, area rug, pillow or other accessory we carry is 100% genuine cowhide and of the highest quality.
another benefit of cowhide rugs are their natural beauty and unique patterns. no two are exactly alike, as each hide has its own distinct markings and color variations. this means that when you choose a cowhide rug, you’re getting a one-of-a-kind piece that adds character and charm to your home. they can effortlessly complement a variety of interior styles, from rustic to modern, and act as a focal point in any room. furthermore, cowhide rugs are incredibly versatile, working well as statement pieces in living rooms, cozy additions in bedrooms, or even stylish accents in offices. their combination of aesthetic appeal and practicality makes cowhide rugs a timeless and fashionable choice for any space.


no one has more real cowhide rugs and area rug cowhides to choose from!
at cowhides international, we have over 500 pictures of real cowhides, cowhide rugs, area rugs, cowhide pillows, calfskins, and goatskins to choose from. we know of no other area rug website that even comes close in offering you so many choices. these cow hide rugs complement a wide range of décor styles, from rustic and farmhouse to modern and contemporary. whether you want to create a cozy, country-inspired atmosphere or add a touch of sophistication to your space, cowhide rugs can seamlessly fit into any setting. they also come in various sizes and shapes, allowing you to find the perfect rug to suit your specific needs.
we prioritize quality and customer satisfaction above all. each cowhide is meticulously selected and carefully processed to ensure it meets the highest standards of durability and aesthetic appeal. our commitment to sustainability means we source our hides ethically, ensuring that every product is not only beautiful but also responsibly obtained. with our user-friendly website, you can easily browse through our extensive collection, view high-resolution images, and read detailed descriptions to make an informed choice. our dedicated customer service team is always ready to assist you with any questions or concerns, ensuring a smooth and satisfying shopping experience from start to finish. choose cowhides international for unparalleled selection, quality, and service in cowhide and area rugs.


naturally colored real cowhide rugs and area rug cowhides
our naturally colored cowhides and area rug cowhide rugs are available in a variety of sizes: small, medium, large, xl, and xxl. the small sized cowhide rugs are approximately 5 x 5 feet; medium sized cowhide rugs are approximately 5 x 6 feet; large sized cowhide rugs are approximately 6 x 7 feet; xl cowhide rugs are approximately 7 x 8 feet; and finally, our xxl cowhide rugs are approximately 8 x 8 feet in dimension.
(please note: most any cowhide rug will have areas of natural colored, yellowish shading. in addition, any one of these animal print cowhide rugs may or may not have extra white along the edges. this can be very easily trimmed if you want the zebra stripes as close to the edge as possible. however, we recommend leaving the white along the edges of any one particular cowhide rug to make the cowhide as large as possible.)


silk screened animal printed area rug cow hides
conversely, our animal print cowhide rugs are not naturally colored but rather are silk screened. each animal print cowhide rug is actually stenciled onto a white, beige, or caramel cow hide. these silk screened animal print cow hides are a very inexpensive alternative to a real zebra or tiger hide. in addition, a cowhide rug is much easier and much less expensive to have cleaned.
(please note: most any cowhide rug will have areas of natural colored, yellowish shading. in addition, any one of these animal print cowhide rugs may or may not have extra white along the edges. this can be very easily trimmed if you want the zebra stripes as close to the edge as possible. however, we recommend leaving the white along the edges of any one particular cowhide rug to make the cowhide as large as possible.)


caring for your cowhide rug or cowhide pillows
concerning product care, area rugs, cowhide rugs and cowhide pillows are very easily cared for. simple soap and water on a sponge will deal with most problems. steam cleaning your cowhide rug, cowhide pillow and custom cow hide area rug will also work as long as you don’t soak the leather backing.
for deeper cleaning and maintenance, it’s essential to handle your cowhide products with care to ensure their longevity. regularly shaking out your cowhide rugs and pillows can help to remove dust and debris, maintaining their fresh appearance. avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive tools, as these can damage the natural fibers and texture of the cowhide. for stubborn stains, consider using a mild detergent specifically designed for leather or cowhide products, and always test a small, inconspicuous area first. if you ever find yourself in need of professional cleaning services, seek out specialists who are experienced in handling cowhides to avoid any potential damage. with proper care, your cowhide items will continue to add charm and elegance to your home for many years to come.


when it comes to sustainability, cowhide rugs are an eco-friendly choice.
these cow hide rugs are a byproduct of the meat industry, which means they make use of a material that may otherwise go to waste. by choosing a cowhide rug, you are supporting a sustainable practice that reduces waste and utilizes all parts of the animal. this environmentally conscious choice aligns with the growing trend of eco-friendly and ethical home décor options.
in addition to their sustainability, cowhide rugs offer unmatched versatility and longevity. the natural durability of cowhide ensures that these rugs can withstand high traffic areas, making them ideal for living rooms, entryways, and other busy spaces. their unique patterns and natural variations mean that no two cowhide rugs are exactly alike, giving your home a one-of-a-kind piece that adds character and charm. easy to maintain, cowhide rugs require minimal cleaning and can retain their beauty for years with proper care. by investing in a cowhide rug, you are not only enhancing the aesthetic appeal of your home but also choosing a durable and practical solution that will stand the test of time.
