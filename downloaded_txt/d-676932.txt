 why this site exists ... 
once upon a time you could find quality sites and services via web directories. the first famous & successful site was yahoo!, a web directory. a massive australian success was looksmart, also a directory. then came open directory, which used crowdsourcing to usher in the era of wikipedia.
then they all either got greedy (pay $$$ to be listed) or got spammed to pieces. 
today genuine directories are few and far between. and there isn't one for australia. 
if you have a resource that is good for all of australia, or fits into one of the categories on the left, let me know.
