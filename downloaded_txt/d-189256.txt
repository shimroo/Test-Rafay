      may all beings be happy + free ☀️


 at sol seek yoga, we believe the work we do on our mats is the foundation for creating a better world.
yoga is not just about movement; it’s a personal act of social justice. each breath, pose, and moment of mindfulness is an opportunity to confront our inner barriers, cultivate compassion, and prepare ourselves to take meaningful action in the world.﻿guided by the sanskrit mantra lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu—"may all beings everywhere be happy and free"—we recognize that true freedom and happiness are not universal yet. the light we cultivate through practice doesn’t stop at the edges of our mats; it ripples outward, impacting everyone around us.
