 customer reviews











i would also recommend the 3 hour tour. trails gave you plenty of different types of terrain but nothing too challenging. my 8 yo daughter had no problem on her own and was matched well with the horse as was i. we unfortunately could not go into the gem mine but there are still plenty of garnet in the tailings around mine. the horses seemed to be well taken care of and they seems to be pretty organized there. - matthew s. read more reviews
