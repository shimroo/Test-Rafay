âitâs a crafted world thatâs so real, you can get sucked in. for over a quarter century, degrassi has helped youngsters (and sometimes adults) through the awkward phase of going from kids to teens to grownups. itâs a show so convincing in its earnestness that one never doubts its sincerity. and in todayâs post-modern, self-aware culture, thatâs as rare as a kid at degrassi with no issues or problems.â
