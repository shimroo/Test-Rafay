note- these are the rates offered by subaru dealers in the 
greater puget sound, seattle, nw area, through chase bank, on approval of credit.
please contact your local dealer
for rates and programs in your area
some dealers will advertise a 
lower rate but always read the fine print, which should disclose that the rate is 
being 'bought down', similar to paying points 
on a mortgage. buying the rate down will affect dealer cost and the consumer price. always
 read the fine print in any ad. 
subaru financing is through chase, with 
no loan setup or early payoff fees. 
on approval of credit.
