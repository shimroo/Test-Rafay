mt. ashland ski area


from atop the siskiyou crest, mt. ashland provides terrain for skiers and riders of every ability. founded in 1964 and operated by a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, mt. ashland is southern oregon’s hub for outdoor recreation. with a peak elevation of 7,533′ and over 200 acres of skiable terrain, find your happy place amongst our steeper terrain in the bowl, one of dozens of groomed runs, in one of our tree glades or at the learning center.
located just eight miles from i-5 near the oregon-california border, mt. ashland features a full rental shop (with ski and snowboard rentals and tuning), several dining options, the t-bar lounge, a retail shop, and ski school.
this winter, come see for yourself why mt. ashland is your local mountain playground!
