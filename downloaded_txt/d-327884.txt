i don't really have a reason...
why i have blogged in so long.  i know that i think of things that i could blog about, but when i sit down to actually do it my mind goes blank, like now.  so i'll just do some random stuff....flavor of love 3why in the hell is those twins of the flavor of love 3 so damn ugly.  missing teeth, skinny with crack bellies, and no command of the english language at all! i'm pretty sure a couple of those woman are men, i would have to ultrasound them to make sure they got mommy parts on the inside.bitchassnesshow in the hell do i sue p. diddy over my damn phrase?  i swear that was one of my original words.  i, at the very least want a cut of the t-shirt sales.adult onset addi seriously think i have it.  i can concentrate on one thing for more than five minutes without getting insanely bored.  i think my job has done this to me since i'm normally juggling ten things at once.  i've made it a point to start concentrating on one thing at a time.  hmmm, could my add be a reason i don't blog like i should?state of the worldwhere in the hell is all the people that lost their homes?  you can go to some really nice neighborhoods in the detroit area and find half the houses empty.  people say that are shacking with other people.  i don't know of one case like that and i know a lot of people that will sleep on someone else's couch without a second thought.my next car will be a moped.  i can not keep affording to fill up my truck at $70 a pop.  it's putting a serious dent in my "me fund".i will be so glad when the presidential election is over, it's wearing me out.  i had some commentary but i'm too wore out about it to write about it.that's enoughi know i need to update my links, my background, and all that good stuff.  to be honest, i don't remember the passwords on none of my stuff.  it took a lot to remember the one to blogger....lol.labels: random

please sign the petition for the jenna 6
http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/2446/t/1373/petition.jsp?petition_key=10in a small highly segregated rural louisiana town of jena inseptember 2006, a black student asked permission from schooladministrators to sit under the shade of a tree commonly reservedfor the enjoyment of white students. school officials advised theblack students to sit wherever they wanted and they did. the nextday, three nooses, in the school colors, were hanging from the sametree. the jena high school principal found that three white studentswere responsible and recommended expulsion. the white superintendentof schools over-ruled the principal and gave the students a threeday suspension,saying that the nooses were a youthful stunt. black students decidedto resist and organized a sit-in under the tree to protest thelenient treatment given to the noose-hanging white students.racial tensions remained elevated throughout the fall. on monday,december 4 2006, a white student who allegedly had been raciallytaunting black students in support of the students who hung thenooses got into a fight with black students. allegedly, the whitestudent was taken to the hospital treated, released, reportedlyattended a social function later that evening.as a result of this incident, six black jena students were arrestedand charged with attempted second degree murder. all six wereexpelled from school. the six charged were: 17-year-old robertbailey junior whose bail was set at $138,000; 17-year-old theo shaw -bail $130,000; 18-year-old carwin jones--bail $100,000; 17-year-oldbryant purvis--bail $70,000; 16 year old mychal bell, a sophomore inhigh school who was charged as an adult and for whom bail was set at$90,000; and a still unidentified minor.on the morning of the trial, the district attorney reduced thecharges from attempted second degree murder to second degreeaggravated battery and conspiracy. aggravated battery in louisianalaw demands the attack be with a dangerous weapon. the prosecutorwas allowed to argue to the jury that the tennis shoes worn by bellcould be considered a dangerous weapon.when the pool of potential jurors was summoned, fifty peopleappeared, all white. the jury deliberated for less than three hoursand found mychal bell guilty on the maximum possible charges ofaggravated second degree battery and conspiracy. he faces up to amaximum of 22 years in prison.the rest of the jena 6 await similar trials. theodore shaw is due togo on trial shortly. mychal bell is scheduled to be sentenced july31. if he gets the maximum sentence he will not be out of prisonuntil he is nearly 40.the message:· as chairman julian bond stated, "this is an american outrage thatdemonstrates the continuing shame of racial division in our country.join us in making it one of the last."· in light of the circumstances surrounding mychal bell's case, weurge all concerned citizens to support the call for a new trial.· it is unacceptable to selectively enforce the law based on race.prosecutorial discretion should be used in a fair and equitablemanner.· the jena six should be tried by juries that reflect the racial andethnic demographics of jena, louisiana.· the hanging of nooses is not a "youthful stunt" or "prank." it isa hate crime. such hate crimes should not be tolerated at anyschool. jena high school must establish a curriculum which promotescultural sensitivity and understanding.· the naacp calls on louisiana governor kathleen b. blanco andlouisiana attorney general charles c. foti to thoroughly investigateand monitor the trials of mychal bell, robert bailey, jr., theoshaw, carwin jones, bryant purvis and john doe. the governor andstate attorney general should do everything in their power to ensurethat these young men's constitutional rights are protected.thank you for your attention to this important matter!!!if you have any questions, call angela ciccolo at the nationalheadquarters at (410) 580-5777labels: african americans, blacks, injustice, jena 6, naacp, racism, racist

getting old?
i keep asking myself that question over and over because people won't let me forget how old i am.i've never considered  myself to have a  problem with my age.  i've alway felt  proud and blessed.  i can't believe that i'm closer to 40 than 30.  i feel like i'm at a crossroads where i need to make some serious decisions about the next phase of my life.i'm also suffering from "pre empty nest" syndrome.  my boy has signed his nli and will be leaving for school in june.  i'm extremely happy that he's leaving for school and i know he'll be ok, but i'm going to miss him.  he'll only be four hours away, but i won't get to see him like i see my daughter who is 45 minutes away.  she's not coming home this summer either, she's getting an apartment near school.all my adult life (and even before then) i've been someone's mother and wife.  the thought of living my life the way i want to and doing what i want is something that i have never given much thought until now.  i knew this day would come and i knew i would be young when it happened, but it came much faster than i thought.....lol.my daughter has pretty much moved on with her life and is doing what she wants to do.  she doesn't really need me and that's cool.  i know my son will need me for a year or two, but then again maybe not.  i hear the south calling me.  i'm considering moving across the mason dixon line.  i'm tired of being cold and i just want a change of scenery.  i think i'm going to use the next couple of years to tie up some loose ends and then i'll concentrate on moving on.in other age related news....i know i'm not too close to "the change" yet, but i can feel my body changing.  i get warm much faster than i used to.  i wore a turtle neck sweater today and i almost went into spontanious combustion.....lol.  my skin is also getting dryer.  if i sit in one position too long, i get stiff.....sheesh.  i'm still waiting on this 30-something sex surge to kick in.  the thought of having an insatiable sexual appetite is hilarious to me.  i mean i'm no prude and i do alright, but i can definitely control myself.ok, i'm done.

jibber jabber.....
oh my, this will make two post in one month!  i guess i'm getting back in the grove.since it's so long in between my post, i can't focus on one topic.  so i'll just catch y'all up and talk about what's going on in my life, head, etc.....i just came home from a whirlwind college tour with my son.  this whole football recruiting thing is wearing me out!  i shouldn't complain though, because i feel blessed that his talents, grades, and personality has schools interested in him.  there are so many people that would like to be in his shoes right now, i just hope we make the best decision for him.while on my tour i finally met my friend, renay!  we've been part of a group that has talked online going on almost three years.  we talk about family, friends, life, entertainment, etc.  we've watched people in our group get married, divorced, have babies, lose babies, bury loved ones, recover from serious illnesses, and just grow up.  renay and i hit it off from the beginning, we are definitely sisters from another mothers.  i absolutely had a blast with her, she is so darn cool!  we were just like two old friends hanging out.  i have met a friend for life!i'm hungry.  i want a friend salami sandwich(my cravings have been so weird lately), but i don't have miracle whip.  we have a ton of mayo, but no miracle whip!what is everyone doing for super bowl.  i want to go to a sports bar or something.  i have a feeling i'll be watching it at home again.  i'm cool with that.when are the killings going to stop in detroit?  now they've killed david ruffin's granddaughter.  they need to send the national guard in there pronto!  it's a scary situation.why do fools continue to drive 80 mph even when they see other cars belly up in ditches?  suv owners are the biggest offenders.ok, i've run out of jibber jabber.  i'm hungry and can't concentrate any longer.....
