the beckoning






the beckoning is an eccentric little dirt track somewhere far away from the bustle of the information superhighway.  it is a source for poetry, prose, medieval studies, medieval art, folklore, academic decathlon advice, wolves, environmental issues, hiking/backpacking/kayaking/rafting/world travel/back road trip reports, and even some useful pages for owners of gm zr2 and highrider trucks



the last round of additions/revisions recently to 'the beckoning' occurred on 19 july 2020
