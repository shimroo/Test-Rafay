the team at riverside convention center (rcc) were true partners in the success of our event.  each year we convene 400+ of our autism experts in california for two days at our summit of the california autism professional training and information network (captain).  the rcc team was easy to work with, incredibly flexible and highly responsive to our specific needs throughout the whole process from beginning to end.  the team was also sensitive to our budget and provided us with an incredible experience that made our attendees feel valued.  rcc is such a great facility and match that we are returning for our second captain summit without hesitation.
