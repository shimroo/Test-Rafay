god loves us so much that he sent his son, jesus, to take our place. because sin is both a spiritual disease and a legal debt, only a sinless sacrifice could pay the price—bringing both healing and forgiveness. the bible tells us that without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins (hebrews 9:22).jesus—the only sinless one—shed his perfect blood to cure us from sin’s infection and to pay the debt we owed. his sacrifice on the cross paid our bail, setting us free from eternal prison. but even more than that, his resurrection conquered death, giving us the opportunity to be fully healed and forgiven, completely reconciled to god, and assured of eternal life in heaven.this incredible gift of salvation is available to everyone, but like any gift, you must accept it.“but god showed his great love for us by sending christ to die for us while we were still sinners.” (romans 5:8)“but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord.” (romans 6:23b) the choice ("best news")receive or reject god’s giftevery gift must be received—and god’s gift of salvation is no different. he offers you forgiveness, a cure, eternal life, and a restored relationship with him, but you must personally choose to accept it.the bible teaches that receiving this gift requires three essential steps:believing in your heart – that jesus is the son of god, that he died for your sins, and that god raised him from the dead.confessing with your mouth – declaring jesus as your personal lord and savior and surrendering your life to him.repenting – turning away from sin and choosing to follow god’s ways instead of your own.when you take this step, the bible promises that you will be:fully forgiven – your sins completely wiped away (legal justification).spiritually cured – healed from sin’s infection and restored (spiritual regeneration).eternally saved – guaranteed a home in heaven.adopted into god’s family – a child of god forever!this is the most important decision you will ever make—will you accept his gift today?“if you confess with your mouth, “jesus is lord,” and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead, you will be saved. for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.” (romans 10:9-10)are you ready to take this step? if so, refer to the prayer of salvation at the end of this page, and begin your journey with jesus. accept his promise of new life and eternity in paradise today! romans road versesthe book of romans contains many powerful verses that explain god’s plan of salvation. while the entire bible tells the story of redemption, the romans road focuses specifically on key passages from romans—hence the name “romans road to salvation.”when sharing the gospel through the romans road, you can choose from different approaches:1) the fast track – a simple and effective way to present salvation in 3–4 key verses.2) the classic route – the most commonly used approach, featuring 4–6 verses, often seen in gospel tracts.3) the scenic route – a deeper dive into salvation, using 6-10 verses for greater clarity and context.the more scripture you include, the more richness and depth you bring to the conversation. below is a list of popular verses from romans that are most frequently used to explain and share god’s extraordinary plan of salvation.as it is written: “there is no one righteous, not even one.”romans 3:10“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god.” romans 3:23“when adam sinned, sin entered the world. adam’s sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned.” romans 5:12 “for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord.” romans 6:23 “but god shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, christ died for us.” romans 5:8“since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from god’s wrath through him!” romans 5:9“therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ." romans 5:1“if you declare with your mouth, “jesus is lord,” and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” romans 10:9“for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it  is with mouth that you profess your faith and are saved." romans 10:10“for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved.” romans 10:13romans road = freedom road = highway to heaven another way to think of god’s plan of salvation is freedom from the chains of sin and death. in other words, jesus’ death on the cross provided payment for all of our past, present, and future sins! the bible states: “therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus.”  romans 8:1  because of jesus’ death on our behalf, we will never be condemned for our sins. praise god for his incredible gift of liberty and victory!ticket to heavenanother way to think of god’s plan of salvation – if one chooses to believe and receive it – is the obtaining of a divine golden ticket. this special ticket is two-fold: it serves as both a ticket-out-of-jail as well as a ticket-into-heaven. furthermore, when we accept god’s wonderful gift of salvation, our names are written in heaven’s registry known as the “book of life.”“and if anyone was found whose name was not written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”  revelation 20:15  because of jesus’ death on our behalf, we have been rescued and  redeemed, along with a golden ticket-to-heaven. praise god! cured of our spiritual diseaseanother way to think of god’s plan of salvation is akin to being cured of a disease. we are all born with a hereditary disease called sin (passed on generation upon generation starting with adam & eve). when we believe and receive jesus’ blood sacrifice, we are accepting the “cure” to our spiritual disease called sin (e.g., think ‘sin-666’). when we do that, god completely eliminates the sin nature from our spirit, forgives all of our sinful acts of disobedience, and redeems us from spiritual death. this process is referred to as the rebirth or being born again, because we have been recreated and cured!“for i was born a sinner.” psalm 51:5“and the blood of jesus, his son, purifies us from all sin.” 1 john 1:7“therefore, if anyone is in christ, he is a new creation.” 2 corinthians 5:17  the bible is god's amber alert!the devil has ensnared humanity, holding us captive in a state of spiritual bondage and darkness. just as an amber alert signals a desperate need for rescue, the bible calls out to us, revealing our dire situation and the way to salvation. through the sacrificial blood of jesus christ, we are offered the ultimate rescue, freeing us from the clutches of the enemy and restoring us to a life of divine grace and eternal hope.“then they will come to their senses and escape from the devil’s trap. for they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants.” 2 timothy 2:26  can you avoid hell by being a good person?no. imagine a man found guilty of stealing stood before a judge in a court of law and asked to go free because he was a “good person” (e.g., he attended church, supported charities, helped the elderly, etc.). could that just and legal-minded judge let him go? of course not; he’s a thief and no amount of good works can undo his punishment. in the same way, we can’t “go free” from the punishment of hell related to for our sinful crimes (stealing, lying, lusting, hating). in fact, the bible states all it takes is one sin (one spiritual crime) and its as if we have violated all 10 commandments. “for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord.”  romans 6:23  “whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.” james 2:10  “but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord.”romans 6:23b prayer to receive god’s gift of salvationif you would like to follow the romans road to salvation, the following is a simple prayer you can pray to god. saying this prayer is a way to express your faith, declare your trust in jesus, and actively receive his free gift of salvation.prayer of salvation:“dear god, i acknowledge my sins and my need for a savior. i believe you sent your son, jesus, to die for my sins, and i believe that you raised him from the dead. i also confess jesus as my lord and savior, and i surrender my life to you. through faith (my belief and confession) in jesus, i now receive your gift of forgiveness, healing, and eternal life. thank you for your amazing grace and the gift of salvation! in jesus’ name, amen.”if you would like to follow the romans road to salvation, the following is a simple prayer you can pray to god. saying this prayer is a way to express your faith and declare to god that you are relying on jesus as your lord and savior and actively receiving your free gift of  salvation.“god, i know i have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment. but jesus took the punishment that i deserve so that through faith in him i could be forgiven. i now declare jesus as my lord and savior and choose to live for you. thank you for your wonderful grace and forgiveness – the gift of eternal life! in jesus’ name, amen!”  learn more…romansroad.org is a ministry of bible iq ministries. please visit bible iq at www.bibleiq.org to learn more life-changing biblical truth.translate »
