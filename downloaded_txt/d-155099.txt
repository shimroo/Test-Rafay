christopher’s 



originally opened in 1991 in the heart of covent garden, christopher’s has established itself as one of london’s prime american restaurants. comprising of three spaces that recall the heady-glamour of the modern american era, christopher’s brings you a martini bar on the ground floor, an elegant dining room on the first floor and a secluded club room on the lower ground floor for private events. housed in a grade ii listed building with an interesting past of its own, including a period as a papier mâché factory and opening in 1870 as london’s first licensed casino, christopher’s strives to bring you its own glamorous drinking and dining experience
