 “matthew did a terrific job. he’s educated, personable, humble, enthusiastic and did a great job on that east ridge having only come down it before. i felt confident he knew what he was doing and would not have done russell on my own. i am very pleased to have run into you guys. i’ll be down again next season.”
“guys, thanks for a killer trip this past weekend up the east face. i need to give some love to lindsay and amy. both were extremely comfortable leading and making decisions, and in control of their environment. as importantly, they were great climbing and camping partners.”
