lottery blocks 



how does the lottery block system work?  make two blocks.  one is for the lottery; the other is used in the guild’s annual auction.  for each two blocks you make and turn in on the due date, you get one chance to win all the blocks in the lottery set.  the more you make, the greater your chance to win – and the guild’s share of blocks-sets bring in auction income that helps pay for our programs.if you did not turn in your blocks on the due date, you can still contribute to the guild by making blocks for the auction.  visit the auction/lottery blocks page for instructions.
