​the sweet’s​the likeable and congenial ed sweet, museum originator, was born february 25, 1904, in applegate, michigan. at the age of four, his family came to new mexico on an immigrant train, bringing all their household items and livestock with them. they settled in the small community of melrose, 37 miles east of fort sumner. it was there that ed grew up and , always with adventurous heart, began thinking about someday building a museum. as he grew older, ed sweet realized that old relics, western and otherwise, possessed an unequaled pleasure to people from all walks of life. as he set about the task of making a living for his family, going from house to house peddling apples, sweet potatoes, making brooms and mattresses, he always kept an eye peeled for anything old. money was short, so some times his wares were traded for antiques which people were more than glad to get out of the their way in order to make room for more modern things. ed and his wife, jewel, after many years of collecting and planning, opened a one-building museum in january of 1953. aware of the fact that the most talked-about “outlaw” in this part of the country is billy the kid, and having collected several items connected with “ the kid”, ed sweet’s museum became known as “billy the kid museum.” as a result of their tireless effort in collecting and expanding, and their friendly and cheerful manner with visitors, billy the kid museum is known the world over and now houses around 60,000 relics. many are of historical value. ed sweet passed on december 5, 1974, at the age of 70. mrs sweet continued to operate the museum with the help of their son, donald, until her retirement in 1979. billy the kid museum continues to be an enjoyable stop for many visitors, of all ages, from all around the world. the museum, souvenir and gift shop is now operated by donald sweet and his wife, lula, and son, tim
