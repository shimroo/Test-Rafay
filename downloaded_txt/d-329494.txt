 welcome to graffitifonts.com!

					the graffiti fonts® collection is the first & largest collection of authentic graffiti style typefaces ever assembled. since 1999 we've worked to both design & collect the most full featured, advanced, digital fonts for building wildstyles, handstyles, throwies, blocks & more with graffiti letter styles from the old school to the new. as the first web site dedicated entirely to graffiti style fonts this collection offers commercial licensing &/or free downloads of virtually all of the first graffiti typefaces ever developed, the most sophisticated fonts in the genre and authenticity that only actual graffiti writers can provide. new releases and updates are added regularly.  
				

					this site provides individual fonts, full families or, for a better value, large collections including extras like vector illustrations, stock images, templates, textures, photo cut-outs & powerful opensource software applications. many of our font families function as layered type systems & many include advanced opentype features, kerning pairs, alternate glyphs & multi lingual support.
