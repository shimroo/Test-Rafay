“the first issue i advertised in paid for itself in the first 2 days. from that first issue i received 3 service calls and a new door installation. for me it's been a great investment. it is getting me into the neighborhoods and in front of the customers that want a quality product as well as quality service.”
mike kramerfounder at integrity door sales






"over the years i’ve been particularly impressed with beverly’s professional approach to sales and customer service. when we finally signed up with thehomemag®, due to beverly’s persistence, we now are experiencing first hand a most excellent team from exceptional graphic design to personal calls clarifying a lead that we had missed. our relationship with thehomemag®’s team has become much more than just quality leads, they have given us an example of customer service we aspire to emulate."
bernard mumfordmumford restoration






"we originally signed up for 3 months because we weren’t sure what the results would be. we tried other means of printing previously with little to no success. i am happy to say we consistently enjoy a good roi with thehomemag® and now sign up for a year at a time. our representative stays in touch with us each month and offers suggestions when needed regarding our ad design. he didn’t just sell us an ad and walk away. he is with us every step of the way. we know this is a company committed to our success. we highly recommend thehomemag® to anyone looking to grow their business with solid, quality leads."
sue brennanbrennan’s fence & deck






"when thehomemag® came to our market, we started our advertising relationship with them immediately based on their great reputation in other markets. thehomemag® will not let you down from the very 1st issue. their team will always keep in contact with you their customer service is impeccable. the most important feature of any type of advertising is the roi and this magazine will not disappoint. be prepared to grow your business!"

“thehomemag® has been my best advertising outlet – it has consistently gotten me more calls than any other form of advertising i’ve tried.”
dan keechkeech clean






"we tried other print in the raleigh market. did not get great results. talked to local thehomemag® rep and decided to give it a try for 3 months. i was amazed at the quality leads we got each month with thehomemag®. thehomemag® is doing so well for us. we no longer have to do home shows. after our initial 3 months we resigned for a year. i would strongly recommend thehomemag® to any business owner that wants to increase their sales."
daniel godfreycary landscape






"used thehomemag® here in the raleigh/durham market since they started early in 2012...been very pleased with the results we have gotten each month from thehomemag®. we have tried other print advertising in this market and nothing has come close too the quality leads we get each month from thehomemag®. i would strongly recommend thehomemag® to any business that is looking to get qualified leads each month and increase their sales."
