what others are saying

 

i have absolutely zero complaints with cesco® and fully intend to use cesco® as much as possible with future transactions. we get daily contacts from other businesses trying to earn our business.... however, the times i have used those companies in the past, their service does not compare to cesco®, which is the main reason i fully intend to stick with y’all.
chad - southeast-based blast & coating company

 

our air compressor was down and we needed a replacement valve asap. not only did mike research this hard to find part and have it shipped same day, he even called me on saturday to provide the tracking information. we were back to work on monday morning with next to no down time. thanks to cesco®, customer service is alive and kicking! 
rod (marine services support)

 

the cesco® reps that came out were able to teach our painters, blasters, and maintenance workers more in half a day than we know after two years of operations. thank you!
charleston based cesco® customer

 

so often when someone takes the time to email a company…it will be something negative. but i felt the need to let you know that cesco® was exceptional in dealing with my issue. i provided pictures and descriptions to two other companies in this line of work for a part i needed. after weeks of no responses and receiving a wrong part i called you guys. cesco® was able to identify the part and provide options to my needs. you guys were very knowledgeable and professional. cesco® is truly an asset.

i sure like the ‘one-stop’ shopping you offer!
chuck o. - cesco® customer
