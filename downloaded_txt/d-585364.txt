welcome to the communication disorders clinics
 
the department of rehabilitation sciences operates two communication disorders clinics within the beaver college of health sciences.  we serve people of all ages from the boone and greater high country region.
the charles e. and geneva s. scott scottish rite communication disorders clinic, located in university hall, serves children who have speech and language disorders that are primarily behavioral or developmental in nature. through the generous support of the north carolina scottish rite masonic foundation, we are able to provide these services to children regardless of their family's ability to pay. 
the interprofessional communication disorders clinic, located in the leon levine hall of health sciences, provides speech-language pathology services for adults and children with medically-based communication and swallowing disorders, as well as audiology services.
