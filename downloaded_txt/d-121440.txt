option #1: welcome to commonland community
close to cornell university and on the tcat busline on the east side of town, these units have 1-2-3 bedroom units with a variety of floor plans including a split-level design and a townhouse design. it is situated close to six mile creek preserve and was originally started in the 1980's as a green building design. there is a community building, ballfields, a pond and common laundry areas. 

many owners have added their own on-site laundry in their units over time.  
there is a community garden for use by residents.
there is an email listserv for commonland and there is an association to manage the financial and social decisions of the community. many people who come to cornell or ithaca college have lived here and enjoyed a more home-like atmosphere than renting. 
there are deed restrictions which prohibit long-term renting of the units so these are mainly owner-occupied. some of the end units and lower units enjoy close proximity to the nature preserve and all that it brings - deer, birds, and more! 
association dues are $235 per month. not every unit has a carport, but if one does, there is an annual fee ($30).  the dues include water and sewer bills and garbage service, exterior maintenance, plowing and mowing. heat/electricity and taxes are the owner's responsibility.

there are usually laundry facilities in each building in the basement, and there may also be storage lockers/areas for bikes and/or other personal items.  
there is an association fee, which depends on each unit so you have to inquire individually. this fee include water and sewer costs, exterior maintenance, garbage removal and sometimes even heat. taxes would be an additional cost to the owner.

option #3: welcome to vista lane
these condo/townhouse units are located just past the entrance to ithaca college on south hill, built in the 1980's with cathedral ceilings, south and southwest exposure and with a split level design. all units have a 1-car garage and deck and patio areas.  only a few of these become available for sale. location is convenient to route 96b, south hill, ithaca college, candor and binghamton corridor. there are only a handful of condos built here...phase 2 of the development never happened so there is a lot of green space in this complex.

the association fee monthly is $180

i've sold one of these limited condos:

7b vista lane - sold in 2007


option #4: welcome to eastwood commons & sunnyview
located on a walking trail just south and east of cornell and belle sherman is eastwood commons. these are townhouse style units that are often hard to come by as sales are not as prevalent here. which indicates that the owners are long-time residents and that properties that do come on the open market are bought up quickly. these units usually have a garage underneath although there are some main level living units that have a garage attached on the same level. there are two different homeowner's associations - eastwood commons and sunnyhill. the ones in the 500 block of strawberry hill circle are in sunnyhill.
there is a resident's association here too, and there are committees like the grounds committee that do a fantastic job of keeping the areas beautiful year round.  association fees are based on square footage.  it is close to the bus stop and the east ithaca recreation way which takes you to cornell through belle sherman.
i know eastwood commons! here are some properties recently sold:

511 strawberry hill circle #3 - sold in 2009

111 strawberry hill circle #3 - sold in 2010

521 strawberry hill circle #2 - sold in 2012

321-2 wildflower drive - sold in 2015
111 strawberry hill circle #3 - sold in 2017

in the past few years, these units have listed and sold quickly with brisk competition. if you want to get into this community, you will need to call me so i can let you know when something becomes available for purchase, otherwise it may sell before you see it advertised for sale!

option #5: welcome to deer run
south hill offers a 1980's version of what i call the philadelphia condo/townhouse...this is the style that most out-of-town buyers think about when they ask about whether there are any condos in ithaca. these are newer in both style and amenities, with a couple of floor plans available including a sunken living room style which is quite appealing, or the soaring cathedral ceiling style, also popular. 
deer run is aptly named - there are deer here! the landscaping is minimal, due to the deer that will visit your plants and consider them free food. many owners here have found ways to garden with deer-resistant plantings. whether you're a fan of the local deer population, it is an interesting sight to see  - natural deer moving around at dawn or dusk throughout the area.
there is an association fee which covers the exterior grounds, lawn mowing, landscaping, and street lights. some of the townhouses have a monthly roof assessment, which is to cover the roof replacements done in 2007-2008, these run for 10 years so most will be paid by 2018. you will have to check the monthly fee for each unit to find out what their charges are currently.
also in this area are single family homes, most of which were built in the late 1980's but mostly in the 1990's even into 2005. this location works great for those working at ithaca college, as it is a short drive from the ic campus. there are also great views from many of the units here and there is a neighborhood park.
june 2016 update - so far these units have sold quickly! 
i know deer run!  some recent units for sale/sold:

30 whitetail drive - sold in 2015
