polytechnic

















a nexus for studies featuring opportunities for project-based learning within advanced laboratory spaces.
the asu polytechnic campus is a nexus for studies in interdisciplinary sciences, engineering, management, technology and education. industry partnerships are key to the campusâ€™ distinctive course offerings, which provide opportunities for project-based learning within advanced laboratory spaces. specialized equipment for hands-on exploration includes simulators for flight and centers for consumer behavior research, semiconductor fabrication, comprehensive commercial printing and design services, and on-demand digital manufacturing.
the expansive polytechnic campus incorporates a major regional airport yet maintains the ambiance of a small, self-contained community by offering family housing, a freshman residence hall, dining facilities and a student recreation center.
a desert arboretum reserves a peaceful native space devoted to sustainability, preservation and contemplation. within a 30-minute drive of the campus are hiking and recreational opportunities amid the legendary superstition mountains, with small and large lakes nearby.
