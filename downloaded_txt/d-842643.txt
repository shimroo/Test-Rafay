the schlössle hotels are small but luxurious. each hotel is a “grand hotel” in miniature, tucked away amidst the cobblestone streets of the romantic cities of eastern europe.
elegance, comfort, sophistication and taste are the hallmarks of each individually designed hotel.
 
the hotels offer an environment of peace and tranquillity; a haven away from everyday cares and busy work schedules.
schlössle hotels are the perfect destination for those who appreciate the good things in life: fine dining, luxurious accommodation and pleasant conversation.
