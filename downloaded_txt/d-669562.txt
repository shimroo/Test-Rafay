welcome to
little washu'scute homepage

celebrating over 20,000 years of washu-mania!  known as the greatest scientific genius in the universe by everyone, washu lives within' the masaki household (well, under the stairs, where there's a portal that leads to her sub-space domain) where she conducts very important experiments.  her past successes includes the soujya, ryo-ohki, and even the flamboyant ryoko.  it is no surprise that washu, or "little washu" as known by her friends, is also the cutest red-head of all of the known universe.
