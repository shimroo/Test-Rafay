-customer testimonials-















"i don't mean to sound hokey, but it is seriously the most comfortable mattress i have ever slept on. take it from me - forget the $50 special from some discount store, and invest in a good mattress."
















"we recently visited our friends from kansas city. they had a spring air back supporter bed that was just divine. well, long story short, we now own one and we love it."
















"best mattress i ever owned! i have been selling and sleeping on a spring air mattress for 25 years. superb in quality and service."
















"i totally agree! my spring air mattress is the best mattress i have ever owned."
















"still as good as the day i got it. i have been sleeping on spring air mattresses for 20 years."
