prints for sale





i have three new prints for sale in the clay pipe shop. one based on the artwork for the forthcoming album from vic mars lp, and two others based on the artwork from the sharron kraus lp. first eight orders will get a free copy of the sharron kraus at the hangover lounge poster.







 vic mars - the land and the garden.

giclée print on 310gsm hahnemühle german etching paper.  30 copies signed and numbered. 16"x12"



£30 +p&p 






sharron kraus -  friends and enemies, lovers and strangers.

risograph* print on  munken pure 170mg paper. 40 copies signed and numbered. a3



 £20 +p&p 








sharron kraus -  friends and enemies, lovers and strangers.

risograph* print on  munken pure 170mg paper. 40 copies signed and numbered. a3



 £20 +p&p 

*unlike
 digital or gilcee prints risogarph prints are not direct copies of the 
original image. each colour is printed separately from black and white 
artwork, and because the risograph inks come in just a few tones the 
colour pallet is  limited. risograph prints have a distinct lo-fi charm 
all of their own.

introducing stagdale





stagdale is an ongoing self-initiated graphic novel project. at the moment i have a detailed synopsis and am busy sketching out the first third of the book. i intend on posting small updates and snippets here when i have new work to show. below are drawings of the main characters in the story. 

it's summer 1975 and twelve year old kathy finds herself living in the small village of stagdale after her parent's painful divorce.  the chance discovery of a diary written a generation earlier by jewish boy, max - an escapee from nazi germany, leads her on an epic hunt for the lost saxon jewel of stagdale. 

stagdale seems like a remote place when kathy and her mother arrive from london, hoping to make a new life for themselves in the country. nestled in a scrubby, chalk-scarred valley, stagdale was once a well-kept, picturesque village, but the slow downturn of farming in the area has sent it into steady decline. along its lanes and pathways sit decaying thatched cottages with mossy roofs and damp stonework.  the manor house, stagdale hall, home to lord ethelbert is rumoured to have once been the seat of saxon kings, but it is slowly slipping into a state of dilapidation.  despite the lack of opportunities few villagers have left stagdale, they remain stubbornly insular and protective of their old ways and customs.  kathy and her mother rent a shabby cottage from lord ethelbert, who kindly reduces the rent to help them out.
