happy new year! time for our annual round-up of the best posts of 2024, with this year featuring as many (or more!) great posts from oscar as from me. if you missed them earlier this year - or just didn't have time to read them then - hopefully the holidays are a more leisurely time for perusal. 

  i'd also like to thank mybestplan for their ongoing generous support. they always have the best and cheapest electricity plan for your texas home. they have saved me a ton of money on electricity, and i suggest you contact them for a free, no-obligation savings estimate. mention “hs” so they know you’re with us.
  
  these posts have been chosen with a particular focus on significant ideas i'd like to see kept alive for discussion and action, and they're mainly targeted at new readers who want to get caught up with a quick overview of the houston strategies landscape. i also like to track what i think of as "reference posts" that sum up a particular topic or argument; and, last but not least, they've also been invaluable for me to track down some of my best thinking for meetings or when requested by others (as is the ever-helpful google search).
  
  don't forget we offer an email option for the roughly once/week posts - see the google groups subscription signup box at the bottom of the right sidebar. an rss feed link for newsfeed readers is also available in the right sidebar (i'm a fan of feedly).

	 hctra part 2: spiraling debt and outrageous costs
	 
    

another excellent followup investigative guest post by houston freeways author oscar slotboom. be warned: this will make you nauseous if you like good government.---
in my previous post, "hctra: from model agency to delay, divert and do nearly nothing", i documented how hctra has hugely increased diversions of toll revenue and drastically curtailed construction. to summarize
  


hctra had $935 million in revenue in 2023, and $410 million in profit.
$369.3 million was diverted out of hctra in 2023. diversions have averaged $345 million per year in the years 2020-2023. harris county diverted $1.292 billion of toll funds out of hctra in the last 4 years, which is around $830 million above historical levels.
for the period 2020 to 2023, diversions were 46.3% of toll revenue and 45.3% of total revenue. it appears this trend will continue for 2024 and 2025 based on budget documents (page 81), although the percentage may be in the mid-thirties since there were one-time transfers in the 2020-2023 period.
hctra awarded approximately $1.648 billion in construction contracts in the six years prior to 2019, but only two projects for around $297 million in the six years after 2019. long-planned projects like the hardy downtown connector, toll barrier removal and the sh 225/sam houston interchange have been delayed for years.



   the loophole
  

are these large diversions legal? apparently yes, using a loophole in section 284.0031 of the texas transportation code which states "the commissioners court of a county or a local government
corporation ... may authorize the use or pledge of surplus revenue to pay or finance the costs of a project for the study, design, construction, maintenance, repair, or operation of roads, streets, highways, or other related facilities." it appears the phrase "other related facilities" is used to justify diversions to anything remotely related to a road, and the term "maintenance" may allow toll revenue to go into maintenance budgets for marginally related facilities. of course, money that would normally fund precincts, non-hctra engineering or general administration can be shifted to 
other "focused objectives" (starting on page 52), nearly all of which have nothing to do with infrastructure.
  

    hctra's financial statement for fiscal year 2024 (ended september 30) will be available in april. the harris county 2024 budget indicates at least $300.5 million in transfers. for the current fiscal year, the harris county budget (excerpt below) indicates at least $305 million in transfers, but we won't know the official audited amount until april 2026.
  


   $950 million in new debt in 2024, and another $2.15 billion on the way
  

with toll revenue being diverted out of the agency, there's no money to pay for planned projects. the result: a huge increase in debt is in progress.

  

the 2023 hctra financial statement shows $1.999 billion in debt principal and $111.9 million in commercial paper principal outstanding for a total of $2.1 billion. in the near future, we can expect debt to rise to around $5.2 billion, a 148% increase.

  

hctra issued $950 million debt in june 2024, the first of what is expected to be multiple debt issues.


  

this may 2024 credit opinion document from moody's ratings has more information about the hctra debt issuance program. some key points are excerpted below.


"hctra expects to fund the remaining $3.5 billion of its five-year capital plan with existing capital funds, commercial paper and
proceeds from past and future toll road revenue bonds. hctra projects that $3.1 billion of the remaining $3.5 billion will be funded by
new debt issuance. we anticipate issuance between $800 million and $1 billion of annual debt issuance over the next few years."



hctra has expressed an intent to issue $3.1 billion in new debt. $950 million this year is only the start. this means that hctra's debt principal will skyrocket to around $5.2 billion within a few years.


if the huge toll revenue diversions were not occurring, hctra would have around $215 million per year available to dedicate to the capital program, which would greatly lower the debt needed to complete the investment program.



"some of the other major projects planned are removal all tolling barriers, the largest project with expected construction costs of $1.6 billion. there is also a related $238 million project for toll system enhancements."



say what?!?! $1.838 billion for removing toll barriers and toll system enhancements? yes, it's true, if you look at this hctra document (page 5) you'll see "barrier free hctra" listed at $1.61 billion, which is more than the way-over-budget ship channel bridge ($1.45 billion).


good grief, this is outrageous! at least half the toll road system is already barrier-free, and only sections built before 2000 have barriers.  since this work will mainly apply to the original three sections of the sam houston tollway (southwest freeway to north freeway) which have paid for themselves many times over, this certainly smells like paying tolls to pay for the collection of tolls.


hctra needs to provide a detailed listing of the costs in this program. is this project a trojan horse to disguise bloated administrative costs? who knows, but a detailed listing of estimated costs of all elements in the project would shed some light on this appalling cost. (attention houston chronicle!)



"hctra in september 2023 updated the toll rate policy to again increase rates at the greater of cpi and 2.0%"


"... we expect that hctra will have sufficient revenue growth through transaction growth, resumed annual toll rate increases, and fee revenue to maintain strong credit metrics in line with aa2 rated peers."


"factors that could lead to a downgrade: failure to adhere to new toll escalation policy without reductions in the capital plan"



moody's expects that toll rate increases will be needed to maintain hctra's credit rating, and hctra appears to have a policy in place to start increasing tolls.



"hctra faces risk from organization structure given the increase in transfers to the county for non-toll road projects. the toll road operates as a division of harris county. its operating board is comprised of members of the county commissioners court, all five of whom are elected officials."


"the elected county commissioners court directly oversee the authority, reducing the level of independence of rate setting versus peers."



yup, we know the transfers are siphoning off a large percentage of revenue. actually, i'm surprised moody's isn't more concerned about it, but there is some discussion on page 4.


it appears that hctra is governed solely by commissioners court, with no independent oversight. of course, the political minority (republican jack ramsey) has no influence in the matter, and the majority does what it wants, and it could be a case of one or two individuals steering these decisions. in sharp contrast, the north texas turnpike authority has 9 directors, with 8 appointed by four different counties and one by the governor. this prevents one or two people from having too much power. 


overall, moody's says hctra can most likely withstand the massive debt increase, mainly due to the strong financial position inherited when democrats took control of commissioners court in 2019, and with expected toll increases.


   we don't get much for $3.5 billion
  

so what do we get for $3.5 billion in capital spending, including $3.1 billion in new debt? not nearly as much as i would think or hope. for example, this spreadsheet shows total construction payments of $1.45 billion from 2001 to 2022, including construction of the westpark tollway, tomball tollway, sam houston northeast, sam houston tollway widenings, fort bend parkway and extensive miscellaneous work. now it costs $3.5 billion for a smaller number of long-planned projects that have been delayed for years and years. sure, there's been inflation, but the new capital projects program seems like poor bang for the buck.
  

using cost numbers here and here and an estimate, i come up with ship channel bridge $726 million for remaining work, hardy downtown connector $226 million for remaining work, hardy-sam houston connectors $310 million, sam houston-sh 225 connectors phases 1 and 2 estimated $350 million and the lynchburg ferry $15 million. that adds up to $1.627 billion. this is just about the same as the barrier-free program at $1.61 billion. the total is $3.24 billion.
  

   commercial paper shenanigans?
  

looking at hctra's 2023 financial report page 33, there is a discussion of the issuance of commercial paper, which is short-term financing as opposed to long-term bonds. issue k authorized $200 million in may 2022, and issue k-2 authorized $150 million in may 2023. 
  

hctra diverted $799 million out of hctra in 2020 and 2021. then hctra issued $350 million in commercial paper in 2022 and 2023. it looks like so much money was diverted that hctra was short of money, so it had to tap credit markets to pay bills. in other words, the bank account was empty.
  

for both credit issues, hctra paid a 10% interest rate for 270 days, amounting to $25.89 million. why did hctra need to pay 10% interest? is this sound financial management - running the bank account dry and then taking out $350 million in loans with 10% interest for a period of time? the interest on the commercial paper after the 270 days is not stated, but the payment schedule shown on page 34, using estimated dates and the excel xirr function, suggests a rate of 5.88%. 
  

the 2023 financial statement says remaining principal was $111.93 million, but the harris county 2025 budget (page 90) shows huge adopted amounts for payments in 2024 and 2025 on series k and k-2, including $320.3 million budgeted for 2025 (see budget excerpt below). looking at the commercial paper reports, i can't make any sense of the numbers. perhaps we'll get some clarity in the next hctra financial statement.
  


   wayne dolcefino investigates hctra
  

hctra services contracts are another world which i haven't even attempted to dissect. services and fees were $213.4 million in 2023.
  

investigative reporter wayne dolcefino has investigated hctra's service contracts and recently posted a video with results of his investigation. dolcefino reports that certain contracts have been transferred to firms with politically well-connected ownership, and the cost to hctra has gone up substantially after the work was transferred. 

   tolls go on forever, no matter how much hctra customers pay
  

the chronicle recently reported that tolls will continue forever, regardless of how much customers have paid on particular sections, even on sections which have paid for themselves many times over, such as the original three sections of the sam houston tollway, completed in 1988 to 1990.
  

the 2023 hctra financial statement states, "when all of the debt service has been paid or provided for in a trust fund, the toll roads will become a part of the state of texas highway system." what will hctra do to continue charging tolls forever? continue to divert toll revenue, and issue more bonds to ensure the agency is perpetually in debt.
  

   hctra's game, post 2019
  

so now we get a clearer picture of hctra's modus operandi since democrats took control of harris county commissioners court in 2019.
  

divert a high percentage of toll revenue out of the agency for use elsewhere, 46% in recent years and probably in the mid thirties percent going forward.  (2020-2023 included large one-time transfers.)
this money gets distributed to the commissioners, the county engineering department (not hctra engineering) and general administration. once in the budgets of those departments, it appears to be used at their discretion for anything they can justify as "related uses" to roads.
with toll revenue being siphoned off, planned and committed projects are delayed for years, and the price escalates.
with available money running short due to diversions, issue billions in bonds to pay for the cost of planned projects and also higher-interest short-term commercial paper to pay bills.
according to the moody's report, toll rate increases are expected in the future, imposing a higher cost burden on businesses and individuals in harris county and extending tolling farther in the future (2054 for now, but future bonds will extend it).


sad but true,  hctra has degenerated into a chicago-style, debt-driven machine rife with inefficient project delivery, high costs, cronyism and increasing debt. customers of the toll road system will pay for this, making the houston area a more expensive place to travel and conduct business.
  

   can this be fixed?
  

since hctra operates at the direction of commissioners court, and commissioners court has created this situation, the only potential remedy is state-level legislation, which has been done before in 2021 with sb 1727.
  

some possible legislative remedies could include
  

eliminating the loophole in the transportation code, and require all toll surplus funds to be used directly on the toll road system or to pay off debt.
limiting the amount of toll revenue which can be diverted out of hctra, for example to 15% of toll revenue annually.
a state takeover of hctra to stop all diversions and implement policies for efficient and timely project delivery, and customer-friendly policies to reduce and eventually eliminate tolls.


dear santa: all i want for christmas 2025 is for txdot to take over the harris county toll road system!

	 hctra: from model agency to delay, divert and do nearly nothing
	 
    

this week we have one of oscar slotboom's best guest posts to date, although sadly with bad news about the state of hctra, which used to be one of the crown jewels of harris county. if you know anybody in the texas legislature (including your rep), please pass it along. thank you.---
      once upon a time, the harris county toll road authority was a model agency that regularly delivered projects quickly and efficiently at a low cost. this efficient and financially conservative approach put hctra in a very strong financial position.
  

      democrats took majority control of harris county commissioners court in 2019. since then, hctra has degenerated into an agency which gets very little done and takes forever to move forward with any project, in spite of collecting huge revenues from the public.
  

   reduction in new contracts since democrat control
  

      hctra has awarded only two new major construction contracts since 2019, with a nearly five-year hiatus between awards, and only one project which was planned and prepared after 2019.  (reference 1, 2)
  


    the list below shows contract awards in the six years before democrat control and six years after, keeping in mind that the 2019 project on the tomball tollway was already poised to proceed.
    



contract(s) awarded
project


august 2024
sam houston tollway at sh 225, 5 connection ramps, $205 million 


december 2019
tomball tollway (sh 249) at grand parkway, 4 connection ramps, $92 million


2017
sam houston tollway widening, i-45(s) to sh 225: $199 million


2017
sam houston tollway ship channel bridge : $934 million (original contract amount)


2016-2017
hardy toll road downtown connector, lorraine and collingsworth: $47 million


2015-2016
sam houston tollway widening, sh 288 to i-45(s): $185 million


2014-2015
hardy toll road widening, fm 1960 to grand parkway: $84 million


2013-2016
tomball tollway main lanes, spring cypress to county line: $200 million




   ship channel bridge
  

      the project contract was awarded in april and june 2017. it has been delayed for years and sustained a major cost increase, around $487 million.  this 2023 hctra document lists the current cost at $1.449 billion, up from the original reported cost of $962 million. 
  

    the 2018 failure of a bridge designed by the same engineering firm, figg bridge group, prompted an independent design review.
      based on the design review findings, hctra made major changes to the design, including replacing structural concrete bridge sections with steel structures.
  

      figg also designed txdot's new  corpus christi harbor bridge, which is longer and taller than the ship channel bridge. txdot paused construction for an independent design review which resulted in findings and recommended adjustments, but a major redesign was not required and the concrete structural design was retained.

  

      of course this problem occurred before 2019 and was inherited by the post-2019 management. but was the costly major redesign really necessary? hctra can justify it based on the independent consultant report, but a major redesign was not needed for the longer and taller corpus bridge. 
  

   delayed projects
  

   toll plaza modernization
  

      hctra has plans to replace the outdated toll plazas along the original three sections of the sam houston tollway, from the southwest freeway to the north freeway. this project was listed as costing $494 million in this 2022 document, but the current cost of this project is unclear.
  

      this project is surely a sore point to customers on these three sections of the tollway. this segment consistently generates over $300 million per year in revenue ($336 million in 2023) and has paid for itself many times over since all sections were completed in 1990, but hctra wants to spend hundreds of millions to continue to collect tolls. it certainly smells like paying tolls to pay for the collection of tolls.
  

      an eye-opening investigative report on click2houston.com in february 2024 was not able to get answers from hctra about this project, stating "that the total price tag remains uncertain as hctra was unable to provide us with numbers". the report concludes that this relatively simple project would require "a total of nearly 8 years to reconfigure and reopen the publicly funded toll lanes along the beltway" at the plazas. the video states "the now four-year delay in reengineering of the tolls is attributed to the pace harris county government operates these days."
  

   hardy toll road downtown connector
  

      preliminary work on this project has been ongoing for a very long time, starting with work to relocate a railroad track in june 2003. contracts for completed projects at collingsworth and lorraine were awarded in 2016 and 2017, and the project appeared ready to proceed to construction in 2018.
  

      when democrats took control of commissioners court in 2019, it became clear that the majority did not want to this project to proceed, in particular judge lina hidalgo, and the project was suspended in may 2020. but there were longstanding agreements between hctra, the city of houston and txdot to build the project, and txdot funded the $36.5 million replacement of the elysian viaduct, which connects to the project. 
  

      so hctra went into the delay mode. it hired a consultant to conduct a reevaluation process, community meetings and "visioning" in 2022. this visioning process resulted in recommendations to make the entire length an elevated structure or a cut-and-cover tunnel (1 2 3), with a 0.83-mile-long tunnel from north of lorraine to south of collingsworth. no cost estimates were provided, but the vision design would drastically increase the cost, probably by hundreds of millions of dollars.
  

      parks on a deck ("cap" in txdot parlance) above a freeway are trendy these days, but this is the most absurd proposal for a cap park i've ever seen. the purpose of cap parks is to connect neighborhoods which were severed by past freeway construction, or create park space where land is not available. neither condition exists along the downtown connector. the connector is alongside a long established and heavily trafficked multi-track railroad corridor. the deck park will be alongside or near the railroad, not connecting any neighborhoods. it would, however,  provide good views of warehouses, scrap yards and freight terminals on the east of the the railroad. google aerial view shows there is plenty of vacant land in the area, and it's difficult to justify a massive expenditure for a strip of park land around 80 feet wide.
  

      so is this super-expensive redesign a poison pill intended to indefinitely delay construction by increasing the cost? maybe. since the majority on commissioners court appears to be against improvement and expansion of the toll road system, it could also be a way to burn up money which otherwise could be going to highway and street improvements.
  

   interchange at the sam houston tollway and sh 225
  

      this project is the low hanging fruit among the planned projects, since it has negligible negative impact and would directly benefit motorists connecting to and from the sam houston tollway and sh 225. this project has been delayed for years, but hctra was obligated to proceed because it is part of a 2018 agreement between hctra and txdot. the $205.4 million contract for five connectors was awarded in august, and this is the first hctra contract for a major project planned and prepared after 2019.
  

   interchange at the hardy toll road and beltway 8
  

      the project has been delayed for years and the hctra site now says "construction is expected to begin in 2026."
  

   hctra's guiding principles since 2019: delay and divert
  

      hctra revenue has fully recovered from the impact of covid, with revenue at a record $935 million in fiscal year 2023, including $896 million in toll revenue. (however, inflation-adjusted revenue was higher in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019, see chart).

  


      every planned project is being delayed year after year, and of course costs have escalated rapidly during this period, with the highway cost index up 65% since october 2021. delay may be the intent of the majority on harris county commissioners court, since they appear to be against making improvements to the toll road system.
  

      instead, harris county commissioners court has drastically increased diversions of surplus revenue out of hctra, which is called "transfers out" in financial reports. diversions include a longstanding amount for general mobilty, and additional transfers are mainly or entirely to flood control budgets, but of course budgeting is like a shell game, where money that normally could have gone to flood control can be redirected to other purposes. in the four years from 2020 to 2023, harris county diverted $1.29 billion out of hctra ($1.45 billion in 2024 dollars), which is about $824 million above the long-established transfer rate. hctra toll revenue has become a slush fund for harris county commisioners court.
  


   have legislators in austin noticed?
  

      the texas legislature authorized hctra with legislation in 1983 (sb 970). hctra in 2024 collects massive revenue from the public, diverts toll revenues to general government and gets very little done in terms of construction. is this what the texas legislature intended? i don't think so.
  

      toll roads have become a hot political issue around the state in recent years due to sky-high tolls, excessively punitive penalties and general arrogance of toll road agencies. in may the dallas morning news did a comprehensive report of the discontent called toll trap (overview,  part 1), and an accompanying dmn editorial stated the following in a commentary called "texas made the wrong decision on toll roads".
  


      the state of texas has abdicated its responsibility to provide necessary transportation infrastructure in exchange for a vast web of toll roads controlled by a patchwork of powerful, self-interested organizations that often act to the detriment of residents.
  

      that’s our conclusion after reading a yearlong investigation conducted by our newsroom into how texas built more toll roads than nearly all other states combined over the last two decades, and the alarming consequences for the public.
  


      a subsequent report hinted at the possibility of toll road reform in the 2025 session: "as lawmakers have grappled with how to ease toll expenses on motorists, some say the time is ripe for them to reform texas’ complex tollway system"
  

   my preference
  

      the state legislature gives, and it can also take away. my preference is for the state of texas to disband hctra due to its mismanagement and ineptitude, and take control of toll road system, including assuming its debt. under state control via txdot, diversions of toll revenue to harris county would stop. then the system should be managed to be customer-friendly by reducing and eliminating tolls. txdot should cancel plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to modernize toll collection on older parts of the system which have long paid for themselves. instead, tolls on the original sections of the sam houston tollway, from the southwest freeway to north freeway, should be entirely eliminated. surplus toll revenue should go to local projects, including projects currently being planned by hctra.
  

      this may be wishful thinking. but it appears that harris county is attempting to repair its soiled reputation in austin, possibly to preempt any legislative action. at the november meeting of the texas transportation commission, harris county commissioners tom ramsey and leslie briones spoke to the commission in support of a new era of partnership between txdot and hctra. hctra executive director robert trevino, whose salary was recently increased to $485,000, was also in attendance. (video, "open comment period" starting at 34:15)
  

      all the the long-planned projects remain on hctra's to-do list, and this october 2024 document has schedules for contracts. hctra also launched two studies, the westpark tollway capacity optimization study and the harris county truck route study & freight corridors plan. will hctra actually be able to get these jobs done, or just continue its policies of study and delay?
  

          let's hope something happens to improve hctra's performance - either legislative action or mandates from commissioners court to get things done. ideally, we can bring back the pre-2019 hctra that got the jobs done quickly and efficiently.

	 redeveloping the old days inn downtown, metro needs to learn from denver's failures, texas' boom, and more
	 
    
a few smaller items this week...the chronicle examines what's up with the abandoned shell of the old days inn high rise hotel downtown. tl,dr: it's uneconomic to do anything with it, esp. with low ceilings. i’ve hoped to see it redeveloped for a very long time. i always thought the best use was an off-campus student dorm for rice and uh students, with rail access to both campuses. but i understand what they’re saying about the math not working, especially at these high interest rates, which would need to dramatically come down. hat tip to rich.developers focus on waller county as katy area grows. short article highlighting the importance of freeway-widening and affordable housing. hat tip nathan.metro needs to learn from the horrible expensive failures of denver rtd, which has been focused on rail for many years now.finally, hat tip to hugh for sending out this video of why florida and texas are booming (and ny and california are not) by economist joseph politano.labels: affordability, development, growth, home affordability, metro, rail, transit

just a few small items this week:charles blain in city journal: saddled with taxes and debt - houston-area leadership is losing touch with the fiscal restraint and pragmatism that made the city an engine of growth.how high-speed rail help sap japan's economic vitality. the lines look and operate great, but what you can't see is how they bankrupted japan and helped cause decades of lost growth.austin builds apartments and single-family houses, prices fall"i worried from afar that my hometown would meet the same fate as san francisco, the poster child of the housing shortage and all its associated woes. i feared that austin would become known as a playground for the rich, a city where displacement and mind-boggling home prices marred the natural beauty that once made it such a draw. in my hand-wringing, though, i'd overlooked one crucial detail: texas is better at building homes than almost anywhere else in the country.”there are differences between austin (and texas) and san francisco that, if not changed will continue to make it possible to build in austin (and texas) and nearly impossible in san francisco (and california). unincorporated county territory in texas is unzoned. that means that, barring environmental difficulties, developers and builders can build. by contrast, in the san francisco metro, and virtually all of california, draconian state and local regulations make it very difficult to build on greenfield sites, where land prices would be much lower if the market were permitted to operate."caught my eye from y-combinator demo day: xtraffic what it does: reduces congestion and accidents with smart traffic lightswhy it’s a fave: controlling traffic lights with ai sounds like the perfect application of this technology. xtraffic says that it’s already doing it in several cities in texas. i hope they make it to my town in california, too, because i sure am tired of waiting for the light to turn green when there are no other cars around.please get this houston!! finally, ending on a lighter note, maybe the first ever metro houston joke by a professional comedian?... 😅 (hat tip to jay)labels: affordability, development, governance, high-speed rail, home affordability, land-use regulation, metro, mobility strategies, rail, taxes

	 the best plan for housing is to plan less - nyt
	 
    
i've had this excellent nyt opinion piece queued up to share for a while, because it essentially argues for adopting the houston approach to housing regulation for the whole country: the best plan for housing is to plan less (no paywall gift link). in fact, houston shows up quite favorably in a lot of their excellent graphs.  below i share the opening, an ai summary of the main points, and the excellent conclusion that this deserves to be a bipartisan issue (bold highlights mine).---"i would be the first to argue that if an economist claims to know of a cure-all policy — a reliable way to relieve a long list of social ills in one fell swoop — common sense tells you to stop listening.so it is awkward for me to declare that i know of something close to a panacea policy: one big reform that would raise living standards, reduce wealth inequality, increase productivity, raise social mobility, help struggling men without college degrees, clean the planet and raise birth rates. it’s a sweeping reform that democrats and republicans, progressives and conservatives could all proudly support.the panacea policy i have in mind is housing deregulation. research confirms that there are large benefits in saying yes to tall buildings, yes to multifamily structures, yes to dense single-family development and yes to speedy permitting. the growing yimby (yes in my backyard) movement already has high-profile wins in minnesota, oregon, california and beyond, but even yimby devotees rarely appreciate the scope of the merits of loosening rules on housing.the economic argument for housing deregulation rests on basic supply and demand principles: allowing more construction leads to lower prices. this is evident in historical data, showing that housing prices were relatively stable before stricter regulations in the 1970s, while rising significantly afterwards.housing deregulation would directly improve the standard of living by significantly lowering housing costs, which currently represent a significant portion of the average american's budget.the distributional effects of deregulation would be impactful in reducing wealth inequality, as rising home values have been a key driver of the growing disparity between the rich and the poor.deregulation would enhance social mobility by removing barriers to moving to higher-wage areas. current strict regulations often make the cost of living in such regions outweigh any potential wage gains, discouraging relocation for many.deregulation would create numerous job opportunities in the construction sector, a large and well-paying industry, particularly benefiting men without college degrees, who have faced challenges in the job market.environmental protection is a common rationale for restricting construction, but deregulation can actually lead to more sustainable practices by encouraging denser housing in urban areas, resulting in lower carbon emissions.while concerns exist about homeowner resistance, the bigger obstacle to deregulation is public misunderstanding of basic economic principles, with many believing that increased housing supply will not lead to lower prices.neither democrats nor republicans have embraced housing deregulation yet. yimby activists lean left, but they are only one voice in the progressive coalition. republican states usually have less housing regulation, but more from tradition than from principle. yet, given housing deregulation’s many demonstrated benefits, this policy agenda deserves bipartisan support. democrats should cheer the effects on equality, social mobility and the environment. republicans should be delighted to see free markets spreading broad prosperity, creating new working-class opportunities and fostering family formation. in a rational world, the panacea policy of housing deregulation would be a done deal. hopefully whoever wins the next election will agree."labels: affordability, density, development, economic strategy, governance, home affordability, land-use regulation, opportunity urbanism, perspectives, politics, yimby

	 next big moonshot for houston? tx will pass ca and htx will pass la, auto vs. transit job access and realism
	 
    
 a few smaller misc items this week:texas will surpass california, and both dfw and houston will pass la in population over the next 40 years. "the american future seems to be more lone star state than a golden one."houston public media/npr asks "what could be the next big moonshot for houston?" among the answers, clean energy struck me as the most ambitious and most appropriate for houston (ideally cost-effective carbon capture!). my own suggestion for a houston moonshot? metro could aspire to offer half-hour or less express trip times from every park-and-ride and transit center to every major job center and both airports using a network of max lanes. a high goal but very achievable and it would support houston's growth for decades to come. more on it here.new geography: auto vs. transit job access ratios for the top 50 metro areas (hat tip to bill). essentially comparing how many jobs are accessible by car within 30 mins (the typical commute) vs. by transit. a houstonian can access 97.3 times (!) as many jobs by car than by transit within the same commute time. even in nyc with excellent transit a car can still reach 9.7 more jobs than transit in the same time. the conclusion is compelling:where for transit from here?with this minimal transit use relative to the auto and especially in view of the huge transit market share losses since the pandemic, it would seem useful to rethink the role of transit.transit does well for work trips to the largest downtown niche markets (new york, chicago, philadelphia, boston, washington, and san francisco), though pre-pandemic market shares are unlikely to be replicated in the future because of the popularity of hybrid and remote work, lower office occupancy and the likely improvement in virtual meeting technology.the reality is that transit is not a substitute for the auto and there isn’t enough money to make it one. professor jean-claude ziv and i found that making the auto a genuine alternative to transit could be prohibitively costly, annually requiring the entire metropolitan area gross domestic product in some cases. this would leave nothing else for anything else.it would be foolhardy to suggest that transit is an alternative to the auto (despite this having sbeen implied by federal, state, and local policy for decades of decline), in a non-utopian world, no reasonable increase in subsidies could make it so.it may be best to identify the small areas within metro areas where transit could actually be an alternative to auto. this would be in neighborhoods where automobile ownership is particularly low, which, in most metros are also areas of greater economic need. investing billions more to coax middle class commuters off the roads seems a daft approach given the realities.labels: census, growth, max lanes, metro, mobility strategies, perspectives, transit

	 metro+dart ridership update: summer slump and beryl erase spring gains
	 
    

this week we have another great analytical guest post from oscar slotboom. dallas dart's extensive and expensive light rail strategy is looking more and more like a total failure as suburban cities try to reduce their tax subsidy to dart.---

when i last reported on metro ridership in april, ridership had reached a post-covid high in february, down only 14.7% from the 12-month pre-covid average. an upward bump in april pushed ridership to another post-covid high at only 13.5% below the pre-covid level. summer months are usually low ridership months, and hurricane beryl caused metro service outages during the week of july 9-12. july ridership was 22.3% below the pre-covid average. however, in spite of the substantial service outages due to beryl, july ridership was only slightly lower than june. so we can probably expect a strong rebound, especially since september and october are normally the highest ridership months.

  


in dallas, june ridership (page 55) was 23% below the pre-covid baseline. as the plot shows, ridership has been flat in the last 9 months, appearing to end the four-year trend of slow recovery. it's interesting to note that the image shown below mentions that on-demand services are included in the ridership data, but a version of this plot presented one month earlier (page 4) without any mention of on-demand services showed ridership down 28%.
 multiple member cities of dart, including plano, are attempting to reduce their tax subsidies to dart.
	


nationally, public transit ridership is down 25% compared to pre-covid levels and appears to be holding steady with little or no upward trend. of course, there are wide variations in performance by city and houston is above average.
