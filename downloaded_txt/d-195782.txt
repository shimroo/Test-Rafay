this server provides information about mineralogy and is
primarily dedicated to providing information about color in
minerals and access to data on mineral absorption
spectra
in the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum and raman
spectra of minerals. most data on the server were obtained in
the caltech mineral spectroscopy labs. other types of
spectroscopic data on minerals are also available. 
visible, near-infrared and infrared absorption spectra are
available for a number of minerals. examples include common
rock-forming minerals, gem minerals, and other minerals of
particular interest.

files   
this is the ever growing list of the
minerals
available on this server. available are single crystal optical spectra,
some ir spectra, and links to other data sites with reflectance data,
emission specra,mössbauer spectra, and luminescence data. under the
single crystal transmission data link, data are
available both as images of the spectra and as ascii text with x,y
format
following two header lines, plus many references to the spectra of
minerals.. 
 data
from our publications

this
is a list of all our publications with many links to
abstracts of the
papers, and sometimes graphics or even links to the data in the papers.
   
extensive
references to mineral optical spectroscopic data are available
numerous references are
found in our  mineral

learn
why minerals have the colors they do
be sure to see the sections illustrating
and
explaining the origin of color
in minerals. you can learn about metal ions in crystals,
intervalence charge transfer, and radiation-induced colors. 
many examples are shown and explained.

the raman is back in service with
a new computer.
all former data files and search libraries were lost.
mineral search libraries have been restored.
