hello there, thanks for coming to our web site. allow me to
      introduce myself, my name is "parsley", or to give you my
      full title "sir parsley button", that sounds really grand doesn't
      it.
i am here to give you a little insight into bobtails. the reason that
      its me doing this is because they keep saying it's all my fault that they
      started this rescue and re-homing thing.
>> about bobtails






 




meet the residents! some
      of us cannot be re-homed for whatever reason, you
      know, homicidal bunnies that go for the throat or ankles, (those of you
      that remember monty python will understand) or those of us that have special needs,
      like regular teeth trimming and eye problems, well, they let us live out our natural lives
      with them.
>> meet the residents
meet the guests, those
      passing through on the way to finding new, loving mums and dads.
      here you can read about us bunny's looking for a new place to call
      home.
