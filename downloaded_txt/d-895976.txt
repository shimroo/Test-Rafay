04/20/08 moved to a new hosting after a brief downtime. 
12/06/04 in an effort to pretend that i'm still working on scorch i have fixed top 100 and  pages so they should actually work most of the time now.
02/16/04 you can now get info about any user here
02/14/04 you can now see the list of top 100 players here
02/08/04 we moved to yet another new hosting. we're hoping it will
solve most of the problems our server has been having.
04/28/02 you can now look at the server state (# of active players etc) here















 
scorched earth 2000 is a remake of the old classic game by wendell hicken which was very popular in the early 1990s.  this version is relatively close to the original but adds online multiplayer support (up to 8 people), high scores table and a community big enough to make finding opponents easy.
scorched earth 2000 is an open source project so if you are curious how this stuff works you can actually take a 
peek inside.
... screenshots? why would you want them? the game is just one click away! pick the resolution you like and start playing. hint: game is not optimized for 640x480; it's playable but some of the guis do not completely fit on the screen.
if you really need to see the screenshots you can take a look at the user manual.
