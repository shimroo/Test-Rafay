family owned & operated since 1967
crystal woods golf course, a pioneering semi-private/daily fee golf haven in mchenry county, boasts a rich history and a transformative journey. originally crafted by the esteemed bill langford in the early 1950s as bit o’ heather g.c., this 9-hole, par 37 gem underwent a remarkable evolution. in 1967, charles wagstaff ingeniously merged tradition with innovation, expanding it into an 18-hole, par 72 masterpiece.
under the visionary leadership of owners richard and mary ann craig, crystal woods not only expanded its horizons but also set a new standard in golf course design and accessibility. officially reopening in the summer of 1969, it stands as a testament to enduring quality and a unique golfing experience.
