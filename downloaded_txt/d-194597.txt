“this song was born out of a 2020 experiment. during the pandemic, with everything paused and the future of touring up in the air, i dove into recording from home and started exploring new creative ideas. one day, i got a unique request from a man who wanted a song to capture the story of his relationship with his wife. his words really struck me, especially when he said, ‘like anyone else, we’ve had our ups and downs.’ that line sparked something, and soon i was pulling from my own experiences to bring this song together.“ – rob derhak“ups and downs” is the first single from circle of giants, moe.’s 14th studio album, dropping january 31st on fatboy records / ato records.pre-order the album here: https://moe.shop.musictoday.com/dept/circle-of-giants
