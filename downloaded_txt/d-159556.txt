premier hunting. unrivaled experience. 














home of the best hunting for over 200 years.



this area is still prime and pristine, truly a hunters’ paradise. you will truly enjoy the “outback of america”.


























the lewis and clark expedition spent more time in north dakota than any other state. the explorers were enchanted by this area. lewis wrote in his journal on may 5, 1805, “the country is as yesterday, beautiful in the extreme.” they saw more game enroute from their winter camp at fort mandan to where the yellowstone enters the missouri river than anywhere else on their journey. fred’s attention to detail ensures that your hunt will be the experience of a lifetime. he has maintained the pristine landscape in its natural state and focuses on creating the best habitat for wild game. if you come to the ttt ranch, you will truly enjoy the “outback of america”.
