cleanskiesthis is the livejournal of jeremy day/jeremy dennis/cleanskies. this journal is mostly of historic interest, although it remains one of my more valued reminders of the early social web. i published a proto web-comic here between the years of 2001-14, by which time that sort of thing was mainstream and had its own superstars, and i had moved into working in other online spaces. you can find out some of what i did then and do now by searching for me on other channels, though not all of it. as the web has become a space of ubiquity, the more personal forms of expression move away, or become more performative, with all the additional demands on time, energy and attention that involves. we retire. we change. we move on.current projects include experimental audio-video-electro band means of production.merch, music, gigs and more for means of production:means of production bandcamp & contact detailshttps://mnsfprdctn.bandcamp.com/https://www.instagram.com/mnsfprdctn/https://twitter.com/mnsfprdctnmeans of production on mastodonupcoming shows: follow us on insta or bluesky for updates (other channels are available).2024 shows: we went out of town! headed out to the apothecary tap, banbury, and supporting mancbeth at band on the wall, manchester, along with the usual round of shows in oxford.merch, t-shirts & tracks for sale. no physical music items at the moment, sorry.contact mnsfprdctn@gmail.com for booking enquiries.

next gig - very short notice


6th may, 2024 at 7:44 pm



 


cleanskiesnext gig coming very soon. we were both having a very busy friday when the gig offer came up, "it's a bit soon, but" and we were oh-sure-yeah and said yes...about thirty-five minutes before the invites to eurovison parties started coming in. eh, oops.next gig: the port mahon, saturday 11th may. set your pvr if you're a eurovision lover, or shake the dust of saturday evening entertainment from your feet if you're a eurovision hater, and and head out for a sweaty gig in an upstairs room in a pub. we promise to be noisy.fresh out of purdah (pre-election period as it is in modern) we will be embracing the controversy, and playing an infrastructure and society focused set, including our exploration of oxford's own massive powershift issue, high traffic neighbourhood, preview below: as ever you can purchase that track and others from the mnsfprdctn bandcamp, along with a few other bits of paper, vinyl ... oh, and our new white label t-shirt, of course. you can find our stuff in other places, too, and if it proves elusive, look again, without the vowels.

mini art-book / single and upcoming gig(s)


9th apr, 2023 at 6:14 pm



 


cleanskiesin the post-physical musical world, i find myself making things nevertheless, again and again. a t-shirt, a download card. neon-bright badges. the latest thing? i remembered the little art-books i made when i last needed to share physical photos with people. and i thought, could i make one the same size as a cd, and have a download code inside them?yeah: pretty much.it was a bit smaller than i intended, but the result was pleasing overall. purchase link for means of production mini artbook single resuscitation status. comes with full lyrics, download code, badge.so, there's that, and then there are upcoming gigs -- one is at the port mahon thursday 20th april rescheduled date tbc. more coming soon.
