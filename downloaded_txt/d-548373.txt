 what is the best approach to hipaa-compliant email?

in today’s environment, email strategies that balance security and hipaa compliance with targeted, personalized engagement present huge opportunities to improve patient and customer experiences, improve outcomes and reduce costs.dedicated infrastructures, flexible encryption and automated capabilities can ensure your email performance is optimized for every recipient and campaign.







 can i send hipaa-compliant emails to anyone with luxsci?

yes. luxsci secureline™ technology enables you to send hipaa-compliant email to anyone with an email address. your recipients do not need to use luxsci themselves.







can my recipients securely reply and still be hipaa-compliant?

yes. recipients of your secure email messages can reply to you and maintain hipaa compliance.







when and where does luxsci encrypt email?

when you send an email message using luxsci, from either your mobile device or your email program, that message is transmitted securely to luxsci servers using tls.once the message arrives, luxsci encrypts the message for each of your recipients and then delivers the encrypted message to the recipient’s email servers. based on your account preferences, who the recipients are, where their email host is, and settings in your account, the encryption used can take the form of: smtp tls, secure message pick up (escrow), pgp, or s/mime. the type of encryption used is dynamically determined at send time.
