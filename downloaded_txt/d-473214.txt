“my first season using woodchuck salad, i caught 22 groundhogs.”sally s., amazon customer



“i've caught five red squirrels within the first three days of getting it. it couldn't be easier; just a little bit of the squirrel jelly on the bait block, set it, and wait for a tail to be hanging out the bottom.”mike h., amazon customer
