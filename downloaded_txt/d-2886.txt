tattoofinder.com no longer sells designs / stencils



as of december 28th, 2014 tattoofinder.com permanently discontinued the sale of  artwork -- tattoo designs and stencils specifically created for use as tattoo reference. the tattoofinder.com website was the right idea, at the right time, and was conceived and constructed in the right way. but  as is inevitable in life, times change. 
we had a great run for many years helping people find their "perfect tattoo designs" and providing opportunities for some of the worlds best artists to profitably share their talents with millions of people around the world. a heart-felt thanks goes out to all  who  supported and enjoyed the use of tattoofinder.com over the years! 
note: all tattoofinder.com website systems, databases and image storage capabilities have been taken offline. any designs & stencils previously purchased on tattoofinder.com are no longer available to past customers for downloading or printing, nor can designs and/or stencils be emailed or otherwise provided to past customers. please see the section below for more details.


information for previous tattoofinder.com customers


 one of the greatest benefits of the tattoofinder.com sale model was that designs & stencils were available to download and/or print immediately after a purchase was made. our product agreement customers agreed to when making a purchase included the  value added service that allowed customers to return to their purchased artwork at a later date to access purchased designs & stencils as long as we were able to provide this service. unfortunately, this service can no longer be provided to past customers.
we took the following steps to notify customers that the tattoofinder.com website would be shutting down its sales of tattoo designs & stencils on december 28, 2014 and that downloading/printing of designs & stencils would no longer be available after that date:

we emailed all tattoofinder.com customers and website visitors who had verified their account email addresses with us to notify them of this information
we created a transitional notification page with this information that was displayed to all tattoofinder.com website visitors upon entering the tattoofinder.com website 
we disseminated this information through our various social media outlets, including facebook, twitter, pinterest, google+, tumblr, as well as putting the information out through the tattoofinder.com rss/news feed.

taking the above steps to notify customers that tattoofinder.com would be shutting down its sales of tattoo designs & stencils on december 28th, 2014 and notifying customers that they would be unable to access (download/print) previously purchased designs & stencils after this date constituted an earnest effort to deal fairly with our valued customers.
 again, all tattoofinder.com website systems, databases and image storage capabilities have been taken offline. any designs & stencils previously purchased on tattoofinder.com are no longer available to past customers for downloading or printing, nor can designs and/or stencils be emailed or otherwise provided to past customers. additionally, due to our privacy policies with our artists, we are unable to provide tattoo seekers with artist contact information. if you want to contact a tattoofinder.com artist directly, your best bet is to do an internet search on their artist name and see if they make their own personal webpage or facebook page available to the public.
