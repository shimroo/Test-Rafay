mindful timber products for architectural and interior design applications.
























ambro has developed methods to turn the recovery of used timber into a viable commercial reality.














introductionambro is a distinguished supplier of wood based engineered products for the building and construction industries. our emphasis on sustainability and the rejuvenation of natural timber resources means that ambro products are perfect for the environmentally conscious. we have developed a product which uses either new or recycled timber through our savewood™ technology. our high quality finishes will suit a broad range of applications enabling sophisticated and practical products to be created.














reclaimed timberambro’s vision, strengthened recently by world recognition of the ‘2050’ no emission vision, acknowledges the importance of maximising timber in its natural state to create products that can be appreciated for decades to come. our timber is sourced through two avenues:it is resourced from wineries that use oak staves to flavour wine. due to the characteristics required this timber is imported from various countries around the world.collected from discarded sites or ‘old timber’ yards.traditionally, the timber we source and reuse was being burnt or dumped as waste. re-processing old timber has been labeled too expensive. we have developed methods to turn the recovery of used timber into a viable commercial reality. ambro maximises the lifespan of timber in its natural state to create products that can be appreciated for decades to come.
