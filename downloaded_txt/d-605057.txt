							featured customer story						
our attempts to mitigate power automate’s limitations by inserting reminders and notifications to the user like, ‘hey, this instance is about to expire. do something with it,’ didn’t always work. so, instance failure rate was the metric that we wanted to change. with nintex, the 20% failure rate we experienced in power automate dropped significantly.

nintex focuses on process automation and they are very good at it. any business process an organization has that requires approvals and especially where those approvals vary (e.g., higher request po amount requires more approvals) are well suited to automation with the nintex platform. nintex also has a robotic process automation (rpa) tool, which allows for automation of manual processes using any software accessible by a user's workstation. and nintex offers a process mapping tool that allows organizations to map business processes (manual or automated) in a standardized manner in a central portal.
