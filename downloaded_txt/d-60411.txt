(temporary?) change of address

for the time being, new sore eyes content can be found at http://blog.thebeard.org. at some point old content hosted here might be moving over there, or that content might be moved over here.

the billion-dollar book of the dead

a neat little slice of science fiction from robin sloan, published in mit technology review: elyse flayme and the final flood. molly khan had written six books in as many years, starting with elyse flayme and the ice queen, surprise best seller, first in the series that became the heir—at last—to potter. even better, this… continue reading the billion-dollar book of the dead

frasier returns

in a perfect world, this would be the frasier sequel coming to paramount+ for at least one season. i’d like to imagine the returning show will live up to the reputation it earned back in the day when i used to enjoy it on friday nights on channel 4. the original show got lucky to… continue reading frasier returns

mapping

by some margin my favourite read this weekend: shadows on maps are getting a lot more exciting, and here’s why… as cartographers, we want to make beautiful maps that grab our readers’ attention. sometimes we wish our maps could jump out of the screen or off the page, and with a recent trend in cartography… continue reading mapping
