refused reunion - atd-i confirmed





yeah, this is getting out of hand. refused is on the coachella 2012 line-up along with at the drive-in, which is kind of aggravating, but hopefully both bands do very ridiculous things at the shit show festival.read their (uh) communique here.talk about it on teh forums here.refused - rather be dead (who doesn't know the lyrics?)also, what do you think about this whole situation? do you think refused should be doing this by playing festivals or are they just too big for smaller venues? similar questions with at the drive-in... also, does this mean that ryan gosling will eventually be introduced to skram gods loma prieta and join the cmhwak community? do you think he already lurks?
