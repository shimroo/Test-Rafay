axe haven guitar restoration and complete repair service
though axe haven began in 1971 as a guitar repair facility  you will find much more happening here. if you are in need of any stringed instrument repair you can call dan at 303-428-1327 or stop by axe haven at 7892 north federal in westminster, colorado. calling first is always a good idea just in case he has stepped out.
if you are looking for a place to leave your treasured guitar for a minor adjustment or a major restoration you have found the right place.
browse through this site to see a small sampling of work done by dan in the past four decades. 
check out the pages showing the guitars he has built since 1974 (two are shown on the left with links to detailed pages) as well as the many impressive restorations he has preformed! in the gallery you will find a few customers with their guitars.
dan is not one to subscribe to the notion of all work and no play but his play also involves a lot of work. you can see two of his most recent auto projects here.
the fiero is the third drag race car he has built.
the chevelle is his first auto restoration. 
both are built with a creative eye to detail.
