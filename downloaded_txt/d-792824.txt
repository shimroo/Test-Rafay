            cltc® certification for long-term care educates professionals in the fields of insurance, financial services, law and accounting about the severe consequences
            a need for care over an extended period of years would have, not on their client, but on the emotional, physical and financial wellbeing of those the client loves.
            the goal is to give these professionals the proper skill set to discuss those consequences, offer a plan to mitigate them, and when appropriate, recommend long-term care insurance as a funding source for that plan.

helping professionals succeed in the changing world of long-term care planning
the cltc® (certification in long-term care) program was created in 1999.  it focuses on the discipline of extended care planning.  it provides professionals the critical tools necessary to discuss the subject of longevity and its consequences on their client's family and finances. students learn how to mitigate these consequences by developing a plan to protect their clients and their families.
the designation has been recognized and supported by the american college, cfp board, naifa, nahu and major insurance carriers.  the designation may be obtained through our two day live cltc master class or online ecltc.
