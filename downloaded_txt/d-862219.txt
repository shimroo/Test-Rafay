delivering an award-winning project during a pandemicthe city of sacramento’s safe credit union convention center named apwa’s 2021 project of the year

the city of sacramento’s safe credit union convention center was named american public works association’s (apwa) 2021 project of the year. built out from the old convention center and the first expansion since 1996, the new $254 million center allows the city to maximize the use of the building and put sacramento back on the map.

cost modeling & benchmarking library projectsthrough the use of cost modeling, ocmi’s solutions help our clients see at a project through a holistic cost management perspective.

libraries are essential to our communities, in most instances relying heavily on local and community funding. when it comes to these cost-sensitive projects, through our cost modeling expertise, ocmi has helped our clients to accurately plan for and budget their projects, identify benchmarks to better locate where the costs lie and resolve any budget challenges during the project’s life cycle.

 building better with pull planningthe pull planning process is a way for contractors and owners to collaborate, improve a project’s schedule, and build teamwork.

on nearly all ocmi construction projects, our schedulers, project managers, and others routinely engage in pull planning sessions to improve a project’s schedule, avoid rework, and foresee potential issues or constraints early on. pull planning is a collective process that ultimately delivers a better project and cultivates a stronger team environment.
