about mt rugby the mtsu rugby football club was started in the fall of 1980. as with any start-up ventures, the club had its share of ups and downs and many times the team had to pick up players from opponents so the game could be played. the club survived and slowly built up a roster of colorful characters that helped to mold the team. in those early years, the club was outfitted by many non-students and the team did not participate in the official national collegiate championship series. 

mtsu rugby is now thriving, and maintains an excellent relationship with the university, as well as continued succession the pitch.
