guest reviews


excellent location at the heart of downtown new york. very friendly and willing to help staff. staff. we stayed for more than a month there and it easily felt like home. nice rooms especially those facing broadway street.

the cosmopolitan hotel is the best kept secret in tribeca. the rooms are comfortable, stylish and clean. the staff is extremely helpful and go over and above the call to accommodate whatever i needed. i will surely stay there every time i am in nyc.
- elizabeth m


this was our second stay in the last year. we had a refurbished deluxe king room, which i recommend. for nyc the price is very good. although small our room was exceptionally clean and the bathroom spotless. the staff is friendly and the two nights we were there it was quiet. i booked online, but confirmed directly with andre (i believe that was his name). he was extremely cordial! i have no need for a view, so i don't request a street view which could be noisy. our son lives nearby, so this is our hotel of choice when he has too many visitors : )
