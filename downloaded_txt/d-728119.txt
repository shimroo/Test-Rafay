truly unconventional wisdom
in 1968, our department was established to critically study religion at a time when it was standard to think about religion only as the study of theology and ethics in philosophy departments.

religion matters
whatever you think of it, whether you are devoutly religious or are somewhere in-between, religion is a very big deal. it shapes the people we are and the communities we live in. it influences how we interact with our sexualities and the natural environment. while religion can fill our personal lives with meaning, it can also foster intolerance, ignorance, and even hatred and violence on a social level. it affects our sensibilities around ethnicity, class, and race; our attitudes about medicine, contraception, and the end of life; and our approaches to poverty, immigration, social justice, and war. religion is everywhere. religion matters. 




welcome to the department of religion!
we are a community of scholars whose critical investigations and articulations put us on the cutting edge of innovative scholarship, grounded in critical research, textual study, phenomenology and historiography. we deploy a methodological pluralism and work in diverse areas, which include: historical and text-critical analyses of culturally and regionally diverse religious traditions; psychological and sociological analyses of religious and spiritual phenomena; and cultural and theological analyses of religious ritual and thought. read more >
