when installing a track, we work with the owner to make sure the land meets the suitability standards for the lay of the land as well as the soil composition. these factors are imperative for fill, drainage and locating rocks below ground’s surface. most of the tracks are a minimum of five to six furlongs and span about 32 rectangular acres.
