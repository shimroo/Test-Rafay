football stars nations the end of shin tae-yong era: indonesian football’s turning point 
january 27, 2025january 27, 2025 admin 



the surprising decision to part ways with shin tae-yong, the south korean coach who transformed indonesian football, has sparked waves of discussion among fans and experts alike. after five years of dedicated service, shin tae-yong bid farewell to indonesia following his dismissal on january 6, 2025, just two days shy of his five-year anniversary as head coach.
fans and analysts are stunned by choice to split ways with shin tae-yong, the south korean coach who turned indonesian football into something else entirely. after five years of leading the national team, shin officially bid farewell on january 6, 2025, just two days before the end of his contract. though pssi controversially dismissed shin, he left behind a legacy that raised indonesia’s footballing profile to a degree not seen in decades.
shin and his coaching crew left indonesia for south korea on the evening of january 26, 2025; they also left an emotional farewell at soekarno-hatta airport. gathering to appreciate the coach who had committed himself to the national squad, thousands of indonesian fans the audience produced a fantastic environment, held banners with kind and appreciative messages and sang songs of thankfulness. shin bid farewell to the supporters who had helped him all during his career, who were moved.

shin visited the minister of youth and sports, dito ariotedjo, at his apartment in jakarta before leaving. during this encounter, shin expressed his great love for indonesia and his intentions to continue helping the nation grow in football via the shin tae-yong football academy. this program seeks to develop a strong basis for the following national teams and cultivate emerging indonesian talents.
minister dito thanked shin for his significant contributions to indonesian football. “the commitment and devotion of coach shin to indonesian football have been priceless. thank you on behalf of the people of indonesia and the government,” stated dito. he also gave him a batik fabric with football designs to show shin’s gratitude. shin returned with ginseng, a gift meant to represent friendship and respect.
the time shin tae-yong spent was transformative. when he took control in december 2019, the indonesian football team struggled internationally and placed 173rd in fifa’s world rankings. under his direction, the team ascended to 127th, an incredible feat for the nation, and entered the third round of the 2026 world cup asian qualifiers. this time was the first time indonesia had progressed this far in the tournament, and they even had some quite outstanding performances, drawing against australia and defeating saudi arabia.
shin’s impact went beyond ratings. he contributed discipline, tactical understanding, and a winning mindset to the team. indonesia made it to the final of the covid-delayed 2020 aff cup, the first big event they had not been able to do in the past. leading the team to the afc asian cup in 2024, indonesia’s first visit in 17 years. they eliminated in the round of sixteen, but their performance was excellent and highlighted the development under shin’s direction.
notwithstanding these achievements, shin’s rapport with pssi, indonesia’s football body, grew sour. pssi chairman erick thohir attributed shin’s removal to the necessity of improved communication and plan execution. “we need a leader who can better align with the players and implement agreed-upon strategies,” erick said in front of reporters. reactions to the ruling were not all positive. although many supporters thanked shin for his achievements, others worried the choice would bring indonesian football backward.
in south korea, where shin is admired for his accomplishments, the news of his leaving also resonated. with some even advocating his comeback as head coach of the south korean national team, many south korean supporters saw his time in indonesia as evidence of his coaching prowess. given shin’s advancement with the indonesian team, many considered his departure sudden and unfair.
with a press conference set for the next day, pssi said beforehand that a new head coach would take charge on january 11, 2025. still, replacing a coach as powerful as shin yong is not easy. given indonesia’s competition for a world cup seat, the new coach will be under enormous pressure to maintain momentum and produce results. their upcoming games in march, including a challenging away game against australia, will be vital.
in indonesia, shin leaves a legacy of hope and development. he raised the caliber of the national squad and inspired players and supporters equally. the founding of the shin tae-yong football academy highlights his dedication to indonesian football even after he left. one thing is sure, though: shin tae-yong has permanently changed indonesian football, even if the future is still unknown.

officiating better officiating? euro 2024 will use a video assistant referee team 
june 9, 2024april 23, 2024 admin 



today, the sanctity of sportsmanship in football has prompted governing bodies to use modern technology. with the next euro coming, uefa’s announcement to use the video assistant referee (var) team marks a good change in the officiating standards – which you can learn more about here.

setting the stage for fair play
football lies in its unpredictability and pure brilliance. however, detecting and correcting errors have often overshadowed its beauty. technology can be used to minimize these errors – which is why the decision to use var at euro 2024 has well-received. this can empower referees with more insights, enabling them to foster a fairer competition.
how var works
the var system is a network of cameras and broadcast technology, which is designed to assist the on-field referee. this can greatly impact the football game’s outcome.
this system focuses on four key types of incidents: goals and offenses leading up to a goal, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and mistaken identity in awarding a card. the var team reviews the footage and communicates with the referee to ensure that the decisions are accurate.
lessons from the past, looking to the future
the adoption of var in international and domestic leagues shows its impact on the football game. while it has sparked debates regarding the pace of the game and spontaneity, the sentiment remains positive.
the system has notably reduced errors in game-changing situations. this has validated its purpose in correcting clear mistakes. as euro 2024 approaches, the refinement of var protocols and training for officials are now made to ensure seamless application into the tournament.
the promise of enhanced officiating
using var in euro 2024 will uphold the integrity of the sport. this can be done by ensuring that all teams have an equal chance of success, devoid of officiating oversights.
this technological advancement promises to deliver a level of transparency and fairness that aligns with the values of competitive sports. by providing referees with the tools to confirm calls, the hope is to sideline controversies that have diminished the game’s enjoyment and focus.
a new era for football
as football continues to evolve with advancements in training, strategy, and officiating, using a video assistant referee at euro 2024 symbolizes a shift towards embracing technology in ensuring fairness and accuracy.
while the system is not without some issues, the consensus leans towards a future where technology and human judgment will finally converge. this is needed to celebrate the footballing sport in its purest form. with this, the upcoming euro is poised to give a brighter future to football officiating.

the impact of club performance
his development at the club level has seen him refine his skills to adapt to high-pressure situations. this experience could be what separates a good tournament performance from a title-winning campaign.
a seasoned campaigner in club football’s biggest stages could transfer that relentless drive and winning mentality to the national squad, inspiring confidence and a relentless pursuit of victory.
