  mission 
	of this apostolate the triumph of mary's immaculate 
	heart
	     
















the living rosary association was paulineâs inspired plan to save the church in france and encourage everyone to learn 
their faith through catholic books. the association began its devotion of distributing fifteen decadess of the 
rosary to fifteen persons in several parishes on dec. 8, 1826. the association was formally approved by 
pope gregory xvi and accorded canonical status on jan. 27, 1832.
 
on dec. 8, 1986, richard and patricia joann melvin, married for more than 30 years, began a revival of pauline jaricotâs living rosary lay apostolate in an effort to honor our blessed mother and 
st. philomena. what originated with less than 30 people dedicated to praying a daily decade of the rosary (some took more than on decade) has grown to more than 11 million devoted christians around the 
world, all praying their dedicated decade of the rosary each day of every year.
 

	today, over 12 million
	souls,,
	
	



 faithful servants, are joined worldwide through the living rosary 
	and united with mary in prayer one decade at a time to hasten the triumph of 
	her immaculate heart and to bring about the reign of jesus christ the king..
 

 

share your gift of faith
 
for centuries, our cherished catholic faith has been passed from 
person to person, parent to child, etc. each of us carries in our heart a 
special memory of how god first graced us with the knowledge of the faith and 
how our blessed mother, saint philomena, blessed pauline jaricot and 
other saints changed our lives and brought us closer to christ.. 
in our work in the universal living rosary association, we see first hand 
how millions of souls are currently living without that knowledge of god and are 
living outside of his grace. we have been given a beautiful opportunity to carry 
out christ's work and pass on our faith and blessings to others who would 
otherwise never be introduced to our lord, the savior of all mankind. just as we 
pray for the souls in purgatory who have no one to pray for them, we should also 
make it a part of our life's mission to pass on our faith to as many souls as 
possible who have no one else to pass it on to them, who don't know our lord and 
his promise of salvation.. 



this is the box we send to the foreign missions: on your behalf. you donate the shipping (which keeps rising, both internationally and domesticily), bringing the total to: $170. it contains 
rosaries, scapulars, miraculous medals, cord & oil, 
newsletters, calendars, catechism books, 2 tan books, large color prints, lists 
and encouragement for our promoters..










 

 
the power of the rosary
pope leo xiii said, "there is nothing more excellent than that numerous voices pray without interruption from 
all parts of the world, simultaneously lifting up supplications to the blessed virgin mary as they meditate on the mysteries of the holy
rosary."
		say the rosary every day, to obtain peace for the world..
	â our lady of fatima
the living rosary is a continuation of the rosary given to st. dominic by our blessed mother, while he was 
combating the albigensian heresy in the south of france, during the thirteenth century. our blessed mother asked st. dominic to spread devotion to christ by saying 
the rosary and meditating on the life of christ, each and every day.


 
the mission of the universal living rosary association: --
what we do.
 



  
 
fruits of your funds

	may christ dwell in our hearts through faith, and may charity be the 
	root and foundation of our life..
	â cf. eph 3:177
following the example of the blessed pauline jaricot, who founded the work 
of "a penny a week" for the propagation of the faith, you and your family may 
also consider dedicating monetary support equivalent to a meal a month or other 
offering to the living rosary/. the majority of the members of the living 
rosaryy are in third world countries. every donation received goes directly 
	back into this universal and heroic missionary effort through the 
	distribution of catholic literature, holy cards and sacramentals such as the 
	holy oil of st. philomena.
 
universal living rosary association of saint philomen is a nonprofit corporation 501(c)(3) 
charitable organization and as such we automatically give "tax receipts" to all 
those who make a financial donation. for those who donate $100 or more, a 
"triduum of masses" will be arranged for the donor and his/her family. thirty 
dollars of every $100 donated supports the missionary who will offer these 
masses. through your help, the prayers of the missions will continue to work 
miracles in the lives of all of its members and families, thus strengthening the 
mystical body of christ. another option is to donate $50 to cover 
	the flat rate to send a parcel of materials and sacramentals to the missions 
	abroad. god bless you for your generosity.
 





 
 
 

please support the missions by donating rosaries, scapulars, old missals, 
medals, holy cards. to the missions, nothing goes to waste and all is placed 
carefully with a reliable catechist or missionary.
