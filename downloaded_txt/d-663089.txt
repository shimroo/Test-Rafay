	 galatians 1:2-5
	 
    

"-and all the brothers with me, to the churches in galatia:  grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ, who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our god and father, to whom be glory for ever and ever. amen."the first thing that strikes me is the reminder that jesus gave himself for our sins. with that reminder comes all the details of what he went through here on earth (the betrayal, the waiting for the soldiers to come take him, the beating, torture, ridicule, and then death on the cross) and then what happened afterward (he returned to life, he let himself be seen here on earth, and then he went to sit at the right hand of the father and is reigning in heaven still).  it is so humbling to have this reminder of how much god sacrificed for us when i know full well how many times i have failed to do what is right. which of course brings to mind just what paul has prayed for in verse 3:  "grace and peace ...from god our father and the lord jesus christ." only god's grace can forgive us our sins and bring us peace in spite of them. the peace which god gives is not hindered by circumstance, but surpasses all understanding and is an incredibly precious gift.isn't it interesting that paul begins his letter with a prayer? imagine if you began the letters- or in this day and age, emails- that you wrote with a prayer. how might that effect the content of your letters?  i imagine it would certainly change the tone of my letters or in the very least shift my mindset as i wrote them. certainly it may not be wise to begin a letter to some nonbelievers with a prayer. they would likely be offended or at least annoyed, but perhaps we could adapt a different form of this. see, i think that the prayer at the beginning of paul's letter is a reflection of the fact that he was constantly praying and thus it just naturally came out in his writing. so, as a step in that direction, perhaps we could develop a new habit and try taking a moment to pray before we write our letters or send our emails.  what do you think?

	 galatians 1:1-2
	 
    

"paul, an apostle - sent not from men nor by man, but by jesus christ and god the father, who raised him from the dead - and all the brothers with me, to the churches in galatia:"here paul establishes that his authority is in christ and not in man.  i think this is a wonderful reminder for all of us that we are not sent or made by man or to please man, but instead were have been created by christ and he has placed us where and when we are for his divine purpose.  our purpose is greater than us. we need to be focused not on what we want to get out of our life, but to continually seek what god wants from us. why has he placed us where we are? what is his purpose for us? are we seeking to fulfill our purpose as described by the bible? are we focused on god or ourselves? when we make a decision is god foremost in our minds?

	 galations 1- an apostle
	 
    

"paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by jesus christ, and god the father, who raised him from the dead;)...........for if i yet pleased men, i should not be the servant of christ. but i certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. for i neither received it of man, neither was i taught [it], but by the revelation of jesus christ............to reveal his son in me, that i might preach him among the heathen; immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood: neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but i went .................and they glorified god in me. "it is tempting, sometimes, to pass over the "formal" greetings of the epistles (letters to the churches).  after all, it's just an overly long "hello", right? yes and no.  technically it is "just" an introduction of self by the author... however this introduction can be subtly and vitally important to setting the tone of the entire letter.  when seen in that light, skipping over it can result in a decreased understanding of the full meaning of the epistle.galations is a perfect example of this.  paul opens his epistle by introducing himself as "an apostle".  he further emphasizes his authority by stating that he is not sent by men, but by god.    this introduction is making a point and this point is repeated throughout the first chapter. paul is dealing with a situation in the galation church where others are teaching a false doctrine. his first step in dealing with this is to illuminate the fact that these others are sent by men, are seeking to please men, and have consulted other men in forming their beliefs and teachings, whereas paul was sent by god, is seeking to please god, and had no need to consult other men regarding his beliefs and teachings because god himself had taught paul directly through divine revelation. note that paul did not confer with other men nor seek out other men for further teaching before setting out to obey god's command to "preach him among the heathen".  god's teaching was sufficient, and so he set out "immediately."i particularly like the last verse in the chapter which seems to declare that paul's purpose was fullfilled on this point:  he did not seek to please men but to glorify god. the last verse states that he was not glorified for himself, but that god was glorified in him. two thoughts occur to me in reading this chapter which apply to my life.first, i think of my previous timidity in discussing scripture with others for fear of  1)screwing it up and causing someone to turn away from god, 2)looking foolish, 3)offending someone.  well, the first fear has been conquered with a right understanding of how salvation comes about, and the second and third are conquered by a right understanding that it is not important that the person with whom i am speaking think me a "brilliant theologian" nor is it important that they like me as a person.  what is more important than their view of me is their view of god.  if i simply proclaim god's word with a right heart steeped in prayer and study, then i can trust in god to handle the rest.secondly, i wonder: is god glorified in me? do i seek his glory? or my own? what do my actions say? do they agree with the words i would use to answer these questions? or do they call me a liar?

	 galations 1
	 
    

"paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by jesus christ, and god the father, who raised him from the dead;) and all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of galatia: grace [be] to you and peace from god the father, and [from] our lord jesus christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of god and our father: to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. amen. i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of christ. but though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. as we said before, so say i now again, if any [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. for do i now persuade men, or god? or do i seek to please men? for if i yet pleased men, i should not be the servant of christ. but i certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. for i neither received it of man, neither was i taught [it], but by the revelation of jesus christ. for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews' religion, how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god, and wasted it: and profited in the jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. but when it pleased god, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace, to reveal his son in me, that i might preach him among the heathen; immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood: neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but i went into arabia, and returned again unto damascus. then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter, and abode with him fifteen days. but other of the apostles saw i none, save james the lord's brother. now the things which i write unto you, behold, before god, i lie not. afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia; and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ: but they had heard only, that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. and they glorified god in me.

	 god is in control
	 
    

i do believe that god is in control of who is saved and who is not saved, just as he is in control of everything else.these verses clearly show that god can change a person's heart :exd 10:1  "and the lord said unto moses, go in unto pharaoh: for i have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that i might shew these my signs before him"deu 2:30  "but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the lord thy god hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [appeareth] this day."jhn 12:40  "he hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with [their] eyes, nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and i should heal them."act 16:14  "and a certain woman named lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of thyatira, which worshipped god, heard [us]: whose heart the lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul."job 23:16  "for god maketh my heart soft, and the almighty troubleth me"these verses explain that we cannot "lose our salvation" because god will not let us go:jhn 6:37 - jhn 6:40 all that the father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out. for i came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. and this is the father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. and this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and i will raise him up at the last day.

	 calming verses
	 
    

today i am simply meditating on verses which emphasize trust in god and his faithful, loving, control. please feel free to add some of your own to this brief list.job 2:10 "he replied, 'you are speaking like a foolish woman.  shall we accept good from god, and not trouble?'"philippians 4: 6-9 "do not be anxious about anything but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to god. and the peace of god, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus. finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things. whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me - put it into practice. and the god of peace will be with you."philippians 4:11-13 "i am not saying this because i am in need, for i have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. i know what it is to be in need, and i know what it is to have plenty. i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. i can do everything through him who gives me strength."psalm 16:1 "keep me safe, o god, for in you i take refuge."psalm 16:5 "lord, you have assigned me my portion and my cup; you have made my lot secure."psalm 16:8 "i have set the lord always before me.  because he is at my right hand, i will not be shaken."psalm 139:13-16 "for you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, i know that full well. my frame was not hidden from you when i was made in the secret place. when i was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body. all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be."isaiah 40:26 "lift your eyes and look to the heavens: who created all these? he who brings out the starry host once by one, and calls them each by name. because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing."isaiah 40:30-31 "even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the lord will renew their strength. they will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."proverbs 16:4 "the lord works out everything for his own ends - even the wicked for a day of disaster."proverbs 16:9 "in his heart a man plans his course, but the lord determines his steps."proverbs 16:20 "whoever gives heed to instruction prospers, and blessed is he who trusts in the lord."proverbs 3:5 "trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight."psalm 118: 6-7 "the lord is with me; i will not be afraid. what can man do to me? the lord is with me; he is my helper. i will look in triumph on my enemies."psalm 118:13-14 "i was pushed back and about to fall, but the lord helped me. the lord is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation."psalm 112:7 "he will have no fear of bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the lord."psalm 107:1 "give thanks to the lord, for he is good; his love endures forever."psalm 62:8 "trust in him at all times, o people; pour out your hearts to him, for god is our refuge."psalm 37:1-9 "do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong; for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away. trust in the lord and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart. commit your way to the lord; trust in him and he will do this: he will make your rightesousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun. be still before the lord and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret - it leads only to evil. for evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the lord will inherit the land."psalm 18:6 "he reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters."psalm 18:28-36 "you, o lord, keep my lamp burning; my god turns my darkness into light. with your help i can advance against a troop; with my god i can scale a wall. as for god, his way is perfect; the word of the lord is flawless. he is a shield for all who take refuge in him. for who is god besides the lord? and who is the rock except our god? it is god who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect. he makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights. he trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. you give me your shield of victory, and your right hand sustains me; you stoop down to make me great. you broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn."psalm 120:1 "i call on the lord in my distress, and he answers me."psalm 121:1-3 "i lift up my eyes to the hills - where does my help come from? my help comes from the lord, the maker of heaven and earth. he will not let your foot slip - he who watches over you will not slumber; ..."psalm 121:8 "the lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore."psalm 23 "the lord is my shepherd, i shall not be in want.  he makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul.  he guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  even though i walk thrugh the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  you prepare a table before me in the presence of  my enemies.  you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever."

	 what i believe about the person and work of the holy spirit
	 


the person and work of the holy spirit ~ we believe that the holy spirit is a person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and that he is the supernatural agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption (john 16:8-11; ii cor. 3:6; i cor. 12:12-14; rom. 8:9; eph. 5:18).  why this is important:  the role of the holy spirit in our lives connects us with the father through the son. the spirit resides in us and gives us the power to love and serve in jesus' name. when we live a life of ministry we do not do this in the flesh, but in the power of god through the holy spirit. the amazing gift of god to us that has sealed us for the day of redemption is the unique identity of god in us, giving us the power to serve and love. without the holy spirit, nothing eternal or spiritual would take place in and through our lives. we are fully dependant on the holy spirit to be at work in our lives and ministries.

	 genesis 3: 20 – 24, & 4: 1
	 
    

verse 20:notice that this is not the first time that adam named eve. (gen. 2:23)the hebrew word for eve’s name is, “chavvah” {khav-vaw'}. it is defined as “life” or “living.” scripture itself defines her name as meaning “mother of all the living.”it is interesting to make a comparison of adam’s name- which means “red earth” and is therefore associated with death- and eve’s name – which means “mother of all living.”eve, until now, had simply been called “woman”. in hebrew the word is, “'ishshah” {ish-shaw'} and means “woman, wife, or female.” until now, her role had simply been that of wife.  now, adam gave her a new name, “eve”, which identified her as a mother. (although the blessing to increase in number had been given in gen 1:28, no child had yet been born.)adam’s choice of name clearly shows that he was paying attention to the serpent’s curse when god spoke of the woman’s seed crushing the head of the serpent. his naming of eve also seems to indicate his repentant heart and renewed faith in god’s word, both in the implied promise given within the context of the curse, and in the continuance of god’s original blessing given in genesis 1: 28, “….be fruitful and increase in number; ….” .verses 21 – 24 reveal god’s incredible mercy and grace. despite their incredible sin, he is compassionate toward their shame and provides them with clothing. he is concerned for their souls and protects them from their own wickedness by placing a barrier between them and the tree of life.these verses are also the first record of death in scripture. the animals whose skin was used must have been slain. so it is important to ask, “why were these animals killed”? the answer: to cover the shame of adam and eve- to symbolicly cover their sin. just as later jews would sacrifice a lamb at the altar, this was a symbolism of the ultimate sacrifice to come- jesus christ the lamb of god sacrificed to cover our sin and shame. also, it is important to notice, that in this original covering, adam and eve had no part in it. god provided the covering. they did not/could not cover themselves.chapter 4 verse 1:although the blessing/command to increase in number was given in gen. 1:28, it is not until after the curse (in chapter 4 verse 1) that adam lays with his wife. in fact, this is recorded as his second act after receiving his sentence. (his first being to rename eve.) this would seem to be further proof of his repentant heart, for he is now acting in faith and obedience to god’s commands and blessings.god’s grace and faithfulness is confirmed in the birth of cain.eve recognizes this and gives god credit. remember that her original sin was wanting to be god’s equal. in this verse she now recognizes her need for and inferiority to god by acknowledging that only with god’s help was she able to give birth.**what a humbling truth, that it is so often only after we sin and are shown forgiveness that we then find a renewal in our faith in god? how many times must god prove his faithfulness to us, before we will trust in and obey him faithfully in return?

	 return to genesis 3: 15
	 


there is one aspect of verse 15 which i noticed, but did not comment on, as i could not find the right words to explain my thoughts.  however, it is a vital detail of this verse which cannot be overlooked.  so i have continued to study it in hopes of being able to formulate the right words.  as i have studied, i have come across a commentary by matthew henry. what he has to say regarding this detail of verse 15 is so well written, and includes so many other biblical references that, i cannot find my own words to be sufficient.  so i am going to depart from my usual method and here simply paste a copy of what matthew henry has written. :“a gracious promise is here made of christ, as the deliverer of fallen man from the power of satan. though what was said was addressed to the serpent, yet it was said in the hearing of our first parents, who, doubtless, took the hints of grace here given them, and saw a door of hope opened to them, else the following sentence upon themselves would have overwhelmed them. here was the dawning of the gospel day. no sooner was the wound given than the remedy was provided and revealed. here, in the head of the book, as the word is (heb. 10:7), in the beginning of the bible, it is written of christ, that he should do the will of god. by faith in this promise, we have reason to think, our first parents, and the patriarchs before the flood, were justified and saved and to this promise, and the benefit of it, instantly serving god day and night, they hoped to come. notice is here given them of three things concerning christ:—(1.) his incarnation, that he should be the seed of the woman, the seed of that woman; therefore his genealogy (lu. 3) goes so high as to show him to be the son of adam, but god does the woman the honour to call him rather her seed, because she it was whom the devil had beguiled, and on whom adam had laid the blame; herein god magnifies his grace, in that, though the woman was first in the transgression, yet she shall be saved by child-bearing (as some read it), that is, by the promised seed who shall descend from her, 1 tim. 2:15. he was likewise to be the seed of a woman only, of a virgin, that he might not be tainted with the corruption of our nature; he was sent forth, made of a woman (gal. 4:4), that this promise might be fulfilled. it is a great encouragement to sinners that their saviour is the seed of the woman, bone of our bone, heb. 2:11, 14. man is therefore sinful and unclean, because he is born of a woman (job 25:4), and therefore his days are full of trouble, job 14:1. but the seed of the woman was made sin and a curse for us, so saving us from both. (2.) his sufferings and death, pointed at in satan’s bruising his heel, that is, his human nature. satan tempted christ in the wilderness, to draw him into sin; and some think it was satan that terrified christ in his agony, to drive him to despair. it was the devil that put it into the heart of judas to betray christ, of peter to deny him, of the chief priests to prosecute him, of the false witnesses to accuse him, and of pilate to condemn him, aiming in all this, by destroying the saviour, to ruin the salvation; but, on the contrary, it was by death that christ destroyed him that had the power of death, heb. 2:14. christ’s heel was bruised when his feet were pierced and nailed to the cross, and christ’s sufferings are continued in the sufferings of the saints for his name. the devil tempts them, casts them into prison, persecutes and slays them, and so bruises the heel of christ, who is afflicted in their afflictions. but, while the heel is bruised on earth, it is well that the head is safe in heaven. (3.) his victory over satan thereby. satan had now trampled upon the woman, and insulted over her; but the seed of the woman should be raised up in the fulness of time to avenge her quarrel, and to trample upon him, to spoil him, to lead him captive, and to triumph over him, col. 2:15. he shall bruise his head, that is, he shall destroy all his politics and all his powers, and give a total overthrow to his kingdom and interest. christ baffled satan’s temptations, rescued souls out of his hands, cast him out of the bodies of people, dispossessed the strong man armed, and divided his spoil: by his death, he gave a fatal and incurable blow to the devil’s kingdom, a wound to the head of this beast, that can never be healed. as his gospel gets ground, satan falls (lu. 10:18) and is bound, rev. 20:2. by his grace, he treads satan under his people’s feet (rom. 16:20) and will shortly cast him into the lake of fire, rev. 20:10. and the devil’s perpetual overthrow will be the complete and everlasting joy and glory of the chosen remnant.”as usual, you will find a link to this text’s original website by clicking on the title of this post.
