this site is about the sound that makes jan his music so recognisable. i would love to archive the sounds and techniques he used on the 80s hitseries miami vice. on the internet there are a few enthousiast artists who are recreating soundbites and tracks that weren’t on official jan hammer records.
for those looking for the components to start recording themselves and try to capture the sound of the 80s (and maybe even the sounds from his 70s era classics) this site may become a good starting point. you are welcome to share your patches/tracks/sheet music/chord progressions and techniques with each other.
kind regards
