 reviews

    
  kritik des herzens:“… a contemporary composer, not totally averse to tonality, who knows how to make skillful use of recent innovations. he has a real affinity for wilhelm busch’s humor and the lyrical sections are also spot-on.”— gerhard s., former concertmaster, bavarian radio symphony

  





 
  fantasy sonata:“celestial encounters is an absolutely beautiful piece making full use of the sonorities and expressive qualities of the piano. creating sound pictures miraculously…, this original work breaks the mold and creates its own.”— molly s., in 20th century music

  





 
  “nebulae … started out with a rumbling, twirling feeling, just as you might imagine vast columns of stellar dust would be; the sounds of this piece were both minute and gigantic, like the universe itself.”— cassandra h. b., in the hardwick gazette

  





 
  arcadian symphony:“the concert … began with kimbell’s piano rendition of an orchestral gavotte, drawn from his arcadian symphony. neoclassic in design, the work takes unexpected prokofievian shifts on a number of occasions, always leaving the listener alert.”— phillip g. in 20th century music

  





 
  i've had the pleasure to witness mr. kimbell's meticulous work and highly recommend him.  he is a gem and i cannot praise him enough. you will be very happy that you hired him to service your piano.– suzanne n.
