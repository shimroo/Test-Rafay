welcome to  cindybeads






 lampwork beads

    ........and jewelry..........



    lovingly made by hand
 






    
b e a d s    . .  . . . . .    the  
h e a l t h i e r    addiction !


 

 
thanks for stopping by!  early in 1992 i
saw my first lampwork beads while vacationing in arizona.  the world stood still when i realized they
were made by hand....one at a time!  could it be that i could learn to do
such a thing?  play with fire?  after purchasing a few beads, i decided to
give this amazing process a try so that i could individualize the jewelry i had
just started making. finding a
teacher was my next order of business (not as simple in '92 as it is these
days!). to make
a long story short, i ended up purchasing a torch, some glass and lewis wilson's first
video at glasscraft and just took off from there! i've been happily making "cindybeads" ever
since! while i still continue to make and sell a little jewelry, there is
nothing like "melting" to fill my days with happiness!

what's
      new?







i  have a "signature" on many
of my beads- a pawprint.

for those of you who don't know why 
(and would like to) feel free to visit the    
before cindybeads page
 




one thing i enjoy
    is creating beads from swatches of wild fabrics. 
      one bead can contain all the colors within the fabric-
      and often the "energy" of the pattern as well.








prices

 for my lampwork beads range from
$10/pair to $50 each. 
the cost is dependent upon the size and complexity of design.

the beadmaking process:
             

the torch i use is the "lynx" torch by
 
glass torch
technology, which mixes propane and oxygen at the surface
of the torch head.  the nortel minor burner is also an excellent torch. 
most of my beads are made with effetre glass made in italy. 
i have had good results, also, with kugler, bullseye and uroboros glass and have
experimented a little with borosilicate and satake glass.
