welcome to gaylord, michigan!
an outdoor paradise for every season and every pursuit.
breathe in fresh forest air and glide along pristine waterways in gaylord, michigan. here, there’s enough room to roam and enough unspoiled wilderness to go around! located in the heart of northern michigan, gaylord is the perfect place to gear up for adventure and unwind in nature. bountiful forest trails, winding rivers, over 90 sparkling inland lakes, and four seasons make gaylord the ultimate outdoor playground.
gaylord not only embraces winter, we own it! when you’re lucky enough to sit smack dab in the middle of lower michigan’s snowbelt, you know flurries mean only one thing – endless opportunities for frosty fun. we know we’re lucky here, but more than that, we’re welcoming – to you, to yours, and to the roughly 148 inches of annual snow that make gaylord a winter-lover’s dream come true. don’t just walk in our winter wonderland. ski it, float it, fish it, sled it and sail downhill on it.

skiing

5 really cool things to do in gaylord this winter
take a ski lesson
both otsego resort and treetops resort have rental equipment and experienced, fun ski instructors. this is a great activity to do with a friend or two or your children. usually, within a few hours, the instructor will have you stopping comfortably, making gentle turns and safely getting on and off the chairlift.

winter rafting

5 really cool things to do in gaylord this winter
winter rafting
gaylord has two outfitters in the area that will take you and up to 5 of your friends or family members winter rafting down the sturgeon river! the sturgeon is the fastest river in the lower peninsula and does not usually freeze over. this is not tubing or kayaking and you get into a raft big enough not to tip.

snowshoeing

5 really cool things to do in gaylord this winter
snowshoeing
let us just say that snowshoeing is a blast. you never need a groomed trail, you can go with 6 inches of snow on the ground or 60 inches of snow on the ground – snowshoes work the same. all you need are some public or private trails, a pair of boots, a hat, gloves and snowshoes. you get a great workout and you can literally go anywhere.

extreme tubing

5 really cool things to do in gaylord this winter
extreme tubing
this is nothing like the days of sledding down the local hill when you were a kid. going “down the hill” has taken on a whole new meaning! the tubes are provided, the course is smooth and a lift attachment pulls you and the tube back up the hill! pretty great, huh? both treetops resort and otsego resort offer downhill tubing.

snowmobiling

5 really cool things to do in gaylord this winter
snowmobiling
rent a snowmobile or trailer your own and check out some of the 500 miles of groomed trails branching throughout 8 northern michigan counties from our central location. in other words, ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! of course, we’ve got maps and they are free to our snowmobiling friends!

why you need to go winter rafting when visiting gaylord
before you shake your head and say “no way!” to winter rafting, let’s clear one thing up from the get-go: no, you will not get wet! this is a guided trip with experienced professionals calling the shots. if you’ve ever been spilled out of your kayak or canoe into the brisk waters of the sturgeon river, we can understand your hesitation. but hear us out and read the full blog because we would hate for you to go home without experiencing one of gaylord, michigan’s most extraordinary winter experiences.
