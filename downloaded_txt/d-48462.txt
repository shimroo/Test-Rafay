carol kent






speaker, author






“what makes my heart sing?” asks carol. “speaking to groups looking for messages that include humor and hope that speak to today’s challenges by pointing to god’s word.” she says, “i think women need to laugh because life is challenging, but i also think they want to go deeply into god’s word and find out how to live in the middle of relationship struggles, difficult choices, and hidden fears. women are longing for authenticity and practical strategies for living out their faith. i’ve spoken at large arena events for women of faith, extraordinary women, and women of joy.
i’ve also spoken at medium sized venues and in small, intimate gatherings. it’s a joy to do women’s conferences and retreats for churches, and sometimes my husband gene and i team-teach at worship services. i’m also available to speak at fundraising events for nonprofit organizations.”
