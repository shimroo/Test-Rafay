excellentaffordable portable structures4.8                based on 39 reviews                        review us on        mikie taylormax was so easy to work with and our new shed is so nice. the guys were quick getting it up too. so happy with the whole experience!tiffani hammacki love my new backyard shed. max at the office was wonderful nd helped me through the design process. they have all the options to build exactly what i'm envisioning. the install was so fast, and the guys were very friendly. i will recommend affordable portable structures to everyone looking for an additional building on the property.nancy leequality shed, excellent service.  friendly, helpful staff made this project happen quickly and affordably.  thank you!evelyn pughawesome experience from beginning to end! max was very accommodating and professional! the project started and ending ontime! we are so pleased with the results and would tell anyone to call max! hubby showed off his skills with the skirt and light installations! customers for life! blessings from the pugh family 🙏🏽emily shelleyi love my shed from affordable portable! i got a custom built shell, built on-site in my backyard and then i gradually finished it out with various other contractors over the course of about a year. it's now its own fully finished-out room. dickey was so helpful in helping me design my little dream shed and was helpful with recommending some of the other contractors as well. it's cheaper than getting a pre-fab finished shed from other companies, you get to custom design it, and you can finish it out on your own time frame as your budget allows. i'm really excited by the outcome.
