black mulch film
black mulch cover film is used to suppress weed and conserve water in crop production and landscaping. plastic mulches also act as a barrier to keep methyl bromide, both a powerful fumigant and ozone depleted, in the soil. crops grow through slits or holes in thin plastic sheeting. plastic mulch is used in conjunction with drip irrigation. this method is predominant in large scale vegetable growing, with millions of acres cultivate under plastic mulch worldwide each year. canada covers brings you high quality mulch cover that has higher elongation and does not easily break down. its high elongation and high tear strength makes it easier to remove after use.
