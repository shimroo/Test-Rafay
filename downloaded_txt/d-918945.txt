easily a 5 star experience. i was in a terrible accident that totaled my chevy cruze. i‚Äôve never been in an accident that completely destroyed my vehicle and caused an injury so the process was very new to me. mr. kurgis and his associates were understanding of the trauma caused by the accident and walked me through the process step by step to make sure i completely understood the process.

bottom line, they did what they said they were going to do and that was getting me a great settlement. very satisfied with this firm

we live in a world where if you have 10,000 clients or customers the three unhappy ones will climb to the top of mount everest and scream to the heavens they didn't call me back quick enough. i found my experience with  melissa and her team exemplary. i was hit by a car on my motorcycle september the 2nd of this year. i was only treated for 60 days but today before the years even over melissa called me with the good news that i got the settlement check that my wife and i had desired and we couldn't be happier. whenever i called to ask a question the response was quick and honest. i was kept in the loop about everything and i will refer this law firm to anyone that i know that might need their services in the future. so to this law firm and their stuff from the bottom of my heart, thank you and i want to wish all of you a merry and blessed christmas. i know my holiday is going to be better because of these awesome folks. sincerely, eddie berg

me and my children were hit while stopped at a red light at 55 mph. this was in december and my daughter was only about 6-7 months old and we were all injured and went thru a lot of pain and stress. kevin kurgis was there and effective and we are almost on the other side of this and healing. i recommend kurgis to anyone and everyone dealing with this. i also had to use him in 2011 when a drunk driver hit me and my son and had the same great results. they take the stress and worry out when you feel like there is no hope. please reach out to them and you won‚Äôt regret it. thanks kevin!
