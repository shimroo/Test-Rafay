no therapy game playing. counseling and therapy starts with a mutual commitment to work together with honesty and trust. i work with you as a real person, who has a positive sensitivity, intelligence, insight, skill, and caring that can help you do the work you need do to benefit in your life.








 


being happy, getting better, recovering, & growth are not unsolvable mysteries. Â we will work together to help you make sense of all of it: to learn how you came to be; to help you become more aware of yourself and your feelings, thoughts, and behavior; to consciously experience the processes of your daily living; and to help you through the sometimes painful and frightening process of growth; to move towards a more complete and fulfilling life as an individual, as a partner, as a parent, as a family member, as a friend, as a colleague, and in the community.



 












 


making it work for you is my goal in counseling & therapy. i will not be trying to fit you and your life and experiences into particular theories of who you should be or how you came to be. if relevant to the reality of your life, then i will help you find your connection to a theory. however, such a theory will not be used to shape you or my conception of who you are. i accept who and what you are as a basic foundation in counseling and therapy.
