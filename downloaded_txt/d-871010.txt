about the monteux school & music festivalthe monteux school and music festival, established in 1943 by the world-renowned conductor pierre monteux, stands as a distinguished summer training program and festival in its class.pierre monteux's visionary approach to conducting education, emphasizing active participation in the orchestra alongside observing the wisdom of peers, serves as the foundation of the school's philosophy. this ethos has been meticulously crafted into a comprehensive six-week program, fostering an environment that encourages creativity and camaraderie. the program encompasses a diverse array of symphonic, chamber, and children's concerts.at monteux, students engage in a rigorous curriculum that involves rehearsing and performing the largest repertoire offered by any music festival and school in the united states. this experience not only sharpens their skills as conductors but also enhances their proficiency as orchestra musicians.the impact of the monteux school resonates far beyond its picturesque campus in hancock, maine. alumni of the school have gone on to establish successful careers in the orchestral, opera, and educational sectors, leaving their mark not only in the united states but also across the continents of canada, mexico, europe, and asia. the monteux school's legacy continues to thrive, shaping the future of fine musicians and conducting on a global scale.not a conductor?monteux also serves as an orchestra and chamber music festival catering to instrumentalists. each week, the program offers chamber concerts, masterclasses, and seminars specifically designed to enhance your musical journey.



















































 




 


“conducting is not enough. i must create something. i am not a composer, so i will create fine young musicians.”

— pierre monteux
