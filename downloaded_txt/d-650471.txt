the history of fluorine, fluoride
				and fluoridation





          
				

the discovery of fluoride
				and fluorine 

hearing of "fluorine"
				or "fluoride" most people now think instantly of
				dentistry, of dental caries or the different ways of fluoride
				application to prevent that disorder. but these terms are not
				inventions of dentistry, nor was the use of fluorides originally
				in any way related to that profession. ...-- [deutsch]

fluoride research in the 19th
				and early 20th century










in the
				19th century, research on fluoride and its occurrence in teeth
				and bones was carried out by physicians and chemists in europe
				while the dental profession was still not organized as we know it
				today. the analytical methods of the time were quite limited and
				the results rather controversial. thus, the early recommendations
				to take fluoride pills to prevent dental caries were based on
				anything but sound science and -then already- subject to heated
				debates...  more

the birth and rise of
				american dentistry 

while some physicians dedicated considerable
				time to dental research, the medical profession as a whole
				apparently neglected the treatment of dental disorders
				which they regarded as rather superficial troubles of short
				duration and very rarely life-threatening. therefore, dental
				treatments were also performed for a long time by so-called
				"craftsmen" . in 1859, the latter organized the
				american dental association. the new profession approached a
				certain scientific status due to research on mottled teeth ...

mottled teeth - the f. s. mckay era
				of dental research 

when dentist frederick sumner mckay moved to
				colorado springs, in 1901, he noticed on the teeth of most of the
				natives strange discolorations, "colorado brown stain"
				as the local people used to call it after the most prominent and
				disturbing feature of the affliction. also from a hygienic point
				of view the teeth were in a deplorable condition, as opposed to
				certain anecdotes ... more

a new water supply for oakley, idaho


not colorado springs but oakley, idaho, was
				the first community to change its water supply solely to get rid
				of a disfiguring dental problem. itâ´s some of the inhabitants
				and a caring director of public health who deserve the highest
				respect for the responsible action taken. they did the right
				thing but the cause of the trouble was still unknown, despite
				some animal experimentation ... more

the bauxite story - a look at alcoa










in 1931,
				h. v. churchill, a chemist at the research laboratories of the
				aluminum company of america (alcoa), new kensington, announced
				the find of fluoride in the water of areas where people had
				mottled teeth. this discovery came as a surprise, for the company
				became involved when some facts pointed to aluminium as a
				possible cause of the trouble. ...

what they say about how fluoridation
				started 

"... a strong uproar was heard when this
				was released and people wanted all fluorine out of their water.
				but later tests concluded that communities with high levels of
				fluorine in their drinking water suffered less dental cavities."

the u. s. public health service (usphs)
				initiates dental research  
				

when henry trendley dean, dds, was transferred
				to the us public health service head quarters in washington,
				d.c., for a study of the distribution of mottled enamel and to
				find economic means for its prevention, he had already shown his
				research capabilities: in 1929 he presented before the american
				dental association's research commission his analysis of fifty
				cases of fractures of the mandible. he had also been part of a
				team that investigated, between 1929 and 1930, the health effects
				of radium dial painting (results published in 1933).  ...

h. t. deanâ´s special
				epidemiology of mottled teeth


the "very mild" category described
				by dean in 1934 shows "no brown stain" while according
				to the 1935 and 1938 descriptions brown stain is "rarely
				observed" and "faint" (as it was in the "mild"
				category described in 1934); in 1942, "brown stain"
				appears only in the descriptions of the "moderate" and
				"severe" categories. ... more

fluoride safety studies: bartlett
				-cameron vs. newburgh-kingston


somehow it was to be expected that mottling
				and staining of the teeth would not be the only toxic effect of
				fluoride, though this was apparently the only one within the
				scope of dentistry. after the examination, in february 1932, of a
				group of children in minonk, illinois, henry trendley dean wrote
				in his report to the surgeon general: "following the minonk
				examination, a new phase of this question seems ripe for further
				study. is mottled enamel merely an oral manifestation of a
				general toxicity, or something similar?" ... more

fluoridation chemicals


sodium fluoride, sodium fluosilicate and
				(hydro)fluosilicic acid are not the only compounds used for water
				fluoridation. late in the 1950â´s, franz j. maier and ervin
				bellack, of the u.s.p.h.s., developed a "fluorspar
				dissolver" which yields a concoction very similar to wayne
				whiteâ´s "flural": fluoroaluminates... more

the history of sodium monofluorophosphate










sodium
				monofluorophosphate was for the first time prepared in 1929 by
				willy lange, a privatdozent at the friedrich-wilhelms-
				university of berlin. his search for ways to prepare the free
				monofluorophosphoric acid led lange to derivatives that soon
				would become known as nerve agents. upon heating silver
				monofluorophosphate with methyl or ethyl iodide lange and one of
				his ph.d. students, gerda von krueger, prepared the corresponding
				dialkyl monofluorophosphates which exerted a strong action on the
				authors. lange felt these compounds might be useful for pest
				control and offered them to i. g. farben industry for evaluation.
				but the company apparently had no interest at that time. within
				two years i. g. farben changed its mind and began its own
				developmental program - with gerhard schrader. ...

fluoride in dental fillings


after clinical observations and animal
				experimentation it became soon obvious "that silicate
				cements exert a harmful effect on the dental pulp. that this
				damage must be attributed to the irritating qualities of silicate
				cement and not to the operative procedures of cavity preparation
				is apparent." ...more

how i became interested
				in fluoride 

in a tv discussion on fluoride a dentist
				vehemently defended the application of fluoride tablets to babies
				for caries prevention, but as soon as the cameras went off he
				told me: "mr. meiers, in a few years us dentists will ask
				â´how could we have ever gotten involved in this fluoride
				matterâ´". ... [deutsch]
