certified-fun: as told by our visitors








“our first stay at a harvest host and this one did not disappoint. host responded to our request promptly and upon our arrival they were very pleasant when we went into let them know we were there. unfortunately we arrived close to closing time and left in the morning before the museum opened but were able to do some shopping in their gift shop. staff were so pleasant and shared a recommendation for a couple spots to eat within walking distance. we chose the drive in and the burgers and chocolate shakes were so yummy!! we have been just driving past this little gem of a town for years, no more! we will definitely stop here again.”

“did the tour and absolutely loved it, it was so much fun! they have so many sweet old cars! not just cars though, there are tons of awesome antiques and rare finds too! the staff members were friendly and extremely kind!!! they honked the general lee horn and played the player piano for our young kids. our children did not want to leave! they have a really nice gift store too. so glad we stopped, it was well worth it!!!”

“a rare treat crossing south dakota. a must see for anyone with an interest in not just cars, but thousands of antiques as well. something for everyone's interest. highly recommend the pioneer auto museum. don't forget the ice cream.”

“stopped for the truck stop across the road 10 yrs ago, and i had some time to kill so i tried out the diner, which had an awesome burger btw, and saw the sign for the auto museum but honestly thought there probably wasn’t much to it. after eating, i decided i would check out the small barely advertised museum. boy was i wrong, he had hundreds if not thousands of beautiful classic autos, motorcycles and tractors. the older gentleman that took me around taught me more history than 12 years of public school did...awesome experience i still talk about often to this day! would love to take my kids there some day!”
