welcome to running bare nudist retreat

we laurie and glennis godden would like to invite you to spend some quality nudist time at running bare.
20 kms south of narrabri nsw we have built on 720 acres of natural bushland the type of nudist retreat that we would like to visit.
we offer a great range of diversity in permanent, semi-permanent and casual sites.
all with power and water and plenty of room.
we cater for first time nudists and long time nudists so if you are looking for a great place to have fun in the nude then give us a try.
we have 24 people living on site and last year we averaged 34 people per weekend at our outdoor cookouts.
you can do nothing or join in and play pentaque, tennis, darts, miniten, badminton or just laze around the pool and enjoy a great bushwalk on our fully fenced property.
