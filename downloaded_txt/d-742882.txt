star wars series 5 and transformers series 2 starters sets at tj maxx





thanks to greivous, from the attacktix forum for the following news:yes, my friends, it is true. i can confirm what i believe to be the first purchase of the star wars series 5 starter sets and the transformers series 2 starter set to happen in a brick-and-mortar store in the united states. however, this might not be a good thing.first, the find.my parents dragged me and my brothers to t.j. maxx in south bend (indiana) this morning. after spending about 5 minutes looking at clothes, jango and i headed over to the toys since, occasionally, they'll have junk video games to laugh at. while passing by the educational and toddler toys, jango spotted the old s4 gunship and s1 omega supreme. we looked at them a moment and jango flipped them over to see a price of $6.looking around for other deals, what do i see but g1 megatron and g1 optimus prime looking back at me! with a "holy..." and an "oh my..." i pick up the starter to find two sw5 starters behind it. a quick flip over and i see the price of $5. needless to say i snatched up all three starters and then looked around for boosters only to find nothing. i then spent the rest of the trip very, very happy (also was able to get a new gcn controller and battalion wars new for $10 :)).the starter sets with paper of prooftm (yes, one is missing the vader since i'd already pulled him out.

two tix forward: gencon countdown...1 week and counting





gencon countdown...1 week and counting one week from today is my birthday (yay me), but more importantly, it's the first day i'll be at gencon this year.  for those of you unfamiliar with the various cons, gencon is the largest north american tabletop gaming convention.  it's follows e3 (video games) and sand diego comic con (comics natch) in the summer, and is a high point for tabletop gamers each year.  this is my third trip to the con, and second as a "pro"...in the past i had attended origins more regularly as a player.  my wife julie will be attending with me again this year, making this a min-vacation of sorts, we really fell in love with down town indianapolis last year, and look forward to hitting some nice restaurants again this year, as well as the occasional relaxing stroll down the river walk   next week two tix forward will be reporting live from gencon, probably later in the day, with an update with all of the things that interested me the most for the day.  i may or may not have new 'tix related news, though i will be taking a hard look at other games that may be of interest to the average 'tixer, and also looking for the ever present gaming accessories.  the following week will be a "get your gear on" that both reviews any and all purchases i made at the con, as well as a recap of existing gaming gear, particularly that which relates to 'tix.  if you have never been to a con of this size before, it's a bit difficult to explain.  the event as a whole takes over the entire convention center, every room converted to some gaming purpose or another.  huge halls house the ccg tournaments, the minis events, and the rpg campaigns.  obscure games the likes of which you have never seen are played, i will never forget the navy battle i saw reenacted on blue tarp on the floor, each fleet of destroyers small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.  there are friends to be made that you may only see that one week each year, and games to be played the same...games that are prepared for and dreamt of for months on end, finally enjoyed for a fleeting few days each august.  can you imagine?  there are seminars, contests, dealers, company presentations, everything you might expect.  there are companies that sell only dice with 20 some tables dedicated to that most well known of gaming devices.  there are popular games like magic and d&d, and obscure games that no one has ever heard of before, making their grand entrance into the world at this very event.  even though gencon falls near the end of the yearly gaming circuit (following both gama and origins), the companies go out of their way to make it important for gamers.  there are exclusives to be had and found.  their are hot new games that may be available there for the first time (kingdom hearts and pokemon minis come to mind).  there are also old out of print games to be found at the various dealer tables.  there are artist alleys featuring some of the people that give the fantasy world it's "look".  there are book signings (look for my friend matt forbeck of blood bowl fame), and all matter of entertainment to be found.  this year, video games should be more on the map, with e3 having gone invite only, gencon may or may not be picking up some of the overflow.  in any case, as you can see, this is something of a gamers nirvana.  and, enough gushing from me...i had meant to write a serious article this week, but this is all i can think about, so that will have to wait a couple of weeks.  if you are going to be at gencon this week, look me up.  i'm not to hard to find in a crowd, and i should have a blue attacktix staff t-shirt on.  and, i should have a handful of tourney figs on hand and ready to give out, just for saying hi.  :) - b

tix tool v 1.0 release





after many months of work – tix tool v 1.0 is finally here!  what is the tix tool you ask?  it started as the brainchild of steve corder (malform) over a year ago, as a way to have a “one stop shopping source” for information and tools concerning attacktix.  chris marshall (cona chris) hopped aboard to tag team on the tix tool with steve early in 2007.  written in microsoft access, the tix tool is available in ms access 97 and ms access 2000 currently.first and foremost, tix tool is a data repository, with a complete listing of all figures, their photos, their projectiles, and complete statistics regarding the figure.  star wars lines up to series 5 are included, as well as tranformers series 2 and marvel series 1.  tix tool allows the user to keep track of figures in your collection, and figures available for trade.  several reports can be generated and printed off (including a listing of all figures with their special powers and special power ratios).there are utilities that help the user keep track of actual trades.  a custom label maker is also available (front, back, effects, and special powers!) complete with logos for all existing factions/classes as well as the ability to upload custom images!  in addition, links to all the most popular attacktix websites are provided.last but not least, there is an entire section built for keeping track of gameplay statistics.  a printable scoresheet is available to keep track of game stats, and then the user can input the statistics after the game is over.  based on a “match points” formula, an mvp for each match is computed.  reports are then available showing win/loss records, and several other statistics for each figure you use.if you do use the tix tool, please note that every so often you have to compact the file by going to the toolbar and clicking on “tools”, then “database utilities”, then”compact and repair database”.feel free to download (for free) the fruits of our labor.download access 97 versiondownload access 2000 + versionwe hope you enjoy using the tix tool – if you have any comments, good or bad, please  post them.  thanks and enjoy!steve and chris
