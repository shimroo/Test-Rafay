the gator gay-straight alliance, formed in 2000 at the university of florida continued its tradition of clever, irreverent, edit: and sarcastic flyers on valentine's day 2004 with a dirty dozen reasons why homosexual marriage is "bad" and why gay people should not be allowed to get married. after 2 months, we reached 100,000 hits! this has since been made into an awesome infographic.
please link to this page (12reasons.com) and give gatorgsa proper credit when making a reference to this list, and if you're going to print it, why not go for the pdf? it's free to redistribute, of course - it's funny not to! think you might be straight? check out our other awesome brochure.

homosexuality is not natural, much like
eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control are not natural.

heterosexual marriages are valid because they
 produce children. infertile couples and old people cannot get
legally married because the world needs more children.

obviously gay parents will raise gay children
 because straight parents only raise straight children.

straight marriage will be less meaningful,
 since britney spears's 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was
 meaningful.

                    heterosexual marriage has  been around for a long time, and it hasn't changed at all: women
 are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal.

gay marriage should be decided by the people,
 not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not
 courts, have historically protected the rights of minorities.

gay marriage is not supported by religion.
 in a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are always
 imposed on the entire country. that's why we only have one religion in
 america.

gay marriage will encourage people to be gay,
 in the same way that hanging around tall people makes you
 tall.

legalizing gay marriage will open the door to
 all kinds of crazy behavior. people may even wish to marry their pets
 because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage
license.

children can never succeed without both male
and female role models at home. that's why single parents are
forbidden to raise children.

gay marriage will change the foundation of
 society. heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and
 we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't
 adapted to cars or longer lifespans.

civil unions, providing most of the same
 benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a
 "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional. separate
 schools for african-americans worked just as well as separate marriages
 will for gays & lesbians.


***new!*** due to the slowly growing amount of emails we're receiving, we've decided to let the cat out of the bag: this list is sarcastic. we don't see how anyone could take our list seriously! we don't want people to get the wrong idea :) we hope to show how ludicrous the arguments against gay marriage really are, by explicitly stating the arguments... and letting the obvious conclusions from these arguments follow, which are clearly not accurate. other examples of anachronism in rhetoric:

women are property.
little girls are forced to marry old men.
divorce does not exist.
blacks and whites can't marry.
birth control is un-american.
children are deprived of a proper home.
same-sex marriage is illegal.
marriage has changed. change is good.
