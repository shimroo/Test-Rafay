  



























































welcome to faithwalk communities, inc. 




faithwalk communities, inc. is the governing body over
						the organizations known as faithwalk communities.
						these communities consist of believers
						in the lord jesus christ. we are a
						lay-led movement with active pastor(s) participation.
						we are a non-profit organization and we actively
						seek the participation of people of all christian
						denominations.  there are many other similar
						communities in the united states and overseas.
we actively seek a relationship with our lord
						and savior, jesus christ, by participating in a
						weekend of living in christian fellowship involving
						a combination of carefully developed activities and
						teachings which are meant to lead to a fuller
						personal commitment to christ.  the main
						teaching of faithwalk is god's unqualified love for
						each of us through his grace, and an encouragement
						to put that love into action in our daily lives.
