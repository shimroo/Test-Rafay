 conrad handled everything!


										in looking for an agent to list our family cabin, i wanted somebody that was physically nearby with knowledge of the area and market trends for the niche market and community. furthermore, since i live out of town, i needed someone i could completely trust to handle not only the paperwork and sale, but several other small, miscellaneous things that inevitably happened throughout a transaction. fortunately for me, conrad checked all of those boxes and i was very pleased with how the listing itself turned out, the job he did throughout the listing, marketing, and closing process, and having some “boots on the ground” to handle all of the small, yet still very important things that needed to be done throughout the entire process made life much easier for me. conrad came through in all areas and gets my highest rating!

 always helpful


										i was a little reserved before using conrad as my agent because he was new to real estate in the walker area.
after working with him, i was pleasantly surprised, of his dedication, kindness, & wiliness to go beyond required necessities.
he was always checking to see if everything was ok. he was willing to work with me in any situation that would arise.
he was always helpful. he gave me advice on ways of making property more sellable. 
i'm thankful for all the help he gave me in the transition period.
i would definitely recommend conrad walton to sell my property again.
