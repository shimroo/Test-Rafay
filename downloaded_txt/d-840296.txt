spyker's sexiest c8





spanier introduced the new aileron. power comes from an audi-sourced 4.2l v8 rated at about 400hp (298kw) and 354lb-ft (480nm) of torque. shifting duties are taken care of with a either a getrag manual or zf auto gearbox, both with six speeds, and drive is sent to the rear wheels. the automatic is spyker's first, though it doesn’t hamper the car's 4.5-second run to 62mph (100km/h) nor its top speed of 187mph (300km/h).inside, the c8 aileron gets a kharma sound system, gps navigation, and all the standard modern electronics connectivity - bluetooth, mp3, etc.
