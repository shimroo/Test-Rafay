what people say about wjdwe are often asked what makes our northern virginia property management services unique. the answer is simple: we have remained true to our slogan that “managing rental property is our only business.” we focus 100 percent on residential property management and leasing.


“wjd is by far a superb management team. they care about their tenants. they have all the great qualities a tenant would ask for. reliable, well organized and always positive. quick response with all questions/problems. definitely recommend them to all.”
jacari m.
“my experience with wjd management has been excellent. i have owned properties in several states and currently own properties in two states. i have worked with at least 8 property managers as a landlady. some have lasted. some have not. wjd has outlasted them all. their monthly statements are clear and concise. their response rate is effective and if i have a question or concern, they always take the time to address the issue, and do so until it is resolved. they have been my pm company for i think about 15 years. i am very grateful for their service. they are actually an outstanding company.
p. loring
“we have worked with lots of property management companies and have to say that wjd management has been the best one of them all. very responsive, respectful friendly and have that urgency at all times when it comes to fixing any issues that arise. i gotta say you guys are top notch! thank you!”
johan s.
“i’m a landlord, and i switched to wjd from a different property management company in the area that honestly wasn’t doing much for me. so glad i did because wjd has been great. they take care of whatever needs fixing and communicate with me every step of the way. they found me excellent tenants who’ve now been in my rental property for more than two years. i can always count on getting paid on the 5th of each month like clockwork. (the other property manager i used to work with sometimes held onto the rent for a week or more before depositing it into my account.) i’m planning on being a long term client with wjd and i recommend them highly for anyone who wants to have all the landlord responsibilities taken off their shoulders”
m. fontenot
“i have been renting with wjd for 6 years. they are always very helpful with any maintenance request. the oven/stove and microwave both had to be replaced and it was done very quickly. brenda withtthe maintenance subcontractor a and b decorating is amazing! so personable and easy to work with. thank you wjd management for a nice, positive rental experience!”
jeannine h.
“i have been a satisfied client of wjd management for the past 16 years. i have been loyal to them over the years because they specialize in residential property management, and they are excellent at it. i’ve gotten tremendous peace of mind from knowing that the team at wjd is managing my property. and even more importantly, they’ve helped me to maintain a steady income from my home, with reliable tenants and top of the market rents. i would recommend wjd enthusiastically to any northern virginia homeowner being relocated out of the area and also to any investor who wants highly professional, cost-effective property management.”
s. truneh
“we would highly recommend using the wjd management company. we have only been renting from wjd for less than one year. we have had a few different items happen at the house we are renting. one was minor, a storm door latch broke. the other two were more major, a water leak from an upstairs bathroom into a downstairs bathroom and hallway and then a stove that stopped heating up. all issues were dealt with in timely and professional matter! we were pleasantly surprised each time as the ease communicating and coordinating with the wjd in getting each of our situations and having them taken care of!”
cathy h.
“wjd have been managing my property in virginia now for more than 2 years and i have been thrilled with their level support and professionalism. i am more than glad that i selected david and his team to look after my property. i live in another state and rely on wjd to manage finances, property maintenance and any tenant issues. i feel 100% confident that wjd will take care of my asset, provide me with timely and effective communications, and support me as a property owner in any tenant related issues that may arise and have arisen in the past. simply put, these folks are the best.
b. petty
“we have been tenants for two years and now are on a three year extension. wjd and team have been great with response times, tenant updates and communication. there was no question if we would stay at this property with the experience we had in the first two years. wjd helps make a rental home a real home.”
sajjad k.
