what our clients are saying



“when we began experiencing significant operational challenges at our plant processing facilities due to some type of contaminate in-flow from our upstream receipt points, an ad-hoc sampling program was urgently needed. spl’s laboratory team jumped in with logistics support, cylinder procurement and advice on sampling methodologies to help us identify & mitigate the problem. as one of our core 3rd party service providers, spl is relied on for support on a daily basis and especially during critical outages or operational challenges. spl’s response and technical expertise provides us with the confidence to know that we are in a partnership with the right folks!!!”
– 2024 top 10 oil & gas midstream company

“spl is unique because you can find out about your fluids in the lab and then see how it translates into flow assurance issues (and opportunities).  these guys actually walk you through and help you understand lab studies.  then they help you develop a plan.”
– jason harry, senior subsea engineer, hess corporation
