dear sisters and brothers,
as we have just celebrated valentine’s day and the love lingers on this weekend, i want to share with you a brief reflection on christian marriage and love.christian marriage is a sacred covenant between a man, a woman, and god, reflecting love, faith, and mutual respect. it goes beyond a social contract to symbolize the divine union of love and service, modeled after christ’s love for the church. when in a contract the language used is, “what i have is yours and what you have is mine”, the covenantal language says, “i am yours and you are mine”.on valentine’s day, as love is celebrated, christians are reminded that true love is unconditional and sacrificial. the love that god has for his people and the love that christ has for his bride the church form the foundation of christian marriage, encouraging couples to deepen their spiritual connection and commitment.



                                            read more...
