who we are
unite lebanon youth project (ulyp) is a nonprofit organization (ngo#134) established in 2010 to propel a paradigm shift in lebanon from a nation that is divided along religious, political, socio-economic, and ethnic lines to one where people can co-exist, unite, and work together for a better future. ulyp does this through creating educational opportunities and giving equal access to quality educational programs to children, youth, and women in the marginalized communities. ulyp’s programs raise general awareness on mutual respect, tolerance, and acceptance of the other to create a dialogue of peace.
