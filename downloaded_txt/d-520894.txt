what does the future hold for vdgg now?
hb: "i have no idea. we haven't really discussed anything since peter was hospitalised on that last tour in may and we had to cancel the rest of it. he's fine and fully recovered now, by the way. as for playing live again, well, the economics of touring are on a knife edge but i see no reason why we shouldn't record again."

hb has been upgrading the hb3 section of his stage organ, just completed in the nick of time for the rest of the european tour:
hb with percy saunders


"the new one has a more conventional look, and undoubtedly influenced by the jw walker organ i learnt to play on at school - you may recognise the resemblance to the organ stops in my 1963 photo with dr. percy saunders if you compare!
hopefully a sonic upgrade as well - the ever evolving system - which was the primary intention of course."

this was not intended as a comprehensive ph/vdgg site but is rapidly becoming one. it started out as a personal journey through some very enjoyable times with my friends from the early to mid/late seventies but i have now incorporated much material donated from other sources to fill in gaps. there is material from 1967, when the band first formed, and onwards to 1978, when they finally split for what appeared to be the last time. if you are a peter hammill and van der graaf generator fan then you may well find something of interest here.
early pictures (1968 to 1969)
the original band had actually split up by the time i got into the music and in fact the first album that i heard was "68-71", a compilation. the disappointment of not being able to see the band live in 1972 was tempered by the fact that peter hammill was by then a solo artist and performing around europe, albeit sporadically. often dave jackson, hugh banton or guy evans would support him, but long gone were nick pearne, chris judge smith, keith ellis and nic potter.
the band's first release was the single people you were going to, released in early 1969.
the early days  read articles from the manchester independent and other publications from 1968 and 1969, and hugh banton's advert in the international times of august 23rd 1968. also caleb bradley and the lost demo tape!
aerosol grey machine  the album entitled the aerosol grey machine wasn't originally released in the uk. it was the band's first album, recorded in 1969, but it only became obtainable in britain in 1973 as an import, through virgin (i think). i can't remember if i got it from virgin in brighton (the first virgin store which was a great place to hang out until they pulled the building down to make way for boots) or by mail order. either way it was the final brick in the wall and a great album as well. it has a good feel to it and is so late 60's. this album, among others, was produced by john anthony.

the cd, released in 1997, contains some interesting sleeve notes, penned by peter hammill, about the early history of the band; "you should get some flavour of the times". that sentiment fits well with the object of this site.

van der graaf generator 68-72

in the early part of 1971 van der graaf generator embarked on a tour of the uk with lindisfarne and genesis, fellow charisma records artists. the ticket price for the charisma package tour was 6 bob (6 shillings - 30p) and it was a risky venture for tony stratton smith...
see also other pictures and live reviews from 1971 and 1972.

during 1972 van der graaf generator toured extensively in italy, had a number one with pawn hearts and appeared twice in ciao 2001 magazine, firstly in the 27th february 1972 edition and then later in june 1972.
peter hammill also appeared in ciao 2001 magazine in december 1972.

today's history lesson
in the interest of man's thirst for knowledge and for those vdgg fans with an enquiring nature i provide you with this link to boston's museum of science.  if you ever wondered where the band's name came from or where the inspiration for many of the early album cover designs originated then pay it a visit. there are some stunning pictures, even of robert himself!  you can cut straight to the photo's by clicking here.
whatever would robert have said? ("they spelt my name wrong" maybe!)

hammill on playaway? can this be?


i don't remember all of the solo gigs but reckon that the first that i went to was at the commonwealth institute in 1973. also in 1973 whilst at brighton poly, i introduced my room-mate, richard mcbride (where are you richard? - it's so easy just to slip away...) to van der graaf and to begin with, like most people, he found the music difficult to get into. one day i returned from college and heard "refugees" wafting down the stairs. a new hammill afficionado born. we went to several gigs together and had a habit of trying to get back stage to meet ph. on several occasions we succeeded and obtained the requisite autographs. the person to talk to of course was gordian troeller, peter hammill's manager (and later van der graaf's).
(peter hammill's brother andrew was at sussex university in brighton at the same time but we didn't meet despite efforts on the part of my sussex uni housemates (inc richard) to contrive for us all to be at certain parties)
autographed killers...
killers, angels, refugees, peter hammill's first book published in 1974, contains lyrics for all the songs up to "silent corner", poems, drawings and other interesting stuff.
solo performances attended

richard could be quite funny and sent me this christmas card many moon's ago that i came across recently. we, like many daft people still do, found ph/vdgg lyrics to suit any occasion. we knew all the songs by heart then, which would be difficult now with 40 albums to learn, and annoyed everybody with never ending renditions. in 1974 richard moved to hove to a 4th floor flat. whenever we returned there from the pub just prior to staggering onto the final staircase we would chant "so onto the familiar top steps! in cloud-scud moonlight glow...the tower reels....".  a bit silly really!

interview with paul whitehead, cover artist.


during 1973 the band, without peter hammill, but including nic potter, released an instrumental album called the long hello. the album wasn't released in the uk until 1976.
the long hello

peter hammill answered some questions from a melody maker reader in the march 27th 1976 edition which included comments about the long hello. click on the paper to reveal.



jubilation abounded when in 1975 the band reformed with the classic line-up of peter hammill, dave jackson, hugh banton and guy evans.
see geoff barton's interview of may '75.

following a couple of secret gigs in wales, the band played in france and belgium in mid-1975, then their "debut" in the uk being at the victoria palace theatre on the 27th july and a little later at the new vic on august 30th. great concerts.
see also antony thorncroft's review in the financial times.
not quite as i remember it! it just shows how subjective reviews are. "there is a musical barrier which keeps out the trivial and the commercial, but also most of the threads that make for a worthwhile musical experience". well, it was a worthwhile musical experience for me!
the charisma press release announcing the oct/nov 1975 tour also contained a vdgg biography and an article that appeared in the times educational supplement entitled defying classification. the front cover sported an unusual picture, entitled "band of millions of years", which was used to publicise the godbluff tour and appeared on a compilation album cover.
university of east anglia concert
at this time i was studying at n.e.london polytechnic along with several friends from home, one of whom was involved with the union at the barking (mad) precinct. he was a budding journalist and set up an interview with the band. i went along as photographer and there appears below previously unpublished photographs of the band and the text of tim's article.

van der graaf played at the reading festival in 1976.  i was a regular frequenter of festivals at that time but for the first time i summoned up some energy and fought my way to the front. i was worried that they wouldn't prove popular with the crowd but i was wrong. reading at that time was undergoing a transition between quiet hippy scene and bottle throwing football hooligan mayhem and anything could happen. the band played brilliantly and went down well. i heard killer played live for the first time. i should have taken my camera.

(interestingly since i wrote the above words i found an interview by geoff barton, which mentions "old" van der graaf songs and in particular killer, and whether the band would play them. the article has a certain relevance to reading and you can cut straight to that section).
various people have reminded me that the band had a false start at reading. water had got into the electrics and the sound system didn't work. see reading festival for more details.
van der graaf generator gigs attended 1975-1978.

then in early 1977, disaster struck! hugh banton and dave jackson left the band. all was truly lost....but no, they were to be replaced by long-term vdgg stalwart nic potter (on bass) and new-comer graham smith (ex-string driven thing) on violin. a short while later charles dickie, a cellist, joined the group.
pictures of the band from 1977 to 1978
van der graaf albums from 1977 and 1978
the band also underwent a name change to van der graaf. well, i suppose we used to call them that anyway.

and that's about it really.after vital became the best selling van der graaf generator album, in july 1978, the band split up and peter hammill resumed his solo carreer.
whilst putting this site together i came across a few mistakes that might amuse you, but nobody's perfect.

... but then on november 29th 2004, van der graaf generator announced their reunion...
