google review by david:
salerno's is my family's go-to when we can't decide where to go. they have a wide selection of sandwiches, pasta, pizza, and seafood. i have tried more than half of their menu and it's all good! the service is always personal and polite. family friendly environment, with a bar next door for date nights. i highly recommend this restaurant.
