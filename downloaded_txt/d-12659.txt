song “stay (i missed you)” from the film reality bites. a trailblazing independent artist, lisa was the first pop musician to have a number 1 single while not signed to a recording contract. she followed that remarkable feat with several hit singles and six albums, two of which were certified gold. the dallas, tx native released her 15th album, a simple trick to happiness,’ to stellar reviews from critics and fans in 2020, and followed the release of this album with the debut of her new musical, together apart, which she co-wrote and co-produced with over 100 of her fellow brown university
