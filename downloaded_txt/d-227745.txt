								mr. watson,

 
							my name is adam winegardner.  my grandfather was 
							jack h. geisel and served in the 30th division, 
							120th regiment, co. d in world war ii.  he was a 
							true patriot and a great man.  jack was a 
							replacement and got to france sometime in august.  
							he passed away almost three years ago and i am doing 
							some research for myself and my family about his 
							service.  he didn't talk to us much about his 
							experiences.  i have just accomplished having his 
							name added to the roster of the 30th division
i have attached his dd 214.  as you may notice, he 
						was not credited with having participated in the battle 
						of the ardennes (battle of the bulge).  this is because 
						he was in a hospital (in paris i think) at the time 
						recovering from a bad case of psoriasis.  he was born 
						with that skin disease and it is known to flare up when 
						under stress.  he said his skin was raw from head to toe 
						before he asked to get it checked out.  he did not 
						return until after that battle was over.  i'm not sure 
						exactly whe



									i know that years ago, some of his buddies 
									from the army stopped to see him,sent 
									letters/christmas cards, and called him 
									different times after the war, but at the 
									time i asked him about them, he couldn't 
									remember any names.  he could however, 
									remember his serial number.  he said they 
									asked you for it everywhere you went. 
									
										he told me some stories about his time 
										during the war.  
										-he told of the night before/during the 
										crossing of the rhine river, that he 
										could read a letter he received from his 
										mother from the light of all the 
										artillery shells being fired on the 
										enemy before the crossing.
										-when he received cigarettes in his 
										rations, he traded them for candy 
										because he didn't smoke.
										-he ate his thanksgiving dinner that was 
										brought up from the rear on a roof 
										shingle because he no longer had his 
										mess kit. (i'm not sure what happened to 
										it.)
										-he lost his toothbrush at some point 
										and found another in a barnyard.  boiled 
										it and used it until he got a new one.
										
										-said they took their first showers in a 
										month in a coal mining town.  the 
										showers were at the coal mine and were 
										for use of the coal miners but they got 
										to use them.  he couldn't remember what 
										town it was, but thought maybe it was 
										spekholzerheide, holland.
										-once they entered germany they often 
										found potatoes in rooms in the middle of 
										the house.  they would fry them and eat 
										them.  they also used the tablecloths 
										for sheets.-they were being shelled (not 
										sure when or where) but while he was 
										digging a foxhole, he took off his long 
										sleeved shirt because it was warm and 
										threw it over a fence.  when he went to 
										get it back, it was rolled up in a ball 
										with a large piece of shrapnel in the 
										middle that burnt holes in it.  he 
										carried around that piece of shrapnel 
										for a while then threw it out.
										-almost everyone got seasick on the way 
										over to england and it took at least ten 
										days because they went down towards 
										south africa to avoid u-boats.  on the 
										way back, however, he did not get 
										seasick because he was so happy to be 
										going home.
										-he also mentioned being strafed and 
										shelled sometimes by their own planes 
										and artillery
it wasn't until after he died that i 
									found the pictures i have attached to this 
									e-mail.  i never got to ask him who is in 
									the pictures with him.  i have also attached 
									his obituary. if there is any way to put 
									them on the website to ask if anyone knows 
									who they are, i would like very much to do 
									that.  if not, it is no problem.
									thank you so much for all you do.
