paladin




























richard boone as paladin...what a great face. our recent houseguest loves the old "have gun-will travel" series so we watch episodes when she is here. i am fascinated by boone's amazingly craggy face. i did some sketchy sketches plus one that i liked enough to do some additional stuff.

"a knight without armor in a savage land." yeah.

godzilla. actually used a photo of a toy godzilla, not the actual...monster.

saw the movie last night and thought it was merely okay. i did enjoy the mutos more than godzilla.

reference for this is one of the photos for the latest trinquette challenge on facebook. i don't plan to enter the challenge but i thought it was an interesting pose, with a really tough (for me) angle to the face.
