explore our beers
for close to 155 years we’ve stayed true to jacob leinenkugel’s vision for combining the german brewing traditions of his homeland with the innovative spirit of his new home in wisconsin. today you’ll find that spirit alive and well inside our wide range of german-inspired beers. from shandy to ipas, weiss to bocks, spritzens to helles, we’ve got a beer to flavor any moment.
