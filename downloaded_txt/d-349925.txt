 the mcdaniel commitment



 the mcdaniel plan









"the student-professor relationships you have at mcdaniel are unlike anything else. they're committed to personalizing your experience."
taylor hoey, class of 2019













 













research opportunities research, publish, present, repeat.
apply your knowledge


in every department, you'll find options for participating in student-faculty research collaborations. each year, students work with professors on over 300 research projects; they often have their names listed as co-authors on journal articles and present work at national and international conferences. gaining serious research credibility as an undergraduate? that's the kind of thing that happens on the hill.




 explore research opportunities








 













constantly climbing. become your best self.
building your network.


everything you do on the hill has one ultimate aim; to prepare you for success. that's why most mcdaniel students complete at least one internship during their time on the hill. through the center for experience and opportunity and our internship fairs, you'll find opportunities that relate directly to your field of study or future vocation. more than part-time jobs, internships apply what you've learned in the classroom to the working world. you'll network with professionals who are employed in your field of interest, and get a preview of what your future career is really like.
