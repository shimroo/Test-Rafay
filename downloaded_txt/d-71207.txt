summer academy

















“the coaches, training, and mentality were all amazing and helped develop me into someone who was pushing towards collegiate and professional soccer. they instilled a mindset that demanded excellence and helped me grow as a person off the pitch at the same time.”

— matt freese (nycfc, mls) / (harvard university)




“as i have progressed through the various levels of soccer, it has become all the more evident how critical preparation and a challenging environment as a young player was for me! when i realized i wanted to play at the highest level in college, i joined penn fusion and i truly believe both my coaches and teammates pushed me and, ultimately, helped me achieve all of my goals. they not only provided me the exposure i needed, but the coaching staff challenged me, forced me to focus and improve my weaknesses and helped to find the best college fit. they were an integral part in getting me to where i am today, playing professionally for the washington spirit.”

— meghan mccool (washington spirit) / (univ. of virginia)
