 rating: 5 out of 5 stars

what an amazing hidden gem! stunning tropical grounds, amazing staff and beautiful accommodations. we stayed in the island city house king (pool side building) which couldn’t have been more perfect. there was a separate living area and full kitchen. this hotel was very charming as it’s the oldest operating guest house in key west. it’s the perfect distance away from duval to get some relaxation and much needed rest. highly recommend!

great time at island city house in key west

 rating: 5 out of 5 stars

wonderful historic hotel in the heart of key west’s old town. within walking distance of mallory square, duval street, and many great restaurants and nightspots. a short walk to meet the free duval loop bus if you want to go to more distant spots. amenities were excellent, rooms were comfortable; each one is a little different. staff were very helpful particularly carlos. loved our time there and look forward to visiting again.

ideal accommodations and service

 rating: 5 out of 5 stars

we stayed at island city house for 4 nights. the location in relation to downtown key west and the waterfront is ideal. it's not too close and also a quick walk to many restaurants and attractions. the rooms/suites are quaint, clean and have plenty of space. the staff at island city is friendly and available to provide information; extra blankets, towels, bottled water and even arrange airport transportation. island city house will be my choice for my next trip to key west.
