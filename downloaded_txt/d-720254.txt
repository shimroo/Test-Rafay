as-built drawings


in architecture and real estate, the term "as-built drawings" refers to floor plans and
                other technical
                illustrations that depict the architecture and/or layout of a building or space, at a particular
                moment in time, as determined by measuring the building itself. ideally,
                as-built drawings
                show the building in its most recent state, including deviations from the original
                construction drawings, and any subsequent retrofits or improvements to the property.
            
to create as-built floor plans, a building measurement survey is required. for the most
                accurate results, laser measurement technology is used to locate building architecture, including walls,
                columns, stairs, shafts,
                doors, windows, and fixtures etc. when measuring is complete, the coordinates
                are
                loaded into cad/bim software, where the individual floor plans are drafted according to the site
                verified
                dimensions. finished as-built plans can be exported to cad, bim and pdf.
extreme measures offers building measurement services for professional real estate
                applications, including property management, area determination, leasing, space planning, and marketing.
                our as-built measuring service includes as-built
                floor
                plans (cad/dwg & pdf), boma area analysis, color area schematics, and an area certificate letter.

3d laser scanning


generally speaking, the term "3d laser scanning" describes a class of digital optical technology
                that uses lasers to
                record the dimensional characteristics of real-world objects and environments - a process sometimes
                referred to as "reality capture." laser scanning
                has compelling applications in manufacturing, forensics, medicine, architecture, engineering, and
                construction.
for buildings and structures, laser scanners that utilize lidar technology offer the best combination of
                accuracy, resolution, and efficiency. these scanners can
                capture thousands (or even millions) of points per second. each point represents a position in
                space, and a
                cluster of points is called a point cloud.
                point
                clouds can be opened in standalone software, or imported into popular cad and bim
                applications,
                where they facilitate high precision as-built and digital twin modeling.
            
at extreme measures, our laser scanning service is specifically tailored for architecture, engineering,
                and
                construction projects. our site technicians utilize stationary lidar and mobile slam scanners to
                capture
                buildings with unparalleled accuracy and detail. our clients can order laser scanning as a
                standalone service, or in combination with our
                scan-to-bim and scan-to-cad modeling solutions.

boma measurements


today's floor measurement standards, such as those published by boma international and
                ipms, aim to standardize the way that key building area figures are calculated and used in the course of
                managing and transacting space. landlords, tenants, and other building stakeholders have a vested interest in
                knowing that floor area calculations are determined objectively, and according to the contractually
                agreed-upon standard.
in the united states, canada and elsewhere, boma area calculations like rentable area and gross
                leasable
                area are central to leasing, managing, buying, and selling space. the building owners and
                managers association continually develops its suite of boma measurement standards for commercial office,
                industrial, retail, multi-residential, and mixed-use buildings. these standards prescribe exactly how
                to measure square footage, and how to allocate common area proportionately to tenant
                spaces.
extreme measures is a leading expert in boma floor measurement
                standards and area certification. we are able to apply boma, ipms, or virtually any measurement definition
                to your
                existing cad plans. our typical deliverables include a global summary of areas chart, color area
                schematics,
                and an area certificate letter.
