the center for racial equity
law firms have a special responsibility to promote the values of justice, fairness, and equity. the center is dedicated to advancing racial justice by using legal, policy, and advocacy tools to help create a more fair and equitable society. visit afscre page.


 












careers
at arentfox schiff, opportunity is a function of creativity, drive, and talent. you won’t find a top-down management structure setting the tone at our firm, because we’re not a corporation, we’re a partnership. you’re in the driver’s seat. make your move. visit careers page.


 









 









 










diversity
diversity is a no-brainer. you don’t only see it in our policy manual. you see it in our people. visit diversity page.
