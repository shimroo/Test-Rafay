 about us:

founder: john moreno
john moreno founded wallacher guitar hangers over 30 years ago after being inspired by his guitar hanger creation in a small studio. there was no space for stands on the floor, and the guitar would fall over every time he used one. thus, he created a unique design that holds guitars just as securely as the hangers at music stores without having to install pegboards on the walls.
the original one was intended for a wall, but john later on realized he could also screw it to the side of his amp and hang the guitar there. since then, the design has evolved because some musicians didn't want to screw their amp in. he came up with several versions, one of which mounts beneath the amp's handle and enables the player to lean the guitar against a small amp or hang it on a large amp.
some designs can be mounted on walls, effects racks, and other surfaces. with our hangers, guitars can now be hung on walls or placed conveniently in the studio or on the stage, freeing up floor space.
