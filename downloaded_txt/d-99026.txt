about fixigames


hello!  my name is rich andrews and i created fixigames to blog about fun stuff about video games i like or just general game theory.  this project is a hobby, and a passion, for me.  
mrfixitonline.com
years ago i created a website called mrfixitonline.com that ran a bunch of online tournaments for real-time strategy games like age of empires and empire earth.  i got published in a aoe strategy guide (they got my name wrong, but they got my website right!)  we got really popular back then with about 3 million visitors a month, got flown around the world to teach gaming companies and high-power players about gaming, and just had soooo much fun!
that project ended and i moved to some other adventures.  playing the online game world of warcraft my guild gave me the moniker “fixi,” which was an evolution from “mr.fixit” and it stuck.  so i have kept that for many years now.

then in 2021 my nephewson michael and his son ryan and daughter emily introduced me to roblox.  after just a little time in it, i thought, “hey, wouldn’t it be fun to create a game together?”  as with many of those silly ideas, i decided to run with it.  i created this site just to collect my musings.
