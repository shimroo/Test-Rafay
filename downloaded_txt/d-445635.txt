a place for you at all saints

all saints is a community from boston, the nearby south shore, and from points further away. those who worship here include both episcopalians and other baptized christians who find the faith and worship of this christian community meaningful, as well as those seeking to find a place to experience god's presence. much parish business (and a good deal of fun and pleasantries) happens at coffee hour, so if you want to find out what makes all saints, ashmont the place it is, a good first step is to join us in peabody hall for some refreshment after the mass. if you are looking for opportunities to be a part of the every week business of the community, here are some ministries where you would be very welcome...
