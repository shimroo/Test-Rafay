peter, paul and mary are folk singers. so stated
                        the liner notes to the groups self-titled 1962 debut album. today,
                        this declaration seems redundant, because the term folk music has
                        come to be virtually interchangeable with the group name, but when the
                        words were written, they were meant less as a stylistic distinction than
                        as a mission statement.
 in the decades prior to the 60s, through the
                    work of such avatars as woody guthrie, the weavers and pete seeger, folk
                    music had become identified with sociopolitical commentary, but the
                    idiom had been forced underground in the senator joe mccarthy
                    witch-hunting era of the late 50s. by the time peter, paul and mary
                    arrived on the scene, for the majority of america, folk was viewed
                    merely as a side-bar to pop music which employed acoustic instruments.
                    at this critical historic juncture, with the nation still recovering
                    from the mccarthy era, the civil rights movement taking shape, the cold
                    war heating up and a nascent spirit of activism in the air, peter
                    yarrow, noel (paul) stookey and mary travers came together to juxtapose
                    these cross currents and thus to reclaim folks potency as a social,
                    cultural and political force. but few at the time could have realized
                    how fervently and pervasively the groups message of humanity, hope
                    and activism would be embraced.   (full
