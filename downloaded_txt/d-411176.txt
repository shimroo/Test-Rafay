toyo tire u.s.a. corp. chooses wise


challenge
with the high demand of tires around the world toyo tires needed an upgraded warehouse management system. today’s economy drove toyo tires to a decision to minimize waste and gain better control of their product distribution. tighter inventory control, agile inventory management, and increased productivity.

solution
royal 4’s tire warehouse management system (called wise) provides an rf solution for inventory receiving, put-away, cross-docking, product location, picking, shipping, tire aging alerts, nafta compliance, outbound documentation and more. wise tracks tires from the moment they are received; directing the put-away process to best utilize available space and it eliminates the guesswork when picking orders by directing pickers to strategic retrieval locations. this results in making staging and loading tires more efficient and accurate. the wise tire warehouse manager seamlessly integrates with toyo’s sap system in real time, increasing efficiencies and reducing costly data entry errors.

what toyo tires has to say!
“we had many options to choose from when deciding on a warehouse management system.  toyo has experienced several consecutive months with 100% accuracy on receiving, inventory & shipping”
