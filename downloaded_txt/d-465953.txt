mom's at home® - family resources











a child will make
love stronger,
days shorter,
nights longer,
the home happier,
the past forgotten,
and the future
worth living for.

i'm a stay-at-home mom.  my husband and i have worked hard so that i could stay home to raise our children.  maintaining the mom's at home® family resources web site, finding new links to put here, and writing about what i believe in has become a hobby of mine.  i hope that what i write about and where i link to will be of interest to families. canadian links are marked with  and stay-at-home parent links are marked with .  just because a site is marked as   or doesn't mean it won't be of interest to you.  these symbols do not mean that the information is directed at these groups exclusively.
