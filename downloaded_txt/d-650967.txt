haleakala summit bike tour




you meet for the tour at 9am in the town of paia. you will then board the van for a drive to the summit of haleakala. you'll be able to view haleakala crater. then you reboard the van to be driven down to the entrance of haleakala national park , where you will begin your bike descent. you will be outfitted with all the necessary gear including helmets, gloves, windbreakers, backpacks and a map. the first part of the downhill you will cruise down the 21 switchbacks through haleakala ranch. this be will be done entirely at your leisure, stopping as often as you like. there are many scenic lookouts for some great photo shots.




 one scenic stop, after the first 9 miles downhill is sunrise market & protea flower farm. you can view their exotic protea flowers from south africa. in addition they have locally grown fruits, coffee, snacks & restrooms available. at this point there are some optional routes for more avid cyclists, who would like to ride some extra miles and including a visit to the maui winery. 

on all the bike tours you will make your way back to paia, by no later than 4:30pm.
