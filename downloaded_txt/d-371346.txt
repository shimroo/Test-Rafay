welcome to 
sue andersen realty!
 
thank you for visiting our website.  sue andersen realty is
  a locally and independently owned real estate brokerage, located in branson,
  missouri, in the heart of the beautiful ozark mountain country.   
 
we have served the buyers and sellers in the branson and
  surrounding region for 35 years, and have had the privilege of representing
  some of the finest people you could ever hope to meet.  many have become
  close personal friends.  
 
while the real estate industry is, and always will be, a
  constantly changing profession, the level of fiduciary responsibility,
  service and care will never change.  throughout my career, this faith
  grounded, people centered service has always been first and foremost, and
  will always remain so.  
 
if you are a past client or customer, or are looking for a
  fresh look at your representation options, we would appreciate your
  consideration.  whether leading the team in listing and marketing your
  property for sale, or helping you find that perfect fit in a property for
  you and your family, we have the experience and expertise to serve you with
  the professionalism, knowledge and skill that you expect.  as a member of the
  somo (southern missouri) regional  mls, we are able to search all
  available listings in the branson mo, ozark, nixa, springfield and the tri
  lakes area.  if you have researched properties on your own, as most buyers
  now do, and identify properties of interest, make note of the listing numbers
  and we can further research them for you.  
 
before you buy real estate, engage your own real estate
  professional to protect your best interest - from locating suitable
  properties, to contract negotiation, inspection processes and settlement,
  seek a real estate broker who will be your representative in buying your new
  home, land, or commercial location.  sue andersen realty has decades of
  experience as buyers agents.
 
 
please call or email us and let us know what you are interested
  in.  we would be glad to help!
