our research
through its state-of-the-art facilities and advanced computer resources, mse integrates education and research, giving our students opportunities to solve real-world problems in the classroom, field and laboratory settings. our faculty work in research areas that feature unique challenges and impacts:

artificial intelligence
computational materials science
electronic, optical, and magnetic materials
energy materials
materials characterization
soft matter and biomaterials
structural materials



learn by doing








broaden your world
student organizations: network with students and professionals outside the classroom by choosing from our department organizations or other college of engineering student organizations.
co-op experience: gain hands-on job experience through the cooperative education program while pursuing your degree, and get paid for it.
study abroad: engineer without borders. many employers are looking for graduates with second languages and international exposure. study abroad introduces you to global engineering.



giving
donations help the mse department evolve and keep pace with the latest technology while giving our students the skills, global awareness, and sense of responsibility they need to make a difference. consider supporting the department today. follow our give now link to donate to the materials science and engineering enhancement fund.
