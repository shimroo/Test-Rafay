friends for dinner





okay here we all are lined up to take the classic group pic with our salmon dinner. kinda dorky but i love it!so from the right, it's peter, anjie , thayne, sharon, jonathan, michelle, quentin, moi, chase, and calvin is the photographer.thayne and chase eating dinner. in the end we put them at opposite sides of the table, cause they were easier to manage.thayne was born 2 days after chase, except he was 2 weeks over due and chase was 5 weeks pre-mature. you'd never really notice now.hey who's taller?our little cuties!
