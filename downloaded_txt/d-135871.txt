rip matt harris

 5 february 20215 february 2021  taylor






from the posies’ facebook page:


“it is with a very heavy heart we acknowledge that the news circulating today is true. matt harris, bassist for the posies from 2001 til 2014, has passed away. matt lent his incredible skills, mischievous humor and abject sweetness to many posies tours and his brilliant bass lines are captured on our albums “every kind of light” (2005) and “blood candy” (2010). rest well, matt. you will be missed.”
