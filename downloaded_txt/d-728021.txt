michigan lemon law lawyers
protecting your rights

michigan lemon law applies to passenger vehicles, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and vans purchased or leased in michigan with a manufacturer’s express warranty. even if a vehicle isn’t covered under michigan state lemon law, there is a federal law and other consumer protection statutes that can apply.
defects that significantly impair the use, safety, or value of your vehicle may qualify your vehicle for repurchase. if the automaker has not repaired your vehicle under warranty after a reasonable amount of attempts (which can be as few as two), your vehicle may qualify for repurchase. lemon law can cover used cars too, but only if the defect was reported to the manufacturer or authorized dealer within the first year after delivery to the original owner.
if you have repeatedly brought your car in for repairs for a qualifying defect, get in touch with our experienced team.
