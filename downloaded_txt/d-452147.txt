 summary 

for sleamaine (sliabh meáin):
simple to reach, easier to leave.







summary created by colin murphy
16 may, 2019








 picture: knocknocloge as seen from top



park at the entrance to the wicklow way - a (o17327 06289). follow track for about 6-700m until you encounter a sharp bend and the forest begins on your right. follow the edge of this forest west for several hundred metres, and then turn south, continuing along the edge of the forest, following a fence. where fence turns left (east), you will see the broad mound of the summit ahead. you can pick up a narrow track directly opposite the corned of the forest, which will take you virtually all the way to the top. the top is unmarked and featureless, basically a broad, heathery rise, but offers good views to the west.

new indistinct summit with fine views


by hibby
3 feb 2025


a 2-hour walk taking in the summits of ballinafunshoge and sleamaine is largely undemanding, with little change of level and mainly on forest roads. to access the summit of sleamaine i recommend the route described in pepe's comment.leave the wicklow way where it bends at b (o16884 05132) and follow a path nne along the fenceline. the path is fairly clear and well-defined but watch out for stray fence wire on the ground. after about 150 metres cross a fence (carefully) and continue along the path to the summit area. the summit is unmarked and the exact high point is not clear. one candidate is c (o16992 05509). linkback: mountainviews.ie/summit/690/comment/24375/

 picture: view sw from the uninspiring top of sleamaine. 









easy, when you know the way!


by harry goodman
1 jun 2012


heading home from a day's walking in wiclow on 28 may 2012 i decided to go and visit two hills that can be approached from the wicklow way near l tay, sleamaine and ballinafunshoge. i parked to the side of the forest entrance near the pier gates and signed for the wicklow way a (o17327 06289), and as suggested by csd walked along the track to d (o17205 05915) to access a forest ride that would give me "easy" access to the top.  not so, things have changed since csd was there in july 2007, in particular the trees have been harvested between the road and the quoted access point/forest ride.  however as i could see evidence of a track going up the line of what previously would have been a forest ride i decided to plough on!  the area is covered with the remains of debris from harvesting the trees and progress along called for much clambering over same for about 200m to the end of the forest and open ground. once there it was relatively easy to make progress left (ssw) along the forest edge and pick up a narrow but distinct path that could be followed along to the unmarked top of the hill on a flat heather covered area e (o16995 05505). on retracing my steps back along the forest edge, about 250m along, i passed an obvious path f (o17011 05755) going off to my right (se) and followed it down for some 400m to return to the wicklow way track. while some felling has taken place in this area there were no obstructions on the path (may 2012) to hinder progress. for anyone wishing to go to the top i would there fore recommend the use of this path, some 700m along from the start, at g (o17402 05653) to gain "easy" access to the top of this  hill. once back at the wicklow way i could have made a simple turn to the left and back to the start but as i also wanted to include ballinafunshoge in my walk i turned right (s) and followed the track for about 2k in search of an access point. but that is another storey, for another place! linkback: mountainviews.ie/summit/690/comment/6839/

dhmiriam on sleamaine


by dhmiriam

sleamaine, to the ear very much resembles, the gaelic word sleamhain (pl) sleamhna) which means slippery, smooth or sleek, (ag sleamhnu - meaning to slip or slide). just add water.... as the recipe puts it, and one may not be too wide of the mark. linkback: mountainviews.ie/summit/690/comment/2914/

padodes on sleamaine


by padodes
10 dec 2007


not the most impressive top in wicklow, but it does have the redeeming grace of affording one of the best views of lough tay and luggala (fancy) to the north, as can be seen in the photo. the etymology of the name itself seems to have stumped mountain views, and a wider search on the internet drew a blank as well. in his "east and south" walk guide, david herman describes a full five-hour, low-level circuit of lough dan, which includes sleamaine and ballinafunshoge. be aware, though, that to find a suitable place to cross the inchavore river, you may have to walk a good distance up the valley between kanturk and knocknacloghoge. as i found to my discomfort one late evening, it tends to carry a lot of water, even after a spell of dry weather. linkback: mountainviews.ie/summit/690/comment/2913/

djouce on sleamaine


by djouce
23 mar 2008


sleamaine is just a short walk from the entrance to the wicklow way near guinness gates h (o173 063). park at the entrance to the wicklow way and walk a short distance through the trees to the edge of  the wood. follow the edge of the forestry plantation until you get to sleamaine (which is an undistinguished summit but has good views to the west). continue along the edge of the forestry plantation to ballinafunshoge. there is an east-west ride from the boundary which goes to or near the summit (which i could not locate for certain among the trees) linkback: mountainviews.ie/summit/690/comment/3014/
