    teaching and fellowship for the whole family

jesus christ is the center of our church - teaching, worship, and fellowship. what you learn in church should have a positive impact on your whole life and the life of your family. follow us as we follow christ! everything else will fall into place.but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.matthew 6:33
