life space crisis intervention

lsci is a brain-based, trauma-informed, relationship-building verbal strategy that turns crisis situations into learning opportunities for young people who exhibit challenging behaviors.
lsci provides educators, counselors, social workers, psychologists, child & youth care workers, parents, and other caring adults with a systematic, 6-stage process to move from stress and conflict to insight and long-term behavioral change.
