day caremy three-part schedule for every day


01morningthe sun rises, and so do i. with determination, i hit the pavement, jogging for an entire hour. as i return, i pour a glass of orange juice, like liquid sunshine, and savour two slices of hearty brown bread. a bowl full of green veggies promises vitality for the entire day. and finally, a fluffy scrambled egg, a masterpiece in itself, crowns my morning ritual. sounds perfect, right?

6:00 am – 12:00 pm



02mid dayas the sun starts to scorch overhead and the clock strikes 12, you’d typically find me immersed in my research for my next blog. the demanding schedule can occasionally keep me tethered to the screen, but i make an effort to take a brief stroll every 20 minutes. amidst all this, i never overlook my lunch. you would always find my bone china plates adorned with a delightful array of vitamins and proteins.

12:00 pm – 6:00 pm



03night timeas the sun begins its descent after a busy day, i prepare my body for the final meal. i tend to opt for lighter fare over heavier dishes. after relishing the delightful flavours, i take a leisurely stroll for about an hour before heading off to sleep. and yes, i restrict myself from scrolling throughout the night! i also avoid consuming alcoholic beverages which can disrupt my slumber in the middle of the night!

6:00 pm – 10:00 pm
