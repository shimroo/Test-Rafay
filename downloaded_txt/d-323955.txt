 about calypso danes our danes allow us to live in the house with them! the great dane became a part of our family in 1981. in 1990, our love of the breed drew us to our first dog show (just to watch and dream a little). we were encouraged and guided in a breeding program that's main goal is to produce healthy, happy great danes that are correct in conformation and temperament.although we are a licensed kennel, we are not what most people expect.


because of our love for our puppies, we screen adoptive parents, which enables us to place our puppies in the best possible homes. we have no formal application process, because i believe in speaking with prospective puppy parents. an application is very impersonal and after a few conversations, i get to know you better than any form could ever let me. at calypso danes, our new puppy owners become lifetime family. we always love to hear from them and they know that they are welcome to call us at any time.many of our dane owners return to us for another puppy. they know the love and care we give our pups, and they know they can depend on us to be there for them. at calypso danes, all adults have their hips x-rayed for dysplasia, thyroid checked, and deemed healthy by our veterinarian prior to breeding. learn more about our selection of great dane adults and puppies.call (386) 774-5472


   we are color ethical breeders. all pups are house raised with lots of love and attention (including lots of play with our seven grandchildren, five of which live with us full time). our vet family thinks that we are, at times, overprotective parents, but that's ok.feel free to contact our vet at spring oaks animal care. their phone number is (386) 736-6747. you may talk with any of the staff.all puppies have a veterinary-issued health certificate, at least two sets of "puppy shots", are at least nine weeks of age before they leave us, and have a two-year written hereditary health guarantee.at calypso danes, we strive for quality and temperament in every home-raised great dane puppy.we feel that when you get a great dane puppy from calypso, you get a...great dane!
