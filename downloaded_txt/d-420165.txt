a future bold enough to match the times
the endowment for health works to improve the health and reduce the burden of illness for the people of new hampshire, especially the vulnerable and underserved. we envision a future where all people who call new hampshire their home are happy, healthy and thriving. a future where healthy aging is easy, and every child has what they need to grow to be their best self. a future where differences among our people are welcomed and celebrated. a future where geography and circumstances do not define our wellbeing. a future of hopeful possibilities. join us.





embracing the amazing future of aging





what if we all considered aging to be a positive and acknowledged the contributions that older adults make to our economy and our communities? that’s the work of the nh state commission on aging. together with the alliance for healthy aging, momentum is building to provide community-based services for older adults while strengthening inter-generational bonds across our state.
in memory of susan ruka, whose dedication to older adults strengthened the intergenerational bonds across our state and made nh a better place for all.
