saas and locally hosted solutionsdesktop alert provides three business models; software as a service (saas), locally hosted solutions and a hybrid solution. locally hosted solutions operate behind an organizations firewall. the desktop alert locally hosted solution integrates with directory services such as active directory. our hybrid solution is for clients who desire a higher level of redundancy for times when the internet connection to the cloud becomes interrupted. in such instances the hybrid kicks into gear and automatically the local on-premise solution becomes the primary server. once the internet connection is restored the cloud seamlessly takes control as the primary server once again without administrative assistance.mass alert notification systems
