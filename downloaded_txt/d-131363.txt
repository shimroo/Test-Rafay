welcome to english country inns, the largest online directory of inns in england. whether you are looking for a romantic break, weekend break in the countryside or a late availability deal, we have it covered!
the english inn is a great english institution and a stay at one of these inns is a unique experience. many are steeped in history, with creaky floorboards, wonky walls, ancient beams, cosy nooks and crannies and a welcome as warm as the roaring fire in the inglenook fireplace. others have been re-imagined into modern hostelries with sleek, contemporary interiors and all mod cons. whatever style of inn you choose, you can always expect a warm welcome and a comfortable stay.
