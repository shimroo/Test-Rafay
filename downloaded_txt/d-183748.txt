about me





i have been married to a wonderful woman for over 30 years.  we live in san lorenzo california. laura works at a catholic school in hayward as a reading recovery specialist and i spend my days shooting photographs at the oakland zoo.
i am retired and i get my exercise by walking up and down the hills of the oakland zoo while shooting photographs of the animals as the only official volunteer photographer at the oakland zoo,  and as a docent the rest of the time.
