a post about food





m and i have been trying to eat at home more this year. since eating out is so incredibly cheap here, and usually pretty tasty, it's easy to eat out a lot. not that healthy though. lots of oil and salt. i've experimented with a lot of new recipes. that has been fun. some things m and i have both liked, and some we've disagreed on the taste quotient. so far this year i've made all kinds of things, like lemony lentil soup, lemon chicken soup, borsht, homemade pizza dough (without yeast), rice pudding, pound cake, chocolate macaroons, cream of mushroom soup, baking soda bisquits....among some other things... (ok some of those aren't that healthy but they are all homemade...) many recipes i've tried, are courtesy of allrecipes.com and some are courtesy of my mom, and some are picked from here or there...i've learned to make an easy local cucumber dish, but i'm still perfecting it. the person that taught me didn't use a recipe and could tell me the ingredients but couldn't tell me how much of each. she just said "i think you have to make it many times before you can get it right." so, i made it and put in too much vinegar, it made m's teeth hurt. so, it's work in progess.  the baking powder bisquit recipe i have is fantastic. i say that as one who loves carbohydrates. and it just popped into my recipe book after a friend stayed in our apartment last summer. thank you very much terrie! tonight, i tried a new recipe- cabbage roll casserole.... i have been wanting to try my hand at making cabbage rolls for a long time, but when push came to shove, this casserole seemed easier with my time limit, and i have all the ingredients. m and i both agree- it's really good!! i think the recipe that i've made that got the best reviews was a jean pare recipe that my mom and dad sent me for cream of mushroom soup.(thanks mom and dad!) it was liked by local friends and canadian friends. we even made it again tonight. it's good. and low fat if you substitute skim milk for the cream. i won't post it here as it's probably copyright or something... but oh jean pare, thank you for the yummy goodness. and note that you can get some free recipes on her site...some christmas baking ....  the macaroons that were delicious even if they didn't set right and i had to eat most of them myself. wonder what recipe he's going to make with that side of pork on the back of his bike?

a little of this, and a little of that





i find myself mentally updating my blog a lot, thinking things in point form bullets. something like this....- this is a very sneezy place. lotsa sneezing, everywhere.  - lots of spring tree blossoms out everywhere, it's just so beautiful.- i make things with lentils now. does that make me crunchy granola? - i've tried making lots of new things this year:rice pudding, lemon chicken soup, borsht... and pig's in blankets.... which is little weiners wrapped in dough.... one of the dough pieces came open while cooking, we renamed it "pig on a couch." he seemed to be reclining comfortably.- for a conversational english class that i teach, i made my students (all professionals) pick english names to use. i mostly just wanted them to pick them so that they become more familiar with the sound of english names. it's also really fun giving people names. lotsa fun. fun fun fun. i made up a list of appropriate names for their age and status etc.. and then let them pick. one man came a couple days late so i made a special list just for him with names like william, timothy, peter,  etc etc .... and at the last minute just for fun i threw in "lanny" in reference to lanny mcdonald. do you know out of all those names, which he picked? lanny. lanny it is. which for some reason makes me ridiculously happy.  - the neighbour dog is cute but barky. - who are the neighbourhood ladies always yelling at to "come here!"? - the dog can't compete with the neighbour ladies for volume, or ability to vocally pierce through a wall or window. - for the most part it doesn't bother us.

spring has sprung around here. a few days ago i saw some gigantic blossoms on some trees. i think they were magnolia trees. that was so exciting!! since then i've seen some cherry blossoms. ahhh spring. while it is beautiful outside, it's turned a bit chilly inside. our heat went off a few days ago, as it usually does in mid march. all the heat turns off in the city at that time. at first it was still warm inside, but now, since it's been a bit cool outside, i've had to also don a few more layers inside. it is a quiet day here today. good friday- i will post something later about that. it's a special day to remember. but i'll post about that later. it has been quiet, and it's been nice. i'm going to make some vegetable soup for supper, and relax this evening. maybe watch a movie, or maybe an episode of "monk." i love that show. i was going back through some pictures from last summer earlier today. we had a good time. it was nice to look back, would you like to see some of the pictures? we ate hot dogs at this place, and looked out at the ocean. looking at the umbrellas you'd swear you were someplace tropical. it was very serene. and the hot dogs were good.               lilacs, can anything beat the smell?and wildlife, we saw some wildllife... we did a little bit of boating with friends and family....                             and the flowers.... and there were sunsets. beautiful sunsets. some were in the sky and one was the kind of sunset that come at the end of a life time. m's step-dad don passed away while we were home last summer. though he was sick, it still felt sudden. it was sad, but we felt blessed that we were in the country at the time. last summer would also be the last time we would see this little cutie. she has since gone on to that great doggie heaven in the sky. we also saw many people last summer, family, and friends. i don't have pictures of all of them, nor do i know how people would feel about seeing their mug on my blog....so no pics of the people...but it was definately a hilight.just one more flower picture.......

i have the most fun when exhaustion erodes my judgement





i think i'm a bit over baked. tired. we stayed up to 2am working on stuff. (it wouldn't have been that late except that somewhere between 10 and 11 we started a deep discussion about life) hence 2am bedtime. i think i'm a little over tired though. i'm in the process of writing a few informational emails. i keep erasing things i think are really funny as better judgement prevails. i realize the people getting the emails won't think it as funny because they may not be over tired.

shepherd's pie and a crazy babboon





we had some local friends over tonight. it was a nice evening. we had supper together- i made shepherd's pie, broccoli and baking powder bisquits. the guys who came over to visit don't eat much western food so it's always fun to serve them stuff. the shepherd's pie- i gave them forks and knives to eat it with, then noticed out of the corner of my eye that the one guy had put the fork down and was getting down and slurping it off his knife. (these guys don't use knife and fork much) it wasn't that he can't use a fork, it was that slurping it off the knife was more comfortable... so i went and got him some local utensils. the broccoli- they found it strange that we didn't put any sauce on it, so i found them some sauce for it. the bisquits, m and i had some butter for the bisquits, and the guys wanted to try it. so, upon eating the butter, one of them made the pronouncement: " nothing!" he kept saying that over and over "nothing!" he was so surprised that it didn't have much taste. then m brought out some cheese and let them try it, and then the guy said "something!" (generally here, people aren't that crazy about the taste of cheese.)he said "first i say 'nothing!' then i say 'something!' then i say 'never!"(meaning 'never again) he was just referring to the cheese thankfully! that was the meal. after the meal we played cards. the one guy was goofing around and started beating his chest when he would win a round. so i called him a babboon in the local language. he thought that was quite funny so he kept doing it. so, i called him a "crazy babboon." he gave that the thumbs up. if one of his friend's called him that he would think it a little funny, but because i'm just learning the language- it's more funny coming from me. what i find funny is that i can not say useful stuff like "remember" and "no msg please" and "paper towel" but i can call a guy a crazy babboon. note: you might think that "remember" is pretty basic, and i did look it up once, but then i promptly forgot it. and you'd be surprised how far you can go without having to use the word "remember" besides, i do know how to say "don't forget" so i make as much milage from that as i can.

2007 special moments and people awards





and the award goes to:the who sent you? award: to the two minority ladies with their beautiful hair, and lovely dresses, who gave me a seat when i had none.to the two gentlemen who popped up out of the blue to help me and little e with our great big bags, down the stairs and up again, on the train and off the train.to the man who went to get the store security when my locker was jammed and couldn't get it open.to various strangers who offered language help in a moment of confusion. to the gracious taxi drivers, store vendors, and people in general who have offered their help, pleasant curiousity, and smiles..... this award's for you. the luckiest person to walk away without being punched in the nose award: picture me, on a train, no seat, just standing there leaning against one of the seats, swaying with the train. a man starts up a conversation with me- it goes like this: initial chit chat, where are you from... etc... (in english) man: foreigners are often fat and don't look beautiful. me: (no response) man: yes foreign women are often fat and don't look beautiful. i sell underwear that makes women look beautiful. me: oh. man:(showing me pictures of a local lady who is not particularly fat, just normal) see? pictures. before, see? this lady not beautiful. me: ok. man:(showing me a second set of pictures.) see, after...beautiful! man:foreign women are often fat and not beautiful. man: (showing me pictures of the woman in her amazing beautifying underwear) see, after, beautiful! me: (waving my hand in the air and laughing) ok, ok ok. man:ok. (and he left me alone. except to ask if i could sing, and to tell that he could sing well.) cutest student award: this is a hard one, as i have a lot of really neat people in my classes. really. cool people. but in the end, the award goes to the girl who out of the blue gave me this little bubu stuffed bear.... because, i'm not even her teacher anymore. she was sooooo sweet about it. and she got my white elephant gift during a gift exchange- this green candle that wasn't particularly pretty, but she was absolutely thrilled and made it known that no one should try to steal it from her. i was particularly surprised because i was strict with that class. i even confiscated her ipod during one class. go figure. she gets the cutest student award, for her sweet spirit. most awkward moment with a stranger awardin may, m and i went back to canada for some rest. on the plane ride back we were really tired. over tired i'd say. we had seats in the middle section. there were a number of empty seats throughout the plane- one of them next to us. yahoo! this seemed like such a nice perk, because i could lie down if i wanted to... ahhhhh. we could spread out just a bit. the couple in front of us had the same luxury. the man in front of us was watching the movie and his wife had curled up on the seats next to him. the guy sitting to our right in the section by the window saw something askew however. i was still sitting up, just thinking of lying down..... helpful man from the window section approaches us in the dim cabin... man:"the man in front of you is a little bit squished by the man who is in front of him who is reclining. i'd like to move him into this seat next to you." (i surveyed the situation and didn't feel he needed to move back, all he had to do was switch seats with his wife who was lying down...and i didn't want to give up that seat!!!) me:"i prefer no." man:"oh, do you speak english? is this your seat? this man is looking uncomfortable, and i would like to move him back here." me:"yes i speak english. he has an extra seat too, he only needs to move over.so i prefer no." man:" oh, maybe you don't understand me..." and he repeats the situation and he sees it."me:" no i prefer no." that was the end of discussion, this man was really sincerely trying to be helpful- he wasn't in any way rude through our conversation... but his solution wasn't necessary. after a few minutes the other man moved over on his own volition. problem solved. but i hate confrontation, and saying no, and so i couldn't sleep for a long time after that. i was a bit disgruntled with that guy for awhile. and why did he think i don't speak english? i realize my grammar wasn't exactly correct,"i prefer not" is better than "i prefer no" but good grief. awkward. the happy back awardfor my back because for about 80% of the year it has really been pleasant to be with. inspiration awardgoes to louisa vaughan, who though not a woman of fame, and having been dead many years, inspired me this year through her book full of stories of god's amazing answers to her prayers. wow. blew my socks off. husband of character awardgoes to m. you really rose to the occasion this year. what would i do without you?people of resilience awardover the last few years i've been hearing stories of friends, and strangers in this country who go through such heart rending stuff. it makes you wonder why people here aren't basket cases. a few examples (which didn't all happen this year but things with this level of drama are happening here still): one young woman we know- her mother passed away- she was washing a comforter in the river and the current took the big blanket away and the mother with it, she didn't know how to swim so she began drowning. she was pulled out, still alive. there was a doctor there, he refused to help her until someone could guarentee payment. there was no one from her family there so no one would guarentee payment. she died. another guy we know: he is now an adult,and should have a younger brother but his mother was forced to have an abortion in her 8th month by local officials. another friend of ours: his dad spent time in jail this year...the stories go on and on. these kinds of things happen every year. the things you hear curl your toes. injustice, corruption, health issues, bad health system, cheating..... but through all of it, the people keep on going. their stories seem so dramatic, and yet they keep on going. so, because of that they get the 2007 people of resilience award.

every week i teach various english classes. my favourite class to teach is the one for professionals who are going overseas. they need to work on their english so that their time overseas will be of the most benefit. some of them have a very low level of english, but they are interesting to teach because they are highly motivated to improve. they have chosen to be in the class and see it as an opportunity. another class that i enjoy teaching is a class for third year university students. they are also highly motivated. their english is already pretty good. they do pretty much whatever i ask them to do- get into groups, discuss a,b or c, make sentances using the verb "to putter." they are pretty fun. they often try to use long words, or phrases without the correct grammar- that can get a little messy. and occasionally i get something like last week i asked them what they thought "a penny saved is a penny earned" meant. one guy stood up and said,  "to earn is the best way of saving, of course we all know that the best offense is to attack, that's all." and then he sat down. he also tagged something else on the end there which i can't remember right now because it was so random, but what do you do with that? what does that mean? anyway, they try hard. they've worked hard to be in university, and they want to use the opportunity to actually learn. it makes them fun to teach.  my least favourite class is the one that i taught this morning. and i'm usually not a play favourites kinda person, but these guys.... not so enjoyable to teach. why you ask? well, because they aren't motivated in class. they are all planning to go overseas to study, so they need to get a diploma that says that they finished this english course. you'd think going overseas to study would be a motivator to actually learn the language there, but no.  it's a conversation class, so my job is to get them talking, and as a foreign teacher to listen to their pronunication, grammar etc, and help them with all of that. but the most important thing is to get them talking. half the class are ok. a few of them are so- so in the motivation department, then there are a few that just don't do much of anything. i assign them something to talk about but they don't have the personal maturity to actually put much effort into it. so they do it for 30 seconds (if that) then chat with their neighbour or whatever.  i can usually enjoy going and teaching the class, as like i say, most of them are ok. but this morning, i got 3 extra hours of teaching tacked onto my schedule with them, during a time that is usually time off for me. i found it more difficult to be patient with them. i read them the riot act when i came in at first... here are my expectations.. blah blah blah.... this is conversation class... blah blah blah... if i ask you to talk about something, i expect you to do it. if you don't like it you can leave.... etc. i said all of it very matter of fact and quite nicely.but then later, after i was getting irritated with some of the little things done in class that short circuit the learning process (ie- people always whispering the answers to each other so there's no thinking going on ) i read the riot act #2. which was basically: your english stinks. you are smart enough to do this, but you aren't working hard enough. and if you don't put more effort in this you are going to be in big trouble when you go overseas.-- i said it in a nice but matter of fact way. and then i gave them homework. i don't usually give homework. all i usually ask is that they work hard in class. and dude i didn't give them any second break because some of them were gone so long for the first one. i wanted to introduce them to the term "royal butt kicking" because i felt like they needed one, but i decided to save that for next week. i'm am a little afraid for these guys. i mean they are going to be in regular university level classes when they go overseas. (not learning english classes) they are going to be studying economics or business or some such thing. you'd think they'd be motivated. you may ask why are they not more motivated? well, i'm told that for most of them their families have money, so they think they don't have to study as mom and dad's money will get them through. i guess in some ways, going over abroad and finding yourself in a class that's way over your head might be a good thing, especially if there's no opportunity to buy better marks or a degree. welcome to the real world. on tap for next class? a discussion involving the terms "taking responsibility" and "it's your own fault."

tis the season





christmas hasn't really been a tradition here. not the way it's a tradition in many other parts of the world. people are aware of it, but most don't "celebrate" it. you will see businesses decorating for it. and schools. sometimes it gets a little crazy compared to what we do in n.america. (but who ever said that our store bought decorations were the "correct" way to decorate?)  "christmas disco" you will sometimes find materials encorporated into the decoration that we typically don't use - here we see some shells.....and, decorating time frame is a bit looser here as well. i think i caught this santa in may or june.(notice the snoopy in his bag- snoop's popular here.)ever have a problem deciding where to put the tree? why not hang it upside down from the ceiling? but really, some parts of christmas- ie) decorating with lights and tinsel, and trees..... it's fun, but it's subjective right? it's just decorating to celebrate the core of christmas. how you celebrate is up to you- be it hanging the tree from the ceiling, or putting it in a corner, having a two inch tree or a 10 footer... or no tree at all.... doesn't matter. what matters is the core. are you really celebrating christmas? are you really celebrating the coming of jesus? if by hanging that upside down tree you are doing so to recognize the wonderful gift of christ, then you are properly celebrating. if you hang no decorations, sing no songs, send no cards, make no cookies, but raise a simple prayer of thanks to god in your heart for his indescibably gift - then you have just celebrated christmas!             "yahoo! christmas blessings coming! look out below!"
