evie, formerly spaghetti "evie is the best girl!! she is the most tenderhearted, snuggly love bug i could have hoped for. she is becoming more comfortable & confident every day & her little personality is so funny.  she loves toys, puzzles, zooming & cozying & is so smart catching on to all her training. evie is the perfect little partner & i'm so excited to watch her grow through our adventures together. thank you for helping us find each other!! i already can't imagine life without her."







polar bear "polar bear has become my second son and a sibling to my two year old son. he came home with us and immediately felt at home. he loves to sleep at the foot end of my bed at night. and in the daytime he loves to push my son’s race cars across the living room floor. getting him was the best decision i made for my small family."







katherine, formerly nova day since adopting katherine a month ago, she’s transformed from being extremely nervous and anti-social to a hilarious, fun loving, loyal, and super cuddly companion. the first 2 nights home, she slept under my bed. however, after many walks, lots of play, and even more couch cuddles, we developed trust and a bond that gets stronger every day. she is everything i wanted in a furry companion and so so much more."







latto, formerly jelly bean "jelly bean is bffs with our toddler! thank you for her!"







trout "trout has settled into his forever home well. he has two big brothers, benson and bj. trout enjoys running around the property, checking in on neighbors (even across the neighborhood), playing and cuddling with his brothers, and rolling in the grass. he’s learned to come when called, sit, and other commands like “leave it”. when he’s excited he gives us a cute toothy grin! his nicknames are wild man and trouble! he also has a cat-brother, tuna, who tolerates him; trout loves to play with him, especially when tuna gets spunky. he is such a sweet, fun little guy and we look forward to more fun memories with trout."
