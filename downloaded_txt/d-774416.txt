kanye west runaway movie video | hip-hop star’s full-length music video / short film






this is the full-length runaway movie / short film / music video from kanye west. it’s alright, but nothing special.

i like kanye west, i really do. and i like his music too. but i’m not buying into all the crap that’s being written about runaway, his new short film which some commentators are describing as “genius” and “a work of art.”

you’d think kanye was the new martin scorsese or quentin tarantino the way people are going on. he’s not even the new michael jackson, so let’s not kid ourselves or make his ego grow any larger.

runaway is ok, but most of it is pretentious crap that could only have come from the mind of someone who keeps getting told how brilliant he is, even if the people doing the brown-nosing are lackeys paid for doing just that.

watch runaway by all means. some of you will like it, others will not. but let none of us go over the top about how it makes kanye some sort of second coming. because he’s not. he’s a rapper, and a singer, and a celebrity. and that is all.

funny rollercoaster vomit video | you’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll likely vomit yourself






while this video is sfw, it isn’t suitable for anyone who is eating or who has just eaten, has a bad reaction to seeing other people vomit, or who doesn’t like rollercoasters and theme park rides.

still, it is amusing in a sick way.

there’s no mystery here, and nothing really to explain.

this lady is on a theme park ride and really doesn’t feel well. you can see it etched all over her face. and before long you get to see the lunch she just ate all over her face and the bodies of the poor people sitting alongside her.

the worst thing for us watching is the waiting. you know full well she’s going to puke, but you don’t quite know when. what’s amazing is how happy she looks afterwards; she actually enjoys the rest of the ride post-vomit. but i think the kids preferred it pre-vomit.

watch awesome veteran poetry slammer katie makkai perform ‘pretty’ video | message for all women






katie makkai sends a message to the world and to her future daughter about the ugly reality of ‘pretty’ in today’s world.

and here, this video, is a prime example of why slam poetry is the most appropriate, amazing way to express something.

makkai does an amazing job of expressing one girl’s life trying to be ‘pretty’ while also applying it to every girl’s experience.

and now men are starting to experience it, too, sadly enough. and most of us aren’t doing a damn thing to stop it.

this video deserves to be spread, if for nothing else, in the name of self-love.

fisherman catches 1,000 amazing species of fish.













47 -year-old steve wozniak, a lure fisherman from california, has traveled the world over, in his quest to catch as many different species of fish as possible. so far he managed to catch 1,000 species, from a colorful threadfin butterflyfish to a 410 kilogram shark.
believe it or not, steve wozniak has spent the last 10 years, and $75,000 traveling to 63 different countries in the search for new species of fish to put on his list. he flew over 1 million air miles, and spent over 20,000 hours holding his trusty rod and hoping for a bite. but all his efforts paid out when he finally caught his 1,000th fish species, a norwegian coalfish, and set a new world record.

watch jessica seinfeld’s deceptively delicious cooking on oprah video






jessica seinfeld, the wife of jerry seinfeld, has become famous in her own right with deceptively delicious cooking – featured here on oprah.

it has never been so easy to get your children to eat vegetables than with jessica seinfeld’s deceptively delicious cooking.

many parents are often frustrated to no end by how picky their children are when it comes to eating vegetables. heck, they might not eat certain things just because they’re a different color.

bring in vegetable purees.

while i would never change my brownie recipe, these purees could be a great way to help myself eat more vegetables… hmm…

amazing mimic octopus video | sea creature impersonates at least 15 other animals!






is it a fish? is it a snake? is it a furry running turkey? no, it’s the amazing mimic octopus!

we’ve seen cephalopods like the cuttlefish blend into their surroundings before, but this octopus takes the art of mimicry to a whole new level. rather than simply disappearing into his environment, he pretends to be other animals.

after all, if you’re a poisonous sea snake or lion fish, chances are the other sea creatures are going to steer clear. i’m not quite sure what that running turkey get-up is in aid of, but it’s also pretty impressive!

perhaps he’s just getting ready for thanksgiving?
