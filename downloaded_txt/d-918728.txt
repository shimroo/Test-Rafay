junkers 87 stuka
was conceived as a dive bomber. first flight took place during 1935, and full
scale production begun during 1936. stukas were involved in the spanish civil
war in order to test its efectiveness in combat. during 1939 and early 1940
stukas enjoyed the reputation of the terror of the skies due to its performance
in combat during the poland, norway and france campaigns. but in all this
campaigns it had no real opposition. when the battle of britain took place, late
1940, stukas took so many casualties that it was soon withdrawn from battle. but
in the next campaigns like greece and russia, where the axis forces enjoyed air
superiority the stukas returned to its excellent performance as a bomber. in
1942-1945 its main role was close support on the eastern front attacking armour.
termination of production took place in 1944.
