april 2019 - deal of the month - hyundai oem wiper blades









how often should i change my wipers?

it is recommended that wiper blades be changed every six months to maintain maximum driving safety. as an easy reminder, you should change your wipers when you change your clock at daylight savings time.


what indicates that my wipers need replacing?

deteriorated wipers produce an uneven wipe, which prevents proper contact with the windshield surface. this will create streaky or unwiped areas, severely impairing your driving vision. and remember - what you can't see, can harm you!


why do i need to install new wipers when i live in an area where it hardly ever rains?

a wiper blade that hasn't been used for an extended period of time can dry out or develop permanent set, as described in the question above under the "streaking" and "chattering" section. even if you don't use your blades often, they still need to be inspected for damage every six months.

hyundai walking car concept is the future of the first responder industry







debuting at ces 2019, “elevate”, the ultimate mobility vehicle (umv), prepares communities in the event of a natural disaster

wheels with robotic legs allow users to drive, walk or even climb over the most treacherous terrain
las vegas, jan. 7, 2019 – any first responder will tell you that the first 72 hours following a natural disaster are the most crucial to saving lives. however, often times due to the nature of the disaster (forest fire, earthquake, hurricane, or flood), it can be difficult for search-and-rescue and humanitarian aid missions to reach and get immediate help to those in need.  

the need for efficient, rapid, resilient transportation for disaster assistance is what led hyundai to develop the first-ever vehicle with moveable legs. elevate is the first ultimate mobility vehicle (umv), blending technology found in electric cars and robots, which allows it to traverse terrain beyond the limitations of even the most capable off-road vehicle.

the hyundai elevate concept in action after an earthquake.

watch the hyundai elevate concept video here. 

https://newspress-hyundai.s3.amazonaws.com/videos%2foriginal%2f35027-elevatefulllengthfinal.mp4

“when a tsunami or earthquake hits, current rescue vehicles can only deliver first responders to the edge of the debris field. they have to go the rest of the way by foot. elevate can drive to the scene and climb right over flood debris or crumbled concrete,” said john suh, hyundai vice president and head of hyundai cradle. “this technology goes well beyond emergency situations - people living with disabilities worldwide that don’t have access to an ada ramp could hail an autonomous hyundai elevate that could walk up to their front door, level itself, and allow their wheelchair to roll right in – the possibilities are limitless.”

the hyundai elevate concept helps a person get to a doctor appointment in a city.

the elevate concept is based on a modular ev platform with the capability to switch out different bodies for specific situations. the robotic leg architecture has five degrees of freedom plus wheel hub propulsion motors and is enabled by the latest in electric actuator technology. this design is uniquely capable of both mammalian and reptilian walking gaits, allowing it to move in any direction. the legs also fold up into a stowed drive-mode, where power to the joints is cut, and the use of an integrated passive suspension system maximizes battery efficiency. this allows elevate to drive at highway speeds just like any other vehicle. but no other can climb a five foot wall, step over a five foot gap, walk over diverse terrain, and achieve a 15 foot wide track width, all while keeping its body and passengers completely level. further, the combination of wheeled motion with articulating legs provides a new paradigm of mobility by enabling faster walking speeds, unique dynamic driving postures and torsional control at the end of each leg.

the hyundai elevate demonstrates its mammalian walking gaits.

“by combining the power of robotics with hyundai’s latest ev technology, elevate has the ability to take people where no car has been before, and redefine our perception of vehicular freedom,” said david byron, design manager, sundberg-ferar. “imagine a car stranded in a snow ditch just 10 feet off the highway being able to walk or climb over the treacherous terrain, back to the road potentially saving its injured passengers – this is the future of vehicular mobility.”

a hyundai elevate climbs itself out of a snow covered ditch.

the hyundai elevate in drive mode.

inside the elevate, passengers would experience a vehicle fully engineered to tackle the roughest terrain comfortably. engineering enhancements include:

robotic legs with five degrees of freedom plus in-wheel propulsion
ability to walk in mammalian and reptilian style gaits for omnidirectional motion
capable of climbing a five foot vertical wall
step over a five foot gap
non-back drivable motors enable the legs to lock in any position
modular electric vehicle platform


“we have been working with sundberg-ferar on the elevate concept for almost three years now,” added suh. “elevate is part of our various ‘last-mile’ technologies and solutions and it also has ‘last-100 yards’ capability too.”
