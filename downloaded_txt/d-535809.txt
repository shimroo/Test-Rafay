   16th annual kern county999 foundation officer down ride
on october 1st, 2022 in bakersfield, california, original roadhouse had the great pleasure of feeding over 500 bikers at the 16th 
annual kern county 999 foundation officer down ride in support of the families of kern county peace officers who have died in the line of duty. when hosting this event, we donate 100% of the bbq and ticket sale proceeds directly to the kern county 999 foundation. 
with over 300 motorcycles riding for this great cause every year, it’s definitely an event you don’t want to miss!

  everything was great. the atmosphere was relaxed, the waitress was fun, the food was good, and prices - including alcohol wasn't bad at all. we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner!

  absolutely delicious and the service was excellent. i got the 1/4 chicken and 1/2 rack combo with a loaded baked potato and dinner salad. it was all perfectly cooked. will definitely be back.

  steak was so tender easy to cut the loaded baked potato was perfect but those yeast rolls little pillowy bites of heaven with the honey butter melts in your mouth. been a few years since i've been in still one of my top steak houses!

  tonight i tried the ribeye with garlic butter and to say it was phenomenal would be an insult to the chef who cooked it. this ribeye was incredible, i am constantly impressed with how good the food is at this location. i also want to take a minute to say that the waitress we got gave us really great service. highly recommend
