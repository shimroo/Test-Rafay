welcome to the official penny jo pullus web site!


copper-coiffed chanteuse penny jo pullus has been living in austin, tx for the past four years.  during that time, she has been honing her pop country stylings all the while putting together a biting and twangy band.  "linda ronstadt, gram parsons and the rolling stones all wrapped up in one lanky body " she grins.  whatever it is, penny jo can sing it all!  her music is kind of like a crazy quilt...different patterns and different textures. some old, some new. when sewn together they make a wonderfully cozy and beautiful piece of art. with her proven vocal abilities, penny jo is an up and comer that needs to be watched closely.  her voice can morph from a sultry country croon, to a rockabilly hiccup, into the rasp and belt of a bluesy rocker with effortless ease.  hailing from the great white north with her band of "southern canadians," as she is apt to call them, penny jo's sound harkens back to a time of donning cowboy hats, vintage suede wallabies and denim jackets.  she has proven that she can ably make this genre her own.

     playing original material smattered with some choice vintage classics, you can catch this act in two forms: the acoustic combo or the full band at any one of your favorite local digs. lovely harmonies, great energy, and great songs... austin americana at its best.
