when the sun sets over the everglades, surfs up in greater fort lauderdale, coming alive with outdoor cafes, jazz clubs, comedy spots, casino glitter, and multifaceted entertainment venues for everything from broadway style productions to jai-alai and horse-racing. in fort lauderdale, the gallery at beach place draws crowds at places like lulu's bait shack, sloppy joes, and howl at the moon, the galleria's blue martini has dining and dancing, and las olas boulevard brings it on with o'hara's pub and mango's. but for true late night party-hopping way into the night, the place to be is across the tracks within the historic himmarshee village, where hotspots range from tarpon bend to the long-popular voo-doo lounge. downtown, laffing matterz provides dinner and musical satire in the old mccrory building across from the fort lauderdale museum of art. in hollywood, harrison street's late night action unfolds at places like o'hara's hollywood and sushi blues cafe, and further west on u.s. 441, seminole paradise glitters with 17 restaurants, 10 nightclubs, and casino gaming at the seminole hard rock hotel & casino. for more betting on fun, there's dania jai alai, mardi gras racetrack & gaming center for greyhound action, gulfstream park for horse-racing, and pompano park racing at florida's only harness race track. broadway shows, top headliners, and other theatrical thrills light up the broward center for the performing arts, parker playhouse, and sinatra theater at the bankatlantic center. and to feed energy levels for late-night revelry, greater fort lauderdale has more than 4,000 restaurants, many open late, and some  like the floridian on las olas -- open all night long.
