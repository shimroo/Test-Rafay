i believe in the power of parody to weaken negative emotions. my father used parody to show acceptance and forgiveness. "dad, i forgot to buy you a newspaper." "i have no son." then i would laugh, feel better, and remember to buy a paper next time. or maybe two copies of the same edition, as atonement.if you get that my dad's response was a joke, consider yourself lucky. i've met people who don't recognize when someone's ridiculously imitating a negative emotion, and they seem sad and unfulfilling. fortunately, they also avoid me, because i constantly falsely display negative emotions ridiculously. i prescribe lots of episodes of mama's family. if i identify that someone's afraid of me or someone else in the room displaying a negative emotion   deliberately doing a bad job at pretending to believe that i have superior social value and quality makes me laugh, and self-selects the people who don't get the joke to avoid me. also i believe that many people who can't spot the difference between a pompous ass and a parody of a pompous ass are themselves pompous asses, and so some of them self-select to avoid me. win-win.link leave a comment | 2 commentsfri, may. 11th, 2012, 03:15 pm i've never been good at identifying lyrics in songs, but now that i sing in public, i construct an e

i've never been good at identifying lyrics in songs, but now that i sing in public, i construct an emotional story to remember and deliver the lyrics. now i can't help but find the emotional stories in songs, and i can't listen to i've got to use my imagination by gladys knight & the pips without crying like i've broken my leg. and it used to just be a fun song. http://youtu.be/33-pb1wppgglink leave a commentwed, may. 9th, 2012, 12:13 pm 20120509boeing787dreamlineratdca.jpg
