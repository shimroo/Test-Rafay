dualis is a plugin-based ds emulator for x86/win32 computers. it is written	in x86 assembly and c++.

important information:

dualis is not able to run dumps of nds cartridges. do not ask me if/when it will be able to run said dumps. also, do not ask me how/where to get non-public material concerning the ds.
if you didn't understand the last three sentences then get the f*** out. thanks.

cpu: fixed a bug in the division swi
cpu: improved irq handling a bit
cpu: added emulation of getcrc16, getsinetable, getpitchtable and getvolumetable
gpu: fixed a bug in the backdrop color selection that would sometimes occur
gpu: fixed a bug in the rendering of 256-color r/s bgs (mode 4)
gpu: modfied palette offset calculation for 256-color textures
gui: fixed a bug where the emulator would occationally freeze for a couple of seconds
gui: fixed a bug where cflash initialization would sometimes fail when loading a rom through the file menu
gui: cflash emulation is now automatically disabled when a compressed rom is loaded (.zip/.7z)
gui: added a dummy sound emulation mode that works on computers with no directsound (emulatesound=2 in dualis.ini)
gui: fixed a bug related to loading a rom by double-clicking it in explorer
gui: added a "recent" menu
gui: fixed some bugs in the map viewer
mmu: fixed an lz77 decompression bug


the full source of emulator is available (i use vs2005, but vs6 might also work), so if you're unhappy about some feature that is missing/broken, feel free to fix it yourself.






2006-05-03



cpu: fixed a bug in the division swi
gpu: fixed some tile flipping bugs
gpu: optimized rendering of extended palette bgs a bit
gpu: disabled rendering of obj windows
mmu: the fat is now writeable
inp: the keyboard layout can now be configured in dualis.ini
gui: improved the texture viewer


fat write operations are fairly restricted at this point, see the readme section on gbamp emulation for more details.






2006-04-30



cpu: fixed updates of some function pointers after changing the itcm size
mmu: added support for send fifo flushing
mmu: added support for send fifo empty irqs
mmu: added support for ipcsync irqs
mmu: fixed a bug in the handling of fat long filename entries
mmu: fixed some bugs in the fat emulation that would occur if a directory contained more than 256 directory entries
gui: modified cpu synchronization





2006-04-21



gpu: fixed some texture transparency problems
gpu: fixed some bugs when rendering 16-color rotoscale objs
gpu: fixed some bugs when rendering extended palette rotoscale bgs
mmu: added experimental spi touchscreen handling
mmu: fixed some bugs in the handling of long filenames in the fat
gui: improved timer event handling a bit
gui: fixed .zip loading
gui: added support for .7z loading


the spi touchscreen handling is not perfect yet and only works somewhat, so the old faked method is still used as a fallback for homebrew roms using libnds.






2006-04-13



cpu: fixed some problems with mode changes after subs
cpu: fixed some problems with swi 6
cpu: fixed some problems with address writeback for ldm instructions
cpu: modified interrupt return address handling a bit
cpu: added a few missing ldm/stm instructions
cpu: added the thumb blx instructions
gpu: fixed alpha blending for extended palette bgs
gpu: added the possibility to turn off 3d emulation
apu: added support for adpcm audio
mmu: fixed some destination address control bugs in dma transfers
mmu: fixed some problems with the ipc fifo
mmu: added support for ipc fifo interrupts
mmu: added support for virtual itcm resizing (up to 32 mb)
mmu: added support for 64bit/64bit->64bit operations to the hardware divider
gui: fixed some problems with the keyboard shortcuts when using the debugging windows


when running the demos from e3 2005 you should generally use the gdi renderer and disable 3d emulation in the video settings. it should also be noted that touchscreen input does not work in those demos at this point.






2006-03-28



gpu: added support for the a3i5 and a5i3 texture formats
gpu: fixed some errors in color selection for paletted textures
mmu: upped the fat limits to max 32768 files/directories with a total size of 256 mb
mmu: added support for long filenames in the fat
gui: gbamp emulation can be turned off (on memory tab, or in dualis.ini)
gui: switched from wm_timer to a multimedia timer callback


note that the max number of directory entries at the root level still is 512, and that the max total number of files/directories will be lower than 32768 if there are files that uses long filenames.






2006-03-24

*update: the original version of dualis 19 would freeze if you loaded a rom by double-clicking it in explorer. this should now be fixed.

cpu: added the lz77uncompvram swi (callbacks are ignored)
apu: added support for psg noise
mmu: fixed a problem with the irq flags sometimes being set when they shouldn't be
mmu: added some support for atapi and fat16 (gbamp)
gui: screenshots are saved in the same directory as the rom file
gui: various small changes to allow the fat emulation to work


some current limitations of the fat emulation: only read operations are supported, max number of files/directories: 256, max combined file size: 32 mb, only 8.3 format filenames.






2006-03-20



cpu: added the lz77uncompwram swi
cpu: fixed a typo in the swi 3 emulation that caused single cycle waits
gpu: added the option to display only one of the ds' screens (useful in fullscreen mode if only one of the screens are used)
gpu: added support for texture alpha bits (for 16-bit textures)
apu: optimized the resampling filter a bit, and applied filter to pcm16 samples as well
apu: added psg emulation (rectangle waves only)
gui: added fullscreen support (toggle with alt+return)
gui: added a couple more registers to the i/o register viewers


the preferred fullscreen resolution can be specified in dualis.ini.
some new keyboards shortcuts have been added: ctrl+shift+1..ctrl+shift+3 to select which of the screens are displayed, and ctrl+shift+f to toggle on-screen fps display while in fullscreen mode.
i've also written a little psg demo that plays 3-channel rectangle wave music - you can find it here.






2006-03-17



cpu: modified the code for swi 3-6 a bit
apu: reduced sound latency. if this causes problems on slower computers you can enable a larger buffer in dualis.ini
apu: corrected sound looping in most cases
apu: improved resampling quality a bit (pcm8 only)
apu: added a sampling rate option in the .ini file
mmu: added support for the timer registers on the arm7 side
mmu: corrected mirroring at 0x3800000-0x3ffffff on the arm9 when wram is split
gui: added a viewer for the arm7 i/o registers
gui: added support for .ds.gba files (the 512-byte loader is skipped so they are effectively treated as .nds files)
gui: fixed problems with reading from the upper 32kb of arm7 ram in the disassembler







2006-03-15

*bleep bleep blop*

apu: added rudimentary sound emulation
mmu: added handling of sound registers
gui: added a sound master enable option on the audio tab
gui: fixed a bug where multiple instances of the same dialog window could be opened at once


only the pcm8 and pcm16 audio formats are handled right now. sound mixing is currently fixed at 32khz mono, so panning doesn't work. if it becomes too painful to listen to you can disable sound altogether through the gui or in the .ini file ;)






2006-03-14



cpu: added a few missing ldm/stm instructions
cpu: added mrs/msr spsr
cpu: swi 3 emulation is more accurate
mmu: fixed some timer bugs

the cpu plugins is this release are not compatible with earlier versions of the mmu and gui.






2006-03-11

mmu: changed initial value of wramcnt to 3
mmu: fixed a typo that lead to bad 16/32-bit wram writes from the arm7
gui: added a few more thumb opcodes to the disassembler
gui: added a "turbo swi" option on the cpu tab for arm7 binaries that mainly sit and wait for vblanks







2006-03-01

two are better than one.
this release features the addition of the second cpu (arm7tdmi). touchscreen access is still faked in the same manner as in earlier versions, and not all parts of arm7 memory are handled correctly yet.
note that earlier versions of the plugins are more or less incompatible with this version.

cpu: added emulation of the arm7tdmi
gpu: modified the hblank/vblank code to handle both processors
mmu: added the arm7tdmi memory space (incomplete)
mmu: added some support for the wram control register
gui: the disassembler can now be used for both processors
