kevin setnes
(december 2019) 
 



kevin setnesâ running career began at bloom township
high school in illinois, where he ran cross-country
      and track, distinguishing himself with a best of 9:40 for the 2-mile run.
      the then entered the u.s. navy and spent the next 6 years serving in the
      u.k. and italy, where he took advantage of the opportunity to compete in
      european track, cross-country, and road races in the 1970âs. he
      gravitated to the longer distances and became a 3-time winner of the
      annual usafe (u.s. armed forces in europe)
      marathon, with a best time of 2:23:43. 
his competitive ultra career began with a bang in 1990 at
      the age of 36, as he won the minnesota voyageur trail 50 mile, and then
      returned to win again the following year. next up was the 1991 usa 100km
      national championship in duluth, mn, where he gave notice that he would
      be a force to be reckoned with on the national stage by taking the silver
      medal in brutally cold and windy conditions in 7:00:59. 
two years later he attempted his first 24-hour race at
      the usa national championship at olander
park in toledo, where he and tom possert waged a
      neck-and-neck dogfight at national record pace over the final 15 hours.
      setnes prevailed for the national title, setting a new american record of
      160.426 miles in the process. 
over the next decade he distinguished himself with
      consistently top placings in some of the most competitive ultras in the
      country, garnering victories in the gnc 50 miler and 100km, the vermont
      100 mile trail race, and another win at the olander park 24 hour. he
      achieved best times of 3:12 for 50km, 5:30 for 50 miles, and 6:58 for
      100km. during this decade he won the 100km usa national championship
      three times and the usa national 24-hour title twice. in 1998 he became
      (and still remains) the only american man to win both the national 100km
      and 24 hour titles in the same year. for 8 consecutive years he was a
      member of the u.s. national team to the world 100km championship. in two
      of those years he was a scoring member of the world championship
      silver-medal winning american team. three times he was chosen to receive
      usa track & fieldâs ted corbitt award as the outstanding american
      menâs ultrarunner, and twice he was selected as #1 american menâs
      ultrarunner by ultrarunning magazine. he continued to compete in
      ultramarathons through 2007. 
in 1995, setnes began a coaching program for aspiring
      ultrarunners. eventually his tutelage would produce 18 usa national
      champions. also in 1995 he created and served as race director of the
      kettle moraine 100 mile trail race. he would later serve as race director
      of the 2002 usa national 100km championship. 
in 2000, during a turbulent time in the relationship
      between the national federation (usa track & field) and its
      ultrarunning constituency, setnes served as co-chair of the
      mountain/ultra/trail (mut) council of usatf, taking the primary leadership
      role in advocacy for the athletes. during the next half decade he served
      as coordinator of the national 100km team, and then as president of the
      american ultrarunning association (aua). his leadership on behalf of the
      athletes resulted in aua being named âcontributor of the yearâ by the mut
      council of usatf in 2003. 
athlete, coach, event producer, race director,
      administrator, leader. no one else from the u.s. ultra community has ever
      blended quality of athletic performance and effective administrative/political
      leadership at a national and international level on behalf of the sport
      as well as kevin setnes. we welcome him into the american ultra hall of
      fame. 
(note: in order to become eligible for induction into
      the american ultrarunning hall of fame, an athlete must have been retired
      from ultramarathon competition for 10 years or have reached the age of
      60)
