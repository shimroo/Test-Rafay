notes from john.... this is the main interface page for slot racers who are looking for online answers for themselves, or their business. also, for anyone who might be needing dial up internet service, or might be wanting to change from another high priced dial up service like aol. our system is faster than the others because it is smaller and your request for a web page is not lost in a sea of millions of other subscribers. our sevice is cost effective at $9.95 for standard or $14.95 for the go fast system. we would appreciate your support and your money will in part go to make our entire company stronger which makes our publishing company stronger, which helps support scale auto racing news. we have 24 hour tech support and are great at what we do. we have been an internet provider since 1997. to sign up, call 1-817-292-3103 or, if you wish, click on my email address to send me email...
