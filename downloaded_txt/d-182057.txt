timeless worship, modern faith
sunday worship is at 10:00am with gathering music at 9:45 am – we do a fully hybrid service – being on zoom is like being here!








worship is a mixture of contemporary and traditional experiences in which our theology is clearly progressive. many sundays you will hear as many as six different instruments in our music ensemble playing for gathering and throughout the service in styles from contemporary to celtic and traditional.

we always strive for songs and prayers that reflect the god who calls us to live fully, love wastefully, and lead courageously.


we have a fully hybrid worship service with in person and streamed services.  although masks are not required, if you think you need a mask please wear one. if you are for any reason unable to join us in person you are encouraged to view from home at this time.
