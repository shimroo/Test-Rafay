glad tidings!





the christmas tree is up and glowing.  it smells wonderful, but i have yet to just sit on the couch in a darkened room and just look at it. i will put it on my list of things to be done. i actually have a few gifts already that i'm pleased with and a few more to get, but it seems like i'm doing better in that area this year.  i have ideas.i am running the secret santa program at work, and it seems to be increasing the holiday spirit in the place.  that is pleasant.i have just enough time logged that i can take a full week off at christmas and i need it so.  i'm so happy about it.  i need time to sit and think and do a few things around the house.christmas-time is here!  it makes me happy.

yay for december





i'm thankful that november is over. it seemed like a really long month and i am happy that december is here.  we have birthdays, and an anniversary and christmas, of course! i have decided that my greeting of choice for this year will be... "glad tidings"!!doesn't that have a nice ring to it?   last year it was happy christmas, like in harry potter.today i am enjoying:i little sneaky fifteen minute date with my husband, who came back to work to run me to another building and gave me some hugs and kisses in between.heavy whipping cream in my coffee. a 100% thrifted outfit.  i think i am successful in goodwill shopping without looking like a total over-aged hipster.  i am mixing stripes and plaids, though, so maybe i'm not as successful as i think i am.gel eyeliner.  who knew!  i love it.  and i love to apply it with the little tiny brush.a clear conscience.  another perk of the 15 minute sneaky date.  confession is good for the soul, eh?new material for a new show.  i get to wear a waitress get-up!being the administer of our secret santa program at work. foundation underwear - not thrifted!and... that's about it.  you?

dear alma l. tompsett





dear alma,may i call you alma?  i feel as if i can, now that we have shared clothing.you see, at my local goodwill i found a beautifully hand knit sweater.  very intricate and in good condition.  and perfectly sized just for me.on the inside tag is says, hand knit by alma l. tompsett.i googled you.  you made a charitable contribution in 2009 the university of nebraska school of nursing.  it looks like you graduated there in 1944. i fear you may have died since then, dear alma.  normally when i find labeled clothing in the goodwill it usually means that the nursing home where you lived just donated all your clothing since you won't be needing them anymore.i hope that's not the case, and that somehow you find this note of thanks for your hand made goodness and know that someone out here appreciates your skill and is wearing your lovely work of art.god bless you, almalove,amy

i'm on a roll





look!  i've typed something here three days in a row. i might just become a blogger, yet!i have tomorrow off!  i'm going to a conference and i get to stay in a very  nice hotel.  i may even take my swim suit. :)  well, i take that back.  i just had my hair colored.  don't want to wreck that!i have a new eating philosophy.  i will eat it or not, but i'm not going to anguish over every food choice and feel guilty about the not so great choices.  i've decided to be healthy and exercise and choose well and just live... without weird food thoughts.  if i stay 20 pounds over weight, then so be it.  but i have a feeling this just might the cure i've been waiting for.i'm going to attempt nanowrimo.  we'll see how that goes.i've just looked down to see that i am wearing 100% thrifted, garage saled or hand-me-down clothing.  except for my tights and undies, which probably cost three times as much as my actual outfit. here's the run down...crocheted cardigan - $1.00skirt - $1.29 - it's a long skirt from the 80's that i chopped off and hemmed.black gap long sleeve t - free from a friendcute, sort of man shoes with a heel - (for lack of a better description) $3.99target tights $7.99is it weird that my leg wear costs more than my whole outfit?  maybe i should start one of those what i'm wearing blogs.  i'm totally addicted to those!   if you go here, here, here and here   (and this one is just fabulous!) you will see what i look at almost everyday!   i have more, but this is just a little taste.tonight, i have a date with hubby which will include yet another trip to the goodwill (i need jeans), dinner out - i'm thinking it's a clam chowder type of day, and we will conclude with seeing a free show.  dress rehearsals are always free and i totally invite myself to everyone i can get to.  nothing like making the  actors feel nervous when another actor crashes their final dress rehearsal!  but i am so encouraging and grateful for the free show that i think it evens it all out!boy, i am chatty today!
