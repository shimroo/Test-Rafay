update
for the first thirteen years this website was constructed using the excellent microsoft 'front page' software. server support was suddenly withdrawn in spring 2015 so the whole site has been rebuilt using adobe 'dreamweaver' software. this should enable it to be viewed with the variety of screen sizes now available despite the large amount of information on each page. an emphasis has also been given to ease of navigation.
the 'php' framework for the pages was expertly set up by anthony rome of silvermarbles, ltd. telford. many thanks for the help.
background.
 after a lifetime of working with industrial copper and copper alloys, vin callcut now working on  domestic copper and brass.  he is covering items made mostly during the period 1851-1951.  
 this follows the period covered by most of the books on antiques that range up to about 1850.   after this date there was an increasing emphasis on quantity production of good designs.
 this website shows some of the work done over 375 pages and asks for helpful comments from those with useful knowledge.
