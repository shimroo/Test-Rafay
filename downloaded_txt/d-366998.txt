read morewhere have all the honey bees gone? to california almond orchardsfebruary 17, 2025the large-scale migration of honey bee colonies is essential for meeting agricultural pollination demands, particularly in california’s almond industry. usda reports from 2020 to 2024 highlight seasonal fluctuations in colony numbers, with bees relocating for pollination in winter and early spring, then dispersing throughout the u.s. by summer. as the u.s. demand for honey bee colonies continues to rise, pollination fees may need to increase to support beekeepers and maintain colony numbers.
read moreimpact of drought in the states in the colorado river basin on us planted acresfebruary 13, 2025in this article, we examine if the ongoing drought in the states that are in the colorado river basin (crb) can help explain the changes in us crop acres. taking the drought into account by removing acres in the states in the crb from us acres improves explanatory power of private market return, but only to 50%. the implication is that factors other than private market return and drought in the states in the crb are needed to explain changes in us acres.
