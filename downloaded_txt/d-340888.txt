inspiring young women since 1906

we celebrate each girl for the unique gifts she brings to our school, fostering a culture where she is known, she is heard, and she is empowered to use her voice.

at girls preparatory school, our mission and values provide an integral framework that supports every interaction with our students. we believe that in addition to providing students robust and engaging academics and girl-centered social-emotional support, we should also provide an environment that encourages girls to live out the values that will help them meaningfully contribute to the betterment of their families and communities. each girl learns to focus on who she will become as much as what she will accomplish.

whole girl education

we believe that education is a journey of self-discovery and growth.



at gps, our holistic approach ensures that each girl not only excels academically but also emerges as a well-rounded, confident, and compassionate individual ready to contribute meaningfully to society.





learn how we support each girl





















learner-centered academics

		at gps, we empower our girls to use their voices, collaborate with one another, and make choices about how they engage with their studies.
	


this active involvement in our liberal arts curriculum fosters a deeper connection to the material and helps students develop a sense of ownership over their learning journey.





learn more about our academics







student life

while academics are an integral part of the educational process, a girl becomes her best self when she steps outside of the classroom—and her comfort zone.



gps girls are encouraged to explore new interests and activities—to spark passions that speak to who they are and who they wish to become. from leadership and service opportunities to clubs, community engagement, and coed life, the breadth of programming at gps allows students to face their fears, fuel their confidence, and find their voices.

sisterhood

the sisterhood at gps cultivates a sense of belonging and acceptance, ensuring that each girl feels valued and understood.



special traditions, unique opportunities, and authentic interactions nurture the development of compassionate, confident, and capable individuals who are prepared to lead and make a positive impact in the world.





learn more about our traditions





























designed for girls

during the middle and high school years—the developmental stage of adolescence—a girl benefits most from attending a school specifically designed for her. 



in an environment where teachers, coaches, and peers accept, support, and encourage her, a girl is free to be herself and try new things. she more easily rejects the limitations both she and society may place on her and can forge her own path to reach her full potential.
