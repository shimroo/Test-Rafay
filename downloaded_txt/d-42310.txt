random links


ridiculously cool/random story of how o.j. mayo decided to go to uscwhen floyd answered the phone, he heard a teenager’s voice on the other end: “coach, this is o. j. mayo. i’d like to come to your school.”mayo had not been on an official campus visit. he had not seen the new arena, the galen center. he did not know anything about the current roster. floyd did not believe it was possible to get a verbal commitment from a player he had recruited for less than one day, especially when that player was a 6-foot-5 sharpshooter with blue-chip strength, quickness and passing ability.-----------from gizmodo:aromahand"i love my hand"--------some dude's top 10 list of shoe commercials, which really i only post because i love #1(#7 is awesome too, but blogged earlier)

zero hero


is zero the new twenty three?sacramento, calif.–aaron brooks averaged more than 17 points a game for the oregon ducks this season, led the pacific-10 conference in scoring and helped his team capture a no. 3 seed in the ncaa tournament.but deep down, he is still a zero."i'm proud of that," brooks said. "i look around college basketball this year, and i see zeroes all over the place."he was referring not to the players themselves, but to the number on their jerseys. no. 0, which used to be assigned mainly to mascots, now has become standard issue for college stars.
