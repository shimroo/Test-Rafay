 challenges  overcoming common obstacles in building effective teams
     01

  chaos
 nothing seems to work right. no one is on the same page. everything takes longer and is harder to do than it should.
  02

  frustration
 when people feel like they can't win, tensions rise, fuses get short. its a relief to go home.


    03

  changing priorities
 everything is a crisis, the urgent trumps the important everyday. you are running on adrenalin all day long.
  04

  no time for people
 you are governed completely by your watch, not relationships. when you do talk with people they know you are in a hurry.





   benefits  addressing the barriers to stronger employee relationships
     01

  care strategies that fit your purpose
 clarify your purpose and then choose proven strategies for whole-person care that fit that purpose.
  02

  clear expectations & ownership
 the leader's relationship, plans, meetings, measures and training clarify not only what an employees is responsible for but the way they interact with people as they deliver it.Â ï»¿


    03

  info organized the way you work
 leaders are overwhelmed with information. to ease the load leadfirst organizes information around the people and teams they interact with. our meeting management and individual snapshot streamline info access.
  04

  change is orderly & communicated
 change is relentless, so clear processes for quickly identifying issues, making decisions and communicating decisions is critical to santity and performance.


    05

  built-in learning
 organization performance depends on individual and collective growth. a learning library is built in. learning tracks are integrated into individual plans and micro learnings into meetings to support continuous learning.
  06

  measured progress
 pressure from the urgent is relentless, which makes organization development benchmarking critical. benchmarks assure that leaders are held accountable for developing their teams and for identifying best practices.


    07

  people smiling at day's end
 recently when i asked tyler, a supervisor of 40 people, what success meant to him. he said, "i want to hit my numbers and i want my people smiling at the end of the day." that sums it up.
