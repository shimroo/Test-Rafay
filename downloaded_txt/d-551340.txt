the blue ridge region mirrors the rest of the
                    nation in hosting an energetic mix of musical 
                    styles. pop, classical, jazz, blues, rock, gospel, 
                    country—these are all here. in addition the blue 
                    ridge has an unmatched legacy of traditional 
                    music and dance. these are the songs, tunes, 
                    and dances carried on largely outside of 
                    formal music instruction or the commercial drive 
                    of popular culture. 
                    
                    the virginia blue ridge music trails guides
                    travelers to the many public settings in which 
                    blue ridge folk music and dance thrive today.
