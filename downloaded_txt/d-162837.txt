govqa public records solutions
simplify public records request management with govqa, the highly configurable compliance software relied on by more state/local governments, public safety organizations, schools, and special districts than any other solution.




 



overview
govqa offers a finely tuned public records request management system that works across all departments and request types while putting time back in staff work day and money back in organizational budgets.

supported by the largest team of specialists in the industry, providing guided change management for ongoing satisfaction
secured with best-in-class data protections for confidence in confidentiality
scalable to keep up with evolving regulations and expanding responsibilities
simplified with automation tools to conquer escalating public records complexity



“we have seen significant time saved by using govqa. we receive over 16,000 records requests per year, so this system has had a tremendous impact in our ability to manage such a heavy workload without having to hire additional staff.”  
gretchen dolan
public records officer, washington state patrol


outcomes
improve the day-to-day with govqa. gain time and resources for other critical missions while reducing friction and risk with govqa public records request software. enhance experiences, outcomes, and civic engagement with modern tools to match requester expectations.












reduce workload and costs
the easiest request to fulfill is the one that’s self-served. automatically deflect or merge redundant requests and reduce volume by 20-60%, ensuring consistent responses. cut down on chaos around high-impact events with easy “+follow” button for trending topics.
















automate repetitive tasks
with govqa, access the best features for automation — custom-configured templates and workflows based on individual triggers for notifications, escalations, tracking, and oversight reporting — plus govqa exclusive time-savers not available anywhere else.
















increase cybersecurity
not all data in staff care is suitable for release to the public. govqa is fully cjis, hipaa, nist, and fisma compliant, offering the highest level of protection for exempt and confidential data. build public trust and mitigate risk with redaction “oops!” protection, fully defensible audit trails, and timely exchange of sensitive documents within a secure environment.












smart workflows
automate manual processes for effortless compliance

functionality
from smart intake and vetting to records gathering, review, and redaction, to release and reporting, govqa simplifies all aspects of request management. replace manual processes, point solutions, and “first” solutions, with the powerful solution that gives time back to staff.








customer-centric public portals 


patented predictive intake deflection automatically matches requester searches with “release-to-all” responses and faqs for faster responses without any manual keyword prep work. frictionless, dynamic intake forms collect all needed details (even with anonymous requests) and route seamlessly to the correct department for processing.




estimates, invoicing, and payments 


clear fee communication builds trust and helps recover costs. automatic estimate conversion creates fully itemized, accounting-aligned invoices and payments with an existing online fee processor or granicus preferred vendor.




secure release with limitable links


deliver responses the way customers prefer while tracking and counting views and downloads with security features that prevent unauthorized, unknown, and expired link-sharing. releasing records via the public portal can drastically reduce paper and other materials costs.




“similar request” alert and link 


duplicate requests are automatically identified so staff can work on them together for efficiency and response consistency. cc responses deliver request communications and responsive packets to multiple requesters at the same time.




pinpointed workflows


streamline collaboration and prevent staff notification fatigue with precise assignment and escalation parameters. request nesting allows unlimited layers of delegation, collaboration, subrequests, or installments grouped under the original request.




email and video record processing


automatically extract, de-dupe, and search email records to simplify those “any-and-all” records requests. securely stream, store, redact, transfer, and track video/audio records from inside govqa with no limits in file size or type.
