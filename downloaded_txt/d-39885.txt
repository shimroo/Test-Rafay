auto repair & service
it’s one of the big reasons for the “plus” in our name. we offer a wide variety of auto repair services for your car, truck, or suv, all done quickly and affordably. whether you need a new battery, new brake pads, an engine repair, flat tire repair, or regular wheel alignment, our auto repair specialists will fix your car right the first time. life never stops, and neither should your car!

























car maintenance
when you take care of your vehicle, you also end up saving money. preventative maintenance like regular oil changes, safety inspections, battery tests, tune-ups, and important fluid flushes can all help your vehicle stay in tip-top shape. whatever the driving conditions, make sure you can beat them. view your vehicle’s recommended maintenance schedule to get started!













at tires plus, we know tires. but we understand that you may not. and that’s perfectly okay. because it’s our job to work with you to figure out what tire options may work best for your vehicle, driving style, and budget. we do this by offering a range of suggestions from good to better to best. then give you the room to choose. we also make tire-buying easy with the ability to shop, get a quote, and schedule installation online. and we’re here for the duration with rotations and repairs.

when it comes to service, we’ve got you covered from simple oil changes to brakes and alignments – including your adas (advanced driver assistance systems) sensors. we don’t believe in performing unnecessary repairs. we’ll tell you what is best to be taken care of now, and what can wait. because at the end of the day, it’s your car. and always your call.
