wildwood summer theatre






















































the dc area's oldest youth-run theatre company

wildwood summer theatre was founded in 1965 by a group of students from walter johnson high school in bethesda, maryland. these theatrically minded students wanted to extend their high school musical experience into the summer. however, they were unable to find an adult sponsor, so they decided to strike out on their own. that summer, on a shoestring budget, and with little in the way of material supplies or support, they put on a production of bye, bye birdie. the show was a rousing success, and wst was born. for the last 51 years, wst has presented at least one, and occasionally two musical productions, with the entire company aged 14 to 25.
