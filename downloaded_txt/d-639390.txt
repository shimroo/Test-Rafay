welcome to bottomless closet!
for 25 years, we have helped empower new york city women in need to enter the workforce and achieve success. through our one-on-one attention, we provide them with the tools and resources they need to get back on their feet. two decades on from when we were founded, our services are needed today more than ever.












































 



how we work












































why our services
are needed
in new york city, 1 in 4 women is living in poverty. working women can expect to earn only 80 cents on the dollar compared to men. for the 85% of our clients who are african american or hispanic, this figure drops to 63 or 54 cents respectively.
we provide each woman who comes through our doors with professional attire, resume help, interview prep and more, but it’s the intangibles we give them – confidence, self-esteem, and hope – that can make all the difference.
we use a truly holistic approach to make sure our clients are seen not just as job applicants, but as empowered job candidates.
