wuzzle & wizard










 there are people who would say we live an unconventional lifestyle - but i would disagree. it is not a "lifestyle", it is a life.
we work hard, and come home to the same household chores that most people have (bills, laundry, cleaning the house, etc). the fact that as partners we both happen to be male does not change that. twenty-nine years now. i guess we are doing something right.
navigation at the top takes you to sections for each of us, one on our take on relationships, and some information about our house projects.
we are now living in the palm springs area and love the desert, the weather, and most especially the community of friends we have discovered.

this bud's for you....
