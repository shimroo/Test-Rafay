more about green currents









								soy ink printing
							
janutol printing uses soy oil printing inks.

								soy inks are one of the solutions to the environmental health and safety concerns of the printing industry. they are low in voc's compared to petroleum based inks, there by reducing emissions that cause air pollution. the ink's resins, reducers, drying oils are refined from renewable resources and eliminate the need for petroleum based products in the printing inks.
							














additive plate making

                              the platewriterâ¢ eliminates all chemicals and processing by harnessing the latest high definition inkjet technology to âaddâ the image onto a blank plate. this is in contrast to traditional laser-based ctp systems which expose an image onto pre-sensitized plates and use processors and chemistry to remove the unwanted non-imaged areas. the additive approach of platewriterâ¢, with no processing chemistry and no waste, enables janutol   printing to create the "greenest" plates on the market
