     hosted an event here for about 22 people that all stayed overnight. daniel and susan are wonderful to work with. they made sure all of our needs were met and were easy to get in touch with if we needed anything during our stay. the price is a bargain in my opinion and everyone kept commenting on how beautiful and homey the inn was. will be returning for future events, thank you!

  our family (and there were 18 of us) had a fantastic time at the canna country inn. the "barn" is beautifully restored, well furnished and comfortable. each family was able to have their own bedroom and private bathroom. the game room in the loft was super fun - pool table, foosball, air hockey, and pinball. there are 2 kitchens that had absolutely everything you would ever need. we'd also like to recognize linda, the property manager. she gave us a tour of the "barn" at check-in and explained everything, and she was there to assist us at any time if we needed anything.

  our family of 15 had a wonderful week at canna inn. the house has such character yet so much comfort. it's a great setting for family time coupled with plenty of room. the location was around 45 minutes or less from many activities. we enjoyed a different experience daily including gettysburg, hershey park, chocolate world, amish tour, and a show at the dutch apple theater (including a delicious buffet). at the end of our trip, my family kept talking about the special time we all had at the canna inn.ronald s.
