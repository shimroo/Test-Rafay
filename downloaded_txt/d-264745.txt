“the cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. our feeblest contemplations of the cosmos stir us—there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, or falling from a height. we know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.”

— carl sagan
