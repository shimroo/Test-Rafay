    welcome to the portable antiquities scheme website
the portable antiquities scheme is run by the british museum and amgueddfa cymru - museum wales to encourage the recording of archaeological objects found by members of the public in england and wales.

every year many thousands of archaeological objects are discovered, many of these by metal detector users, but also by people whilst out walking, gardening or going about their daily work. finds recorded with the scheme help advance knowledge of the history and archaeology of england and wales.







amazing discoveries.
new finds are uncovered and reported daily. it is easy to get involved with the
                        scheme and report your discoveries.
