this finds me, literally, as i type, waiting on the phone with the dumbest ups employee in the history of the world.   i sit on the phone.   i sit on the phone.   some dumbass finally comes back and starts talking.   some dumbass: ...yeah...billed to account...you still there? me: yes.   very long pause.  i hear strange noises in the background like a paper shredder, or large industrial equipment that's slightly further away.   very long pause.  i type angrily.   sd: let me see...i'm...kansas...let me look up...your package is in kansas.   i laugh.  it's five thirty -- i'm already running late listening to this moron wade through what seems to be, at least for him, a terribly complicated process.   sd: ...didn't have anything yesterday-- me: i sent it last week, you should've picked up the package last week.  yesterday is when it should've arrived to me, in texas -- kansas has nothing to do with anything. sd: but i'm showing that the shipper of your package is in kansas... me: why didn't it leave arkansas?!?!? sd: all i see is kansas, he didn't do any pick-ups today.   this goes on for some time.  i'd write more, but i'm desperate to get out of this fucking cube.   i am overwhelmed with how assanine my existence is from 8 to 5.   the end, for now.

	 changing my tune
	 
    


this edition finds me in and around my car.  we start with a flashback.it's five months ago.  my totally awesome girlfriend, lady-a, and i are walking back to my car through downtown austin.we turn up that little chunk of 4th street west of the warehouse district where there's nothing but the entrance to some posh "converted-loft" condos (but we all know they weren't "converted" from anything).  something's wrong. me: (to lady-a) hey -- shit -- did i leave my lights on?even as the little knub of concern swells in my stomach, my brain tells me that this can't be so.  two drinks and my thoughts are coming so slow i can transpose them months later.  what the f--?the lights are flashing.  why would...?that doesn't happen on accident...did i hit the emergency...?although my brain is wading through molases, we're still walking toward the car.  as we approach i realize that the missing window/thousands of small pieces of glass was not an accident/some weird, highly localized natural disaster. lady-a: what do we -- i mean -- we should, we call the police? i can't believe -- this is horrible!  who the fuck would --?me: do we really have to call the police?i am remarkably calm.  i calmly discover that the $70 cd player is missing, but the $170 carseat for my daughter is still sitting, untouched in the back seat.  as i calmly recite this to the helpful austin police department employee over the phone, i calmly realize that my favorite cd is now gone, also.me: (into the phone)  yes...there was a cd inside.  it was my favorite -- sorry -- i know that isn't important really. the next day i calmly hand over $700 to the morally questionable employee at an austin-area mazda dealership.  before writing the check i make a quick call to my insurance company.  of course, some dickhead picks up.some dickhead: blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah coverage due to ipso facto ignotico blah blah blah blah.  i'm sorry, but, therefore, your policy doesn't cover break-ins.  have a nice day.i calmly hang up.  i calmly hand over the check.  the morally questionable employee grins at me with a number of gold teeth. three days later, the window is replaced and my car's ac unit is no longer a huge mess of wires and sheared plastic vomiting out of the center consol, i drive the 40 minutes to work in silence.we hear the sound of road noise. i stare straight ahead.  silence.the next day.  more road noise, more silence.  pause.  me: (out of nowhere) what the fuck?!?!?  god!  what is it to you -- you little bastard!  you little, fucking prick!  (i kick some of the remaining, un-vacuumed pieces of beaded glass from under my feet )  ripped the shit outta my car!  like, what?  you didn't see the fucking childseat in the back?  like i'm fucking loaded?  like i've got the seven-fucking-hundred dollars to spend so you could pawn that piece of shit stereo for fifteen bucks?  you fucking, fucking fuck!i smack the steering wheel.i take a deep breathe.i drive in silence.lights up on the next day.  i am driving.  we hear an npr news report, but don't know where it's coming from.npr: i'm steve inski for npr news.  seventeen people died today in another insurgent attack...(the voice fades into fuzz)annoyed, i lift the handheld sports radio that's sitting in my lap, and point the antenna in a different direction out the window.npr: (fading back in) ...and other related casualties.i breathe a small sigh of relief/accomplishment.  i give a fatigued, weak little smile.  lights fade.end of the flashback.it's now the present.  lights up on me and lady-a in our apartment.  i am opening a gift.  it is a car cd/stereo.  lights down.lights up on me in my car.  silence, road noise.triumphant/defiantly, i take a postal service cd out from it's case, and put it into the cd player.  i turn up the volume.as i fly down the highway, i begin to dance.  i sing along to the tune, completely unaware of the wild eyes and patronizing grins of fellow drivers.my dance gets bigger. i sing louder.  i smile.the end, for now.

	 magic
	 
    


this edition finds me once again hanging out with my toddling super-daughter, little-e.magicme and little-e are at our local playground, dodging careening children and avoiding conversation with their much older, judgmental-looking parents. what they’re judging, we’re not sure.little-e: slide, daddy, slide!and she’s off. little-e can kind of run, but it’s precarious.little-e: (as she runs) go go go! go go go!she falls.me: are you ok?little-e: (picking herself up) yeah! (she’s off again) go go go! go go go!little-e reaches what, to her, must seem like an enormous castle of colored plastic and twisting metal – the jungle gym. a big kid swings past on the monkey bars.big kid: (to me) i got a bike for my birthday!me: (looking around for big kid’s parents) that’s…awesome…(to little-e) do you want to say “hi” to the big kid? e?but she’s not there. little-e is meandering up a cement ramp, thus allowing her to circumvent the pesky tower of metal bars she isn’t coordinated enough to climb. some other munchkin rushes past, almost taking me down by the knees. little-e reaches the platform at the top of the ramp, and wanders toward the edge with no wall.me: (moving quickly towards her) careful!little-e stops. she turns to me and giggles.little-e: slide, daddy, slide!another child stumbles and falls at the other end of the playground. he cries. little-e takes the three steps up from the platform to the top of the slide.me: ok, e, let’s do the slide. (moving to the bottom of the slide) i’ll be here to catch you.little-e: no!me: you don’t want me to catch you?little-e: no daddy myupum. (i’ve learned that this means “back off, dude, i’ll do it by myself”)me: (nervous) are you sure?little-e: yeah, myupum!me: (taking a step back) …ok.little-e prepares herself. she giggles. she zooms down the slide. i suddenly regret my decision. her independence isn’t worth— little-e has reached the bottom. she doesn’t get her feet down in time and falls forward – flat on her face. smack. little-e cries!me: (picking her up) little-e! are you ok?little-e: owie! (snotty tears)me: i know, i know – i’m sorry!little-e: owie, daddy, owie! (she points to her face) owieeee!what do i do? i can’t make it stop. i’m trying to look calm.me: it’s ok, it’s ok, i’m sorry you have an owie.inside i am freaking out. this has never happened before. the judgmental parents seem to be gathering on the outskirts of the jungle gym – their older, more-wrinkled eyes scream at me “bad parent! bad parent! we told you so!”little-e: owwwwieeeee!the light bulb goes off!me: do you want me to kiss it better?little-e: yeah.i give little-e a kiss on the forehead.me: (hopeful, trying to sound like my parents did when i was little) there! all better!little-e: (suddenly stops crying) down, daddy, down! (she struggles to be put down) play slide! play slide!pause.little-e: down daddy!i set her down. she’s off. and just like that, i have magic powers.the end, for now.

	 snot faced boy
	 
    


in this edition, i am miserable – under sudden attack from winter’s allergy reaper, mountain cedar.snot face boy lights up on me, alone, surrounded by piles of discarded tissues. i sit, slouched in my chair, head hanging, with a considerable frown on my face.i sniffle.me: (to no one) i feel like butt.i wince, as if jabbed by an unseen attacker. my left hand shoots up toward my red, puffy eyes. it is desperate attempt to purge the undefeatable itch in my retina, but my right hand is lightning-fast as it moves in to defend said eye.back and forth, brother against brother they struggle – to scratch, or not to scratch?me: (to left hand) stop! enough! don’t you understand? you’re on a mission of doom!my left hand struggles on.me: (to left hand) please – think about the future!it is in vain, as my left hand pushes through, sinking into my eye cavity with the sweet squish of victory.me: (overwhelmed) oh, jesus that’s good.i rub my eyes like an addict smokes crack.as i take my hands away and open my eyes, i am dominated by pain. my world is a fuzzy mess.me: (reacting to the pain) arararhahghhghg!i sneeze. i sneeze again. i sneeze again. i sneeze. i sneeze. i sneeze again. i sneeze again. i sneeze again. i sneeze again. i sneeze. i sneeze again. i sneeze. i sneeze. i sneeze.i stumble out of my chair, blindly flailing my arms in search of a tissue.i sneeze again.me: (calling to no one) help! help me!i sneeze again, tumbling to the ground and into a pile of half-used tissues. i open a tissue, desperately sniffing snot back into my sinuses as water flows from my burning eyes like a river of torment.i blow my nose.a heartbeat of relief.me: holy shit that sucked.then a fire in my nose. i sneeze. i sneeze again.me: noooooooo!!!i flail around for more tissues, mumbling like a mad man as the lights fade to black.the end, for now.

	 bad reception
	 
    


in this edition, i confront the all-too-weird central figure in any office setting: the receptionist!note to reader: the normal receptionist at my dayjob is friendly and professional. however, this is the week she decided to take a vacation.bad receptionmondaylights up on shaggy college student (scs). scs has long greasy hair, is unshaven, wears a considerable frown, and stares intently off stage – presumably at nothing.i enter, groggy and non-verbal.i cross to the coffee pot.scs: (answering phone) generic psychiatric co. what? yeah. (with annoyance) yeah. (hangs up)silence.i press on the lid of the coffee pot, desperate trying to extract something caffeinated from within. instead of dispensing coffee, it makes a wretching sound and spits all over the place.silence.me: (to scs) um—scs: (still annoyed) what?short pause.me: i think we’re outta coffee.scs: (jumping up from his chair) damnit. (hurries past me to the coffee maker) why doesn’t anyone tell me when these are empty? (under his breath) damnit, damnit, god, god, damnit. (to me) come back later. there’ll be more then.short pause. then i exit.tuesdaylights up on wild-eyed woman (wew). she has assumed the receptionist’s position. scs is nowhere to be seen. wew has shaved her eyebrows and drawn in new ones so high that she looks permanently surprised.i enter, groggy and non-verbal.wew: good morning! jonathon, right?i look around, assuming she must be talking to someone else.wew: (sing-song) good mor-ning. are you jonathon?me: um…yes.wew: great! how was your holiday?me: (confused) my christmas holiday?wew: yeah. i really enjoyed mine. how was your weekend?me: it was fine.wew: gettin’ some coffee?me: why yes.wew: little jolt to the system, huh?me: uh…(starts to exit)wew: i just could not get my energy up this morning. i was so gosh-darn tired when i walked in here a little earlier that i just didn’t know what to do with myself, but you know what—?i exit. i assume she continued talking.wednesdaylights up on wew. she stares out into space.i enter, and start to walk towards the coffee maker. i see wew and stop, debating whether i should proceed to coffee, or escape before she sees me.i proceed to coffee.silence. it’s eerie. i pour some coffee into my little travel mug. she’s obviously seen me but says nothing.uncomfortable pause.me: hello.wew: (confused) hello.short pause.me: how are you?wew: fine. (suspicious) why are you asking?me: well, i just—wew: i’m fine, that’s all there is to it.me: but…yesterday you…wew: (seemingly quite annoyed) what?wew stares at me blankly.i exit.thursdaylights up on an empty receptionist desk.i enter, thanking whatever higher power i can think of that there’s no one there as i quietly pour my morning dosage of coffee.the phone begins to ring.i pour, not really paying attention.the phone keeps ringing. i feel like it’s getting louder. it rings some more. i turn, staring at the desk – feeling like somehow because i work here i’m partially responsible for answering it and it rings again, it’s getting louder, i set down my coffee and walk towards the desk when—shaggy college student comes bursting into in the room with a half-light, still-smoking cigarette hanging out of his mouth.scs: damnit, god, damnit, every time – why can’t you people just let me smoke in peace for once? jesus! (picks up the phone) hello.i exit.friday i’m posting this on thursday evening. who knows what horror friday will bring.the end, for now.

	 feline fissure
	 
    


 this edition finds me just a little annoyed with all of all those damn semi-stray cats roaming the streets of my austin neighborhood. i am, today, imagining a moment in the life of my wonderful girlfriend, lady-a, as i listen to her tell me the story of how the cat next door peed on our towels.feline fissureact i. the cat learns to hate (backstory)scene 1me and lady-a are sitting on our back patio, chillin’ like villains. our patio door is a pain in the ass to open and close, so we leave it slightly ajar, allowing for easy access to the goodies in the kitchen.enter pete, the neighbor’s cat.lady-a: (to me) don’t pet him – you’ll break in hives if you touch your face afterwards.me: thanks honey.i can’t resist, and pet the cat anyway. calm returns. i don’t touch my face.but then— pete makes a bolt for the open door! i dive after him!me: (to pete) hey! stay outta my house you little pussy! why i outta—pete retreats. calm returns. scene 2me and lady-a sit on our patio. i hold a broom. pete enters.i shake the broom menacingly and pound it on the ground.pete gives me a nasty look, hisses, then retreats.scene 3i open the patio door with an armful of laundry. i exit out onto the patio, as our machine is in a little cupboard outside. i put some clothes in the machine, blah blah blah.as i turn to go back inside, i notice the open door – like a flash, enter pete – straight into the house! i dash!me: you little fucker! come ‘ere you little bastard – think you can just sneak into my house like it’s yours?!?! i’ll show you a thing or two! no cats in my house!!!we chase around the apartment. through the living room. i cut him off at the stairs. he disappears for a moment, only to be rediscovered in the kitchen.me: aha! want me to get the broom, bitch?stand off. tumbleweed.pete retreats – scurrying out patio door from whence he sprung!end of act iact ii. the cat’s revengescene 1lady-a has hung a load of laundry on a drying rack, and left said drying rack on our patio for drying purposes.enter lady-a.enter pete.lady-a looks out the patio window/door, pete is staring at her. she swears he is grinning. he lifts up his ass to point those hind-quarters directly at some towels hanging on the drying rack.he pees. the towels are soiled.in shock, lady-a is motionless in the living room.scene 2a phone call takes place between me and lady-a. we have come to an agreement about her involvement as a character in this on-going depiction of my life. as such, i am restricted to informing you of only the following:we spoke. i was informed of pete’s pissing.scene 3lady-a marches over to the next door neighbor’s house. she does not take the towels.she knocks on the door. neighbor’s boyfriend (nb) answers.lady-a: i don’t want to be rude, but your cat peed on some stuff i had drying on my patio – on purpose.nb: wow. that’s weird. he’s usually really good.lady-a: yeah. well. i don’t know if you need to start keeping him inside, or what, but the peeing thing gross.nb: yeah. i’ll see what we can do. maybe he’ll stop. he’s usually really good.annoyed, and with nothing accomplished, lady-a returns home.the end, for now.

	 little e's life with baby
	 
    


this edition finds me hanging out with my 19-month-old daughter. she has two baby dolls that she’s really, really into. at first i wasn’t a big fan of this fascination – you know, re-enforcing gender stereotypes and all that – but recently i’ve been thinking that it’s her way of understanding herself, or maybe even the first steps towards creating an idea of “self”. let’s hope so, or at least, let me keep pretending. she already wears a lot of pink, and i’ll have to stop calling myself progressive if this goes much further. ha.little e’s life with babylights up on me and little e, riding in the car. i’m driving in the front, and little e is riding in her car seat. little e is holding onto baby, her favorite doll and constant companion.me: what do you want to do today?little e: oh.me: do you wanna go to the park?little e: yeah.me: do you wanna chase some kitty-cats?little e: kitty….cat?me: do you wanna go for a walk?little e: yeah.me: cool.little e: cool, daddy, cool! (no kidding, she really says that)short pause.lttle e: (confused) baby?me: (turning around to look at back seat) i think she’s in your lap.little e: oh! (laughs, as if baby had been hiding or playing a trick)little e picks up baby.little e makes a very, very intense grunting noise, as if moving a large object. she doesn’t make this noise normally, nor does she move large objects – she’s a baby.me: e?little e: daddy.me: e?little e: daddy.me: e?little e: daddy.me: are you all right?little e makes another very intense grunting noise.me: e, are you making a poo?little e: poo!me: are you making a poo right now?little e: no.me: (slowly, with emphasis) is little e making a poo?little e: no poo!more grunting.me: e—i turn around to see little e holding baby up in front of her face, just like i do when pretending to make her stuffed animals “talk”.the proverbial lightbulb shines above my head.me: (with disbelief) is baby making a poo?little: yeah, baby poo!more grunting.little e, in a moment of excitement, drops baby.little e: uh-oh.the end, for now.
