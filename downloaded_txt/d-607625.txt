history

tempo's foam molded technology began in 1960 with cup production and has evolved to custom thin wall molding today.

tempo developed a thin wall molding technique known as “dry molding” beginning in august, 1960 with its first product, foam cups.  patents for this technique were granted in 1965. tempo adapted dry molding to numerous other products where good material fusion is achieved to accomplish a “no-leak” quality standard.  tempo is one of the few remaining cup molders in the world to adapt cup molding techniques to serve modern high technology engineered applications.
