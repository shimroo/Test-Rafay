you may hear from representatives of certain anti-union groups who will try to trick you into giving up your rights and  hurting your pay and benefits by dropping your union membership. it is important to be aware of this threat to organized labor and collective bargaining in the public sector, as this has direct implications for the wellbeing of our union, and its capacity to represent all of our members with the strength we would like to possess. for the story behind the agendas of these groups, go to this link.
