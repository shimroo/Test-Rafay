stand-up paddle boarding (sup)

graveyard of the atlantic museum


more than 2,000 shipwrecks sunk off the coast of north carolina in what’s called the graveyard of the atlantic. with all that history floating around, it was only natural to build a museum to honor and preserve the maritime culture of the outer banks. a state-of-the-art structure, the year round museum houses and displays artifacts, and presents a variety of exhibits and interprets the rich maritime culture that includes war, piracy, ghost ships and more. artifacts include thoseex from the uss monitor, which sank 16 miles off the hatteras coast. the lobby features the stunning and original, 1854, first order lens from the cape hatteras lighthouse. current hibits include those on piracy and the civil war on hatteras island.

buxton woods


perhaps the reason that this area of maritime forest goes unnoticed, (an area which in fact comprises the majority of frisco village), is simply because the oceanfront beaches just yards away are too alluring to ignore, and garner the lion's share of vacationers' interest. this is understandable, as when most folks think of an outer banks vacation, they envision miles of unspoiled beaches, refreshing ocean waves, and plenty of room to spread out a beach blanket, and frisco's beaches have all of these attributes in spades.
