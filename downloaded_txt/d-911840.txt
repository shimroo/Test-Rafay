welcome and thank you for visiting my custom knives web site. i began making knives early in 2003. actually, i began assembling knife kits back in 2003. knife kits were a good choice for me at that time as the tools available to me were minimal. the kits were a lot of fun and afforded me the luxury of learning how folding knives work. as i made them, i began honing my skills and adding more and more embellishments. i was having fun.  i began selling these knives to friends and acquaintances which helped me fund my shop as it is today. 
today, i make custom folding knives of my own design using the best materials available. i meticulously handcraft each knife using using natural handle materials such as bone, ivory and pearls and occasionally i will use different types of burls. the blade steels i use include ats-34, 440c, d2, s30v, 154cm, and damascus made by various artisans. the majority of my folding knives are made with titanium liners but will also use stainless steel or in the case of some slipjoint folders, i will use brass.
take your time and have a look around……………….
