many law firms work the problem.
we solve them. 
attorney reuben j. donig is a former law school instructor with a reputation for working hard, being creative and investigating all aspects of the claim. here are a few examples of how this approach pays off for clients:

problem: toddler suffers brain injury after falling through open window
a toddler suffered a severe brain injury when he fell through an open window on the third floor of an apartment building. even though there were no window guards, everything was built to code. another problem was that the owner had only a $1 million insurance policy.
solution
even though there was no code violation, we were able to establish that the windows constituted a dangerous condition, and that the child’s injuries were foreseeable. we were able to collect policy limits not only from the owner, but also from the company that installed the window and from three other entities, for a total settlement of $5 million.

problem: pedestrian hit by underinsured motorist
a 70-year-old woman was hit by a pickup truck while she was crossing the street at the intersection. although she suffered numerous serious injuries, the driver who caused the accident had a liability policy limit of only $15,000.
solution
our client’s husband had purchased a $500,000 uninsured motorist policy. by carefully working up the case, we were able to establish that our client’s injuries warranted payment of $500,000. by navigating the maze of rules and regulations that govern uninsured and underinsured motorist claims, we were able to receive the full $500,000 ($15,000 from the driver’s insurance policy, and $485,000 from our client’s uim policy.) further, we were able to settle the matter amicably and without needing to resort to litigation.

problem: california driver injured by falling tree branch
a california driver was injured when the branch of a eucalyptus tree inexplicably fell through her windshield and seriously injured her knee. no one knew which tree or property it fell from or who was responsible.
solution
we brought a claim against the county and several nearby private property owners who had eucalyptus trees on their properties, and we obtained more than $1.5 million for our client.many law firms work the problem.
