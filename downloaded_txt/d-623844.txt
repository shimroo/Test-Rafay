art and learning are connected when
			established stories, ways of knowing and living, are destroyed by
			new creative endeavours.
are
			you sure this is a web page?
why
			are literature and the written page a metaphor for what is on
			screen here? could other metaphors be equally informing? 
			screenwords.
the
			historical projects to be linked here in the coming days, weeks,
			months, will hopefully show how questions are raised about art and
			learning in the act of breaking with convention, established
			culture, received propaganda and attempts at control and
			influence.
