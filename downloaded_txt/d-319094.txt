“i would not stay anywhere else! great walking distance to the town square. gorgeously appointed and well-maintained. so many great little touches like fresh pastries delivered to your door every morning. the patios (private and shared) are gorgeous.”

— adelina cooke




“i did not stay at the inn, but had an appointment at the spa a few weeks ago, and it was amazing. the staff was super helpful and my massage therapist was very kind, professional, and knowledgeable. this was my third professional massage and i felt like it was much more functional than the previous massages i’ve had, and i left with a better understanding of the origins of my back pain.the room itself was very cute and calming, opening onto a beautiful patio. overall great experience and i would return next time i’m in sonoma.”

“nice, clean, quiet, relaxing inn just a few minutes walk from downtown sonoma. my husband and i stayed 3 nights and it was very enjoyable, we loved the room and location. staff was friendly and breakfast pastries were delicious! would definitely return.”

— monika mckell




“my husband surprised me with a birthday massage today! we arrived a little early and were greeted with warm smiles and cold bottled waters. terry showed us to the beautiful courtyard where we waited in patio chairs, next to a water fountain and lots of shade (thank goodness because our 5-month old was heating up in the stroller).i got the 90-minute wellness massage with stephanie. we chatted briefly about the areas that i wanted to focus on, as a new mom. she was very courteous and checked in on me throughout the massage. the pressure was perfect and the lavender lemon scent was soothing and calming. i was so very relaxed that i dozed off and on! this was a perfect way to celebrate my birthday! thanks stephanie!will definitely come back again to treat my wonderful husband for a couples’ massage!”

“surprisingly unique and quaint little hotel. we loved it. we stayed in the arroyo suite and the room is spacious and well designed. it was nice having the little kitchenette and they bring you pastries from the local coffee shop each morning. our room had a cute little private patio that we enjoyed relaxing on while having our morning coffee and pastries. it’s well located a block from sonoma square so we could easily walk to restaurants and tasting rooms. we would definitely stay again and hope to try out the spa in the future, as we heard good things from a few different people during our stay.”
