mini multiple manifesto!
let's bypass making the situation worse before it gets better, skip twiddling our thumbs for years based on therapies that are inhumane and when you think about it make absolutely no sense. we can leave our past in the past, cut years off our recovery, live our collective life, trust in ourselves, love ourselves, and make the absolute best of our situation.  we must refuse to hold out on having sanity until the good doctor can see us again!

come get a taste of the manifesto!
