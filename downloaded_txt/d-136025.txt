the working river
 
miamiâs historic âworking riverâ originsâ include generations of trade, transportationâ and commerce. â today,â cargo shipping, boat repair,marine related services and supportingâ businesses help continue this legacy.
miami river marinas, restaurants, inns, as well as, historic shipyards that provideâ heavy lift capability where yachts, commercial and government vessels from around the world schedule regular inspections, repairs, paint, repowering and remodeling, all serve residents and visitors from around the globe.
the miami river is a key transit pointâ for goods destined for the islands of the caribbean and the atlantic ports of south and centralâ america.â â at its busiest, miami river shallow draft cargo ships make as many as 2000 movements in and out of the river annually, an average of 5 entries or exits a day.â  miami river cargo ships call on more than 100 ports throughout the caribbean basin, central and south america.
the miami river marine industriesâ generated a $2.9 billion dollar output, $1.5 billion in income, 24,000 related jobs and $136 million in tax revenues to the state of florida.
