systems engineering

              at consystec, nearly everything we do involves the use of the
              systems engineering process.
            

              the systems engineering process provides a structured
              methodology for managing complex systems used in the its field
              and our staff is highly qualified in the practice of systems
              engineering. all projects involve risk. however, consystec helps
              our clients navigate the systems engineering process, reducing
              the risk involved in the project while adhering to fhwa and fta policies.

transit data

              its standards are not restricted to highways. consystec
              encourages transit (bus and rail) operators to conform to data
              standards to achieve institutional and technical integration.
              for example, transit schedule data takes many forms: service
              schedules, planning data, real time information, fare data, and
              more.
            

              our transit practice is built around sharing transit related
              data and information among transit agencies, and between transit
              agencies and consumers.
