   your gateway to sedona's enchantment
 welcome to cozy cactus

the cozy cactus blends the personal touches of a b&b with the modern amenities of a resort while featuring the luxury of an all-in-one wedding and event destination. our unique offering is located in sedona amongst arizona's desert oasis. guests love that they can hike or bike right from the patio (slim shady trail, bell rock, templeton to cathedral rock), or relax with a tasty beverage by one of our firepits.  most guests do both….a perfect cozy cactus day!come see what all the buzz is about!

 i am hesitant to explore all the superlatives i could use to describe this place.friends introduced us to it, and they go every year, and we will be back as well, i just don't want to get too popular that i can never get in again.great views, great accommodations, great host, great, hiking right outside the back doorwithout the tourist of sedona

 this is my 12th time at the cozy cactus and it never disappoints. 
this time i was so excited to stay in the new court house room (house). it was absolutely perfect. it has lots of natural dreamy light and the most epic view. every room has bell rock in the mix. i did my usual hike 2x day literally steps away from my room. this place truly has it all.this is my home away from home. thank you for always making me feel so warm and cozy in your perfect retreat.

 perfect in every way!the hosts terry and carrie have thought of everything. our room, the vortex vista, was comfortable and clean. it had an amazing view from our private balcony. being able to walk out the door, past the spacious patio with lots of seating, firepits and umbrellas to the excellent hiking trails was so convenient. the neighborhood in oak creek was quiet and less hurried than downtown sedona. parking is convenient. highly recommend this special spot.
