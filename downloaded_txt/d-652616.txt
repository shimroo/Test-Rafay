the brain, memory loss and the causes of dementia
 by conrad lebeau
 read the 8 page report and learn about the multiple causes of dementia and how to prevent, slow down and possibly reverse its development. also includes a case report of an elderly lady who was helped to stop and even partially reverse her alzheimers state of mind. 
systemic infection with fungus and mold is also caused by comsumption of too much plastic in the diet. toxic mold grows on plastic. plastic consimption comes from food cooked in plastic trays heated in microwave ovens, and from soda and beverages and food items stored in plastic bottles. one report on tv recently said the average american consumes every week the amout of plastic used to make one credit card. 
there is no simple one pill cure for this condition. be informed and pray to god for guidance in all your health care decision. may divine providence bless each of you in 2024. a printable pdf version of this report is here. 

a petition to congress to enact .....

the federal reserve overdraft protection act and
  to issue united states notes and gold or silver coins
 whereas the growth of the national and private debts of farmers, small businesses and all americans grows exponentially with the interest charged for the use of credit; and the governments national debt now exceeds $35 trillion, with mortgages and credit card debt that has now reached astronomical levels, and....
 whereas the constitutional authority to coin money are powers granted to the us government; congress can and must offer leadership by considering for enactment the proposed reforms contained herein; and 
         
		   
		   whereas the banking system uses its own records as de-facto digital dollars that are stored in their computers to make loans and for the payment of debts; and....
whereas the u.s. government budget requires substantial amounts of money (cash) or credit to deliver public services and security, we propose the following:
 the federal reserve overdraft protection act (part one - sub a and b) 
 a. overdraft protection as credits. this is a petition to congress to amend the federal reserve act and pass a law requiring the federal reserve bank(s) to enter digital bookkeeping dollars* as credits to the u.s. treasury checking account at the federal reserve bank(s) at a minimum sum of $100 billion to prevent default on the u.s budget or bonds; to maintain normal working capital for all budgeted needs; and to deposit in the u.s. treasury's checking account on a recurring basis additional sums or $100 billion on any day the account balance drops below $100 billion. all credits advanced to the us treasury account(s) shall be backed by currency or coins. 
b. overdraft protection backed by cash. the credits advanced to the us treasury's bank account at the federal reserve bank (frb) shall be legal tender "money" backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government. this backing shall include the delivery, at no cost to the federal reserve banks, of coins and currency (lawful money) minted at the bureau of mint and engraving, in an amount and in denominations as requested by the federal reserve board up to the total monetary value of the credits that the federal reserve banks have credited to the u.s treasury's bank account.
member banks, non-member banks, credit unions, and the public shall be able to purchase any newly designed coins or currency at their face value from the federal reserve banks, member banks, and credit unions with cash, check or debit card.(part two - sub c, d, e and f) 
c. united states notes. the printing of united states notes was upheld by the u.s. supreme court. therefore, under the authority granted by our forbearers in the u.s. constitution,we seek a legislative directive from congress to the u.s. treasury to print $200 billion dollars worth at face value in the following dominations: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1000. the sec. of the treasury shall choose the images to be placed on each denomination except that one billion of these notes shall be printed with a value of $100 each and have on each note the image of former president john f kennedy.
d. gold and silver coins: the u.s. treasury shall use bullion stored at fort knox and mint $100 billion dollars worth of gold and silver coins in denominations chosen by the secretary of the treasury. the face (legal tender) value of each coin shall be a minimum of 150% above the cost of production but not exceed 200% of the cost of production. designs shall be approved by the secretary of the treasury or as directed by congress.
e. low interest credit cards:congress should also make available to the public loans and credit cards at an interest rate of 3% per year and backed by currency in quantities that support public demands for cash. the availability of low interest loans will provide immediate financial relief for small businesses, farmers, homebuyers, students, car buyers, and consumers.
f. repeal the borrowing authority: subject to approval by the states, congress should amend the us constitution and repeal sec 8, (2) that gives congress the power "to borrow money on the credit of the united states." this is to permanently end the creation of burdensome government debt. once all these reforms are enacted, they will provide the necessary funds to support free enterprise and prosperity for all the people. for all the foregoing reasons, we urgently seek public hearings on these proposals.

pfizer's paxlovid for covid is safe - pfizer's covid vaccine is not

conrad lebeau 
        â â â â  why paxlovid? the newly fda approved treatment for covid- 19 contains the hiv drug ritonavir (norvir) and is highly effective against the covid virus and has my qualified support. there are no case reports or research that paxlovid causes vascular inflammation, blood clots, heart attacks or death - unlike what the pfizer or moderna covid vaccines often do. paxlovid, not the vaccines, should be offered to all people including those with covid who are obese, elderly or have a pre-existing condition. 
        â â â â  in my view as an observer and researcher, the pfizer and moderna vaccines remain too dangerous and are a serious health risk not worth gambling your life on. children should never get this vaccine nor should the elderly.
        â â â â  just treat the (expletive deleted) infection and forget the covid vaccines - they are a failure anyway as they only promote antibody production that last about 6 months until a new variant comes dancing along. what this disease needs is an improvement in t cell immunity and these vaccines fail to improve t cell immunity. 
        â â â â  paxlovid is safe and effective and is now available at doctor's offices and hospitals nationwide. time is of essence to find an effective treatment when you are hit with the covid virus that can also be fatal if not quickly and effectively treated. 
        â â â â  my support for using paxlovid does not diminish the value of other treatments listed in my booklet on covid-19 including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine or the therapeutic baths - or alternating of the use of hydrogen peroxide in bath water one day with the use of apple cider vinegar and epsom salts the next day. the dietary advice remains the same. 
        â â â â  it is important that people are told get off their disease producing diets (refined sugar, junk foods, corn syrup, gmo corn and soybeans contaminated with monsanto's weed killers, antibiotics, along with hormones and steroids) added to feed cattle and pigs before they arrive at the slaughterhouses.
        â â â â  at the time of the 2nd printing of my book on covid 19 in nov of 2021, the paxlovid treatment for covid was not available. pfizer makes both the covid vaccine and the treatment paxlovid. in my opinion, pfizer got the vaccine tragically wrong but got the treatment for covid right with paxlovid.  
        â â â â  in my booklet published last year, i recommended the hiv drug ritonavir (aka norvir) (see page 47) that is now one of two parts of the paxlovid combo. see pages 40 - 41 for information on the iranian research on hiv protease inhibitors for covid that they found in computer modeling as early as february of 2020. 
        â â â â  i have no doubt that the covid-19 virus was bio-engineered in the wuhan lab in china. this is the result of so-called "gain of function research." what is outrageous is that a trusted government employee, doctor anthony fauci, knew or should have known that u.s. taxpayer funds were being used for this dangerous research project, although there is no proof that the virus was intentionally leaked. 
        â â â â  why was the wuhan lab and other labs funded by us taxpayers looking to produce more dangerous pathogens than nature itself provides, and why was not this funding used to support gain of function research to support the human immune system to defend against pathogens like covid-19? these questions warrant a congressional investigation. 
long covid may linger in the intestines
â doctors and hospitals are puzzled as to why long-covid exists when the nasal swabs come out negative. why does china require a stool sample to test for the presence of the covid virus or the covid spike proteins? the answer may be that the covid virus could linger in the intestines even after a nasal swab tests negative. there have been many published scientific reports in the united states over the past two years that test samples of several city sewage wastewater treatment plants found quantitative rna fragments of the covid virus. these tests are made to determine how widespread a new covid viral variant has spread in a city or local community (1-8). 
  â â â â  a search on pubmed for "wastewater testing for covid" resulted in 344 published articles. hospitals and doctors need to test the stools of patient's that have long-covid and look for the covid virus fragments (sars-cov-2) or even live virus in these samples.

new york post reports that the city's rats are infected with covid
here is an excerpt from the post article:
â â â â  "a new study by scientists at the university of missouri and the usda identified the virus in new york city rats and also found that some species of the notoriously disease-riddled animals are susceptible to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants of covid-19." 
â â â â  “we were concerned that there was a possibility that we were going to find a spillover event knowing that [covid-19] had been detected in some other animal species,” 
        â â â â  the post article was co-authored by dr. julianna lenoch, who is a national coordinator of the usda-aphis center. there is concern that the covid virus has spread throughout the animal kingdom worldwide and may evolve new strains of the virus to re-infect humans.

the damar hamlin story
the covid booster shot for covid he got in december may be the cause 
â â â â  on january 2nd, 2023, millions of people watching tv were in shock as a healthy, 24-year-old defensive player for the buffalo bills, damar hamlin, suffered cardiac arrest during a game with the bengals. he was given cpr for 9 minutes after his heart attack interrupted a game against the cincinnati bengals. after cpr efforts to revive him, he was taken to a local medical facility. 
        â â â â  her is an excerpt from cnn - 
buffalo, new york cnn  â  jan 9, 2023 
        â â â â  "bills safety damar hamlin is now at a buffalo hospital, having been released from the medical facility where he stayed seven days after his heart stopped and he had to be resuscitated on the field during an nfl game, dr. william a. knight said monday during a video news conference. 
        â â â â  "knight, a doctor at uc medical center in cincinnati, said hamlin was released to a health care team from buffalo after his condition was upgraded from critical to good or fair. hamlin flew back to buffalo on monday morning, the doctor said. 
        â â â â  “he is doing well and this is the beginning of the next stage of his recovery,” knight said. “it is entirely too premature to discuss, not only his football; it’s that we’re really focused on his day-to-day recovery.” â end of excerpt.
        â â â â  note: cnn's parent company is at&t as reported by wolf blitzer on cnn last year. what cnn and the corporate media did not tell you is that hamlin had his booster shot for covid the previous month. (sources: americas real voices and justthenews.com) 
        â â â â  millions of people around the world prayed for damar hamlin, and his recovery is proof that god does respond and answers prayers. god can help those who were damaged by the covid shots - if people would simply pray. â â â  the following excerpt is from naturalhealth365.com
mainstream media is complicit in crimes against humanity
â â â â  [corporate media, including companies such as sinclair broadcast group that control the mainstream news narrative, are going to great lengths to conceal the truth about the coronavirus shot.  nor will state and federal governments shine a spotlight on the truth about the vax.  therefore, it is up to you and other justice vigilantes to search for the truth and take appropriate action.
        â â â â  do some digging, and you’ll find more than 1,000 fit and healthy athletes have died suddenly after receiving the covid jab.  nearly 1,600 athletes have suffered cardiac arrests or other serious health issues related to the vax since the coronavirus injections began almost three years ago.  
        â â â â  critical thinkers are quick to point out that these figures are likely less than the actual number of adverse health outcomes and deaths resulting from the jab simply because many such adverse events are not connected to covid injections for political reasons.
        â â â â  brave doctors are beginning to speak out and raise the alarm about the possible explanation for the increased number of sudden deaths.  watch the video to hear dr. scott jensen’s explanation for what’s wrong with our hearts.] end of excerpt.

probiotics may help reduce the intestinal covid viral presence
        â â â  an article on long covid was published by medcomm (2020). 2022 dec; 3(4): published online 2022 dec 8. doi: 10.1002/mco2.196 pmcid: 36514781 pmc9732402 
â â â â  some excerpts are as follows:
        â â â â  [the early strains of sarsâcovâ2 and variants before omicron mainly infect lungs, and cells in the heart, kidney, intestine, liver, and other systems.(170) it is widely recognized that after the acute infection, a substantial proportion of convalescents suffer from longâterm symptoms for several weeks to 2 years, designated as long covid.
        â â â â  [apart from pharmacological interventions, covidâ19 convalescent with asymptomatic cardiac abnormalities, who require less pharmacological intervention, are advised to avoid intense exercise at convalescence.(191)
        â â â â  [clinical trials have documented that probiotic and prebiotic have the potential to construct intestinal environment,(192) and may help to improve the acute and chronic intestinal symptoms. (193) dietary fibers are ideal carbon source of intestinal microbes; the increased intake of dietary fibers may regulate and improve microbiota diversity. in addition, supplement with anti-inflammatory bacterial species is considered to accelerate the restoration of gut microbiota after covid-19 (199)
        â â â â  [based on the serological manifestation of patients experiencing immunological dysfunction, suggested treatment of immunological dysfunction focuses on immunoregulation. blockade of pro-inflammatory cytokine such as il-6, tnf, and ifn is proposed to suppress the over-activated immune response and improve immune dysregulation. moreover, blockade of histamine receptor may play a key role in reducing inflammation.]
â â â â  specifics: foods high in fiber (bran muffins, whole grain non-gmo crackers), raw organic fruits, berries, and vegetables. whey protein from grassfed farm animals, sauerkraut, garlic, onions, raw seeds and nuts, brazil nuts for selenium, walnuts, sunflower seeds, cold pressed flaxseed oil. inulin, artichokes and bananas that are partially green in color. 
        â â â â  canned sardines, and probiotic supplements with either l-plantarum or l-casei to support t cell immunity and anti-inflammatory, anti-covid and anti-cancer activity. cod liver oil, tanning indoors or sun tanning.

magnesium l' threonate helps a 96 yr man with memory issues.
â â â â  i obtain information from multiple sources. individual case reports are refreshing as you can just read and understand the plain facts without mentally swimming through the weeds of technical medical terms like "results were statistically significant" or "single blinded study" orâ  "placebo" or "double blinded" and much more. 
        â â â â  it is encouraging when a 93 year-old wife calls to tell me that her husband of 96 year had an improvement in his memory after he started taking magnesium l'threonate. prior to taking this form of magnesium, the only form known to cross the blood brain barrier, he had trouble with his short-term memory. an example of short term memory loss is to take a trip to the local grocery store and get there only to not remember what you were suppose to buy. 
        â â â â  long-term memory loss is when you forget what happened last year, or 5, 10, 20 or 40 years ago. on an otherwise ordinary day, i cherish getting these kinds of phone calls, because i don't get them that often. 
        â â â â  the couple are on keep hope alive's mailing list. sometimes i am surprised to get a call from an elderly person who tells me about themselves, their life, health, concerns, spiritual experiences, successes and/or failures. i always look forward to hearing first hand what readers say about their experiences and even their experiments. 
the past 6 months - 5g - hazards of wireless radiation
â â â â â  the last copies of my booklet on "insomnia, fatigue and cell phone towers" that i wrote and published in 2010 sold out last month. my plan to write a book on dental health was put on hold - for now - as i had to revise my first edition on the dangers of cellphone microwave radiation that i wrote 12 years ago. 
        â â â â  after working on it for much of december, its size increased to 64 pages. the revised booklet contains 24 pages of both new and updated information including the results of several tests and discoveries i made with my cornet electrosmog meter. see photo of book cover below.

â available at keephopalive.org or lebeaubooks.com

     flip phones- a safer alternative to smart phones  
â â â â â  testing several of my friend's smart phones with the cornet electrosmog meter recently, i found that there is a major defect in their design being that at the top of the phone, when in active use, is where the radiation is highest and the color light of the cornet turns a bright red. you also see the same red lights when the cornet meter is placed near a microwave oven in use. the red color indicates "dangerous" levels of radiation are being emitted. this was true for all 4 smart phones i tested last month. 
        â â â â  now guess where most smart phone users place their smart cell phone when talking to someone- usually the phone is pressed against their face with the top of their phone being against their ear. this is where dangerous levels of microwave radiation are being emitted. if the built in antenna that sends and receives phone data were at the bottom of the phone, then most of the radiation would not be entering the ear or the head of the user. 
        â â â â  also, when the cornet meter is slowly moved away from the smart phone is use, i have to move it 6 or more inches away from the top of the cell phone while it is being used until the red light turns to yellow and more than 12 inches away before it enters the green zone and the cornet light turns green which is the safe zone. now, how many people move their smart phone 6 inches away from their head when making a call? 
        â â â â  now, there is one more problem that the public is not being told by all the smart wireless carriers that advertise their wireless phone services on television 24/7. they are not being told that the electromagnetic frequencies being emitted by their smart phones are in the same frequency range that is used in a microwave oven. 
        â â â â  microwave ovens are used to cook food, and published medical research finds that long term use of a cell phone can damage nerves in the ears leading to hearing loss, acoustic neuromas, and in some instance even brain cancer, usually gliomas, that most often develops on the same side of the head as where the phone had been held. 
  â â â â  there is plenty of published research and medical opinion on the dangers of wireless radiation, but the brain dead regulators at the fcc don't care. 
what makes flip phones less hazardous than smart phones is their different design
â â â â â  when i make a phone call on my flip phone (alcatel), i first open the phone and see the lighted screen but the top measures no radiation with my cornet meter. however, the radiation is emitted on the bottom half of my flip phone 
        â â â â  like the smart phone, the cornet meter also emits a red light when the flip phone is in use and being tested. however, unlike the smart phone that emits the highest concentration of radiation is emitted right over and into your ear and therefore your skull and brain, the location of the radiation data being emitted on a flip phone is about 5 inches below the top of your ear. the location of the radiation emissions on a flip phone is about level with your teeth and your cheek's jawbone. 
â â â  conclusion: the good news is flip phone should not cause you hearing loss, cataracts in your eye, acoustic neuromas or brain cancer. however, excessive use of a flip phone could weaken the bone structure of your jaw due to calcium leakage caused by cell phone radiation. also, because of how the phone is held with your hand, partially away from the jaw, it substantially reduces the risk of developing a cancer in your mouth or jaw. 
â â â â  
â  the photo on the left is my alcatel flip phone in an open position. when in use, the antenna that sends and receives signals is on the right side of the phone about parallel with the number 3. 
        â â â â  when closed, it folds in half and the screen is not visible. it costs me $10 a month for the little service i use. i can send and receive text, take photos and surf the web, but i usually leave it turned off and use it mainly for convenience. 
        â â â â  most of my phone calls are made on a landline and i do not use the handsets that came with the landline phone as they also emit the same radiation as a cell phone. 
letter to the editor of the american free press
americanfreepress.net
â â â â â  "congratulations to kevin mccarthy for his selection by republicans as speaker of the house. we all owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the 19 members of the freedom caucus in congress who held out for substantial changes in the house rules and procedures under the new speaker. these reforms mandate a 3-day, (not the 3 hour nancy notice that the house had for bills under mrs. pelosi's reign)..... 
        â â â â  these reforms include the delivery of the full text of the proposed legislation to all members of the house of representatives 72 hours before any actual deliberations and vote can take place. the reforms also include the right to amend proposed bills, single-issue legislation, and even the right of one member to make a motion to remove the speaker, when deemed necessary.... 
        â â â â  this is a major victory for fairness, justice, democracy, common sense, and above all, the u.s. constitution. these rule changes benefits all democrats, independents and republications equally. 
        â â â â  we should all be grateful, but the work for real and substantial reform, especially restoring to congress control of the nation's banks, money, and the power of credit expansion or contraction has just begun."

the a, b and c's of medicare
â â â â â  part a is hospital care. part b of medicare offers medical care from doctors for retirees starting at age 65. under part b you may still have to co-pay a portion to cover the doctor's charges. then, there is part d. the d stands for drugs and does not include dietary supplements, herbal remedies, organic and non-gmo foods that are used for their medicinal value and - why not?
  â â â â  part c. long lists of insurance companies spend millions each year on advertising their part c advantage programs. you get some "free" otc products - as much as $100 a month - mostly junk vitamins imported from china. you also get some dental, vision and a cheap membership in a local fitness club like the y. a few offer a token monthly payback benefit on your part b monthly premiums. all this supposedly cost the retiree on medicare nothing. it is all "free" but is it really free? 
how much does the government pay medicare advantage (part c) plans?....
â â â â â  john, a neighbor of mine, and a real person, who is about to retire and go on social security called an insurance company who was offering the part c advantage program. being inquisitive, john asked the insurance agent: "are the insurance companies offering all these perks on part c medicare out of the goodness of their hearts?" 
        â â â â  the agent replied; "i have heard that the federal government pays the insurance companies $800 a month under part c to provide all the benefits of original medicare. the insurance companies offer the extra benefits as an incentive to sign up with them each year." 
        â â â â â â  actually, the amount is higher than what john was told. it is $1000 a month to as much as $9000 a month for very expensive disease condition like cancer and open-heart surgery.â  i learned this from a search on the internet. 
        â â â â  the following is a block quote from medicarefaq.com that came up in a search on google - jan 19, 2023. 
        â â â â  [the federal government pays out over $1,000 each month for each enrollment for every individual. $1,000 is a substantial amount when considering the number of enrollees they see, and bonus payments received through the bonus system......
        â â â â  sometimes the medicare advantage plan will get over $9,000 from the government to handle the claims of a “high risk” patient. high risk can include patients with heart disease, diabetes, or other chronic condition.]
        â â â â  wow! - do the math. an insurance company like humana, network, united health care and others get $1000 a month per retiree to take care of their health care needs. now multiply $1000 a month times 12 months, and that adds up to $12,000 a year per person as gross income to the insurance company. now multiply that ($12000) times 29 million people on medicare part c and you have a staggering income of 3.48 trillion per year! 
        â â â â  if the profit margin after expenses per medicare advantage patient were at 40%, then the combined insurance industry profits annually would exceed 1.39 trillion dollars per year. no wonder the insurance companies have millions of dollars to spend on advertising part c advantage on television, the advantage is that the big profit margins go to these monopoly health care providers. 
        â â â â  now, while original medicare is a silver mine for the big drug companies, the medicare advantage program is a gold and diamond mine. part c and d will pay for high priced patented drugs for cancer, but nothing for dirt cheap immunotherapy drugs like low dose naltrexone, or nutritional, dietary and herbal remedies, cbd oil or hemp or even medical marijuana. 
why part c should be repealed and original medicare benefits expanded.
â â â â â  the federal government could abolish part c medicare and still offer all medicare recipients all the perks (dental, vision, local gym membership, including paying all part b premiums now offered by some insurance companies under part c and still have a trillion dollars of pocket change left over. the losers would be the insurance cartel and the lobbyists paid to promote this scam in congress and to the american people.
medicinal hemp 
â â â â â  the original ban against the medical use of marijuana started with the food and drug act of 1905. at that time, the emerging pharmaceutical industry was facing competition from herbal remedies. among those remedies were a few addictive substances including cocaine and heroin. 
        â â â â  wall street bankers including john d rockefeller and others invested in the drug industry and became major stockholders. a few years ago, a special on pbs reported that in 1900 john d rockefeller owned 10% of all the wealth in the united states.
        â â â â  the bankers and other stockholders of the emerging drug medical monopolies wanted to eliminate competition, so they got together and started a print media campaign to stamp-out "quack" remedies. into this basket of deplorables, they tossed in hemp and medical marijuana, both of which were inexpensive and becoming popular as remedies for various ills.
        â â â â  the bankers and their collaborators got congress to define a drug as any substance intended to prevent, mitigate, or cure disease.
        â â â â  the reason for doing this was to eliminate competition and create a market monopoly for patented drugs, most of which were manufactured and sold by big drug companies, whose major stockholders were rich new york bankers. 
        â â â â  after passage of the fdc act of 1905, and the passage of amendments to the fdc act under president franklin roosevelt, the powers of the fda were expanded further with a new law that defined a "new drug." under this new law, the fda was empowered to require fda approval of any "new drug" based on its intended use for preventing or mitigating disease for distribution into interstate commerce. of course, this fda power grab over time led to fewer and fewer low cost health remedies and the patented medicine monopoly grew. 
        â â â â  with this enhanced power as government regulators, the fda gradually removed hundreds of natural remedies that were labeled for the prevention or mitigation of disease. the natural remedies included nutritional supplements, health foods, hundreds of herbal and mineral supplements and other non-patentable formulas.â  this included the use of cbd oil from hemp for its medicinal value, and medical marijuana, a close cousin of the latter. the conflict continues to this day. 
        â â â â  â last year, the manager of a local store that sold cnd hemp products told me they were now fda complaint. i asked her what the fda wanted. she replied: "we had to remove language about our hemp products being anti-inflammatory." 
        â â â â  this is how the fda, the deep state and the corporate media operates. they use tv, print and social media to brainwash, intimidate and influence us. 
        â â â â  if you want to really understand how big money and market monopolies control us, then read my book on "money creation" available at lebeaubooks.â  com. while google diverts traffic away from both of my websites, the fda is an avid reader of my writings but not for innocuous reasons. we are living in a surveillance state. 
        â â â â  i would ask readers not use google as a browser as they will give you a false message that the keephopealive. org or lebeaubooks. com is not secure. google does this for hundreds of websites they are actively censoring. try using yandex.com or duckduckgo.com as your browser. it is best to type in our website address in your browser top line and not use either google or gmail links to reach us.

san damiano water
â â â â â  i have been importing san damiano water since the summer of 2003. one testimonial comment came from jack f. of california who had a tumor on his leg the size of a half dollar. he applied the water directly on it each day. he reported that in a few weeks not only was all the pain gone, but it had shrunk to the size of a dime. 
        â â â â  i have had many reports on this miraculous water since 2003 with people claiming recovery from all kinds of health problems, cancer, depression, and other life threatening conditions. i have been reluctant to publish them, as it would take a lot of time to verify each report. 
  â â â â  this water has both spiritual and medicinal powers. it was announced by the virgin mary in one of her appearances to mama rosa in san damiano, italy.â  "mother mary" is "the immaculate conception" and said the water was a gift to the world from god the father for all time, and until the end of the world.

a five part plan to stop the war in ukraine 
 the purpose is this letter and proposal is to stop the ongoing bloodshed in ukraine, arrange a ceasefire that is monitored by neutral 3rd party observers and to setup a working group to discuss and resolve the underlying issues for a durable, just, and lasting peace.
first: seek the approval from president zelensky and president putin for their support of a united nations peacekeeping force of 50,000 or more persons from non-nato members of the united nations to separate the warring parties in this conflict and who will agree to simultaneously cease all hostile actions against each other from the air, land, and sea. 
 second: a ceasefire must take effect before the observers are placed in their respective positions in a space corridor of 1 to 3 miles. the mission of the peacekeepers, who should be lightly armed for their own protection is to monitor and report to the united nations violations from either side. the initial scope of the peacekeeping force should be limited to the donbass region, crimea and the contested land between these two points as well as other lands adjoining these areas. 
 third: russia should agree to immediately allow the un to deliver food, medicine and water to the civilians and ukrainian troops barricaded in the underground steel plant in mariupol. all civilians in mariupol and other contested areas should be allowed to safely evacuate. 
   fourth: both sides should agree to abide by the terms of the geneva convention in the treatment of their respective prisoners. 
 fifth: diplomats from the unaligned members of the peacekeeping forces should address both the short and long-term security concerns of both sides and propose solutions to both ukraine and russia. 
 finally, religious leaders from all the world's religions should call for a day of prayer and seek divine intervention for the success of this mission. the united states should also pause further shipments of arms to ukraine and offer to help fund this peacekeeping mission as a first priority foreign policy.

milwaukee wi - jeff olinger, a local friend dies 6 days after receiving the johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccine
conrad lebeau 5/8/21
â â â â  this case is personal with me. jeff and i were friends for more than 5 years when he rented an apt from me in milwaukee, wi. he was my maintenance go-to handyman for doing everything from making electrical and plumbing repairs to taking care of the lawn, repairing furnaces, drywall and painting. he moved out of the apt in may of 2018 to a new place on allis st in bay view, wi. since then, we have maintained contact from time to time. 
           â â â â  on palm sunday, march 28th he called me and asked for a ride to umos, (a local community health center) to get a covid-19 vaccine shot. i was unable to give him a ride that day because of a scheduling conflict. 
           â â â â  on april 26th, his uncle, dan, called to tell me that jeff (59 y.o.) had passed away on april 22, the previous week. jeff is survived by his two children, sid and megan. i contacted megan who told me the last time she spoke to her dad was sunday april 18th. i learned that jeff told her he was not feeling well and blamed the j and j covid vaccine that he had received two days earlier on friday, april 16th at the umos community health center.
           â â â â  i contacted the apartment manager (debbie) in bay view who told me she had brought a sandwich to jeff around 5 pm on april 22nd. she knocked on his door but got no response. however, the door was slightly ajar so she opened it and asked him if he was ok but there was no response. she stepped inside and found him motionless. she told me she touched his body and it was cold to the touch. she then dialed 911 for the local police.
           â â â â  on may 5th, convinced that jeff did not die from emphysema since he could walk half a mile without his oxygen tank, i filed a vaers report with the cdc online. a temporary case number was assigned to the report. it is e-498532. at the family's request, i have not included their contact info, as they want their privacy. more information is contained in the report i filed with the cdc. you may contact the cdc and ask how to retrieve the report if you desire. 
           â â â â  will the cdc investigate this case? will we find out if the j and j vaccine caused a blood clot that abruptly ended jeff's life? will this story ever see the light of day in any mainstream media or will it be ignored or quietly buried along with all the other deaths not being reported in vaers? is it not the fda's responsibility to provide instructions to vaccine recipients on where to file a report of an adverse vaccine event? one fact - dead people do not talk- we must speak for them to help prevent more needless deaths.

urgent open letter from doctors and scientists to the european medicines agency regarding covid-19 vaccine safety concerns
         








doctors for covid ethics





















 to emer cooke, executive director, european medicines agency, amsterdam, the netherlands 28 february 2021
dear sirs/mesdames,
for the urgent personal attention of: emer cooke, executive director of the european medicines agency
 as physicians and scientists, we are supportive in principle of the use of new medical interventions which are appropriately developed and deployed, having obtained informed consent from the patient. this stance encompasses vaccines in the same way as therapeutics.
we note that a wide range of side effects is being reported following vaccination of previously healthy younger individuals with the gene-based covid-19 vaccines. moreover, there have been numerous media reports from around the world of care homes being struck by covid-19 within days of vaccination of residents. while we recognise that these occurrences might, every one of them, have been unfortunate coincidences, we are concerned that there has been and there continues to be inadequate scrutiny of the possible causes of illness or death under these circumstances, and especially so in the absence of post-mortems examinations.
in particular, we question whether cardinal issues regarding the safety of the vaccines were adequately addressed prior to their approval by the european medicines agency (ema).
as a matter of great urgency, we herewith request that the ema provide us with responses to the following issues:
1. following intramuscular injection, it must be expected that the gene-based vaccines will reach the bloodstream and disseminate throughout the body [1]. we request evidence that this possibility was excluded in pre-clinical animal models with all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the ema.
2. if such evidence is not available, it must be expected that the vaccines will remain entrapped in the circulation and be taken up by endothelial cells. there is reason to assume that this will happen particularly at sites of slow blood flow, i.e. in small vessels and capillaries [2]. we request evidence that this probability was excluded in pre-clinical animal models with all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the ema.
3. if such evidence is not available, it must be expected that during expression of the vaccines’ nucleic acids, peptides derived from the spike protein will be presented via the mhc i â pathway at the luminal surface of the cells. many healthy individuals have cd8-lymphocytes that recognize such peptides, which may be due to prior covid infection, but also to cross-reactions with other types of coronavirus [3; 4] [5]. we must assume that these lymphocytes will mount an attack on the respective cells. we request evidence that this probability was excluded in pre-clinical animal models with all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the ema.
4. if such evidence is not available, it must be expected that endothelial damage with subsequent triggering of blood coagulation via platelet activation will ensue at countless sites throughout the body. we request evidence that this probability was excluded in pre-clinical animal models with all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the ema.
5. if such evidence is not available, it must be expected that this will lead to a drop in platelet counts, appearance of d-dimers in the blood, and to myriad ischaemic lesions throughout the body including in the brain, spinal cord and heart. bleeding disorders might occur in the wake of this novel type of dic-syndrome including, amongst other possibilities, profuse bleedings and haemorrhagic stroke. we request evidence that all these possibilities were excluded in pre-clinical animal models with all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the ema.
6. the sars-cov-2 spike protein binds to the ace2 receptor on platelets, which results in their activation [6]. thrombocytopenia has been reported in severe cases of sars-cov-2 infection [7]. thrombocytopenia has also been reported in vaccinated individuals [8]. we request evidence that the potential danger of platelet activation that would also lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) was excluded with all three vaccines prior to their approval for use in humans by the ema.
7. the sweeping across the globe of sars-cov-2 created a pandemic of illness associated with many deaths. however, by the time of consideration for approval of the vaccines, the health systems of most countries were no longer under imminent threat of being overwhelmed because a growing proportion of the world had already been infected and the worst of the pandemic had already abated. consequently, we demand conclusive evidence that an actual emergency existed at the time of the ema granting conditional marketing authorisation to the manufacturers of all three vaccines, to justify their approval for use in humans by the ema, purportedly because of such an emergency.
should all such evidence not be available, we demand that approval for use of the gene-based vaccines be withdrawn until all the above issues have been properly addressed by the exercise of due diligence by the ema.
there are serious concerns, including but not confined to those outlined above, that the approval of the covid-19 vaccines by the ema was premature and reckless, and that the administration of the vaccines constituted and still does constitute “human experimentation”, which was and still is in violation of the nuremberg code.
in view of the urgency of the situation, we request that you reply to this email within seven days and address all our concerns substantively. should you choose not to comply with this reasonable request, we will make this letter public.
this email is copied to: charles michel, president of the council of europe
ursula von der leyen, president of the european commission.

doctors and scientists can sign the open letter by emailing their name, qualifications, areas of expertise, country and any affiliations they would like to cite, to doctors4covidethics@protonmail.com

 testimony of dr. pierre kory md, before the homeland security committee meeting on alternative treatments for covid-19 12/08/20
    editors note - senator ron johnson is from wisconsin and dr. pierre kory md practices in my hometown of west allis. wisconsin, at aurora st lukes hospital.   
"i want to begin by thanking senator ron johnson and the committee for this critically needed effort to bring attention to the importance and need for effective early treatment approaches to covid-19. 

      i am speaking today not only as an individual physician, but also on behalf of my non-profit organization, the front-line covid-19 critical care alliance, made up of some of the most highly published and well-known critical care experts in the world with almost 2,000 peer -reviewed publications in the medical literature as well as over 100 years of bedside clinical experience in icuâs around the country. 
      although we, like many, are extremely encouraged by the apparent successes in developing effective vaccines, we also are dismayed at the near complete absence of guidance and research on effective early, at-home, or preventative treatment options apart from vaccines, a reality we find unconscionable. 
      our hospitals are overflowing with over 100,000 covid-19 patients admitted, and new record deaths are reported each passing day. it will take months for the vaccine to be distributed to the general public and further time to have sufficient impact in this crisis, so we are here to stress the need for effective early treatment. 
      my organization of critical care specialists have spent the almost nine months tirelessly reviewing the scientific literature to gain insight into this virus and the disease process and to develop effective treatment protocols. 
      all the while, we were working long hours in intensive care units full of covid patients. iâ¨ was proud to testify in front of the committee about our math+ hospital treatment protocol in may which i would like to mention has had nearly every single component of its combination therapies validated in clinical studies and our paper detailing and reporting on the impacts of the treatment protocol will be published within days in the journal of critical care medicine.
 
      and so, it is with great pride as well as significant optimism, that i am here to report that our group, led by professor paul e. marik, has developed a highly effective protocol for preventing and early treatment of covid-19. in the last 3-4 months, emerging publications provide conclusive data on the profound efficacy of the anti-parasite, anti-viral drug, anti- inflammatory agent called ivermectin in all stages of the disease. 
      our protocol was created only recently, after we identified these data. nearly all studies are demonstrating the therapeutic potency and safety of ivermectin in preventing transmission and progression of illness in nearly all who take the drug. 
      before proceeding, i want to bring attention to two critical deficits in our national treatment response that has made this hearing necessary in the first place. besides the early interest and research into hydroxychloroquine, we can find no other significant efforts to research the use of any other already existing, safe, low-cost therapeutic agents. 
      seemingly the only research and treatment focus that we have observed on a national scale is with novel or high-cost pharmaceutically engineered products such as remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, tocilizumab, with all such therapies costing thousands of dollars. this is consistent with conclusions drawn by a physician consulting to congress about covid-19 when she concluded, 
      âthere is a pervasive problem on the hill with how we prove the value of a low cost treatment.â 
another barrier has been the censorship of all of our attempts at disseminating critical scientific information on facebook and other social media with our pages repeatedly being blocked. finally, we believe the lack of clinical experts on the existing task forces is further hindering progress on identifying effective therapeutics. 
      we can identify almost no members with any similarities to the skill set, clinical knowledge base, and patient care experience to our group of expert clinicians. existing members all seem to be either physician leaders of large health care organizations or have research backgrounds.
      although many must have had some bedside experience in the care of patients in their careers, there seem to be almost none that have been at the bedside of covid- 19 patients in any appreciable fashion during this pandemic. expert clinician panels such as ours have large amounts of valuable insights and wisdom and we are extremely pleased to share our recent discovery of the immense potency of ivermectin in covid-19. 
      ivermectin is highly safe, widely available, and low cost. its discovery was awarded the nobel prize in medicine, and is already included on the whoâs âworldâs list of essential medicines.â we now have data from over 20 well-designed clinical studies, ten of them randomized, controlled trials, with every study consistently reporting large magnitude and statistically significant benefits in decreasing transmission rates, shortening recovery times, decreasing hospitalizations, or large reductions in deaths.
      this clinical data is also supported by multiple basic science, in-vitro and animal studies. our manuscript, completed one week ago, is already out of date due to the near daily emergence of new, positive ivermectin studies. the manuscript has been posted on the medical pre-print server osf (open science foundation) and can be downloaded on our organizationâs website, www.flccc.net. 
      a more updated meta-analysis and review authored by a group of ph.d. researchers and scientists includes all ivermectin studies as of december 4th, 2020 and can be found on the c19study.com website here: https://ivmmeta.com/ 
      these data show that ivermectin is effectively a âmiracle drugâ against covid-19.
 the magnitude of the effect is similar to its nobel prize-worthy historical impacts against parasitic disease across many parts of the globe. it should be noted that that merck, the pharmaceutical company whose scientists helped discover ivermectin, has from the first availability of the drug, donated hundreds of millions of doses for free to support the who parasite eradication programs. 
      we believe a similar initiative is needed to eradicate the globe from the scourge of covid-19. our group held a press conference this past friday, december 4th at the united memorial medical center in houston, issuing a âcall to action.â 
      we made a formal request to our national and global health care agencies and leaders to rapidly assess the growing scientific evidence on ivermectin and update treatment guidelines accordingly. we noted that the last treatment recommendation on ivermectin is from august 27th where on the nih website, they recommended that ivermectin only be used in clinical trials and they based that recommendation as âexpert opinionâ only given the lack of clinical studies at the time.
 
      there is now a wealth of studies reporting efficacy of ivermectin. in that press conference, we called for a rapid and updated review of this evidence in the hopes a treatment recommendation could be made and thus saving many thousands of lives, quickly. 
      the press conference was broadcast via the associated press and univision to nearly every country globally. 
the health ministry of the government of uganda is currently reviewing our manuscript with the intent of incorporating our treatment protocol into a national treatment guideline. it is now 48 hours later and, although it has been shared widely, we have not heard from: 
      â¢	any national news radio, newspaper or television station. â¨
      â¢	any single member of any u.s health care agency. â¨
      â¢	one notable exception is the interest shown by the health ministry of the â¨government of uganda 
      we know of no similar effort by any us health care agency at this time. (this point can be omitted if necessary) â¨this is unacceptable as we have documented evidence that leading members of operation warp speed, including janet woodcock had planned to watch our press conference as have multiple members of the cdc and military as well as journalists from major national news outlets who watched.
      again, 48 hours later and no contact from any health official or major news outlet. we are still hopeful to hear soon from the government and media. â¨i now will briefly review and summarize the emerging scientific data demonstrating the efficacy of ivermectin in the treatment of covid-19
 
data supporting ivermectin as a potential global solution to the covid-19 pandemic 

    â¨
 ivermectin is already eradicating coronavirus infections in multiple regions of the world. dozens of studies demonstrate its efficacy from studies done from " bench to the bedsideâ as follows:
 1)  since 2012, multiple in-vitro studies have demonstrated that ivermectin inhibits the replication of many viruses, including influenza, zika, dengue and others (19-27). â¨
    2)  ivermectin inhibits sars-cov-2 replication, leading to the absence of nearly all viral material by 48h in infected cell cultures (28). â¨
    3)  ivermectin has potent anti-inflammatory properties with in-vitro data demonstrating profound inhibition of both cytokine production and transcription of nuclear factor-kb (nf-kb), the most potent mediator of inflammation (29-31). â¨
    4)  ivermectin significantly diminishes viral load and protects against organ damage in multiple animal models when infected with sars-cov-2 or similar coronaviruses (32, 33). â¨
    5)  ivermectin prevents transmission and development of covid-19 disease in those exposed to infected patients (34-36,54,88). â¨
    6)  ivermectin hastens recovery and prevents deterioration in patients with mild to moderate disease treated early after symptoms (37-42,54). â¨
    7)  ivermectin hastens recovery and avoidance of icu admission and death in hospitalized patients (40,43,45,54,63,67). â¨
    8)  ivermectin reduces mortality in critically ill patients with covid-19 (43,45,54). â¨
    9)  ivermectin leads to striking reductions in case-fatality rates in regions with widespread â¨use (46-48). â¨
    10)  the safety of ivermectin is nearly unparalleled given its near nil drug interactions along â¨with only mild and rare side effects observed in almost 40 years of use and billions of â¨doses administered (49). â¨
    11) the world health organization has long included ivermectin on its âlist of essential â¨medicinesâ (50).
 a more detailed summary of ivermectinâs existing clinical studies in the prevention, early, and late treatment phases of covid-19 follows below. all studies are positive, with considerable magnitude benefits, with the vast majority reaching strong statistical significance. 
    note that in the below summary, rctâs refers to "prospective randomized controlled trials" where patients were assigned randomly to a planned treatment with ivermectin or placebo and octâs refer to âobservational controlled trials" where ivermectin treated patients were compared to concurrently or previously treated patients that did not receive ivermectin. 
    1)  prevention studies: six studies, 4 rcts, 2 octâs with total patients included now over 2,400 patients â all showing near-perfect prevention of transmission of this virus in people with unprotected exposure to covid-19 patients compared to high measured rates of transmission in those that did not receive ivermectin treatment. â¨
    2)  early treatment: three rctâs and multiple large case series âpatients in these studies total over 3,000. all studies show either a considerable, statistically significant reduction in the number of patients who deteriorated into hospital or icu or they reported faster recovery from all symptoms when treated with ivermectin. â¨
    3)  hospital treatment: four large rctâs, 4 well designed octâs, total amount of patients studied approach 3,000, and almost all show large and statistically significant reductions in mortality when treated with ivermectin. â¨
    table 1 below summarizes the existing clinical trials data as of november 24, 2020; however, the number of positive studies has since increased. 
 numerous studies have consistently positive reported large magnitudes of benefits in all disease's phases but - with the most significant public health impact in the prevention of transmission. on this compelling evidence, we recommend ivermectin's administration for both prophylaxis in all high-risk patients as well as in the early and late phases of the disease. 
    if this were to occur nationally and globally, we predict that, like in many of the regions shown above, the pandemic will end, the economy can re-open, social interactions and activity can resume, and life can normalize. the expected impact will allow our nation to grow and focus on the multitude of other pressing problems facing our society. 
    people are dying at unacceptable and untold rates. i am a lung and icu specialist, and all i do right now is take care of covid-19 patients dying of breathlessness in icus. by the time they get to the icu, it is nearly impossible to save most patients. 
    they simply cannot breathe â all are attached to high flow oxygen delivery devices or non-invasive ventilator masks strapped tight to their faces or they are placed in sedative comas and paralyzed so that mechanical ventilators can do the work of breathing for them. they are dying even with our armory of modern medicines and machines. and they are dying slowly. 
    i have never witnessed a form of respiratory failure where patients can be consistently kept alive for weeks before finally succumbing. 	besides the horrific amount of suffering by the patients, their families are also getting traumatized and destroyed. i have seen so many vibrant fathers and mothers of families die in my icu. and most importantly, the majority are minorities, black and latinoâs, many of them poor and often without access to private doctors for early treatment. 
    i have never seen such a disparity in any other illness i treat. recognize that the amount of evidence that i have presented far exceed the level required for a compassionate use authorization as defined by the fda. 
    in conclusion, the global impact of the covid-19 pandemic on both lives and economic despair is in front of all. covid-19, and the inflammatory response to this virus, ravages damage to the body in a way that we, healthcare providers in the front-line, have never seen before. 
    the heavy burden placed on society, legislators, governmental and medical organizations is unprecedented. we are worried that if our call to action is not followed through, confidence in our health care leaders and agencies will be irreparably tarnished. inaction in front of mounting evidence of safety and effectiveness during a catastrophic pandemic may also compromise widespread vaccination support. 
    we will look back to the impact that actions versus inaction had on the us and the globe two months from now. if we do nothing, the present trend will continue. history will judge. the american people will cry for answers or will praise the courage of those elected to represent their interest.

 6,000 covid-19 patients in the dominican republic treated with ivermectin.


excerpts from dr. josã© natalio redondo of  santo domingo, dominican republic-
    doctors in the dominican republic, one of poorest nations in carribean, have found a safe and effective low cost remedy for covid-19. 	the details of this treatment were provided by dr. josã© natalio redondo, when he participated as a guest in âla cita con el covid,â which broadcasts every monday at 9:00 pm at listindiario.com.
    redondo reports over that 6,000 covid-19 positive patients have been successfully treated with excellent results using the drug ivermectin, by doctors belonging to the rescue group, with health facilities located in puerto plata, la romana, and punta cana.
    ivermectin is an antiparasitic and antiviral drug, known and used for 45 years for treating parasitic infections and also used as a dewormer in animals. rescue doctors in the dominican republic used ivermectin to treat patients with the sars-cov-2 virus that causes the covid-19 disease since the beginning of the epidemic. 
    the advantage of ivermectin, redondo points out, is that it is a well-known and studied drug because it has been used for more than 30 years in humans. he states that around the world a trillion doses are given per year with no side effects.
 
the dose 


he explained that the current dose is that a person between 80 and 90 kilos should take six or seven tablets in total, administered all together or in daily doses, preferably in the early stage of symptoms. âour group is giving it all six (tablets) in the emergency room to covid patients,â he said. each tablet has 3 mg of ivermectin. any doctor may prescribe it. 

12/15/20 reuters news service reports a new variant of covid-19 is rapidly spreading in great britain.

 reuters reports that mutations to the "spike" protein have occurred. this "spike" protein is what the covid-19 virus uses to infect human cells. as we reported in our last newsletter, covid-19 latches onto the ace2 receptor in the blood vessels and can cause vascular inflammation and blood clots. 
    excerpts from reuters: "the mutations include changes to the important âspikeâ protein that the sars-cov-2 coronavirus uses to infect human cells, a group of scientists tracking the genetics of the virus said, but it is not yet clear whether these are making it more infectious.
    "efforts are under way to confirm whether or not any of these mutations are contributing to increased transmission," the scientists, from the covid-19 genomics uk (cog-uk) consortium, said in a statement (bit.ly/3mhptjx).
    "the new variant, which uk scientists have named âvui â 202012/01â includes a mutation in the viral genome region encoding the spike protein, which - in theory - could result in covid-19 spreading more easily between people."
    dec 20 update: with over 1000 britain's already infected with this new strain of coronavirus, several european countries have blocked travel to and from britain today. the timing of the emergence of this new variant of the coronavirus is one week after britain began inoculating its citizens with the pfizer/biontech vaccine. whether this vaccine will protect against the new variant of the covid-19 virus is unknown at this time.

australia abandons coronavirus vaccine after study participants test hiv positive - december 11, 2020

 australia has cancelled an agreement to distribute 51 millions doses of a vaccine made by csl limited. the vaccine was abandoned after several persons in the trial receiving the vaccine tested positive with an hiv antibody test. 
    the australian prime minister, scott morrison, stated:
    âuniversity of queensland vaccine will not be able to proceed based on the scientific advice, and that will no longer feature as part of australiaâs vaccine plan."
    csl ltd used the covid-19 âspike proteinâ technology for vaccine research using molecular clamp technology to lock the protein into a shape that allows the immune system to be able to recognize and then neutralize the virus.
    mike ives of the new york times reported the following on dec 11, 2020:
    "the trouble that arose with the australian vaccine, developed by the university of queensland and the biotech company csl, was related to its use of two fragments of a protein found in h.i.v.
    "the protein formed part of a molecular âclampâ that researchers placed on the spikes that surround the coronavirus and allow it to enter healthy cells. the clamp stabilizes the spikes, allowing the immune system to respond more effectively to the vaccine.
    "the use of the h.i.v. protein posed no risk of infecting the volunteers with that virus, the researchers said. but the clamp generated the production of antibodies recognized by h.i.v. tests at higher levels than the scientists had expected."

the nih funded research on coronavirus in bats at wuhan lab

 the following are excerpts from newsweek - dec 20, 2020
    "just last year, the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases, the organization led by dr. fauci, funded scientists at the wuhan institute of virology and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses.
    "in 2019, with the backing of niaid, the national institutes of health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. the program followed another $3.7 million, 5-year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses, which ended in 2019, bringing the total to $7.4 million.
    "many scientists have criticized gain of function research, which involves manipulating viruses in the lab to explore their potential for infecting humans, because it creates a risk of starting a pandemic from accidental release.
    "sars-cov-2 , the virus now causing a global pandemic, is believed to have originated in bats. u.s. intelligence, after originally asserting that the coronavirus had occurred naturally, conceded last month that the pandemic may have originated in a leak from the wuhan lab."
