canid conservation survey

to all friends of the  canid specialist group,    the iucn quadrennium  came to an end at the world conservation congress last october, and all ssc’s  specialist groups were dissolved. i have been invited by the new ssc chair,  dr simon stuart, to continue to serve as chair of the canid specialist  group (csg) and re-constitute its membership.    i have already  written to the current members of the csg in this regard, and in parallel i have  prepared a short online questionnaire to help me get a better idea of the human  resources available among our friends of  canids. the information thus gleaned will constitute a resource database for  easy reference.    this exercise will  also assist us in identifying additional  csg members, and csg country  contacts (i.e., those of you that  reside or regularly work in a country with  important canid populations, and have  detailed knowledge on their distribution and  status).   click here to get to the survey:   http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=ywgrlz6miebbgmnl1r93ca_3d_3d   it should not take  you more than 5 minutes to complete. please do it no later than 20 february 2009. feel  free to pass this on to any other people sharing our interest for wild  canids.    note that if you already received a letter  addressed to csg members you dot need to complete this survey.   i look  forward to hearing back from you. please do not hesitate to write to me with  additional comments or to raise any further canid related  issues.   best  wishes   claudio sillero,  chair  iucn/ssc canid  specialist group

rabies "barrier" to save ethiopian wolves 

 ethiopian wolf conservation  programme press release    a team of dedicated  conservationists is battling to save the world's rarest wolf from a rabies  outbreak by creating a 'barrier' of vaccinated wolf  packs.   with less than 500 left, the  endangered ethiopian wolf teeters on the brink of extinction. in their  stronghold in the bale mountains national  park wolves live in close contact with the oromo  people. whilst this coexistence is encouraging, it places the wolves at great  risk of catching the rabies virus from the dogs the oromo use to herd livestock.  the ethiopian wolf conservation programme (ewcp) has been actively protecting  the wolves in bale mountains since 1988.  'despite the efforts of our veterinary team, who vaccinate  thousands of dogs in bale's villages every year, the virus has raised its ugly  head again and jumped into the wolf population,' said dr claudio sillero of  oxford university's wildlife  conservation research unit (wildcru) and ewcp director. 'fifteen wolves  have died to date, and laboratory tests have confirmed our worst fears that we  are facing another potentially devastating outbreak. if left unchecked, rabies  is likely to kill over two-thirds of all wolves in bale's web valley, and spread  further, with wolves dying horrible deaths and numbers dwindling to perilously  low levels.' in 2003 a similar epidemic swept through, and a rapid response by  the ethiopian authorities and ewcp blocked the spread of the epidemic.    a team led by claudio,  ewcp coordinator dr graham hemson and dr fekadu shiferaw of the ethiopian  wildlife conservation authority is implementing a plan to vaccinate wolf  packs to create a 'barrier' to prevent the virus from spreading. the researchers  knew from previous outbreaks that they had to move quickly to stop the virus in  its tracks so they began by vaccinating the first wolf on 20  october.   'tracking and vaccinating  these animals is a far from easy task,' said dr sillero. 'our veterinary team  are travelling on horse-back and camping out in remote mountains above 12,000  feet with temperatures falling as low as -15°c. but the first three weeks  of the intervention have gone well with the team vaccinating to date  forty-eight wolves in eleven vital packs that connect the web valley population with other wolves in  bale. the objective is to secure a 'cordon sanitaire' of safely vaccinated  wolf packs which will prevent the virus reaching other packs living further  afield in the bale mountains.'     'these preciously rare wolves  can ill-afford it another massive die-off', concluded  claudio. researchers at oxford university have developed a detailed  knowledge of the wolves from 20 years of continuous study. a sophisticated  computer model of how rabies spreads developed with colleagues at glasgow university guides their vaccination  efforts.    professor david macdonald,  director of oxford's wildcru, commented 'it is only because of years of  intensive research that we have the information, and strategies, in place to  mount this ambitious vaccination plan. it's a powerful example of the importance  of the science and practice of wildlife conservation combined in the effort to  deliver practical solutions.' the intervention has been endorsed by the  iucn canid specialist group and the iucn wildlife health specialist group, and  has been sanctioned by the ethiopian wildlife conservation authority (ewca) and  oromia bureau of agriculture and rural development.     dr claudio sillero oxford,  uk   ewcp is a wildcru  (www.wildcru.org), university of oxford endeavour in partnership with the  ethiopian wildlife conservation authority (ewca) and regional governments.  the born free foundation  (www.bornfree.org.uk) and  wildlife conservation network (www.wildnet.org) are  the main donors that enable ewcp to protect the world's rarest  canid.   for more  information on ethiopian wolf conservation go to www.ethiopianwolf.org

vaccination can spare the lives of world's rarest wolves dying of rabies 

  ethiopian wolf conservation  programme press  release 27 october  2008    with less than 500 left, the endangered  ethiopian wolf teeters on the brink of extinction. restricted to a handful of  ethiopian mountains they are actively  protected a dedicated team of ethiopian and british conservationists.     endangered ethiopian wolves are  particularly susceptible to rabies. in their stronghold in the bale mountains national  park they live in close contact with oromo herders,  and their dogs. while this coexistence is encouraging it places the wolves at  great risk from the disease which is common in dogs.     despite the efforts of the ewcp  veterinary team who have vaccinated thousands of dogs in bale's villages every  year; the virus has raised its ugly head again and jumped into the wolf  population. thirteen wolves have died to date, and laboratory tests have  confirmed our worst fears. if unchecked, rabies will kill over 2/3 of all wolves  in bale's web valley, and move on, wolves  dying horrible deaths and numbers dwindling to perilous levels.     a team lead by dr claudio sillero, dr  graham hemson, dr fekadu shiferaw and dr karen laurenson has devised a campaign  to swiftly vaccinate wolves to prevent further infection. the intervention has  been endorsed by the iucn canid specialist group and the wildlife health  specialist group, and has been sanctioned by the ethiopian wildlife conservation  authority (ewca).   the first wolf was vaccinated on monday  20th october and during the first week of the intervention we have  made good inroads, covering four vital packs that connect the web valley population with other wolves in  bale. in 2003 a similar epidemic swept through, and a rapid response by the  ethiopian authorities and ewcp blocked the spread of the epidemic.     this is not an easy task, with our vet  team travelling on horse-back and camping  out in remote mountains above 12,000  feet with temperatures as low as -15°c, but by securing a cordon sanitaire of safely vaccinated  wolf pack that will prevent the virus reaching other packs living further afield  in the bale massif.  these  preciously rare wolves can ill-afford it another massive  die-off.   dr claudio sillero bale  mountains,  ethiopia   ewcp is a wildcru (www.wildcru.org),  university of  oxford endeavour in  partnership with the ethiopian wildlife conservation authority (ewca) and  regional governments. the born free  foundation (www.bornfree.org.uk) and wildlife conservation network  (www.wildnet.org) are the main donors that enable ewcp  to protect the world's rarest canid.   for more  information on ethiopian wolf conservation go to www.ethiopianwolf.org

e-bulletin of ewcp

     if this email does not display properly please follow this        link             dear friends of ewcp,i would like to thank those of you              that came to the wcn garden reception in los altos in june. we              received many generous donations for ewcp, and i enjoyed meeting old              friends and making new ones.  our british supporters please take note that on 7th september we              will gather in london's battersea park for our second walk              for wolves organized by born free foundation.  hope you enjoy receiving regular news from our team in ethiopia.               thank you for your support. claudio sillero    wcn solar panel guru visits bale mountains   by stephen gold, san francisco, usa              i recently visited the bale mountains to inspect three solar              electric systems that i facilitated as part of my wildlife              conservation network solar project. i was not prepared for the              beauty of the afroalpine highlands and i was equally impressed with              the staff and activities of the ewcp. after spending more than a              week there, i understood how important and difficult their work is.               i toured with a colleague, and we were met by graham and vanessa              in addis. after an arduous drive to dinsho we were greeted by              edriss, the programme manager, who seems to be everywhere at once.              the following day we 4-wheeled to sodota, where we saw the first              solar installation. this provides all of the electricity for the              camp and enables phd student freya to conduct her research on wolf              reproduction. lead by mustaffa on horseback, we camped for several              days at keyrensa, rafu and finally sanetti, where another solar              installation is located. this trek is unbelievably beautiful,              especially the otherworldly rock formations at rafu. we spend the              final night in dinsho with graham and vanessa, who cooked us a              fabulous dinner.  the success of the ewcp is from the "top down" and the "ground              up". all of the wolf monitors, who lead very difficult lives camping              at 4,000m, are as committed to the preservation of the ethiopian              wolf as graham and claudio are, and everyone was deeply involved              with the local community. i feel very privileged to be a part of the              ewcp, and i look forward to returning to ethiopia in the              future.  news from bale     by graham hemson dinsho is underwater. it has              been raining almost non-stop for 2 weeks and our house, storerooms              and research buildings have all mysteriously sprung leaks. the              rivers and streams with their headwaters in bale are thundering past              and dinsho market is a swamp.              nevertheless work continues and our monitors have reports of new              packs in an area west of bale (somkero) and have collected faecal              evidence of wolves in lajo (an area slightly north of dinsho). these              are all positive signs and point to a population continuing to              recover from disease epidemics.              back at hq we are preparing for the onset of the breeding season              and our big push to gather vital data on our focal packs. the field              equipment is being thoroughly checked and elaborate and optimistic              work plans are being formulated. one concern is site accessibility              and the teams are worried that they may not be able to get into the              web valley until the flood waters subside. a first scouting foray              heads out today and we look forward to their news.   let’s talk about rats!   by flavie              vidal the afroalpine grasslands of the bale mountains              support an exceptionally high diversity of rare and endemic rodent              species, such as the giant molerat (tachyoryctes              macrocephalus), a favourite prey of the ethiopian wolf.              however, over the last 20 years, the national park has been used to              graze increasingly high numbers of livestock that are suspected to              have reduced rodent diversity and abundance. this reduction              constitutes a threat to the persistence of the ethiopian wolves.              investigating the effects of livestock grazing on the afroalpine              ecosystem has been identified as one of the leading research              priority for bale.  as part of my phd, i will model the impact of livestock-rodents              competition on the long-term survival of the wolves. using ewcp's              long-term monitoring data as well as my livestock data collected              along transects i aim to produce a map of livestock grazing              pressure, highlighting which particular habitats are more prone to              overgrazing. field investigations designed to identify critical              links between vegetation, livestock grazing and rodent communities              include the construction of enclosures within which no livestock is              allowed. these enclosures will unequivocally determine the extent to              which livestock grazing has an impact on vegetation              diversity/biomass and rodent abundance, as well as inform us on the              recovery time-scale of the system once livestock grazing is removed.              these enclosures provide a long-term experiment that long exceeds              the duration of my phd, and offer the park a tool to develop the              scientific basis for future management of its natural resources.              rodent surveys in the arsi mountains    by mohammed kasso               a              study on the status and ecology of rodents in arsi was conducted as              part of my msc degree in mount chilalo and galama range from august              2007 to april 2008. live-trapping was used to obtain information on              the distribution of rodents and insectivores, their relative              abundances and habitat associations. of a total of 2,525 captures              96% were rodents and 4% were insectivores. a total of 17 species of              were recorded, 60% endemic to ethiopia. lophuromys              flavopunctatus was the most abundant and widely distributed              species; mus mahomet the least abundant and more              restricted. the majority of species were associated with the montane              forests, whereas the least were trapped in shrubland at higher              altitudes. i acknowledge my advisors prof. afework bekele and dr              graham hemson for their continuous follow up and ewcp for financial              support.   ewcp diary   21 august - ethiopian wolf conservation committee meeting, addis              ababa 7 september - walk              for wolves, battersea park, london 28 september - ewcp              celebrates world rabies day              4-5 october - ethiopian wolves at wcn expo, san              francisco bay area     www.ethiopianwolf.org   news | publications              | contact us         please help protect these                    rare and endangered animals      in uk donate via born                    free foundation   worldwide donate with paypal    in usa donate via wildlife conservation                    network           © ewcp 2008 - a wildcru endeavour in parternishp              with ethiopia's wildlife conservation authority and regional              governments. funded by the born free foundation and the              wildlife conservation network.              under the aegis of iucn/ssc canid specialist group -              info@ethiopianwolf.org  if              you no longer wish to receive these emails, please reply with "unsubscribe" in the subject line

dholes in china

 attempted predation on blue sheep pseudois nayaur (hodgson) by dholes cuonalpinus (pallas) in china richard b. harris, university of montana, missoula, mt usa 59801 key words: blue sheep, china, cuon alpinus, dhole, predation, pseudoisnayaurthe principal predator of blue sheep (psuedois nayaur) throughout its rangeon the tibetan plateau is generally considered to be the snow leopard (unciauncia) (oli et al. 1993, schaller 1998). young lambs may also be taken byeagles (aquila spp.) or other raptors, and wolves (canis lupus) mayimportant predators in some areas (schaller 1998). although the geographicrange of the dhole (cuon alpinus) is universally represented as includingall the high-elevation areas of western china (cohen 1977, fox 1984,ginsberg and macdonald 1990, sheldon 1992, zheng 1994), few documentedreports on its distribution or ecology in china have been published. dholesare known to prey on numerous ungulates, but there exist only vaguereferences to them attacking members of the sub-family caprinae (e.g.,heptner et al. 1998). here, i report an instance of attempted predation on agroup of blue sheep by a pack of dholes in the qilian shan, gansu, china. for more details see journal of the bombay natural history society 102:(2006) (in press), or contact rharris@montana.com for a .pdfclaudio

oxford university news release: targeted vaccination programme cuts rabies in endangered ethiopian wolves

researchers have produced the strongest evidence yet to suggest that atargeted reactive vaccination programme, rather than blanketvaccination, can control infectious diseases like rabies in threatenedwild canid populations (wild dogs, wolves and foxes. (low-coveragevaccination strategies for the conservation of endangered species',d.t.haydon et al nature 443, 692-695 -12 october 2006)the research team from oxford university, edinburgh university andglasgow university demonstrated that by vaccinating just thirty per centof the ethiopian wolf population, the spread of rabies during anoutbreak can be reduced.. their study, published in the journal nature,suggests that by vaccinating wolf packs living in the connectingmountain valleys close to the outbreak, they can contain diseaseoutbreaks with unexpectedly low overall levels of vaccine coverage.for nearly twenty years oxford university's wildlife conservationresearch unit (wildcru) have been studying these animals and in 1995established the ethiopian wolf conservation programme (ewcp) to addressthe most urgent threats to wolf survival. the population of just 500 canonly be found in remote mountain enclaves in the ethiopian highlands.there are six subpopulations of between 10 and 50, with the largestgroup of 350 living in the bale mountains in the southeast. caniddiseases, such as rabies and distemper, are the major killers withdomestic dogs being the main disease-carriers. the ewcp continues tovaccinate domestic dogs in wolf habitat in an attempt to protect thewolves.after rabies outbreaks in the bale mountains in the early 1990s, whichwiped out two thirds of the ethiopian wolf population in this area, anemergency vaccination programme was introduced in 2003 in response toyet another outbreak that year.the study, an analysis and modelling of data collected by the ewcp,suggests that a preventative strategy to capture and vaccinate the wholepopulation is impractical as the wolves live in remote, inaccessiblemountain enclaves. the alternative strategy adopted by the ewcp is aneffective reactive response to outbreaks, whereby ethiopian wolvesliving in the mountain valleys close to infected packs are targeted. theresearchers have shown through modelling that even if outbreaks becamemore frequent, fewer wolves would need to be vaccinated under thistargeted scenario, than under a wholesale vaccination programme, inorder to virtually eliminate the extinction threat posed by suchoutbreaks.the researchers suggest that routine monitoring of the populationenables the early detection of disease and a rapid response to deal withit. in the event of a single suspected case, they suggest thatmonitoring should be intensified and once two rabid carcass are found,vaccination teams should be dispatched to target subpopulations livingin connecting valleys. additional measures, such as vaccinating between10 and 40 per cent of wolves in affected packs, if targeting theparticularly large and highly connected packs, can further reduceoverall mortality due to these outbreaks.dr claudio sillero-zubiri, from oxford's wildcru, said: 'ethiopianwolves are on of the rarest carnivores in the world, restricted to a fewmontane enclaves in the ethiopian highlands. canid diseases, such asrabies and distemper, transmitted from domestic dogs pose the mostimmediate threat to their persistence, and targeted reactive vaccinationintervention presents a useful tool to protect the remaining small wolfpopulations from extinction.'lead author dr dan haydon, from the university of glasgow, said:'theoreticians have devoted a lot of effort to working out how tovaccinate populations in ways that prevent epidemics getting started,but this requires coverage that is impractical in wild populations.we've looked at vaccination studies that don't prevent all outbreaks,but do reduce the chances of really big outbreaks - ones that could pushan endangered population over the extinction threshold. these strategiesturn out to be effective and a lot more practical.'dr karen laurenson, the university of edinburgh, who has led the diseasework ethiopian wolves said: 'we have shown that the vaccination ofethiopian wolves, when appropriately and strategically used, is a safe,direct and effective method of reducing extinction threats. with theadvent of new generations of oral vaccines, such methods are becomingever more feasible and cost-effective.'professor david macdonald, director of the wildcru, said 'the wildcru'saim is to put innovative science to practical use. these discoverieswould have been impossible without long-term field-studies, and theyshow how cutting-edge science can have down-to-earth practicalsignificance both for the protection of a very rare, and spectacular,wild species, and also for human well-being.'

new publication

 trends, dynamics and resilience of an ethiopian wolf population - j. marino, c. sillero-zubiri & d.w. macdonald - animal conservation 9 (2006) 49–58  abstract: fifteen years of monitoring in the bale mountains provide a valuable time series to better understand the dynamics of populations of the endangered ethiopian wolf canis simensis in the face of epizootics and increasing human pressure. line transect counts in four study areas were used to identify trends in the local abundances of wolves, people, livestock and domestic dogs (a putative rabies reservoir). estimates of wolf abundance were validated against total counts in prime wolf habitats, where two local populations decimated by rabies in the early 1990s had recovered fully by 2000. growth appeared to be regulated by negative density dependence, but the rate of growth was unexpectedly low at reduced densities. limitations to rapid growth, including an initial gap for which data were sparse, are discussed. in a poorer habitat, wolf abundance estimates were less reliable but indicated slight fluctuations without an overall trend. a local extinction was recorded in an area of marginal habitat. with this exception, trends in wolf abundances were unrelated to trends in the abundance of people, livestock or dogs. rabies emerged as the main cause of decline for high-density populations. the rapidly increasing livestock grazing pressure in bale gives cause for concern, calling for further research on its impacts upon long-term wolf survival.
