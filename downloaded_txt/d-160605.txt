there is a place in scotland, where in the wail of a lone bagpipe, the present retreats, and a guest can ponder the age when culloden house played host to the dreams of a prince.
in california, where winter storms hatched a thousand miles away throw themselves upon the northern coast with wondrous fury, the solid walls of the pelican inn hold back the night and envelope warm rooms rich in companionship, hearty food and fine ales.
is romance found in an authentically preserved building, the local history or the dramatic landscape? in a romantic places property these elements are inseparable. our five individually owned hotels are infused with a sense of place, with details reflecting the environment and history of its surroundings.
