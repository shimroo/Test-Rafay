		enjoy yourself here. cajun cooking and creole cooking dominate south 
		louisiana, cajun cooking being the most popular. fact is, cajun cooking 
		and creole cooking couldn't do without each other! that's why you'll 
		often see references to the combo as cajun/creole cooking! no matter

this website is born and bred in lafayette, 
			louisiana in the heart of acadiana and has been on the web since 
			2002. it was nothing more than an idea i had to have my own recipes 
			on the internet so i could find them easily and share them.
i do hope you enjoy your visit and please return often...
"make yourself at home, there's the ice box...get what you need, the 
		forks and knives are in that drawer and the plates are up there. if you 
		leave here hungry it's your own fault!" pass the site on to your friends, unless of course, you want to be a 
	better "cajun" home chef than they are.
enjoy!
