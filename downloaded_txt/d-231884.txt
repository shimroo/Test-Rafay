â
       i love going for walks in the woods â the trees offer both wonder and wisdom. so we designed the legacy project website like a walk in the woods. we invite you to wander around. you may not know exactly where you're going or what you'll find, but we hope you feel like you're in the right place. use the navigation bread crumbs in the top left corner of each page to explore. may you enjoy the walk.â

susan v. bosak
legacy project founder,
         7-generation strategist




â
        what are we missing in trying to read this world by the inappropriate scale of our small bodies and minuscule lifetimes?â
stephen jay gould
paleontologist, biologist,
	science historian




âthe truth about stories is, that's all we are.
thomas king
novelist and essayist




â
  though many say that the future is in the hands of the children, in fact the future lies in the relationship between the generations. what kind of education will they need? and how can we as adults open our minds to thinking in new ways with them? intergenerational learning is not a new project, it's as ancient as time.â
nora bateson
educator, writer, filmmaker




â
  the human heart is the first home of democracy. it is where we embrace our questions. can we be equitable? can we be generous? can we listen with our whole beings, not just our minds, and offer our attention rather than our opinions? and do we have enough resolve in our hearts to act courageously, relentlessly, without giving up â ever â trusting our fellow citizens to join with us in our determined pursuit of a living democracy?â
terry tempest williams
author and conservationist




â
  if a particular society's cultural world â the dreams that have guided it to a certain point â become dysfunctional, the society must go back and dream again. we must reinvent the humanâ¦ by means of story and shared experience.â
thomas berry
cultural historian




â
  there is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. we speak, we write, we do language. that is how civilizations heal. i know the world is bruised and bleeding, and though it is important not to ignore its pain, it is also critical to refuse to succumb to its malevolence. like failure, chaos contains information that can lead to knowledge â even wisdom.â
toni morrison
novelist and professor





â
  snatching the eternal out of the desperately fleeting is the great magic trick of human existence.â
tennessee williams
playwright





whatâs happening?


following on the highly successful   7-generation bioregional earth summit in the gtb in february, the global bioregional earth website has launched, with susan bosak and brian puppa of the legacy project as co-stewards with joe brewer and penny heiple 


the legacy project is the core team working  on  7-generation gtb (greater tkaronto bioregion). this is social (generations in community) and ecological  (community in bioregion)  regeneration across silos and connecting generations 


in his 1992 regeneration report, david crombie laid the foundation for understanding the bioregion around toronto, and profoundly influenced local thinking and planning. this short documentary explores crombie's legacy in the current gtb work 


the story of a bioregional earth depends in part on connecting  western scientific knowledge with indigenous worldviews and ways of knowing. in this conversation with regeneration leader joe brewer, 
	    dr. dan longboat explores a  third way forward 


the annual listen to a life story contest changes lives and communities. a young person 8-18 years interviews an older adult about their life experiences and writes a 300-word essay. cedar lake studios sponsors an amazing grand prize 


researcher, educator, and legacy project founder susan v. bosak's piece in the toronto star calls on all of us to be an elder. we're helping bring more meaning  and purpose to elderhood. be a support and steward for younger generations and the planet 



drawing on her close relationship with her grandmother, legacy project 
    founder and educator susan v. bosak explores how we can build a 7-generation world in her tedx talk.
    7-generation thinking and action are powerful in this time of change
