the new england region has a legacy of rich craftsmanship and environmentally friendly design. the masonry and wood taken from the local landscape are the epitome of the yankee traditions. some designs incorporate reclaimed wood, while others use harvested wood (tree removal permit explains tree harvesting requirements if you wish to process local wood for use in your next property).
in addition to the use of stone, metal, and wood materials, we dream unique and innovative ideas that enhance urban living. we incorporate measures to improve our local environments and make our cities more livable. our architecture and decor firm focuses on sustainable design and leads the charge of "green" architects.
