welcome
your gateway to discovering the natural treasures of south central saskatchewan






nestled in the hills of the wood mountain uplands, it's an area where nature enthusiasts can easily appreciate the forces of nature that shaped this land and enjoy breathtaking scenery reminiscent of the times before cowboys rode the range. one of only four unglaciated areas in north america, it allows naturalists, geologists and paleontologists rare opportunities to study their crafts and saskatchewanderers to appreciate the wild beauty of their province.  



take a drive up the south or west hills, see the country from a geologic perspective. look up the valley and picture the ancient inland sea that covered the town and washed the clay cliffs, leaving the u-shaped bottom land. imagine herds of mastodonts and three toed horses grazing in the lush tropical greenery of the lowlands … and re-discover rockglen from a whole new point of view.  if you want to do some relaxing just slip over to rockin' beach just east of town.  there you can enjoy camping and boating or just sit and take in the view. 















 visit us virtually through our video monologue
