welcome to  dizzy dean 
						baseball/softball 
						

dizzy dean baseball, 
						inc. is a non-profit youth baseball/softball 
						organization whose mission is to provide a recreation 
						outlet for as many youth as possible regardless of sex, 
						religion, race or color.  

 

the main purpose of 
						this program is to provide youth ages five (5) through 
						nineteen (19) years of age, a fair and equal community 
						based baseball and/or softball program.

 

our goal is to 
						instill in our youth the ideas of good sportsmanship, 
						honesty, discipline and a sense of teamwork so that they 
						may become strong, healthy, well-adjusted members of 
						their community.

 

the rules of dizzy 
						dean baseball inc. are designed with emphasis on local 
						league play rather than tournament play.  however, we do 
						offer state and world series tournaments for leagues 
						wishing to participate.

 

our rules are based on 
						the official rules of major league baseball with 
						specific modifications and field dimensions, which are 
						designed with the age specific physical development of 
						the youth taking precedence. 


						there is no such thing as one size fits all; every 
						community has their own specific needs.  with this in 
						mind, dizzy dean baseball/softball allows individual 
						parks to 

						modify their regular season playing rules to better fit 
						the needs of their youth, as long as the overall intent 
						of the rules is not violated (particularly pitching 
						rules).

 

jay hannah dizzy 
						dean was always interested in youth baseball and the 
						development of youth. dizzy dean baseball, inc. is a 
						front-runner in youth baseball and softball and our 
						intentions are to honor dizzy dean by associating his 
						name with a recognized leader in the field of youth 
						baseball and softball.

 

first organized in 
						1977 dizzy dean baseball, inc. has grown to a 
						multi-state youth based organization.
