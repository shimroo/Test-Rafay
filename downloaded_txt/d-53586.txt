our color story




at bella+canvas, we don't take color lightly. with over 300 shades to choose from amongst our current range
        of silhouettes, color is of paramount importance to everything we do. but we didn't get here by accident,
        spinning the color wheel blindly pointing to 300 shades, crossing our fingers for a win. each and every color
        is, in fact, a careful concoction - a perfect mixture of both creative intuition and curious observation.
