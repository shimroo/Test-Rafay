carothers genealogy



the
carothers genealogy page is provided for researchers of carothers genealogy. it
is hoped that this page will provide a means for those researching carothers
genealogy to get in touch with each other. carothers is spelled many different
ways: caruthers, carruthers, carrothers, carithers, cruthers, etc.
with the growth of
genealogy websites, and search engines, i’ve decided this page is no longer
needed.  i will continue to make
this page available for reference, but i will no longer accept further
additions.

i
am researching the family of james carothers, rev. war vet, who died in
jessamine co., ky in 1835.   he was born ca 1752 in va and lived in
nc.   parents were supposedly hugh carothers and sarah
purviance.     one of his children, sally carothers,
married jacob wells, and moved from ky to jackson county, in ca
1820.   close to the wells family is william carothers, who died ca
1826 and was married to mary.   was this the son of james carothers?


i
live close to jessamine co., ky.   i found a document in the court
records from the late 1820's or early 1930's that shows that there was an
infant daughter of a william carothers named elizabeth who eventually married a
george true in jess. co., ky.     george was made the
guardian first.  
would like to figure this out.   this william may have gotten mixed
up with a tennessee branch of carothers, but i am not sure i can say anything
either way.  
would love to share info.

my ggreatgrandfather was named thomas crothers (various
spellings) eaton and was born in lancaster in 1814.  he was the second son
of captain thomas and 
jane adams eaton.  thomas and jane were married 1811 by rev. clarkson, but
the marriage is not showing in the records in st. james where clarkson was 
rector. there has been conjectured that they were married in philadelphia.  thomas was living in east hempfield
twp. lancaster co. by 1827.  jane died 
in 1823 we believe in east hempfield.
we do not know the families of either thomas or jane, except that thomas seems
to have had a brother ezekiel and jane had a sister sarah that married isaac
mowl from washington co., pa. 
based on naming customs we presume there was some connection between the
crothers family and either the  eatons or adamses. 
i would be very happy to share data with anyone that can shed light on this.

historian for its 175th anniversary.) 
marguerite carothers, john's youngest daughter, says
"tennessee(carrothsville?) may be the original home of the family on entry
to the us.  at that time there were 9 in the family, 6 brothers.  one
went to canada during the revolutionary war out of loyalty to the english
king."  i have just begun to investigate the carothers and bedford

i am looking for info on my gr-gr- grandmother, a louise carithers. another
spelling is carrethers. she married a pleasant a randolph from tn.they had 2
sons i know of ...thomas calvin augustas randolph born august 28, 1860 in tenn.
also a son william. i don`t have any info on his b/date. thomas was my
gr-grandpa. he died in indianapolis, in. dec. 5, 1941. the mystery is this..
according to family folklore pleasant was killed by "morgan`s
raiders" at look-out mountain i would guess around 1865. no one seems to
know what happened to the boy`s mom louise. they were sent to delphi, indiana
and raised or "bound-out" as my dad and grandma called it by louise`s
sister a rebbecca carrethers. another thing is as i have gotten into this
genealogy i have found that pleasant lived until 1918!! if it`s the same
pleasant randolph. but, we still don`t know what has happened to louise. so i
guess i can say i`m also looking for any 
info on rebecca also.

i am not a
carothers researcher but have a book "1891 biographical history of
pottawattamie co, iowa" which lists a mrs. maria jane (carothers) barton
and a wonderful write-up about her, written by her husband at the time of her
death.  i thought perhaps the information contained in this bio would help
some carothers researcher. 
reuben barton,
a native of massachusetts, son of nathan and sarah barton, was born january 9,
1812.  in the fall of 1867, having been married and "bereft of
wife" twice, mr barton made a visit to ohio, where he met and married on
october 20, 1867, to maria j. carothers, the youngest of a large family of john
and betsey (sickler) carothers, john born 1774 and betsey born 1778.

the father john
died feb 17, 1842, and the mother sept 8, 1853 in burton, ohio. here is the
obituary that mr barton wrote for his beloved wife: 
   
"mrs. maria jane barton, consort of reuben barton, departed this life,
september 10, 1890.  she was born in phelps town, ontario co, ny, oct 19,
1818, and was the youngest of the numerous family of john and betsy
carothers.  her father removed to burton, geauga co, ohio, in 1832, where
he died feb 17-18, 1842.  she being the only unmarried one of the family,
the care of her father during a lingering sickness fell upon her.  after
his death, the care of an invalid mother who had become blind and helpless,
devolved upon maria until her mother's death, sept 18, 1853, leaving maria, at
age 35, with feeble health and quite limited means.  by overwork in
lifting her mother through a series of years, she had contracted a disease of
the spine, from which she was a great suferer.  she was under medical
treatment by eminent physicians for 11 years, when she was so much improved as
to enter the marriage relation with reuben barton in the fall of 1867, and

came with him to
this county where she resided until her death.  she was a great sufferer
from sickness.  the change of climate improved her, but did not restore
her to sound health.  in 1884 the removal to weston for a time seemed to
be beneficial; but in sept 1887, she had a stroke of paralysis of the left
side, from which she never recovered, although able to be about the house until
the last fatal attack, which occurred august 9, 1890; she was then forced to
bed, from which she never arose again.  she survived in great agony a
month, ceasing to breathe sept 10, when she passed peacefully away, and there
passed from earth life one of nature's noble women.  her sympathetic
impulses knew no bounds; where duty seemed to call she was always ready, and to
a sense of duty she sacrificed her health and life.  they laid

her tenderly to
rest sept 11, 1890."

books on the carothers 




a biography of wallace
hume carothers , b. 1896, d. 1937, entitled "enough for one
lifetime", wallace carothers, inventor of nylon, will be published by the
american chemical society, washington, dc, late in march 1996. the book celebrates
the centenary of the inventor's birth, april 27, 1996. the author is matt
hermes. 



i have been researching off
and on for ten years the life and career of george cupples carothers, who was a
u.s. consular agent resident in torréon, neuvo leon, mexico in 1910. during the
madero revolution of 1911 he reported to the u.s. state department on events
there and elsewhere... during the mexican civil war of 1913-1915, carothers was
the u.s.representative and intelligence agent appointed to accompany the forces
of francisco "pancho" villa.he was born in san antonio, tx, in 1878
and as a young lad was taken to mexico, where he grew up muy simpatico; some of
the more chauvinistic yanquis resident there considered him a "traitor to
his race". because he was u.s. consular agent, he was in place and because
he was known to be friendly to the revolutionists, he was readily accepted by
villa as a compañero. gcc continued to accompany villa until the villistas'
defeat in the spring of 1915 by carranzista forces commanded by alvaro obregon.
in the event, the villistas were driven back to the arizona border and his
forces were finally dispersed after the battle of agua prieta in october 1915.
at this time the wilson administration recognized villa's opponents, the carranzistas
as the de facto government of mexico.  after the defeat, villa and a few
hundred men, withdrew into the sierras, to emerge on march 9,1916, making the
columbus raid.  after carothers left the villista forces he continued to
roam the border, while residing in el paso, tx. it is not clear when he ceased
to be an active intelligencer but he remained friends with gen. john j.
pershing, who, before he had commanded the punitive expedition, had been the
border patrol commander at fort bliss, el paso, tx. they kept in touch until
gcc's death. subsequently, gcc's widow, minna hall carothers, continued to keep
in touch with pershing until his death. i have mined the pershing papers in the
lc for all relevent materials on gcc. minna hall died in the 1950s.

both carothers are listed in
the nyt obituary index. gcc 3 times. he even rated a front page article in the
nyt. so many people came to his funeral that they had to stand in the street.
all in all, a once popular and well-known man but now forgotten in the mist
stirred up by subsequent events of the great war and after.  gcc's early
life and career is well documented in state department personnel files, and his
reporting and revolutionary career is well summarized in larry hill's
emissaries to a revolution. 
there are scattered mentions
of him in both obregon's and villa's memoirs; the former did not favor him
because he was considered to be on the other side, even though that was his
assigned duty, and villa, who seems by inference to have been influenced heavily
by gcc in dealing with the crisis caused by the vera cruz occupation in 1914,
and the english cattleman benton's murder by villa's right hand man, fierro,
would have been reluctant to publicly say so. 
in the event,
carothers never returned to mexico to live, and ended up by the twenties in new
york city, where he was in business and married minna hall, a businesswoman in
her own right. 
in 1920 he was living in
rochester when he testified about the columbus 
raid before the
fall committee investigating mexican "raids and 
atrocities".

carothers never appeared in
the 1910 census and was not important enough at the time of compilation to be
included in a directory of american residents in mexico which is on microfilm
in the lc. gcc does appear in various nyc manhattan directories and in the 1925
ny census but little detail is to be gained therefrom. i could not find him in
any el paso sources of the time except for an address. 
gcc was married while
resident in torréon and had one son. but in accord with the custom of the time
she is always referred to as "and wife". no record have i found gives
her name. i had originally thought she had died, because several sources said
she was sickly, and searched cemetary and death records for the period but when
i got gcc and minna hall's marriage certificate, it stated gcc had been
divorced. although it is not really important to the story, i really want to
find the first wife's name and what happened to her and the son. the obituary
stated that he was in buenos aires, arg., but a check of recent phone books
revealed nothing of the name. there were supposed to be a brother or cousins in
1943 living in mexico. 
i intend to write his
biography and want to fill in the last twenty years of his life and to find his
personal papers, if indeed they still exist. 
his existing reports in the
national archives reveal an intelligent and 
hail-fellow-well-met
type who enjoyed life and remained life long friends with many persons of
renown. 
*the watcher reference is to
the highlander tv series.
