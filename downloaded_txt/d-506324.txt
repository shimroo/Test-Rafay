welcome to my part time home-based business dealing in vintage collectibles, curios, antiques, and militaria on the internet and locally at the finishing touch antique mall in carrollton texas. my lovely wife sharon and i have made myself a unique niche on the web selling a variety of vintage collectibles and antiques since 1995. due to my unique work schedule as a firefighter i am able to spend my free time hunting down many interesting items from garage sales, estate sales, flea markets, auctions, and from individuals. 


me at my real job!
