make sure your beneficiaries are up to date




when life events happen such as marriage, divorce, death of a beneficiary, etc. please make sure you update your beneficiaries not only with the funds office but also with the international office.  
for the international office: 
if you do not have a beneficiary designation form on file, article xi of the ibew constitution states that the death benefit is payable to the following individual(s) in order of priority:
member’s spouse, or if none;member’s children in equal shares, or if none;member’s parents in equal shares, or if none;member’s estate
or if you wish to specifically name a beneficiary or change a beneficiary previously named, you must fill out a new beneficiary designation form.  
this form can be found on our website: 
online forms – ibew local 86 (ibewlu86.org) 
or on the international office website: 
beneficiary_usa (ibew.org)
http://www.ibew.org/portals/31/documents/pension/beneficiary_cover_letter2b.pdf
do not assume you do not have a beneficiary designation form on file.  you may have filled one out at the beginning of your career and it needs updating.  if you are unsure whether you have one on file or not, call us and we will check on it for you.
