silent infections





some people see advanced as woo-woo, but if ivy league universities and scientific entities such as nasa, and lucrative businesses like the nfl embrace a science, perhaps it isn't alternative. perhaps it is advanced. standard of care is not always advanced. the pharmaceutical industry won't tell you about supplements that are studied and published in peer reviewed literature. i wouldn't call standard of care and the drug industry advanced at this time. not when the profession isn't honest about what could change lives for the better instead of judging insulin resistance solely on diet and never giving the chance that any good horse would get for a healthy offspring by giving a test to find a yeast infection, which the cdc has called a silent infection.lorenzo odone died may 30, 2008. his father inspired me to do this research below about yeast infections women commonly have. women aren't tested much for it, and then when a baby is lost they are not tested for it. so much more research has been done to help horses than to help humans with yeast. i found a little research that i share in the article below. these issues are taboo with doctors, pharmacists and their corporations, so far. monistat is only for candida albicans, but there are other yeast infections people can have.this site has no ads. to support this site, please check out http://www.fertileprayers.blogspot.comif i could go back in time, i would rather do a green diet and vitex than all the drugs and surgeries (procedures) and exams and miscarriages i went through. the stats are better for vitex for women, and l-carnitene for men than for all the medicines doctors are giving now. people are happier, as well with these supplements.http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,361148,00.htmlfertilityfair(at)yahoodotcom is my emailhttp://www.authorhouse.com/ to purchase fertile prayers as an ebook.barnes & noble and amazon are selling the paperback around $60.00.below is the article about low grade infections and miscarriage, infertility, stillbirth and sterility.charlotte fairchild many infections are silent (c) 2005many infections are silent, symptomless. an infection does not need to be sexually transmitted to be listed in the sti/std category(cdc, 2004) or to have been found to cause infertility in horses (google, 2004). humans have not been studied as extensively? an example: horses infected with candida from fescue and/or caterpillars become infertile. (google, 2004) common infections, as well as sexually transmitted infections might well disrupt hormones, and decrease fertility. the research for common infections in humans affecting fsh (folicle stimulating hormone) has yet to be done (urinary tract infections, yeast infections, dental disease, colds, to name a few). if there is a relationship to fertility and common infections, one test will not close the door to treatment, as well as hope for many women to give birth to their genetic child. it may instead open the door to better health. perhaps the ph miracle and alkaline diets will change the milieu of sterility, stillbirth, infertility, miscarriage.most women who reach menopause will have high fsh levels. follicle stimulating hormone comes from the pituitary in the brain, and is necessary for ovulation in women. higher levels spell menopause and the end of ovulation. some women have higher levels as soon as their 20s and other women have normal levels in their 40s. the women with higher levels find it is difficult or impossible to have their genetic children. little research has been done directly for factors of fsh levels. so much has been written about the age factor, when perhaps there is more. (hanson, 2003) perhaps infection plays a role.four studies gave differing views of infection and fsh levels. hiv infected women had higher levels of fsh in one study. (salmassi, 2001) cattle had normal fsh levels, but still fewer and smaller follicles with a uterine bacterial infection. (sheldon, 2002) (the fsh levels may have been different, but the effects were similar, because fertility factors decreased in each study.) fsh is related to viral replication time (wang, s.w., 1995). “our findings reveal that endotoxin interrupts the follicular phase of the cycle by interfering with several steps in the preovulatory chain of endocrine events.” (karsch, 2001) ########referencesgoogle. search: horse fungal fertility, results 1-10 of about 11,400. march 25, 2004.

charlotte fairchild recommends take back your temple





kimberly floyd has written a book called take back your temple. it is written for people who have a low income in order to eat healthy on less money. she is a nurse. ask your library to order it, please.anything to be healthy will give a woman a better chance at being pregnant. i don't know if she mentions kudzu or the william shurtleff book the book of kudzu, but that would help as well.nothing helps candida more than chloraphyll.

charlotte fairchild: infection





the fertility solution by a. toth is a free book online for people interested in the possibilities of infection. he treats candida, or yeast infection, too. but the interesting thing is that he doesn't use the ph miracle science for this. he will use heavy duty drugs. i would rather go with something like the ph miracle to lower candida. it is cheaper and less side effects, i believe. but he offers this free book to help people understand the consequences of infection, and that there is hope. the supplements seem expensive until you go to someone like any md.  something else that is important to realize is that the body doesn't build up a resistance to choloraphyl, but i cannot take nystatin or diflucan because my body built up a resistance to these antifungal drugs. because of asian soybean rust, and farmers putting antifungal chemicals on the soybeans, this might be more prevalent for people.you can find out a little more about this on the links on my www.kudzus.blogspot.com site
