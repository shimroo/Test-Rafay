what others say about us





âa class act. everythingâs always in stock. thereâs no question about deliveries really. price, theyâre the most competitive. just the whole persona thatâs developed from the organization. the moment you walk through the door, theyâre very professional on how they carry on business, right through the whole accounting process, the invoicing process, and the people in general, the people themselves make the company.â
manufacturer, president-partner




âthey have certain people within their organization that have been with them for a long time, so if we need something, theyâre pretty good go-to people. their turn-around for the most part is good; their inventory is good. weâve got a good working relationship with them. if we have a problem with quality control or something, i have no problem picking up the phone.â
