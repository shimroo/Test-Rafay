lee purbaugh's plane, the forest damage, and the three shanksville high students






two people supposedly saw a plane actually hit the ground in that shanksville field.  one was lee purbaugh, who a lot of you probably heard of.  the other was michael shepley, the son of air-witness linda shepley. michael is not very well known because he was never directly interviewed by the media (and maybe there was a good reason for that as you're about to see).





both lee and michael were working a couple hundred yards up the field at rollock scrap yard.  (yes, the closet business to the alleged plane crash that supposedly only left small bits of metal scrap on the field was... a scrap metal yard!) 





purbaugh says a plane flew over extremely low only a couple hundred feet over his head coming down at a 45deg angle and then saw it crash into the empty field a couple hundred yards away. he described that the plane was rocking from side to side, then suddenly nose-dive into the ground by the treeline.  





what's interesting about this part of his story is that officials claim flight 93 crashed at a blistering speed of about 580mph.  how could a 757 going that fast be able to rock from side to side, or suddenly nose-dive after coming in at a 45deg angle in that short of distance from the scrap yard to the treeline???





but the most interesting thing about his story is what he doesn't describe. flight 93 was a united airlines plane that supposedly was upside-down when it allegedly crashed (or crashed more on its side as coroner wally miller said he was told).









purbaugh would have either seen the grey top of the upside-down united airlines 757 as he looked up, or its two-tone grey/blue color scheme if it was more on its side as wally miller said he was told it was.  however, purbaugh never mentions that the plane he saw was either upside-down, on its side, or recognized it as an united airlines plane!





it's hard to believe the navy veteran would forget to mention, or not being able to notice that a 757 buzzing so low right over his head was was either upside-down or on its side, or what airlines it was from had it been an united airlines plane.  in fact, in an interview with jeff "shure" hill, purbaugh not only described seeing the bottom of the plane that flew over him, but that the bottom of the plane that flew over his head was black!  





the plane lee purbaugh described does not sound like an upside-down united airlines 757, or any plane going around 580mph.  i would really like to see mr. purbaugh interviewed again and specifically asked if that plane he saw was upside-down, or not, and if he could recognized if it was a united airlines plane.  i'd also really love to hear what michael shepley has to say!





purbaugh does however give a description of what happened to the plane after he says he saw it crashed, quoted as saying when it hit it “shook the ground, rolled over in some way and then collapsed,” but that too differs from how officials are trying to make it out that because of the super fast speed that flight 93 supposedly crashed into the "soft ground" of the reclaimed strip mine at, most of the 757 went straight into the ground, "literally." interestingly, purbaugh's description is similar to the one given by wally miller, who says was the explanation given to him, presumably by the officials in charge of the scene.  it should also be noted that some hold a little suspicion towards purbaugh because he was coincidentally only on his 2nd day on the job at rollock, coupled with being ex-military.


still, if the plane these two saw was different, but still supposedly crashed, where is this plane's wreckage?  even purbaugh basically says the only thing he could identify when running up to the scene was a bookbag and a bunch of mail.





but what if this mystery plane didn't crash?  what if this plane flew over the alleged crash site and kept going?  do i have any evidence to that?





well remember those three students from shanksville high school that described seeing a "fighter" plane flying over their school just seconds after they saw an explosion off in the distance?





john:  we think it was shot down because as soon as it crashed a big fighter plane flew over the school.
tessa: i think that the passengers took it down.
brian:  i think it was both. at the same time really... we saw that plane like right after it happened.  we were the only ones who saw it pretty much from the school.  nobody one else saw.
narrator: how long after did you guys see the fighter plane?
john:  like ten seconds.
brian:  right there. it was right after everything.
john:  as soon as we saw the mushroom cloud, this plane goes flying over. 





well, it does all line up!

did 100% of flight 93 supposedly survive?!





when the fbi finished their investigation/recovery efforts at shanksville, a mere 12 days after the supposed plane crash of flight 93, they claimed that they had recovered about 95% of the alleged 155ft-long 60ton boeing 757 and handed all of it over to united airlines, except for the alleged black boxes.

fbi finished with pennsylvania crash site probe
[monday] september 24, 2001

shanksville, pennsylvania (cnn) -- the fbi announced monday that its investigation of the site where a hijacked jet slammed into a field here is complete and that 95 percent of the plane was recovered.

evidence-gathering was halted saturday afternoon [sept. 22] and the pieces of united airlines flight 93 that had been recovered were turned over sunday [sept. 23] to the airline, with the exception of the flight data recorder and the voice recorder, which are being held and analyzed by the fbi, according to fbi agent bill crowley. - cnn.com

-----------------------------------------
fbi ends site work, says no bomb used
tuesday, september 25, 2001

stonycreek, pa. -- the fbi said yesterday that it has finished its work at the crash scene of united flight 93 after recovering about 95 percent of the downed airliner and concluding that explosives were not responsible for bringing it down.

since it had no more use for it, the fbi turned the airliner debris -- but not the data and voice recorders -- over to united airlines yesterday.

recovery teams initially said that the fbi investigation could go on for up to five weeks. instead, the fbi officially ended its investigation of the crash scene late saturday afternoon [sept. 22], 12 days after the probe began. - post-gazette.com
that's quite remarkable they could recovered so much in such a relatively short amount of time.
it's even more remarkable when you consider the debris visible at the scene looks more like only about 5% of a boeing 757!



of course the "reason" so little of the 757 looks to be left at the scene is not because the plane virtually obliterated upon its alleged high-speed 580mph impact, but because about 80% of the plane had supposedly buried under the "soft" ground.




but probably the most remarkable thing is that somehow the fbi supposedly dug up and hauled away 30+ cars-worth of debris (the estimated equivalent of 80% of a 757) with hardly any of it being seen!

 see: why no piles of plane debris, just piles of dirt? 

some people say that this photo of a partially filled dumpster could be some of the plane debris that was buried -- never mind that none of the visible debris in it has united airlines colors on them:


however, the debris in that dumpster was collected a week after the fbi finished their investigation:

searchers to return to flight 93 crash site
saturday, september 29, 2001

shanksville, pa. -- about 250 workers will make another search today in the area where united flight 93 crashed, believing high winds and heavy rains may have shaken additional evidence out of the trees.

somerset county coroner wallace miller said the search would begin early today around the crater where the boeing 757 crashed near shanksville on sept. 11. forty-four people on board died when the hijacked plane crashed.

miller said consultants with united airlines suggested another search because bad weather this week might have shaken additional airplane parts out of the trees in a wooded area near the crash site. the coroner said the workers would also be looking for any human remains not already collected.

some pieces of the aircraft -- most no larger than one square foot -- have already been found because of the bad weather, he said.

the fbi, which had treated the site as a crime scene, turned over control of the field where the plane crashed to miller on monday [sept. 24]. - post-gazette.com

-------------------------------
latest somerset crash site findings may yield added ids
wednesday, october 03, 2001

stonycreek, pa. -- the somerset county coroner said yesterday that he should know by this weekend if the last big sweep of the united airlines flight 93 crash scene yielded remains that he can link to any of the 44 people who were aboard the hijacked airliner.

but a week after the fbi closed its criminal investigation at the somerset county site, county coroner wallace miller indicated that his job has switched largely from search and recovery to a cleanup of what he deems sacred ground.

over the weekend, about 300 volunteers combed a half-mile square around the crash site and found enough debris from the boeing 757 to fill about one-third of a trash container.

most of it was little more than thumbnail size -- "no bigger than a pop rivet holding two pieces of aluminum," miller said yesterday -- that last week's rains washed from trees bordering the stretch of strip mine where the airliner crashed nose-first sept. 11.

no significant evidence turned up, miller said, and there probably won't be a repeat of anything the size of last weekend's search. - post-gazette.com
so that means none of the debris in that dumpster was part of the alleged 95% of the plane the fbi claims to have collected and returned to united airlines, minus the black boxes.  it's all additional debris. (it also means the fbi didn't do a very thorough job!)

also, some reports say that years later, alleged plane debris was still being found at the site:
in the sky, a heroic struggle aboard hijacked united flight 93; one year after 9/11: shanksville, pa.

from the first chaotic hours after the crash, miller has firmly kept the media and meddling officials he calls "jafos" ("just another f---ing observer") from "tromping around" in the woods and among the handful of small cabins and houses at the scene. only the seven landowners with deeds to various sections of the area may visit their acreage. errant shards of the aircraft can still be found there–twisted plates of the machine's metal skin and swatches of patterned seat covers–but it's illegal to keep them. - usnews.com

---------------------------------
owners to get 9/11 field in pa. back
posted 7/29/2005

shanksville, pa. (ap) — the abandoned strip mine where united flight 93 crashed nearly four years ago on sept. 11, 2001 will be returned to the control of its owners when the county coroner releases the area as a death scene on monday.

somerset county coroner wallace miller and volunteers made a final sweep of the property this week, turning up human remains too small and weather-worn for identification. airplane debris was also found near downed evergreens.

"the volume (of materials found) has dropped off considerably, to the point that i now feel it's appropriate to close my involvement in the case," miller said. - usatoday.com 
so "officially," more than 95% of flight 93 was recovered and if you think all that debris in the dumpster, coupled with the small amounts of debris reportedly found at the scene years after, could equal about 5% of a boeing 757, then that would mean that 100% of flight 93 supposedly survived the alleged "high-speed, 40deg-angle, fiery, huge-explosion, only 8% of passenger remains survived" crash.

the most ironic thing about all this is that most of the debris witnessed at the scene came from the <5% of the 757 that allegedly remained and this came after the fbi supposedly removed their claimed "95%" of the plane!

just one more unbelievable detail of the phony flight 93 crash story.
