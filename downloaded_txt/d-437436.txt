what our members say





"the programs, staff resources and support available through the cma are of excellent quality. whether in the domains of legislative advocacy, member services, educational resources, assistance with medical staff issues and public policy – the cma team is experienced, accomplished, and readily available to assist."
john maa, m.d., general surgery, cma member since 1992





"the work cma does is only possible thanks to the collective strength of our physician members. it is when we act in concert with one another and speak with one voice that we can be most effective in shaping the future of health care and building a system that works for our patients."
donaldo hernandez, m.d., hospitalist, palo alto medical foundation
