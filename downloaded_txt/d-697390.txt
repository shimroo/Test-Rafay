		the health by design holistic wellness approach is a health investigation and healing modality that considers the whole person; body, mind, spirit, and emotions in the quest for optimal health, wellness and the promotion of healthy longevity. the health by design holistic protocol helps people to identify imbalances in their body (physical, emotional, or spiritual) and in their lives, which can negatively impact their overall health. the quest for well-being, which includes good health, is a 'life long journey' not merely a destination. we are all on our well-being journeys! the best way to improve your health is to learn as much as you can about the factors that affect your body, your health and well-being using holistic investigation principles; and then follow holistic guidance to help you deal with those challenging factors. visit my latest blog posts 'for a healthier you'! to get started and for updates. click on the contact tab at the top of the page for information on appointments, consultations and bodyfeedback training.
