carnival radiance cruise (1/9/-1/13/2023) - solo cruising





 unfortunately, my 4-night cruise turned into a 'cruise to nowhere' thanks to the weather. bad weather last tuesday caused our stop in catalina island to be canceled as the tenders could not operate, going down to ensenada the rain caused my tour for mexican food & margaritas to be canceled as well.can't blame carnival for that and port charges & tour costs were refunded.  naturally, the weather on wednesday and thursday was nice so i could sit out and get some sun. the comedians were both pretty good, although one did a better job in the 'adult' show than in the 'family' show earlier in the evening. you could tell he wasn't as comfortable trying to keep his routine more acceptable, but he's not the only comedian i've seen have that problem, no matter where they may be performing. carnival radiance was built as the victory beginning in '98 and sailed under that name until late 2021 when it was refitted and renamed. it's similar to its sister ship the triumph (now the sunrise), which was the first cruise ship donna and i sailed on in '99, which was her inaugural year. the destiny class all have the same issue where it is impossible to go directly forward or aft on some decks, making it a pain in the ass getting to the dining rooms if you happen to be either forward or aft and your reservation is in the restaurant on the opposite end. guy fieri has two restaurants on board, including at no additional cost, his guy's burger joint and the later pig & anchor bbq. i recommend both. shaquille o'neal heavily promotes the 'funships' and has his big chicken franchise aboard as well. i enjoyed all three places. the only restaurant, at an extra cost i went to was bonsai sushi, open in the evenings.

a few quick comments on politcal events. 





 things could change by the time i post this, but earlier it does not look good for kevin mccarthy in his desperate attempt to become speaker. already a proven non-entity he's giving away any power he might have had by kowtowing to the worst elements in his party.i find it funny that he actually had his office files moved into the speaker's office (video available) and may have to move them back out later. at least he's moved george santos (if that is his name) out of the headlines for a bit. by the way, does the editor in charge of santos' wikipedia page get extra for changing things daily? there is more stuff there than on the pages of politicians who have been in office for decades.

getting new glasses





 went for an eye exam yesterday. had to see a new doctor as my former one, dr. roberts has retired. this is the first eye exam and new pair of glasses since before the pandemic.i have an issue with my eyes which causes me to see everything blurred or double-vision unless i tilt my head to the right. i also have the habit of closing my left eye when reading, since this gets rid of the double-vision for close-up stuff. dr. roberts did what he could, but there was nothing he could do about the tilt. i lost count of the number of machines i had to look into and the tests i took yesterday. dr. goldman believes he can correct some of it through a series of prisms in my lens. not even going to tell you how much it cost for the regular glasses and the computer ones.  if it makes driving, reading and watching tv & films much less tiring it will be worth it.going to take a few weeks, so i may or may not have them by the holidays. i'll keep you updated. active

nyc is going to try to assist some of the homeless for the own good, plus an admission of my own brush with a legal issue.





 have to admit that i am of two minds when it comes to this. i believe that the homeless should be entitled to all their rights, as being without a permanent residence should not be a crime. on the other hand, if a person is likely to harm themselves or others it would be best to put them under observation. they should also be receiving psychological and medical help during this time. going to make an admission here. while i was still working, shortly after donna had passed away, i made what was in hindsight a stupid comment which was taken out of context. at least i saw it. due to this, it was reported that i had made a threat and the police, along with human resources were contacted. despite my explanation, i was taken to a local hospital and put into a ward where a psychologist could speak to me. i admit that i really wasn't aware at the time that if the doctor didn't sign my release i could be kept for several days. fortunately, i was able to explain the situation and what i had been saying was a misunderstanding. i was released, but could not return to work until an independent therapist could sign off on me. i was able to return to work a couple of weeks later and the matter was dropped. by that time i only had a month until i retired and it seemed everyone wanted to move on. most of you have never heard this story before, or if you did it might have been a shorter version. i felt this story from nyc was a good way to get into the subject. hope that no one thinks less of me for thishttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/29/nyregion/nyc-mentally-ill-involuntary-custody.html?smid=url-share

shooting in colorado gay bar





 there was a mass shooting last night in colorado springs, co at this time five are confirmed dead and over 18 injured, but those numbers can go up. it's just sad that these events continue to take place. this targeted a particular group, but we see these in schools, malls and grocery stores where the people being killed or injured are just going about their lives. gun violence is an ongoing issue, but sadly the incoming gop house will do nothing about it. this is on the voters who continue to vote against their own interests just to anger the libs. this is on you, so don't bother with the thoughts & prayers.

ultra, the rachel maddow podcast





 listening to ultra, the new rachel maddow podcast. covers the right-wing/pro-hitler movement in america in the late '30s and early '40s. it has the same targets that many of the magaites and the current gop use to split the country.called the america first movement, it's all too familiar, including arming their supporters and planning an insurrection. chapter 5 examines how certain folks in congress call for investigations, not against the movement, but against the justice dept. to investigate them. we can see the playbook.
