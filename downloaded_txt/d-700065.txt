heinrich heine 1797-1856, german poet


the british enlightenment represents "the sociology of virtue," the french "the ideology of reason," the american "the politics of liberty". the british moral philosophers were sociologists as much as philosophers; concerned with man in relation to society, they looked to the social virtues for the basis of a healthy and human society. the french had a more exalted mission: to make reason the governing principle of society as well as mind, to "rationalize, "as is were, the world. the americans, more modestly, sought to create a new "science of politics" that would establish the new republic upon a sound foundation of liberty.

when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science, what ever the matter may be.

john fitzgerald kennedy 1917-1963, 35th president of the united states

my candidate for an ethic to replace the idea of maximizing shareholder value thinking would be building and sharing wealth. why? shareholder value thinking was always about creating wealth. the terminology got in the way, however. the very word value implies an immediacy that in most cases should have no place in the conduct of great business enterprises.

the reward of one who does something lies in something being done for him. this is considered by god as ma'at.

pharao neferhotep i, xiiith dynasty (ca. 1700 b.c.)

far better to be aware that the value opportunity gap difference between current value and potential value is presently in a 50 to 57 percent range and to know the critical actions necessary to close that gap, than to waste time trying to pinpoint the exact underperformance amount. an insecure ceo might be impressed by an unnecessarily complex valuation model. for the rest, the dazzle connotes paralysis by analysis, not progress. precise future estimates exist only in economist' dreams. pragmatic, outperforming top managers emphasize the key actions to narrow the value opportunity gap.

i believe in one god, and no more. i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church, by the roman church, by the greek church, by the turkish church, by the protestant church, not by any church that i know of. my own mind is my own church.
thomas paine 17371809, anglo-american political theorist and writer. opening pages of 'age of reason' (1794)

thus passes away all man's life. men seek rest in a struggle against difficulties; and when they have conquered these, rest becomes insufferable. for we think either of the misfortunes we have or of those which threaten us. and even if we should see ourselves sufficiently sheltered on all sides, weariness of its own accord would not fail to arise from the depths of the heart wherein it has its natural roots and to fill the mind with its poison.

it is therefore quite certain that pity is a natural sentiment which, by moderating in every individual the activity of self-love, contributes to the mutual preservation of the entire species. it is pity that carries us without reflection to the assistance of those we see suffer; pity that, in the state of nature, takes the place of laws, morals, and virtue, with the advantage that no one is tempted to disobey its gentle voice

jean-jacques rousseau 1712-1778, swiss-french philosopher, author, political theorist, and composer whose novels inspired the leaders of the french revolution

the truth is that the value we set upon the opinion of others, and our constant endeavor in respect of it, are each quite out of proportion to any result we may reasonably hope to attain; so that this attention to other peoples attitude may be regarded as a kind of universal mania which every one inherits.
arthur schopenhauer 1788-1860, german post-kantian philosopher, who considered true philosophy as art, and accessible to only a few capable minds, in "quotations on the wisdom of life", chapter iv, section 1, (1886)

virtue depends partly upon training and partly upon practice; you must learn first, and then strengthen your learning by action. if this be true, not only do the doctrines of wisdom help us but the precepts also, which check and banish our emotions by a sort of official decree.
lucius annaeus seneca 1-65, stoa philosopher in "letters to lucilius - on the value of advice" (epistle xciv)

why do we complain of nature? she has shown herself kindly; life, if you know how to use it, is long.
lucius annaeus seneca 1-65, stoa philosopher in "on the shortness of life ( de brevitate vitae)"

horus (civilization) and seth (force) are unified by law.
throne pedestal from lisht, sesostris i, anscient egyptian pharao of the 12th dynasty, middle kingdom, as explained by jan assman, professor of egyptology at the university of heidelberg in 'the mind of egypt' (ca. 1950 b.c.)

thus the wisdom of what rules, and is first and chief in nature, has made it to be according to the private interest and good of everyone to work towards the general good; which if a creature ceases to promote, he is actually so far wanting to himself and ceases to promote his own happiness and welfare... and thus, virtue is the good, and vice the ill of everyone.
the third earl of shaftesbury 1671-1713, english politician and philosopher in 'an inquiry concerning virtue, or merit' (1699)

plate sin with gold, and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks; arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
william shakespeare 1564-1616, playwright and bard, king lear, act 4

all that glitters is not gold. often have you heard that told.
william shakespeare 1564-1616, playwright and bard, the merchant of venice

the purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation; that away men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
william shakespeare 1564-1616, playwright and bard, the tragedy of king richard the second

for every complex problem there is a simple solution that is wrong.
g.b. shaw 1856-1950, irish critic and poet, famous for his 'verbal wit'

lack of money is the root of all evil.
g.b. shaw 1856-1950, irish critic and poet, famous for his 'verbal wit'

people exaggerate the value of things they haven't got: everybody worships truth and unselfishness because they have no experience with them.
g.b. shaw 1856-1950, irish critic and poet, famous for his 'verbal wit'

currencies fluctuate; commodity prices fluctuate. why should we expect earnings to rise in a straight line upward.
william g. shenkir, university of virginia commerce professor who worked for the u.s. fasb in the 1970s

ethics and religion must not stay at home when we go to work.
achille silvestrini, cardinal of the roman curia, may 20th, 2004, at a congress of the union of industrialists of rome, organized under the theme "business, ethics and legality"

how selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest him in the fortune of others and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it. of this kind is pity or compassion, the emotion which we feel for the misery of others when we either see it or are made to conceive it in a very lively matter.... by the imagination we place ourselves in his situation. we enter, as it were, into his body and become in some measure the same person with him.
adam smith 1723-1790, scottish philosopher and economist. opening sentences of :the theory of moral sentiments, 1759

every individual endeavors to employ his capital so that its produce may be of greatest value. he generally neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. he intends only his own security, only his own gain. and he is in this led by an invisible hand to promote an end, which has no part of his intention. by pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.
adam smith 1723-1790, scottish philosopher and economist in: the wealth of nations, 1776

the patrimony which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. the patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hand; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbour is a plain violation of this most sacred property.
adam smith 1723-1790, scottish philosopher and economist in: the wealth of nations, 1776

the unexamined life is not worth living.
socrates 469-399 b.c., ancient greek ethicist-philosopher, apol. 38a

not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued.
socrates 469-399 b.c., ancient greek ethicist-philosopher

as mens habits of mind differ, so that some more readily embrace one form of faith, some another, for what moves one to pray may move another to scoff, i conclude ... that everyone should be free to choose for himself the foundations of his creed, and that faith should be judged only by its fruits.
baruch (or also: benedictus) de spinoza 1632-1676, dutch deductive-rational pantheistic philosopher, founder of the european enlightenment in 'a theologico-political treatise' (1670)

a person is free only insofar as he is in a position at every moment in his life to follow himself.
rudolf steiner 1861-1925, austrian anthroposophic philosopher in: the philosophy of freedom, chapter 9, 1894

you know the value of every merchandise, but you do not know your own value -- that is stupidity....
the sufi path of love, the spiritual teachings of rumi

there is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself.
henri david thoreau 1817-1862, american poet and philosopher

the principle of self-interest rightly understood is not a lofty one, but it is clear and sure. it does not aim at mighty objects, but it attains without excessive exertion all those at which it aims. as it lies within the reach of all capacities, everyone can without difficulty learn and retain it. by its admirable conformity to human weaknesses it easily obtains great dominion; nor is that dominion precarious, since the principle checks one personal interest by another, and uses, to direct the passions, the very same instrument that excites them. 
the principle of self-interest rightly understood produces no great acts of self-sacrifice, but it suggests daily small acts of self-denial. by itself it cannot suffice to make a man virtuous; but it disciplines a number of persons in habits of regularity, temperance, moderation, foresight, self- command; and if it does not lead men straight to virtue by the will, it gradually draws them in that direction by their habits. if the principle of interest rightly understood were to sway the whole moral world, extraordinary virtues would doubtless be more rare; but i think that gross depravity would then also be less common. the principle of interest rightly understood perhaps prevents men from rising far above the level of mankind, but a great number of other men, who were falling far below it, are caught and restrained by it. observe some few individuals, they are lowered by it; survey mankind, they are raised.
i am not afraid to say that the principle of self-interest rightly understood appears to me the best suited of all philosophical theories to the wants of the men of our time, and that i regard it as their chief remaining security against themselves. towards it, therefore, the minds of the moralists of our age should turn; even should they judge it to be incomplete, it must nevertheless be adopted as necessary.
alexis de tocqueville 1805-1859, french social philosopher in 'democracy in america' (1835-1840)(2nd volume, section 2, chapter 8) a highly positive and optimistic account of american government and society

we all want to live. and in large part we make our logic according to what we like. but not having attained our aim and continuing to live is cowardice. this is a thin dangerous line. to die without gaming one's aim is a dog's death and fanaticism.
yamamoto tsunetomo 1659-1710, japanese samurai warrior and buddhist priest(contributed by nate baber)

to permit a large number of men to live free of charge is to encourage laziness and all the disorders that follow; it is to render the condition of the idler preferable to that of the man who works... the race of industrious citizens is replaced by a vile population composed of vagabond beggars free to commit all sorts of crimes.
anne robert jacques turgot 1727-1781, french economic theorist, controller general of finances and philosopher, on 'fondations' in encyclopédie, vii, 75

october: this is one of the particularly dangerous months to invest in stocks. other dangerous months are july, january, september, april, november, may, march, june, december, august and february.
mark twain 1835-1910, american humorist and writer, famous for tom sawyer and huckleberry finn

grief can take care of itself, but to get the full value of joy you must have somebody to share it with.
mark twain 1835-1910, american humorist and writer, famous for tom sawyer and huckleberry finn

all existing things are really one. we regard those that are beautiful and rare as valuable, and those that are ugly as foul and rotten the foul and rotten may come to be transformed into what is rare and valuable, and the rare and valuable into what is foul and rotten. therefore it is said that one vital energy pervades the world. consequently, the sage values oneness.
chuang tzu 389-286 b.c., chinese interpreter of taoism

like migrating gnus the investors follow each other and the analysts. sometimes they encounter a ravine on their journey.
ir. drs. jeroen van der veer, ceo royal dutch/shell group, january 2002

there is only one moral, as there is only one geometry.
voltaire 1694-1778, french philosopher, writer and deist satirist, the embodiment of the 18th-century french enlightenment, a crusader against tyranny and bigotry.

religion must be destroyed among respectable people and left to the canaille large and small, for whom it was made.
voltaire 1694-1778, french philosopher, writer and deist, the embodiment of the 18th-century french enlightenment, a crusader against tyranny and bigotry.

there is no such thing as absolute value in this world. you can only estimate what a thing is worth to you.
charles dudley warner 1829-1900, american writer

and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.
george washington 1732-1799, the first president of the united states in his 'farewell address' (1796)


while luxury and profaneness have been increasing on one hand, on the other, benevolence and compassion toward all forms of human woe have increased in a manner not known before, from the earliest ages of the world.
john wesley 1703-1791, british founder and preacher of the methodist church (ca. 1790)

this 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. the device is inherently of no value to us.

nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.
oscar wilde 1854-1900, anglo-irish dramatist and poet
