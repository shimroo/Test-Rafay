welcome to the salt lake buddhist templewe welcome anyone to attend our services. regular services is schedule to begin on september 15, 2024 starting at 10:00 am with meditation service at 9:00 am.   our next special service will be nehan-e and pet memorial service on february 16th. our templeour sect is called jodo shinshu honganji ha, or nishi honganji. our mother temple and international headquarters are located in kyoto, japan. we are also affiliated with the buddhist churches of america (b.c.a.), with headquarters in san francisco, california. as a member of the salt lake buddhist temple, you are joining the sangha (fellowship of buddhists) in our efforts to support and follow the teachings of jodo shinshu buddhism.as we journey through the 21st century, jodo shinshu buddhism is at a crossroads in its development and expansion in the united states of america. although jodo shinshu has been in the united states since 1899, we are still in the beginning stages of truly becoming a part of the larger religious landscape of this country. through the personal sacrifice and determination of the japanese immigrants and their descendants, our temple exists today. however, we now find ourselves living in a changed environment from that of our founders. to meet these ever-changing needs, we must develop a new methodology by combining the sacrifice and determination of our pioneer members with new ideas, to ensure the continuation of jodo shinshu in our present community.jodo shinshu buddhism has much to offer in teaching us about living a spiritually awakened life, in the midst of  ordinary circumstances. to follow the nembutsu path is to live a life of gratitude for amida buddha's infinite wisdom and compassion. our temple is here to help us understand how we may express appreciation for the  wondrous gift of shinjin bestowed upon us.within these webpages we will explain the methodology and functions of the temple and provide an overview summary of our history, beliefs, etiquette, etc. our temple exists for you. please play an active role in the life of our temple.
