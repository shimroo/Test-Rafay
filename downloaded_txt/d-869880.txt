this is the place to find out about the “ugly duckling” in the aircooled
vw lineup, the type 4. produced from the summer of 1968 until the end of
the 1974 model year it never grew to be the success it was supposed to be.
volkswagen’s edsel, so to speak, although the final production tally of
about 370,000 cars is nothing to sneeze at.
nowadays they are very hard to find and maintain and somehow the antique vw
community seems to have a certain disdain for a car that has amenities like
standard gas-electric heater booster, fully automatic transmission,
electrical fuel injection and, anathema to any die-hard old vw enthusiast,
a unibody construction that does not follow the old “body on platform
chassis” philosophy.
