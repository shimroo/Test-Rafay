about atpe
founded by educators for educators, atpe is the leading educators’ association in texas and the largest independent educators’ association in the united states. atpe exists to serve the needs of texas teachers, paraprofessionals, administrators and all public education employees and fights for our schools on the local, state and national levels.
the atpe philosophy is simple. we believe it takes everyone working together to improve texas public schools. we work with all stakeholders in public education, regardless of political party or platform. we work collaboratively with all sides of any debate to find the best solution. and we represent the priorities defined by our members—working educators who are passionate about texas public schools.






why join atpe?
when you choose atpe, you’re choosing an organization led by working texas educators who understand how hard it is to be public educators today. our mission is to support you so you can focus on what matters most: your students.
