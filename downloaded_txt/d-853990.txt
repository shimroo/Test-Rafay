a game changer – dr. palmer’s 
1200 studies – truth will prevail ebook










click on image to follow link




download dr. palmer’s historic work, an ebook titled 1200 studies- truth will prevail. it is hands down the most comprehensive exposé on vaccines ever produced.
the latest updated version 3.0 was released january 12th, 2024 and is available here
dr. palmer took on this project and mission because of his intense desire to educate people about the potential risks of vaccines and the troubling changes we have seen in the decline of the health of our children over the last 30 years. this decline has coincided with the significant increase in vaccine doses added to the schedule during that period of time (from 23 doses, to 72 doses now by age 18; 90 doses if parents give the covid-19 shot to their children each year). he feels that parents and adults should have the ability to make an educated decision about something as important as vaccines. this is very difficult to do, especially since the advent of the controlled algorithms by search engines, censorship by social media and tech giants and the insidious cancel culture of today. that’s where 1200 studies can be a game changer.
 1200 studies is updated periodically, and now contains 766 pages of excerpts and summaries from over 1,500 studies, published in journals representing 45 different medical and scientific disciplines and authored by thousands of scientists, contradicting what we are and have been told about vaccines. these are unbiased, objective studies by researchers who are not funded by vaccine manufacturers. and, if there’s anything we have learned from the covid-19 vaccine roll-outs, the bias and conflicts of interest run deep.
it is designed to be a research or reference tool, as i created it as a pdf with easy-to-use navigation tools, search capability and links directly to the studies on pubmed. the entire table of contents are links directly to the page in the book on that topic. and every page has the links directly to the study on pubmed or the source journal.

the focus of wellness doc is to empower people to fix the underlying pathology that is keeping them from making significant and effective long term changes to their behavior. in order for that to happen a person has to change their paradigm (beliefs), by understanding the following two powerful and compelling questions; why? and how does it benefit me and my family for the rest of our lives?
bestselling author and success mentor stephen covey said it well when he said:
“if you want small improvements, change your behavior. if you want massive improvements, change your paradigm.”
