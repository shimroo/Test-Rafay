for profit? no, we are not a for-profit university. herzing university is a nonprofit educational institution as of 2015.  when can i start? we have 6 start dates spread across full year-round study, resulting in start dates about every two months. semesters last for 16 weeks (about 4 months) each.you can view our academic calendar to see specific upcoming general start dates and other important dates to remember. we offer rolling admissions with no application deadlines.keep in mind start dates can vary by program and certain programs have a limited number of openings for new students. your best bet is to contact admissions to confirm how soon you can enroll and start your new career path.  does herzing university offer evening/night classes? availability of evening or night classes varies by program and class type. general education courses can typically be completed online on your schedule. in some cases, certain classwork or exams may require a set log-in time.we work hard to fully prepare you for success in your work and provide as much flexibility as possible to achieve the right school-life balance. our admissions team can help you determine how much coursework you can potentially complete in nights and evenings.  do i need a master’s degree to get a dnp? no, you don’t need a master of science in nursing (msn) to begin working towards a doctor of nursing practice (dnp). current licensed registered nurses who hold a bachelor of science in nursing may apply for our bsn to dnp program in a specialization of their choosing and begin working toward a dnp right away – without having to earn an msn first.there are a few considerations to keep in mind:if your primary goal is to pursue a specialization such as family nurse practitioner (fnp), earning a dnp is not currently required. you can choose an msn-fnp program and earn the master’s degree education you need to become an fnp.it takes more time to complete a bsn to dnp curriculum compared to an msn alternative. in the case of fnp, the msn-fnp program takes 20 months compared to 32 months in the bsn to dnp-fnp program.1if your primary goal is to earn the terminal degree in nursing and reach the top of the field, a bsn to dnp program offers less time and lower cost than earning an msn and dnp separately. once again using the case of fnp, a bsn to dnp-fnp program takes less time (32 months) than earning an msn-fnp and dnp separately (20 months each = 40 total months).contact our admissions team and we can help you determine what degree pathway is right for your lifestyle and overall career goals.1. all program length estimates reflect average time to complete for full-time students and may vary. we strive to help you learn at a pace that’s right for you.  is herzing a good

the program and location.but don’t take our word for it! hear from current and graduated students who agree that herzing helped them attain their educational and career goals.  does the cybersecurity program include any math courses? there are general education courses in math you may need to complete depending on your prior education.however, mathematics is not a significant part of a career in cybersecurity, and our core cybersecurity curriculum does not include any math courses.  where is herzing university online located? our online division is based out of our home office in downtown
