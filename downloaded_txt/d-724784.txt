what we do
quizbowl is an academic competition format pitting one team of up to four players against another team of up to four players. while a question describing a certain event, person, phenomenon, or entity is being read, the players individually compete to see who can buzz in first with the correct answer to the tossup. teams can then work together to answer bonus questions when a member of their team gets the tossup right.
quizbowl is similar to formats like academic decathlon, academic olympiad, knowledge master, and the tv show jeopardy! in that it rewards knowledge to those most prepared to demonstrate it. many of our past and present team members have utilized this knowledge to win large sums of money in game shows like jeopardy! and who wants to be a millionaire?
although quizbowl generally covers areas that are academic in nature (such as literature, history, sciences like biology and chemistry and physics, fine arts, religion, mythology, philosophy, geography, social sciences like psychology and economics and linguistics, and current events), we also play on questions geared towards popular culture, such as music, movies, sports, and general knowledge. we travel throughout california to places like san diego, claremont, pasadena, and stanford, in addition to national tournaments in places like chicago, new york, atlanta, and ann arbor, and raise money for our trips by hosting tournaments.
