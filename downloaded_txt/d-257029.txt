introduction

welcome to one of the most fun, interesting,
        informative and enjoyable web sites yet.  click on one of the topics in the left hand
        table of contents, or one of the links above the summaries below.

dune
        buggies

this is the newest area of the site,
        and my latest obsession.  the term dune buggies means different
        things, to different people, in this case, dune buggies means fiberglass
        meyers manx or manx copies.  for other vehicles that are frequently
        mistaken for dune buggies, please see my "sandrailing"
        area.   
family

this area is our family area that is full of pictures of
        our recent wedding, pictures of our boys, details of our intentions to adopt a baby, and
        much more.
racing

this area is set aside for my love for auto racing.
          the area is split into nascar, touring car, and indy car racing.  check out
        some of the pictures i have from the touring car races held in portland, oregon in 1997.
resume

check out some of the cool web stuff i've created, oh
        yea, and my resume too.
sandrailing

my wife and i bought a sandrail in the summer of
        98, and have had nothing but a blast every time we go.  check out
        the project of building the 2275cc engine.  for links of places in oregon to go sandrailing, links for
        weather in the same duning areas, and for technical information regarding the building of
        a stroker engine, check out this area.
volkswagens

this is what brought my beautiful wife and i together,
        our love for these cool cars.  as you can see in the volkswagen area, we have both
        owned our share of these cars.  look here for other volkswagen links and pictures of
        other real nice cars.
