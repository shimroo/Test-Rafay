tripping the trinity river
by larry hodge
on the edge of the dallas/fort worth metroplex, not far from dfw airport, kayakers paddle lazily by the lush green island in the middle of the trinity river as 
four wild turkeys in succession blast off and fly right over their heads, flapping mightily, heading for the dense forest on the other side.

texas politics:

the big rich

book review by steve labinski
texas loves big stories about itself, and nothing reads bigger than the ups and downs of its most famous entreprenuers, the big four oilmen h.l. hunt, clint murchison, roy cullen and sid richardson.  containing interesting biographies, the book eventually wades into deep water by trying to pinpoint texas' political origins.

lovin' that lone star flag

book review by alfredo alvarez
texans have never been shy about pride in their state. so it's high time for someone to offer, in the form of a large coffee table book, examples of some of the many ways that texans show and display their state's famous flag. 






for the best barbecue in texas, go to wyoming 
by rick vanderpool

texas joints (under the pretense of photographing the signs) as time, funds, and my arteries 
will allow, it was with no small measure of anticipation that i departed lubbock, the morning of june 24,
on a quest that would have amounted to finding the end of the 
rainbow - in gustatory terms, that is.
