please spend a few moments learning about us, where we are, and what we have in our garden this year.  if you plan to be in the upstate of south carolina during the blooming season, we invite you to come view over two acres in bloom!  the season never lasts quite long enough, so we love to show off our garden to as many flower lovers as possible during the summer.  so, please, drop by, pull up a chair under the pecan tree, and take in the sights!





 we welcome you to our garden, and thank you for stopping by to see our selections.  please look through our on-line catalog, with a great selection of old favorites, and newer varieties too. our garden is open by appointment only.  but please feel free to call or email anytime - we can usually accommodate your visit during the week or weekend with just a little notice.  
let us know if you have any questions - we are always happy to discuss your daylily needs!  
please call or text jerry at (864) 420-0141  or email info@daylilyj.com
