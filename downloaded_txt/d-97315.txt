  food allergy

it’s a disease not a diet
donate





  get involved 









                    15 and fare
                     
15 and the mahomies foundation and fare have partnered to create 15 and fare, bringing the fare neighborhoods initiative and fare’s food allergy academy training to the kansas city area.








                    ready to act
                     
food allergy is not a diet; it’s a disease that can cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening type of allergic reaction. epinephrine is the only drug that stops anaphylaxis—and now there is a needle-free option. be ready to act, so you can save a life.








                    fare patient registry
                     
join over 14,000 individuals and families managing food allergies who are sharing their food allergy stories and making a critical difference, helping to speed the search for new treatments and informing life-changing improvements in patient care.
