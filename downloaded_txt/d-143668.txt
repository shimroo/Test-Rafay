modern care for a modern world<p>​<strong class="ms-rteforecolor-2" style="">advertorial</strong></p><p><br></p><p>at its most basic, health care has not changed much—a skilled clinician diagnosing and treating ailments is as old as time. but everything else has changed, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the skilled nursing industry.</p><p><a href="http&#58;//tapestryhealth.com/" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="60b7cbf17788425491b2d083" target="_blank"><img src="/articles/publishingimages/2025/tapestryhealth.png" class="ms-rteposition-2" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;200px;height&#58;100px;" /></a>today’s nursing homes are expected to accept higher acuity patients with multiple co-morbidities, more psychiatric patients, and more patients that a few years ago would not even be considered for discharge. and if they are unable to provide the necessary care and the patient is re-hospitalized, there are fines and reputation issues that can impact the facility for years. add to that more regulatory and compliance issues than ever before, along with the cost of maintaining a modern facility, and it is easy to see why america is losing skilled nursing facilities at a frightening pace.</p><p>one solution can be found in technology, and the pressure is mounting from all sides for snfs to upgrade their technological capabilities. patients, families, and, most importantly, hospitals are placing more weight on the level of advanced technology available to ensure the highest level of care.</p><p>every facility in the country has been forced to look at technology not as an advancing foe but as the potential savior. yet adoption is still dangerously slow. in many facilities, half-measures provide the illusion of advanced technology while never fully embracing it.</p><p>an administrator needs look no further than their electronic health records (ehrs). while you may have a computerized system, that system is only as good as the data that populates it. are your nurses taking vital signs and then entering them into the system at a later time? are all those entries accurate? how often is patient a’s data entered as patient b? and what are you doing with the data? who is looking at it? who is turning that data into usable directions that will improve care and boost efficiency among the nursing staff?</p><p>telemedicine is another valuable tool that too often passes for a facility’s primary technology. assuming that your telemedicine provider is keeping up with the latest technology, it can be a valuable, even life-saving, tool. but it is no longer enough.</p><p>in the current health care environment, a skilled nursing facility needs the most advanced technology available. most facilities conflate that with the most advanced technology they can afford, and that may be one of the biggest reasons for failing to take advantage of what is available.</p><p>the other is simply fear. learning something new can be difficult. and new technologies can be surpassed by even newer ones. if your nurses need a 10-year-old to program the tv (and many of us do), they might not be quick to embrace technology. it is incumbent on the facility to research and install technology that is both advanced, simple to use, and one that will stay current. companies like tapestryhealth that know the snf industry and have been at the forefront of vetting and incorporating technology specifically geared for the day-to-day operations of a snf are delivering exactly that.</p><p>technology, like continual patient monitoring, not only eliminates human error—no more heart rates written on a notepad for later entry into the ehr—but collects data non-stop and can alert a nurse to any sudden change that might indicate the need for medical intervention.</p><p>tapestryhealth is one company that utilizes that data and similar data from thousands of patients in hundreds of facilities from coast to coast to create a pool of information, treatment data, and outcomes that can be used to power predictive modeling programs. these advanced systems can predict with startling accuracy potential outbreaks of dangerous infections and other conditions that often lead to hospitalizations and sometimes even to the death of a patient, as much as 72 hours in advance of any visible symptoms. that has been proven to be enough in many cases to prepare the facility and the patient and avoid any acceleration of the issue and potential hospitalizations. moreover, advances in radar wave technology assure complete privacy and 100 percent contactless monitoring.</p><p>tapestryhealth’s technology solutions are vetted by nursing home professionals—doctors, nurses, administrators, and operations executives from within the industry, who are uniquely suited to evaluate each one and make sure it delivers solutions specific to the needs and the environment of a nursing home. and tapestryhealth doesn’t charge the facility anything for its services. everything they provide is covered by public or private insurance. what’s more, tapestryhealth guarantees to keep its customers updated with their latest services at no cost.</p><p>while these devices and services may sound terribly complicated and may even sound like nurses are being asked to learn a whole new health care language, the fact is that the learning curve is dramatically short and easy. health care in nursing homes is not what is changing; it still comes down to a skilled, compassionate clinician providing bedside care to an elderly patient. what technology has done is elevate the quality, effectiveness, and timing of that care to a lifesaving level.</p><p>to understand more about technology in skilled nursing facilities, and how it can impact the level of care, reputation, and profitability, contact tapestryhealth at (203) 721-6822 or visit <a href="https&#58;//tapestryhealth.com/"

advanced technology available. 5 steps to reconfigure skilled nursing facilities to assisted living facilities<p>​<img src="/articles/publishingimages/2025/skaalencbrf-1.jpg" alt="resident room with comfortable space with more windows" class="ms-rteposition-2" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;200px;height&#58;200px;" />staffing has long been one of the most pressing challenges in the long-term care industry. chronic shortages are a persistent issue, and the new centers for medicare &amp; medicaid services (cms) regulations, which increase staffing requirements, have only added to the complexity. as providers grapple with these demands, one strategy gaining traction is the reconfiguration of skilled nursing facilities (snfs) into spaces with less intensive staffing needs, such as assisted living facilities (alfs). this approach not only reduces operational costs but also revitalizes the care offerings of long-term care campuses. here’s a guide to successfully transition a skilled nursing facility to an assisted living model.</p><p><strong>step 1&#58; define program goals and engage stakeholders</strong><br>the first step is to set clear program goals and define the elements you want to incorporate into the new environment. to ensure a resident-centered and operationally efficient design, include input from both residents and staff.</p><p>key considerations&#58;<br></p><ul><li>target resident demographics&#58; what level of care will the facility provide? will it cater to residents with early cognitive impairments or focus on general assisted living?</li><li>licensing requirements&#58; collaborate with state authorities to understand the licensing processes and requirements for transitioning your building(s).</li><li>operational balance&#58; work closely with staff to align care and service offerings. for instance&#58;</li><ul><li>how will food service staff interact with residents and colleagues?</li><li>what meal delivery methods will be used, and will residents participate in cooking activities?</li><li>how can efficient layouts minimize staffing needs?</li></ul></ul><p>collaborating with an architect to address these elements is crucial. owners should clearly outline expectations for critical systems such as wander management; nurse call systems; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac); and emergency power backup. additionally, plans for new safety procedures, including updated fire safety protocols, must be established to ensure compliance during construction.</p><strong><img src="/articles/publishingimages/2025/skaalencbrf-2.jpg" alt="bump-outs, accent lighting, and resting areas in corridors " class="ms-rteposition-2" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;200px;height&#58;200px;" />step 2&#58; assess the current facility</strong><p>to make informed decisions, conduct a thorough evaluation of the existing facility or campus to determine its suitability for the new use. building codes and design requirements for assisted living differ significantly from those for skilled nursing facilities.</p><p>structural modifications&#58;<br></p><ul><li>corridor widths&#58; assisted living facilities do not require the 8-foot-wide corridors mandated for snfs. explore opportunities to repurpose this space to enhance unit layouts.</li><li>kitchenettes&#58; adding kitchenettes to units is a common upgrade. plan how to reconfigure existing spaces to accommodate these features along with living and dining areas.</li><li>property layout&#58; aim to move away from the institutional feel of snfs by introducing design elements to enhance the architectural rhythm, such as wall bump-outs and accent lighting in corridors to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.</li></ul><p>safety and compliance&#58;<br></p><ul><li>fire protection&#58; unlike snfs, community-based residential facilities (cbrfs) often require smoke detectors connected to a central alarm system in each resident-occupied space. address any gaps to meet these requirements.</li><li>evacuation standards&#58; depending on the physical and cognitive capabilities of a resident’s ability to self-evacuate, assisted living facilities may require residents to be ambulatory and capable of self-preservation during emergencies. adjustments to window operation, door hardware, and resident room layouts may be necessary to meet these standards.</li><li>lighting and ventilation&#58; evaluate the need for additional windows or daylighting to create a comfortable environment for residents in shared spaces.</li></ul><p>compliance with building codes is paramount. states often adopt the international building code (ibc) but may also have unique requirements. engage an architect familiar with local codes to navigate these complexities and consult with the authority having jurisdiction (ahj) early in the process.</p><p><strong>step 3&#58; avoid common pitfalls</strong><br>transitioning a skilled nursing facility to an assisted living model is a complex process with potential obstacles. here are some key pitfalls to watch for&#58;<br></p><ul><li>licensing and timeline oversights&#58; ensure that licensing requirements are well understood and that submissions to the ahj are timely to avoid construction and licensure delays.</li><li>resident disruptions&#58; minimize disruptions during renovations by creating viewing areas, offering guided tours, and maintaining operational support spaces. consider temporarily relocating residents who may struggle with the changes because of physical challenges or emotional distress.</li><li>mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (mep) systems&#58; understand how these systems are integrated throughout the building. proper planning is essential to keep them operational in occupied areas during construction.</li><li>lack of coordination&#58; engage with the ahj early to confirm requirements, seek variances where needed, and secure consensus with code officials on the overall plan.</li><li>construction oversights&#58; obtain approvals and inspections at critical milestones. for example, ensure equivalent construction ratings are maintained and avoid exceeding allowable building areas.</li></ul><p><strong>step 4&#58; foster clear communication and collaboration</strong><br>effective communication is the cornerstone of a successful transition. establish clear lines of communication among owners, architects, construction managers, and code officials to&#58;<br></p><ul><li>clearly define licensing requirements and building modifications.</li><li>manage cost issues and set realistic budgets.</li><li>document responsibilities to avoid misunderstandings and overlaps.</li></ul><p>owners play a pivotal role in leading these efforts, ensuring all parties are aligned and focused on meeting project objectives.</p><p><strong><img

success</strong><br>transforming a skilled nursing facility into an assisted living model is a multifaceted endeavor that requires careful planning and execution. by defining program goals, assessing the facility’s capabilities, avoiding common pitfalls, and fostering collaboration, you can navigate the complexities of this process with confidence.</p><p>this transition offers a unique opportunity

needs, such as assisted living facilities. how to structure your compliance program<p><img src="/articles/publishingimages/2025/nurse_paperwork.jpg" class="ms-rteposition-2" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;200px;height&#58;200px;" />​nursing, assisted living, and post-acute facilities have long been an area of scrutiny by the office on inspector general (oig) as they are high-risk areas. it is important that an organization have a formal compliance program as proactive and preventive; a structure to address issues; and as a mitigating factor should compliance violations be identified by regulatory agencies.</p><p>oig recognizes a common structure for compliance programs centered around seven elements. they are&#58;<br></p><ul><li><strong>written policies, procedures, and standards of conduct</strong></li></ul><ol><li>how accessible are they to all employees?</li><li>how often are they reviewed?</li><li>what is the process/procedure for review and approval?</li><li>are they written in understandable language?</li></ol><p>as an example, every policy is subject to review every three years. however, they can be revised at any time. front-line employees who actually work with the policies should be free and encouraged to make revision recommendations. as policies may impact areas outside of the department owner, an interdisciplinary committee can review them to avoid conflicts and also provide ideas to strengthen them.</p><ul><li><strong>designated compliance officer and compliance committe</strong>e</li></ul><ol><li>does the compliance officer report to the ceo directly with independent access to the board?</li><li>the compliance officer should not lead or report to the entity’s legal or financial functions.</li></ol><p>a compliance committee of designated board members meets on a quarterly basis with a standing agenda. the only member of management present is the compliance officer or its staff so that issues can be presented and openly discussed without management interference or filters.<br></p><ul><li><strong>effective training for success</strong></li></ul><ol><li>identify required training by regulatory and accrediting bodies.</li><li>what training is required? what should be conducted for all employees annually?</li><li>how is effectiveness measured?</li></ol><p>compliance can also develop custom-designed training to address specific reoccurring issues in identified departments. an example is one for health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa) incidents with identification of their root cause and corrective/preventive actions. the staff usually appreciate the effort and attention shown to help them.<br></p><ul><li><strong>effective lines of communication</strong></li></ul><ol><li>have a variety of reporting mechanisms that can be used to report concerns or incidents.</li><li>how are the lines communicated? are employees aware of them?</li></ol><p>a hotline incident management reporting system can help the compliance officer track, manage, assign, quickly access and review cases and develop metrics of where to place compliance priorities. this should have an anonymous reporting feature and be available to the public for reporting access.<br></p><ul><li><strong>enforcing standards&#58; consequences and incentives</strong></li></ul><ol><li>they should be publicized and made available.</li><li>consistently applied and enforced.</li></ol><p>adherence to compliance standards can be a rated factor in performance evaluations.<br></p><ul><li><strong>internal auditing and monitoring</strong></li></ul><ol><li>be proactive and reactive.</li><li>communications and approach should be working as a business partner with managers for quality and process improvements.</li></ol><p>compliance should work as a team member with other departments in identifying and monitoring, through audits, opportunities for process improvements that can mitigate risks, make employees’ jobs easier, and increase revenue. one example, in an ambulatory care setting, is improving patient wait times.<br></p><ul><li><strong>responding to detected offenses and developing corrective action initiatives</strong></li></ul><ol><li>processes and resources should exist to address them.</li><li>investigations, corrective actions, and resolutions should be prompt</li></ol><p>standard timelines should be developed for investigations to be completed. points-of-contacts in departments should be identified to whom incidents should be sent.</p><p><img src="/articles/publishingimages/2025/robert-rohr.jpg" alt="robert rohr" class="ms-rteposition-2" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;175px;height&#58;175px;" />this model provides a recognized structure for preventing, addressing, and resolving compliance issues in an organization. it is flexible in how organizations choose to develop programs to address them within available resources.</p><p>an annual compliance plan should be developed with the activities and their goals to support each element. an excellent guide for ideas can be found in <em>measuring compliance program effectiveness&#58; a resource guide,</em> hcca-oig compliance effectiveness roundtable meeting&#58; january 17,

identified by regulatory agencies. health plan focused value-based care in nursing homes<p><strong class="ms-rteforecolor-2">advertorial</strong><br></p><p>​provider partners is a value-based care (vbc) company singularly focused on nursing homes, assisted living facilities (alf), and personal-care homes. provider partners offers services in three lanes&#58; i-snp, ie-snp, and aco-reach. from my perspective as the founder of provider partners, the vbc model creates a real opportunity to better align the wants and needs of residents, their families, nursing home operators, the health plan, and cms. that’s a tough combination of constituencies to please at the same time.</p><h3>what makes vbc models work?</h3><p><img src="/articles/publishingimages/740%20x%20740/0120_news1.jpg" class="ms-rteposition-2" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;200px;height&#58;200px;" />models of care that align success metrics with outcomes create powerful incentives to keep individuals well and reduce the need for costly services. a typical inpatient hospitalization costs provider partners $8,000 - $15,000. a complex stay, such as with a trach and ventilator, can cost over $100,000.</p><p>vbc models are successful when they identify and deal with issues early. it certainly costs a lot more to provide the staffing and enhanced level of intense services that can identify ailments as they are germinating, yet still minor. we employ a team of nurse practitioners and rn case managers who supplement those services provided by the attending physician, specialists, and nursing facility team. it’s an expensive proposition to hire, train, teach, and monitor the activities of this large group. we don’t bill for their services and their activities do not conflict with those of a primary care physician.</p><p>trying to monitor every individual to achieve early detection and intervention requires close attention to leading indicators of changes of condition. a tool that is essential to this oversight is one that delivers targeted data analytics, such as real time medical systems. obtaining clear concise data in real time is a key early warning signal that helps us reduce admissions and readmissions in skilled nursing facilities.</p><h3>what does this accomplish?</h3><p>frequent hands-on interaction that complements and enhances that of the primary care team provides a dramatically greater opportunity to catch those changes in condition early before they reach critical mass. our model doesn’t revolve around decisions about whether to approve services—it focuses on making many high intensity services unnecessary by dealing with illness at that earlier stage.</p><p>this approach has been proven by provider partners and other vbc entities to improve outcomes and quality of care. nursing home and alf residents and their families experience much higher satisfaction for two simple reasons—greater interaction with the clinical team and fewer urgent trips for emergency services. overall costs are significantly reduced. not only are direct medical costs reduced but so are the affiliated costs such as transportation expenses. all of this is measurable.</p><h3>what are some challenges? </h3><p>provider partners is owned and managed by former owners and operators of nursing home and assisted living facilities. we partner with facilities as a true value-added service. we must communicate and coordinate with the facility operator, primary care physician, administrator, director of nursing, and medical director.&#160; this is our true secret sauce. building rapport at all levels and really knowing our members is what makes this work. that requires training, reinforcement, and support from the facility and provider partners leadership.</p><h3>what about non-hospital services?</h3><p>trends in nursing home care over the past decade clearly demonstrate a need for non- hospital services that can be provided, when possible, in the facility. nursing home administrators and directors of nursing covet relationships with behavioral health providers, wound care specialists, and therapy vendors. those vendors want to attain a certain level of service utilization to make it worth their while to come to a facility.&#160;</p><p>one of the challenges to managing a vbc model is attaining a balance between “routine” follow-up visits and reasonable medical necessity criteria. there is a significant degree of excessive “routine” specialty visits for nursing home residents who are quite stable or have disorders that would no longer benefit from ongoing regular follow up. efforts to address these “affordability” issues create the ongoing need for monitoring and engagement by vbc health plans. this process greatly reduces the frequency of medicare fraud, waste, and abuse issues.</p><h3>summary</h3><p>experienced clinicians working in the value-based care environment are fully committed to creating a high standard of care for our most vulnerable populations. we strongly believe that this model provides the best opportunity to align incentives in order to do right by our members. provider partners is dedicated to working with long term care providers to improve quality and allow them to participate in the share of savings that is created.</p><p><img
