about




over my career, i've had the honor of designing, building, and launching some amazing digital experiences. i had the opportunity to work side by side with lebron and kobe to develop beautiful websites for nike. i spent an entire year rebranding a country by the name of belize. i spent drunk evenings in london with the world's top beatboxer making fantastically fun music videos for dolby laboratories. made a guest appearance on china's cctv creating apps for robots that appeared to be ready to take over the world. and helped create websites for nasa's first rover visit to the red planet of mars. i would never have been able to achieve it without having had the gumption and motivation to live in wonderful cities like san francisco, new york, seattle, and minneapolis... taking opportunities at some of the best ad agencies, companies, and tech startups in the world while meeting a variety of individuals along the way whom i consider to be life long friends.but after years of free world travel and countless extravagant dinners, i grew tired of watching ad agencies throw their clients' money around more liberally than a frisbee at burning man. it was this archaic agency formula that lead me to found humdinger & sons with fellow ad vet, andrew berg. we're proud (and more importantly, invigorated) to be turning the traditional creative agency model on its head and to have a focus on helping emerging tech-minded brands, products, and services gain a leading and lasting edge in today’s ever-changing, multi-platform landscape.i have been maintaining this personal portfolio since 1997. it started on a green acer aspire running windows 95 using notepad, a cracked version of photoshop 3, and ws-ftp. since that time i’ve had a front-row seat in our digital revolution and wouldn’t change it for the world.
