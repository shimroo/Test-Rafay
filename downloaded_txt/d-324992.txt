located in caledonia, new york, just half an hour from downtown rochester and an hour from downtown buffalo, caledonia country club offers one of the most unique and exciting golf experiences in western new york. the course is an 18-hole, 6200-yard from the whites and 6500-yard from the blues, par-72 test that features fully watered and manicured fairways, lightning-fast greens, and a scenic layout centered around malloch's hill, the legendary rise that overlooks the course.
although caledonia is a private club, the public is invited to play on mondays and tuesdays. this helps to keep our membership fees at a level that represents the best golf bargain offered by any private club in the area, while allowing players from other clubs to enjoy a quality golf course at a low price. our monday and tuesday special of greens fees and cart for $38 (with lunch) is tough to beat.
our goal is to provide our members with a golf course that challenges the best players while remaining accessible to the average player. considering the response from the golf community, it looks like we've reached that goal.
the best players in the state have discovered caledonia country club. caledonia played host to the 1995 new york state senior ladies amateur championship. the annual bob weitzel two-man scratch bestball tournament draws some of the top amateur golfers in the state.
but we also know how to have fun. throughout the golf season, our tournament schedule is filled with events like mixed scotch tournaments which bring the gentlemen and the ladies together for some friendly competition, ladies days for the women and stag days for the men. there are also social events throughout the year.
