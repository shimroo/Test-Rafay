client review















no one but nicole nguyen could have handled my case with such passion, care and concern. from the minute i met her, i knew i was in great hands and that she would fight for me. her depth of knowledge in employment law was not only impressive, but she gave me a sense of peace.
a. thomas










civil rights are at the core of who we are. we deliberately champion employee rights to secure justice for our clients, educate workers about wrongful workplaces, and set a standard in the community for a better society. in short, we believe that everyone benefits when an employee holds an employer accountable. and we help employees do just that.
we are leaders and pioneers in employment law. founding partner don sessions started only representing employees in the 1980s, decades before other orange county attorneys did so. from discrimination to harassment to unpaid wages and more, there’s not a single type of employment case that we can’t handle for you.
our attorneys have taught ten different law school and university courses as well as authored around 1,000 published newspaper and magazine articles. we always consider your best interest when we take your case. and we give our all to get you the best possible result. if we can’t reach a settlement with your past employer that is acceptable to you, we’re never afraid to go to trial. when that happens, we have the experience and resources to do things the right way.
common types of cases we handle
we handle all types of employment law cases for employees, but the following are some of the most common:

wrongful termination
workplace discrimination
sexual harassment
unpaid overtime
retaliation
unpaid wages
leaves of absence
whistleblower cases

we will do everything we can to help you
every attorney at sessions & kimball is dedicated to helping you – we don’t do this for just the money. we take all our cases on a contingency fee basis, so you’ll never pay us fees upfront or out of your pocket. more than 99% of our cases resolve before they ever go to trial, and well over half resolve without even having to file a lawsuit, which saves you time, stress, and money. we have won more than 200 million dollars for our clients over the years. opposing attorneys, judges, and former clients all refer friends and family to us because of our confidence, compassion, commitment, reputation, and success. we will make sure we do everything in our power to get you the best recovery in the best way for you—individually. speak with one of our attorneys to see how we can help vindicate your rights. contact us today to schedule your free consultation.
