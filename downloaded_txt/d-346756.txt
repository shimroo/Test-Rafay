i love motorcycles and have been
    riding them for 30+ years. i started with a honda 305 and have since had
    many. my first goldwing was a 1984 1200 aspencade and after alot of
    years and 109k miles it was time for a new one. i purchased my 98 wing
    brand new and put more then 150k miles on it
    until some worthless useless dirtbag did a hot
    and run on me and totaled. i purchased another 98 se same color from my
    buddy and currently have some 70k miles on it and adding more daily.
    sadly that bike also suffered a
    accident so i am not riding an 1800.




 




personal interests
motorcycles
