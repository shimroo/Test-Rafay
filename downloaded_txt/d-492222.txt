acknowledgement of country



jingeri! at benowa we would like to acknowledge the kombumerri people, the salt water people who are the traditional custodians of the land on which we grow and learn. we pay our respect to their elders, past, present and emerging. we are proud to be surrounded by, and connected to, the nerang river and the unique flora and fauna that we have the privilege to care for, and live within.
our barna jarjums (students) proudly wear the bilin bilin (king parrot) on our uniforms as our emblem. the bilin bilin represents loyalty and curiosity – qualities we endeavour to pursue each day.
