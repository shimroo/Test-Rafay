(snowdonia) grade: moderate to challengingseason: mar to oct from: £1020 explore all walking holidays in waleswalking in waleswales has long been a popular destination for avid walkers and adventurers, due to its unspoilt beauty but relative accessibility. most famous is undoubtedly eryri national park (snowdonia) with yr wyddfa (snowdon) taking pride of place, but yr wyddfa really is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to finding wonderful walks. more about welsh place names in our destination guide.celtic trails offers more coastal walks in wales than anything else and with very good reason. wales has 870 miles of coastline and almost all of it is unspoilt and spectacularly beautiful. in 2012, the wales coastal path was opened, making wales the first country in the world to offer a footpath around the entirety of its coastline and allowing walkers unlimited access to its wonderful scenery. if you don’t have the time to do it all, there are plenty of shorter options, with the pembrokeshire coastal path being the most popular.those looking for more mountainous terrain should head up to north wales for the really dramatic peaks, a number of which are included on glyndwr’s way. alternatively for broader but nonetheless challenging mountains, try the beacons way in south wales.finally, if you’re looking for a more moderate walk featuring charming market towns and some local history, head for the borders. offa’s dyke, the wye valley walk and our llangollen break all offer plenty of each. view from dinas bran over the vale of llangollenbest time to visit waleswales is one of the milder parts of the uk and can be visited at any time of the year, however it is worth noting that it does experience high rainfall and cool temperatures, particularly in late autumn and winter. for this reason the best months to visit are between mid march and late october.north wales is generally cooler, often experiencing wet and cold winters, particularly in the high ground around eryri (snowdonia). south wales on the other hand is usually warmer and dryer and is the safer option during autumn and early spring.the main school holiday period in the uk runs for 6 weeks from mid july to the end of august, which can make certain touristy spots, particularly around the coast, quite busy. if you would like to travel in summer but avoid crowds, we would recommend travelling in june, early july or early september. how to get to walesby plane: wales has just one international airport, cardiff international airport, which flies to a small number of destinations in europe. this includes amsterdam, which can be a useful transfer point. from cardiff airport, there is a bus service into cardiff city centre where you can connect onto other buses or trains.alternatively, it may be easier to fly into an english airport. london heathrow and london gatwick are approximately 2-3 hours from south wales by either car, bus or train. bristol airport is less than an hour from south wales and also has good public transport connections. if you are visiting north wales, then your nearest airports are manchester or birmingham, both around 2 hours away with good bus and train connections.by ferry: those visiting from europe may wish to consider travelling to the uk by ferry. if travelling from mainland europe, the nearest port to wales is portsmouth (connections to caen, cherbourg, le havre, st malo, bilbao, santander and the channel islands) which is approximately 2 ½ hours drive from south wales and also has direct train connections through to south wales. dover is the other main ferry port in england serving europe (connections to calais), however it is approximately 4 hours drive from south wales.eurotunnel: the eurotunnel connects to the uk in folkestone, which is approximately 4 hours drive from south wales.by train: the uk can be reached by train from paris, brussels and lille using the eurostar. the eurostar arrives in london, and from there you will find excellent connections to newport and cardiff in south wales and also to the city of chester on the north wales border.

the walk from dylife to machynlleth on a glorious spring day was totally memorable. after such a pleasant stay with maya at bron y llys we were already singing, but the views at glaslyn blew us away. we were warmly welcomed by everyone in mid wales and would encourage anyone thinking of doing this walk to book up."   east  -  july 2017    "it was an excellent holiday. northern wales was spectacular, we will recommend this area to anyone. nathan was fantastic! he gave great advice and always got back to us promptly. thank you so much for everything. so great!"   b. p  -  july 2017    "very favourable! outstanding service from jo adding [my friends] to different sections along the route. organised transfers to and from the trail appreciated."   hides  -  june 2017    "finished at last, de mendonca and i have finished the offa's dyke path. what a glory. thank you for arranging such good weather. just to say all your arrangements worked like clockwork. the b&bs were very good indeed. all were good and i expect that they will appeal to different people."    bell and de mendonca  -  june 2017    "we had narrowed down our search to five companies, asking for suggestions & recommendations from all. celtic trails was the only company that did not parrot back what was on their website and actually gave us a suggested itinerary based on the parameters i had outlined. well done celtic trails!"   dzwoncyk  -  june 2017    "great tour company - we will recommend!"   miller  -  june 2017    "my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our 5 days walking the southern part of offa's dyke. it exceeded our expectations. the views are stunning (even in the rain!). the walking was easy, even if there were a few tough climbs. 
it was our first long-distance walk together and we certainly are encouraged to do it again. celtic trails were excellent (and patient with our changing plans). the choice of b&bs and hotels along the path were perfect, and it was such a treat to find our luggage in our room each evening."   french  -  june 2017    “we are back home after a truly wonderful holiday!

there is no aspect which could be improved on. 
we particularly appreciated that our holiday was bespoke with attention paid to detail."    turner  -  june 2016    "luggage and private transfer was perfect. i used to organise and carry everything myself. celtic trails makes everything nice and a lot easier.
i like walking from one destination to the next, rather than staying in one place. i recommend celtic trails. thank you very much! i had a wonderful week."   kimmich-laux  -  may 2016    "this is our 6th walking holiday, so we have a good understanding of these tours. we could not fault celtic trails for quality & communication, administration, accommodation & assistance. thank - you all."   warren  -  september 2015    "hello penny. got back yesterday from my offa’s dyke walk which went really well.  i thoroughly enjoyed it although i have to admit it was a bit tougher than i had expected!.....this is just to thank you for making a superb holiday possible.  several b&b owners said that celtic trails were the best or one of the best companies - so well done."   kent  -  june 2015    "greatly appreciated the helpfulness and patience shown to us by staff members of celtic trails. many of my questions and concerns were resolved before we even got to wales! the hike was wonderful and lodgings were great...thanks so much for your help."   edmonds  -  may 2015    "kate, many thanks for great organisation – the accommodation you chose for us was very caring and everyone along the way said you were the best too!"    williams  -  may 2015    "what really made the holiday special was the quality of accommodation. all the b&b's were extremely welcoming & comfortable. we really appreciated the individuality of each place & the people we met. thank - you for a lovely holiday."    peters  -  march 2015    "this is only the second time that i and barbara, in 40 years of walking in wilderness & other routes have used a company to organise beds, transfers etc. it was such a pleasure! we know at the end of each day our bags, bed + meal were organised and ready, plus all our hosts were so welcoming, it really added an extra dimension of pleasure to our trip

accommodation and food were fantastic, landscape and weather as well."   sesche  -  july 2014    "i love solitude and wild places, and like to experience a landscape at walking speed, however i do not want to camp when i can enjoy the comfort of a good b&b!"    hydes  -  july 2014    "a fantastic experience and we were generally very impressed indeed by the effort taken on our our behalf by your accommodations and our hosts. thank you."   bond  -  june 2014    "overall, i am extremely pleased with out experience with celtic trails! even before our trip, e-mails were responded to quickly. i

thank you."   stewart  -  july 2013    "i found offa's dyke path a wonderful walk . the variety of landscapes, the terrain, the farms. the towns and villages made odp a rich walking experience. it certainly whet my appetite for further walks with you. and thank you penny and the celtic trails team, for your organisation once my husband decided to join us."   ong  -  july 2013    "this is the fourth long distance walk  we have completed in the last four years. as you can see from our appraisal we greatly enjoyed this walking holiday. there is very little to fault in your organisation, notes, maps and guide books. all the accommodations were of a good standard, the service was excellent."   parker  -  june 2013    "overall a great and unforgettable experience. the changing scenery, the sea, the birds; i saw some dolphins beneath nant gwrtheyrn and behind whistling sands was met by a badger mother carrying it’s own little one in its mouth. everywhere i found kind and helpful people – i even met an elderly lady who had also walked a lot with celtic trails! thank you for organising a very enjoyable holiday."   bailey  -  august 2012    "[we enjoyed] going to local pubs, seeing a variety of gorgeous landscapes and meeting new people along the way. the route was even more rural than we expected. we knew there would be some days where there were no restaurants, stores or other facilities, but we didn't realise this would be nearly ever day. we appreciated very much the flawless suitcase delivery service. the offa's dyke path provides a great deal of natural beauty and beautiful views of the countryside. we loved seeing these, thanks for your work in helping us organise such an interesting holiday experience."   e & d driver  -  july 2012    "we thoroughly  enjoyed walking offa's dyke south with celtic trails. we walked offa's dyke north last year. overall, price would have been £50-60 per person cheaper than celtic trails. but, both my wife and i concluded that it was well worth paying the extra money. we will be definitely use you again. maybe hadrian's wall in 2013!"    mr & mrs j bennett  -  july 2012    "from my perspective celtic trails did a great job in every respect. even a phone call from penny at the end of the last day'. i (we) will recommend celtic to everyone. fantastic job and a big thank - you."    smith  -  may 2012  leave your own review of your wales walking holiday with us - add review.   keen to find out more? we've created a destination guide to provide more information about this region. view destination guidewhy wales?wales, or cymru as it is known in its native language, is one of the oldest, most beautiful, yet least known areas of the uk, where it is possible to walk for miles without seeing another soul.this ancient, celtic nation, situated to the west of england is one of the smallest countries in the uk, but it is amongst the richest in culture and heritage. measuring just 170 miles long and 60 miles wide, a visit to wales will allow you to see some of the uk’s most spectacular coastlines, climb rugged mountains, visit a never-ending supply of ancient castles and churches and hear europe’s oldest living-language actively spoken, within just a few day's walking. wales may not be quite as well known (or as highly visited) as her celtic sisters, scotland and ireland, but as you immerse yourself in the vast green mountain ranges, the centuries of exciting history, and the wonderfully traditional and distinct welsh communities, you will find a great deal to fall in love with. and all this within just a few hour's drive of london.what's in a name?2023 saw name changes to snowdonia and brecon beacons national parks with snowdon also reclaiming its welsh identity. sixty six years after its designation as a national park, brecon beacons became known as bannau brycheiniog pronounced ban-eye bruck-ein-iog; the name comes from the plural of ‘ban’, meaning ‘peak’ and ‘brycheiniog’ refers to the kingdom of king brychan -  ‘the peaks of brychan’s kingdom'. the changes come hand-in-hand with key initiatives including 16,000 hectares of peatland restoration and the planting of 1 million trees.welsh for snowdonia is eryri pronounced e-ryh-ree - a name that can be traced back to the 9th century and means ‘highlands’ not ‘place of eagles’ as is commonly believed. likewise, snowdon, derived from the saxon ‘snow dun’, meaning ‘snow hill’ has reverted to its earlier name of yr wyddfa. reference to early forms of the name yr wyddfa appeared in a charter drawn up by llywelyn fawr (llywelyn the great) in 1198. discover more about the diplomat and warrior who united much of wales here.here are our top 5 reasons to visit wales.1) the coastline wales is surrounded on three sides by the irish sea and with this comes some of the most beautiful coastline you will find anywhere in the uk. the jewel in the crown? pembrokeshire.2) the mountains striking, sharped edged peaks, hidden lakes and wonderful views. the mountains of wales are quite unlike anywhere else in the uk. visit the best of the bunch in eryri national park.3) the castles centuries of border battles have left wales with a spectacular selection of norman castles along its border and coastline. nearly a thousand years old, these magnificent buildings bring the history of this tiny nation alive.4) the language wales is the proud home of europe’s oldest living language, still spoken as a mother-tongue in many welsh communities. the real trick is being able to pronounce the longest place name in britain: llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch!5) the capital a beautiful castle, the home of welsh rugby, male-voice choirs, dr who, endless supplies of fine food and culture. cardiff, or caerdydd, provides the perfect end to a holiday in wales.  essential informationmedical cover no vaccinations are required for entry into britain. all citizens of the eu are entitled to free medical treatment under the national health service (nhs). if you are travelling from outside the eu you will receive free treatment from the accident and emergency unit, but not if you are admitted into hospital or receive treatment at a general doctors surgery. consequently health insurance is highly recommended.money wales uses the same currency as the rest of the uk, pound sterling (£). most shops, hotels and restaurants accept all major debit and credit cards, although you should always carry a bit of cash on you, particularly when visiting more rural areas or when using small businesses. you will also find an atm in most small towns.tipping is expected in most cafés and restaurants but not mandatory. anything between 5% and 15%, depending on the quality of service is acceptable. it is not necessary to tip bar staff as you will usually order and collect your drinks at the bar.language although many people in wales do speak welsh, most can also speak english fluently and will usually speak to strangers or visitors in english first. in some areas of wales you will not hear welsh spoken at all (the south and borderlands), whilst in other areas you will hear it spoken regularly (north and west wales). the welsh are very proud of their language but are not offended if you do not speak it. if you would like to try they will be very happy to help you, but beware, it’s a tricky one! place names are a good starting point.internet and phone coverage because wales is quite rural there are many areas where you will have limited mobile phone coverage and mobile internet. for this reason it is best to plan ahead and not rely on them when you are out and about. in towns and villages there will generally be phone reception but not always mobile internet. it is increasingly common to have free wi-fi in cafés, hotels and b&bs but not guaranteed.welsh culturewales has a very distinct and strong culture, which they are very proud of. some of this culture dates back to the celtic period, but much of it has been formed in the last few centuries. there is a very strong sense of community across the country ranging in character from the farming communities in the north to the old mining communities of the south.key facts: flag: welsh dragon national anthem: hen wlad fy nhadau (land of my fathers) patron saint: st david (1st march) national flower: daffodil population: 3 million capital city: cardiffcreative arts: arguably the strongest element of welsh culture. the creative arts are ingrained in the welsh identity through music, literature, and the visual arts. particular highlights include the national and international eisteddfod (national arts festivals held during the summer), welsh male voice choirs, the national museum of wales in cardiff, the hay literary festival in hay-on-wye and the wales millennium centre. however, the arts are everywhere and we recommend visiting any art gallery or performance venue you pass on your travels.sports: rugby is undoubtedly the most popular sport in wales and plays a big part in the welsh identity. visit any pub during a wales rugby match and you will discover a great deal about what it is to be welsh (including the singing!).food: being an agricultural country, welsh food is generally very traditional. wales produces some of the best-tasting lamb in the world and it is the definite ‘star of the show’ on any welsh menu. other highlights include, caerphilly cheese, welsh rarebit (similar to cheese on toast), laverbread (a seaweed puree), welsh cakes, ice cream and bara brith (a welsh fruit loaf).travel documents: wales has the same immigration and visa requirements as the rest of the uk, which will be checked upon your first arrival in the uk. if you arrive in england or scotland first, you will not need to go through passport control again when you enter wales.getting aroundceltic trails will arrange necessary transfers for yourself and your luggage for the duration of the walk. this is included in the price of the holiday, but does not include transport to the start of the walk. we are very happy to arrange private transfer to the start of your walk at an additional cost. alternatively, there are the following options:by train: there is a very good train network in the uk and it is the most popular form of public transport because it is comfortable, safe and fast. it is also suitable for travelling on with large pieces of luggage.in wales, there is a good train service running along the north and south coastlines, and a less regular service running along the border and into mid-wales. it is possible to get to most large towns in the uk by train, but you may need to change trains a few times. the best place to plan your journey, check train times and prices is via the national rail website www.nationalrail.co.uk. if you would like advice on which is the nearest train station to the start/end of your walk please get in touch. train tickets can be bought on the national rail website or at the train station on the day.coach: coach travel is often one of the most affordable ways of making long journeys across the uk (but not necessarily the quickest). national express and megabus are the main long distance coach companies in the uk, serving major towns, cities and airports. tickets for long distance coach journeys should always be bought in advance from the company’s website.www.nationalexpress.com uk.megabus.combus: buses (generally smaller than coaches) are used across the uk for shorter journeys. there are thousands of bus routes and you will find a service running through almost every town in wales. they are particularly useful in more rural parts of wales where there is not a train service. tickets are bought from the bus driver.timetables in wales can be checked at www.traveline.cymru. if you are at all unsure, we are very happy to offer advice on bus routes.taxi: travelling by taxi is not cheap but it is the most convenient way of travelling if you only have a small number of journeys to make. if you are in particularly rural area or need a taxi late at night, it is advisable that you book a day or two in advance. taxi journeys should always be booked in advance unless you are in a major city or airport. celtic trails are very happy to provide you with the numbers of local, trustworthy taxi companies and also to book a taxi if enough notice is given.car: if you plan to drive to the start of your walking holiday, please let us know as we can provide advice on where to leave your car whilst walking.  ✕  home » walking holidays in walesenquire about walking in wales +44 (0)1291 689 774 our lines are open: 9am to 5pm (gmt), monday to fridaye-mail  name*
