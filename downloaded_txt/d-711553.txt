ahca rescue provides support, coordination, and financial assistance to a national network of volunteers. our goal is to ensure that veterinary care, including spaying and neutering, temperament evaluations, foster placements, and loving, permanent homes are provided to homeless afghan hounds. ahca rescue receives its funding from individual contributors, fund-raising items and events, and from donations by regional afghan hound clubs.
