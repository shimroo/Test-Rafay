e-mails preferred!! 
                usually i need to research to answer questions or check 
                availability, so 
                emails are better than phone calls.  if we need to chat 
                after that, then we certainly can and i will provide my phone

greetings!!


thank you for visiting this website



(i keep the following 
        paragraph listed because it's the best way to describe what i will 
        continue to sell in the years to come.  i can't add to what dale 
        originally wrote when we retired to alaska in 2006. 
        i have kept this website active 
        but am no longer in business.  i don't buy items, but continue 
        to sell 
        personal items we collected over decades.)  
        please see the resume' page for a bit of background info on the history 
        of dale anderson, and the origins of this militaria website. you can be 
        confident in the items you purchase from me, as they were personally 
        picked and purchased by dale over the past decades.

"we are now retired 
        after nearly 50 years of active sales.  what this naturally means is 
        that weâve commenced a huge militaria & retirement saleâ¦great deals 
        to be had. however, the really big storyâ¦and what 
        really is more important to you, is that weâve decided to begin opening 
        boxes, 
        and offering  important material from several personal 
        collections, carefully selected over 50 years, and which havenât seen 
        the light of day in decades.  this material will constantly be added to 
        this website and sections will fill up 
        with items as time allows.  this will include a vast assortment of military and sweetheart 
        jewelry, gar, fraternal, patriotic, home front, remember pearl harbor, 
        ribbons, pins, buttons, badges, medals, rings, german items and collectibles of all 
        types.  this is quality, ultra-rare material you wonât believe.  and 
        what weâve been able to get on the website barely scratches the surface 
        of what is yet to come.  to be candid, itâs like christmas morning 
        around here when i open these boxes so long in storage, revealing things 
        you simply donât any longer see offered in catalogs, on the internet, or 
        at antique or gun shows.  we  recommend you keep a good watch 
        over our listings for a long time to come.  as good as the variety and 
        selection is now, it can only get better.  enjoy!"
