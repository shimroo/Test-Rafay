	 a list of bulldog disorders
	 



      i came across this list of bulldog inherited disorders, and there are a lot of them. our special breed has been inbred so much that these genetic conditions can be passed on or show up when two bulldogs with recessive genes are bred. this is not to say that all bulldogs have these, it's just that they are more common in the bulldog.--vl    bulldog (english bulldog)    the disorders listed in the first 3 categories below are believed to have an inherited basis, or are known to have a predilection for this breed ("breed predisposition"). this means the disorder occurs more commonly in this breed compared to other breeds, or to the general dog population. common sense suggests that these are inherited disorders, but for many breeds and many disorders, the studies to determine the mode of inheritance or the frequency in the breed have not been carried out, or are inconclusive.    we have listed disorders for which there is a general consensus among those investigating in this field and among veterinary practitioners, that the condition is significant in this breed.  where the mode of inheritance is known, this information is included on the linked disease page. the most popular breeds tend to have the most disorders listed because there is a larger number of dogs affected, and therefore more opportunity to recognize a breed predisposition to a particular disorder. as well, there is likely to be more indiscriminate breeding of these breeds, leading to a higher occurrence of inherited disorders. in less common or newer breeds, there may be no disorders listed or the list of disorders may be quite short, because it can take some time before enough dogs are affected to recognize an inherited condition.    the last category lists conditions that have been reported sporadically, and may be inherited in this breed.    1.jpg (6243 bytes)most important    these disorders are relatively common in this breed, and where possible, efforts are being made to eradicate them. ask your breeder about these conditions in his or her dogs. these disorders seriously affect the health of your pet and may require medical or surgical intervention.    brachycephalic syndrome    hip dysplasia    keratoconjunctivitis sicca    pulmonic stenosis    ventricular septal defect    2.jpg (6271 bytes)other disorders which have an increased incidence in this breed    these disorders occur less commonly or are less devastating than those mentioned above.    aortic stenosis    cleft lip/palate    cryptorchidism    deafness    demodicosis    distichiasis    entropion    fold dermatitis    hemivertebra    hypoplastic trachea    hypothyroidism    hydrocephalus    prolapsed gland of the third eyelid    spina bifida    tetralogy of fallot    urolithiasis    3.jpg (6264 bytes)disorders associated with conformation    these disorders are directly related to the conformation or standards for the breed. although these conditions have in many cases become so common that they are accepted as normal for the breed, they can still cause serious physical problems and discomfort for the dog. one component of responsible breeding is to breed away from the extremes of conformation that cause these physical problem.    brachycephalic syndrome    fold dermatitis    hypoplastic trachea    4.jpg (6254 bytes)other disorders which may be inherited in this breed    these disorders have been reported sporadically, and may be inherited in this breed.    coagulation disorder (factor vii deficiency)    laryngeal paralysis    lymphoedema    retinal dysplasia    von willebrand's disease    for more information about this breed    bulldog - american kennel club    copyright Â© 1998 canine inherited disorders database. all rights reserved.    revised: november 24, 2003.

	 how to breed english bulldogs
	 



      note from bulldog health.  this is a detailed account from wikihow.com on how to breed english bulldogs, personally i do not recommend to my readers that they breed english bulldogs. i think that it is a risky and expensive proposition and should be left to the professionals. and i do not edorse the methods proposed herin, i merely publish the article for informational purposes only -- janclick the title above to read the entire article.how to breed english bulldogsthe best advise is not to breed unless you have plans that will include the proper long term commitment to the breed, the health and safety of the bitch and puppies, and the ability to completely understand the bulldog and its needs.stepsso the time has come for your bulldog to be bred. your bitch is sound, her temperment is excellent and she is worthy of the breed. your thoughts should also have been given to the correct selection of a proper stud. a mating should take place after careful consideration of bloodlines, health, age and how many previous litters.count 60-63 days before the puppies are likely to be born making sure everything necessary for their arrival will be in order by that time. note; semen can hold in the bitch for up to 3 days, so be careful not to expect them too early. example: if she has passed 63 days and you have no puppies she may have not "taken" the day you thought she did. it could be a few more days.labor: a normal gestation is about 63 days. a week before the puppies

	 dominance or aggression problem in bulldog
	 



social isolation: "what is dominance confusion?aggressive *display* (growling, teeth baring, etc.) is one of the many tools a dominant canine has at his disposal if he needs to control the behavior of a subordinate canine. the top ranked dog and the lowest ranked dog are the two that rarely engage in aggressive *action* (bites). one rules the pack, the other defers to the whole pack. it's the middle ranked dogs, the 'beta' dogs, that will use aggression to further their ranking. dominance confusion is created when a dog is totally confused about his place in the pack and uses aggression (bites), or aggressive displays (growling, teeth baring), to answer the question 'who's in charge around here anyway?'. in a canine only pack there are clear lines drawn in the sand. the alpha gets control of the resources, directs the hunt, breeds and makes any decisions affecting the group that need to be made. the rest of the pack voluntarily follows his lead. the caricature of a snarling, nasty, dominant alpha dog is not a correct one. the alpha male, for example, tolerates nearly everything the alpha female throws at him without objection. however, their roles and their relationship are clearly defined. she follows his lead when issues affecting the group are decided.  the image of an alpha wolf throwing a subordinate onto his back and threatening him with his life is not something based in reality. in a pack situation everyone knows their place and the sub-dominant members of the group voluntarily roll over if they are being chewed out by any higher ranked individual. if you've ever seen aggressive displays of this type they look and sound very nasty, but when it's all over no one is injured or bleeding. exceptions to 'no harm done' aggressive displays are when two dogs (males or females) are fighting over breeding rights, or when a younger and stron"--great article on how to be the alpha in your pack.

	 what to do about diarrhea
	 



      i see a variety of pets with a number of problems..but diarrhea is at the top of the list.fortunately, most cases of diarrhea are caused by dietary indescrations, and some simple, safe home remedies can help you avoid a trip to the vet.here is what i advise.fluid..ensure that your pet doesn't get dehydrated. you can assess hydration status by checking their gums. lift up the lips, and place your finger on the gums. if the gums are dry and tacky, then your pet is dehydrated. skin tent is another method. gently pinch the skin behind the head over the shoulder blades forming a tent. it should rapidly return to normal within 2 seconds. if the gums are dry and the skin tent is prolonged, then your pet is dehydrated and needs fluid. i find an electrolyte solution, such as pedialyte is best. you can force it in with a syringe or turkey baster. give a 10lb cat 1 tablespoon ( 25ml) at a time. a 40lb dog should get 100ml or approx 1/2 a cup. this can be repeated every 4 hours. the daily fluid needs for a 40 lb dog are 4 cups.   24 hour fast. stop putting food into your pet for 24 hours (day 1). this allows the intestines to rest and regenerate. always have access to plenty of fresh water. after 24 hours, introduce a bland food for the next 24 hours (day 2). plain cooked white rice for dogs, feeding equivalent cups of rice as their normal diet. for cats, protein is essential, try cooked chicken breast with the rice. after a day of the bland food mix Â½ regular diet and Â½ bland diet (day 3). by the end of day 3, they should be back on their normal diet.homeopathic. nux vomica is good for the entire intestinal tract. use the 30c potency giving 2-3 tablets  twice daily as needed.human remedies. peptobismal is an old standby that can be effective for dogs. the dog dose is 1ml/10lbs of body weight given three times daily for no more than 7 days. immodium (loperamide) is the only safe over-the-counter anti-diarrhea drug for cats: give .25mg/10lbs of body weight three times daily for 2 days (it comes as a liquid of 1mg/5ml, meaning you can give 1ml to a 10lb cat three times daily); dogs can get .5mg/10lbs three times daily (give your 40 lb dog one 2mg tablet three times daily).--this is from dr jones who has a great book on home remedies for dogs and cats - check it out at this link: vet secrets

	 rapid growth problems in bulldogs
	 



bulldog health: "development problems: because of the bulldogï¿½s rapid growth it is very important that you keep weight, play and exercise properly managed during the first year, early joint damage could be permanent and may lead to osteoarthritis. irregular growth in the long bones is very common and is almost always only temporary as the dog usually grows out of it by the time the bones fuse at about 9 months to 1 year of age. hip/elbow displaysia is genetic but can be encouraged by environmental factors (ie: slidey floors, jumping, overweight etc). any puppy that shows lamness should be rested as it is not unusual during a rapid growth spurt, try not panic if your puppy becomes lame and don't ever allow surgery to be undertaken on growing bones - no firm diagnoses can be made until he is at least a year old anyway.--as a rule, do not do surgery on your bulldog younger than one year

	 cherry eye treatment
	 



veterinary vision: public forum *cherry eye*: "'cherry eye' is the term often used to describe protrusion of the tear gland associated with the third eyelid membrane in the corner of the eye. this occurs due to weakness in the gland's normal attachments and is thought to be an inherited abnormality in several breeds of dogs, including the english bulldog, cocker spaniel, lhasa apso, and shar pei. it is also seen in burmese cats where it may be related to abnormalities in the membrane itself as well as the gland. 'cherry eye' often affects both eyes although the second gland may prolapse several months after the first.treatment for this condition involves surgically replacing the gland into its normal position and attaching it with sutures. this gland is responsible for producing approximately a third of the tear volume to the surface of the eye. thus, removal of the gland is not recommended as this can compromise tear function and can lead to development of 'dry eye' later in life.surgery for this condition is done under general anesthesia. your pet is able to go home the same afternoon. there may be some swelling and redness of the eye which will resolve over the first 3-5 days. surgery is most likely to be successful if it is done soon after the gland prolapses. with time, prolonged swelling of the gland can make repositioning more difficult and recurrence more likely.-- from opthamology specialists

	 cherry eye in english bulldogs
	 



cherry eye in dogs: "the medical term for 'cherry eye' is nictitans gland prolapse, or prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid. unlike people, dogs have a 'third eyelid' that contains a tear gland and is located in the corner of each eye. under normal circumstances, this gland is not visible and aids in the production of tears. for some reason, which is not completely understood, the gland of the third eyelid prolapses or comes out of its normal position and swells creating the condition known as cherry eye.what dogs are likely to get cherry eye?any dog can develop cherry eye, but there are several breeds that appear to have a higher incidence of developing it in both eyes. they are: the beagle, bloodhound, boston terrier, bulldog, bull terrier, lhasa apso, saint bernard, and shar-pei. dogs can acquire this condition at any age and it affects males and females equally.what causes it?the exact cause of cherry eye is not known, but it is strongly suspected that it is due to a weakness of the connective tissue that attaches the gland to the surrounding structures of the eye. the weakness of the connective tissue allows the gland to prolapse. once the gland prolapses and is exposed to the dry air and irritants, it can become infected and/or begin to swell. the gland often becomes irritated, red, and swollen. there is sometimes a mucous discharge and if the animals rub or scratch at it, they can traumatize the gland further or possibly create an ulcer on the surface of the eye.what is the treatment?treatment of cherry eye is very straightforward and consists of surgically repositioning the gland. topical or injectable treatments of antibiotics and steroids are rarely effective in reducing the gland and allowing for correction without surgery. because the exposed gland is at greater risk for-- perhaps it's that flat face on the bulldog - not enough room for all those glands

	 supplements for pets
	 



supplements for pets: "supplements for petsaccording to the aspca, if your pet is eating a healthful, balanced diet of high-quality food, then vitamin supplementation is not necessary. even pets eating kibble are more likely to suffer from vitamin overdoses (due to the amount manufacturers add to the finished product) than vitamin deficiencies. give your pets the extra boost they need by feeding them raw vegetables and fruits as treats.the aspca also advises that it is not necessary to supplement unless a specific deficiency is diagnosed by your veterinarian. however, some people subscribe to the view that optimal pet health is more than just avoiding a marked deficiency, and that their pets may benefit from daily supplements. here are the vitamins that dogs and cats need most, and why:vitamin a: for healthy tissues, inside and out. the best form is from fish oils, like cod-liver, and is beneficial to dogs and cats.b vitamins: promote growth and aid in healing. b vitamins are also necessary for fat and protein assimilation, as well as metabolic processes. they are found naturally in eggs, yogurt and kefir (an enzyme-rich yogurt-like product that stimulates digestion and peristalsis).vitamin c: an essential antioxidant that helps eliminate free radicals. carnivores can produce their own vitamin c, but their need for it increases in stressful situations. the best form for dogs is calcium ascorbate, which is water-soluble and causes the fewest side effects (such as nausea or diarrhea).vitamin e: an essential antioxidant. promotes healthy circulation in the heart and arteries. it also helps protect the lungs from the effects of pollution. senior cats especially can benefit from increased vitamin e intake to maintain their immune system responses.probiotics: just as we need active, ï¿½friendlyï¿½ i"--read the rest by clicking the title link - bulldogs need supplements too!  vl

	 your bulldog could benefit from a little dirt!
	 



: "hygiene hypothesis vindicatedimprovements in sanitation over the last century have led to longer, healthier lives in the industrialized world ï¿½ but like most things in life, cleanliness can be taken too far. a new study suggests that overly hygienic environments increase the tendency to develop allergic reactions and autoimmune disease.researchers at duke university medical center compared the antibodies in the blood of laboratory rats and mice, which grow in a virtually germ-free environment, with those of wild rats and mice. all of the wild rodents had higher levels of igg and ige, classes of antibodies associated with immune and allergic diseases, but the wild rodentsï¿½ antibodies did not tend to bind to the ratï¿½s own cells, as did the antibodies produced by the hygienically raised rodents. instead, the wild rodentsï¿½ antibodies efficiently and effectively attacked invading organisms. the researchers published their results early on-line in the scandinavian journal of immunology.the ï¿½hygiene hypothesesï¿½ is perfectly sensible to me. i think it is extremely important for children and adults to spend significant amounts of time outdoors, where they can interact with all manner of environmental stresses and build strong, healthy immune systems. i also discourage the indiscriminate use of antibacterial soaps for the same reason. the immune system is like any other system ï¿½ it needs exercise and challenges to grow and function effectively."--this applies to bulldogs too, especially where allergies are concerned!  vl

english bulldog health: "while the majority of english bulldogs live happy and healthy lives, the breed is susceptible to two major joint problems - luxating patella (floating kneecap) and hip dysplasia. again, these conditions are caused by bulldog breeding. and all bulldogs have them to some degree, causing arthritis and other more severe problems.these conditions can often require expensive surgery to correct, and can have a serious effect on your dog's quality of life. both of these diseases are considered inherited conditions so you should check carefully with your breeder to see if either the sire or dame has a family history of one or both diseases. whether they say so or not, they are most likely evident to at least a lesser degree."--reputable breeders are a mustread more at the heatlhy bulldog

allergy test: the test: "how is it used?the allergen-specific ige antigen test is done to screen for an allergy (a type i hypersensitivity) to a specific substance or substances in response to acute or chronic allergy-like symptoms in the patient.the allergen-specific ige antibody test may be done (instead of other medically supervised allergy testing) when the patient has significant dermatitis or eczema, is taking necessary histamines or anti-depressants that would make other testing more difficult, or if a dangerous allergic reaction could be expected to follow another test.the allergen-specific ige antibody test may also be done to monitor immunotherapy or to see if a child has outgrown an allergy, although it can only be used in a general way; the level of ige present does not correlate to the severity of an allergic reaction, and someone who has outgrown an allergy may have a positive ige for many years afterward."--this test may or may not prove what ails your bulldog, i'd try dietary changes before expensive testing.www.bulldoghealth.com

a bulldog with focal alopecia november 1999 veterinary medicine: "seasonal affective disorder can be culprit for canine hair losscoming off of a long, dark winter as we are in the midwest, we're confronted with a unique disease seen in certain breeds of dogs. light responsive alopecia or seasonal flank alopecia is most often seen at this time of the year. it is not well understood but is thought to be from lack of sunlightexposure to the pineal gland. the pineal gland is located at the base of the brain and is the gland responsible for telling bears to hibernate and perhaps telling us to crawl into bed early during these long winters, eat fatty foods, and in general, not have much energy.these changes are not recognized in dogs but physical changes such as trun-cal alopecia and hyperpig-mentation are evident light responsive alopecia is logically more common in those areas of the country with dark winters such as the midwest, the plains states, parts of new england and canada. studies of seasonal affective disorder in humans show an incidence of 2 percent in florida vs. 10 percent in new hampshire. when seen in other parts of the country or at other times of the year it maybe evident that affected dogs are house bound during the daylight hours for a prolonged period of time. for example, the owner leaves before dawn and arrives home after sunset so the dog is exposed to virtually no natural sunlight. it is not known whether the disease is comparable between humans and animals but what is certain is that a photo period plays a role in both."

	 reverse sneezing, like a wheezing choking sound
	 



thebulldogbunch : message: re: [the bulldog bunch]: "reverse sneezing:the real name for reverse sneezing is paroxysmal respiration. paroxysmal respiration is commonly described as a 'reverse sneeze' because for all purposes it does look as if a dog is trying to inhale a sneeze. when this occurs, your bullie will appear to be snorting or choking with the neck extended and the chest expanded, as the she struggles to take in air.physiologically, the trachea has narrowed and the normal amount of air is not able to enter the lungs. in most cases, this not a serious problem and it looks much more horrifying than it is. if this is happening to your bulldog, do not panic. you can help your her by soothingly stroking the upper throat area to encourage relaxation and dilation of the trachea. other have had success gently pinching the nostrils together until the bulldog swallows. this is usually all that is necessary. it is important to remember that most attacks will stop without doing anything at all.http://bulldogdomain.com/health/breathing.php"

poisoned pet food?: "when choosing food for my own two rhodesian ridgebacks, jambo and daisy, i stay away from anything containing animal byproducts, rendered or recycled meats, poultry or fats, and look for meat protein that is properly cooked before it's consumed. i suggest you always check pet food labels to make sure that they clearly state that the food does not contain added growth hormones, antibiotic-fed protein sources, as well as rendered meats, fats and poultry. i would add corn to the list of ingredients to avoid. pet promise, the pet food i use, does not contain any of the protein sources i mention above. it does contain corn gluten meal, the high-protein part of the corn kernel that remains when the starch, bran, and germ are extracted. corn gluten meal provides two essential amino acids that pets need, methionine and taurine. while you can never be 100 percent sure that corn gluten meal doesnï¿½t contain aflatoxin, i'm satisfied that the corn from which corn gluten meal is extracted for pet promise is subjected to much more stringent tests. it comes from a family-owned kansas facility that mills corn for use in human foods and has earned a 'superior' rating for its testing procedures from the american institute of bakers."--protect your pets with high quality foode.s.

	 how we become what we are - questia online library
	 



how we become what we are - questia online library: "many aspects of our personalities, it now seems clear, are inborn and resistant to change--a fact, ironically, that makes the role of environment in our lives all the more important an offspring of cry havoc and one tough cookie, slick willy is the second bull terrier fortunate enough to belong to david lykken, a psychologist interested in temperament. temperament, which is reflected in a creature's manner of behavior, is personality's biological, enduring, and heritable aspect. it greatly contributes to but does not entirely explain personality, much as innate intelligence contributes to but cannot entirely explain ability. willy's temperament originated when the english bulldog wa s deliberately crossed with the white english terrier, almost 200 years ago. the nature of the resulting fearless, tenacious fighting machine requires a different sort of nurture than that of dogs bred for complaisance. when willy can't resist chomping through a plastic jug with his powerful jaws or taking a few extra laps before responding to a summons, lykken mostly just grumbles, reserving sterner measures for more serious infractions. harsh treatment would render the feisty animal vicious; permissiveness or neglect would produce an uncontrollable bully. willy's good behavior depends on an appreciation of his innate disposition and a judicious balance of carrot and stick.

	 surface pyoderma
	 



      "surface pyoderma surface pyoderma are bacterial infections confined to the surface of the skin. two of the most common types are pyotraumatic dermatitis and skin fold dermatitis. pyotraumatic dermatitis, (acute moist dermatitis -- more commonly known as 'hot spots') is typically located on the back near the tail, the outside thighs and the shoulder. occasionally the neck and face are also involved. it is typified by localized itching, reddened skin patches and ulcerated oozing lesions. longhaired breeds are more commonly affected, with a marked increase of incidence during warm weather. contributing factors are allergies, parasites and poor grooming. flea allergy dermatitis is one of the most common causes of 'hot spots'. successful treatment depends on identifying and controlling the 'itch'. short-term oral corticosteroid therapy can be used to control itching, while keeping the affected area clean. topical therapy is optional. skin fold pyoderma is associated with moisture and accumulation of debris. the environment in the crease of the fold is ideal for bacterial growth. skin abrasion, lesions, hyperkeratosis and hyperpigmentation are commonly seen when itching has been a problem. the degree of skin damage varies with each type of skin fold; reddening of the skin, ulceration and oozing are common in most instances. treatment is usually accomplished using a 2.5 to three percent benzoyl peroxide shampoo. initial application should be daily, with eventual maintenance cleansing two to three times weekly. systemic antibiotics are seldom needed.

	 what causes seizures in dogs?
	 



what causes seizures in dogs?: "seizures can be caused by a variety of things including both primary and secondary epilepsy. they can also be the result of a blow to the head, calcium deficiencies in nursing mothers, end stage heartworm disease, toxic plants, chemicals, fertilizers and poisonings. there is even evidence that seizures may be have a hereditary factor involved since there are several breeds such as the belgian tervureren, german shepherd, dachshunds and others that have a higher incidence of them than other purebred dogs. if a seizure happens to your dog, the important thing is for you to stay calm. this is especially hard to do when your beloved pet is in the throes of what appears to be pure agony but you must be in control of yourself. keep a calm, quiet tone of voice while you attempt to comfort the dog. if there is furniture, doors or anything that the dog could hurt itself on during the seizure, move it if possible. if you are unable to move the danger, wrap blankets or place pillows between the dog and the object. slide something soft under the dogï¿½s head but make sure you do not get your face or hands close enough to the mouth risking a possible bite. dim the lights, turn off any loud music or tv and keep the environment as quiet as possible. speak to your dog in a low, reassuring voice and perhaps gently stroke his side or hip. also try to avoid being on the same side as the feet and toenails. as the muscles spasm, so do the legs making the feet curl into actual claws that can rake or gouge your skin. during these times, take notes to contact your veterinarian with. note the time of day it occurred, the duration of each seizure and the time in between them if they are recurrent. in addition to these things, the veterinarian will want to know if the dog regained consciousness, urinated or defecated, if the seizure progressed from mere bobody twitching or hit suddenly. he will probably ask if there had been any possibly triggering events such as fireworks, excessive exercising or playing, strange products or items eaten and how long it was before the dog appeared normal again." --and stay calm, many seizures are controllable with medicatione.s.

	 raw food diet: barf
	 



dog owner's guide; barf: bones and raw food: "raw vs cookedbarf feeders eschew the convenience of 40-pound bags of kibble and opt for preparing meals for their dogs that include uncooked meaty bones, uncooked muscle and organ meat, raw eggs, vegetables, fruit, yogurt, cooked cereals, cottage cheese, and herbs, enzymes, and other supplements. they are not tied to the same diet every day ï¿½ no more just measuring the kibble and pouring it in the bowl. if a good source of fresh chicken parts or lamb meat is available, the dogs get chicken or lamb. if green beans are on sale this week, cottage cheese is two-for-one at the supermarket, or the carrots are ready to be pulled in the garden, the dog's diet (like the family diet) will likely be heavy in those ingredients. the barf philosophy is that dogs should be fed the foods they are evolutionarily suited to eat. the barf principles are that commercially-prepared cooked foods lack enzymes and other essential dietary components and contain some ingredients that promote allergies and are otherwise harmful for dogs.

m - megaesophagus: "this is a condition in which the esophageal muscles lose their strength and the esophagus dilates to a much larger size. usually dogs with this condition regurgitate food as well as water but i have seen at least one other dog that started out just regurgitating when it drank water. sometimes the enlarged esophagus is visible on plain x-rays of the chest but often it is necessary to use some kind of contrast medium like barium to make the enlargement visible. there are other possible problems like esophageal diverticuli, hiatal hernia, esophagitis, pylorospasm, esophageal tumors and probably others. in addition, there are about thirty disorders that can cause a secondary megaesophagus problem.

	 problem with poop eating pooch?
	 



google answers: help for the poop-eating dog: "coprophagia (the eating of feces) is indeed repulsive but it is anatural canine behavior, especially with puppies. normally, as thepupï¿½s desire to eat more solid and complex foods begins to mature thebehavior usually stops. if it doesnï¿½t, have your dog checked forparasites. it may also be that he is lacking a certain necessarybacteria in his digestive system. have him checked for this and alsohave him placed him on a nutritionally complete medically approved (orsupervised) diet appropriate for his age. you want to make absolutelysure that he is not vitamin or mineral deficient. there are some otherthings you can do to help rid him of this urge to consume waste: keep his ï¿½bathroomï¿½ clean and feces free. some time away from it mayhelp divert his attention from obsessing about it. keep his break areapoop-free and make sure other dogs donï¿½t soil it either. train your dog. put him on a lease and introduce him to the word off.the word no is not a good word for this because no can mean a lot ofthings. dogs can recognize a surprisingly large vocabulary. getyourself a dedicated word specifically for this purpose. lead your dogto some poop in a leash a couple times a day. when he strugglesforward to get a small or a taste, snatch the lease (gently for asmall dog of course) and firmly command ï¿½offï¿½ or even ï¿½no! offï¿½. [ ihave a friend who uses the word phooey ]. a couple of weeks of thisand your dog will not need a lease anymore. you simply give thecommand off and he will anticipate the snatch and will immediatelyavoid contact. if he starts to go back to this behavior he might needanother week on the leash as a remedial lesson." --i think diet is the keye.s.

	 chronic ear infections
	 



google answers: golden retreiver chronic ear infection: "some dogs have chronic ear problems (the infection is not controlled by general medication or returns when general medication is discontinued).  in these cases, the ear discharge should be cultured so that the precise organism can be pinpointed and treated specifically.  regular treatment at home with disinfecting ear washes should become part of the pet's grooming routine.further testing may be in order to determine why the infectioncontinues to recur. allergy is the most common reason for recurrent ear problems.ask your vet if s/he thinks skipping an ear washing and ear drops the day of culturing, to allow a greater chance of collecting organisms, is a good idea.http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_ear_infections.html"--good advisee.s.

	 ear infections
	 



bulldog club of denver ::: "ear infections are typically treated with ear cleansers and topical application of medications that aim to kill the yeast or bacteria. many topical medications also have anti-inflammatory agents (usually steroids) in them to help with the inflammation and irritation caused by the infection. oral medications and ear cleansers are the first step. the cleansers aim to break up the wax and debris in the ear, as pets with ear infections have discharge that fills their ear canals. cleaning is essential to successfully eradicating the infection, and your pet will be more comfortable. if home cleaning is not successful, then deep ear cleaning under anesthesia may be necessary. the type of infection and its chroncity will dictate the medication needed. if your pet has recurrent or chronic ear problems, it is likely that either the infection was not completely cleared up initially and/or that the underlying cause of the ear problem has not been addressed. the most common underlying cause of ear problems in dogs and cats is allergies. the allergy may be towards food or airborne environmental allergens such as pollens, dusts or molds. over 20% of dogs with food allergies begin with ear problems as the only sign, and ear disease may be found in up to 80% of the dogs with food allergy." --those allergies seem to be at the heart of most bulldog problemse.s.

hotspot: "superficial pyoderma superficial pyoderma are bacterial infections which present themselves beneath the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis. commonly called superficial folliculitis, the bacterial diseases within this group have been termed recurrent pyoderma, pruritic pyoderma, shorthaired dog pyoderma, staphylococcal allergy and bacterial hypersensitivity. all of these have similar symptoms and require similar treatment. systemic antibiotics are appropriate therapy. superficial folliculitis is characterized by reddened pustules that develop a flattened crust usually five to ten millimeters in diameter. when the crust loosens, the center falls off and a thin circle of epidermal tissue (resembling a collar) remains around the periphery of the lesion. the ensuing area of skin is usually bald and hyperpigmented. it is common to have all stages of infection present at the same time. shorthaired dog pyoderma has a high concentration of pustules in a less extensive area -- usually the outside thighs and along the back and top of the neck. dogs diagnosed as having shorthaired pyoderma suffer from thinning of the hair coat over the affected area. recurrence is common in superficial folliculitis. in cases where superficial pyoderma is diagnosed as chronic and recurrent, a genetic predisposition is suspected. in these cases, owners are left with the possibility of lifelong intermittent antibiotic therapy" -not as bade.s.

	 interdigital cysts
	 



interdigital cysts: "interdigital cysts are actually a cellulitic form of deep tissue pyoderma (skin infection).  cellulitus is a condition in which inflammatory fluids are forced into the tissues, rather than being discharged on the surface.  interdigital cysts are characterized as a firm, nodular thickening of the interdigital web.  these cysts generally exhibit active stages of deep draining tracts of large pustules in one or more interdigital spaces.         interdigital pyoderma tends to be chronic in nature, therefore a thorough search for the underlying cause is essential.  this search can consist of skin scrapings, bacterial cultures and sensitivity tests.  most often the causative factors are found to be infection with staphylococci, ingrown hairs or blockage of a sebaceous gland.  though in some cases a genetic predisposition is suspected, which will necessitate intermittent lifelong antibiotics to control the symptoms.  in some cases, the cyst is removed under general anesthesia followed up by appropriate antibiotics.         in many cases, interdigital cysts can be eleviated, if only temporarily, by home treatment.  home treatment should not be attempted by novices, it is however a step available to those experienced in dogs and the possible repercussions of interdigital cysts.  the following is a brief outline of one fairly successful home treatment course. a) first thoroughly clean the area. b) soak the paw in warm water with epsom salts.  some people find it easiest to soak all 4 feet at the same time by standing the dog in a bath tub. c) do not allow the dog to drink the water. d) soak for approximately 10 minutes. e) dry area thoroughly. f) apply panalog ointment to the area. g) repeat daily until swelling has been gone for 3 days.

(actually he was told it's a compound whichis one molecule away from antifreeze). therefore, just by the dogwalking on the floor cleaned with the solution, then licking its ownpaws, it ingestedenough of the solution to destroy its liver.  soon after his dog'sdeath, his housekeepers' two cats also died of  liver failure. theyboth used the swiffer wetjet for quick cleanups on their floors."--since bulldogs are so allergy prone, no harsh chemicals should ever be used around the housee.s.

house training your dog by perfect paws dog and puppy training: "dogs are instinctively clean animals. if they can avoid it, they would rather not soil themselves or their usual eating and sleeping areas. dogs also naturally develop habits of where they would like to eliminate. for example, dogs that have a habit of eliminating on grass or dirt would rather not eliminate on concrete or gravel. you can use these natural tendencies for rapid and successful house training.  setting up for successful house trainingestablish the living areathere are two things you can do to set your dog up for successful house training. first, establish your dog's living area (we will call it 'den' from here out) in a small confined space such as a bathroom, part of the kitchen or garage. please note that a den is not a crate. read about crate training for more information on this. try to spend as much time as possible with your dog in her den. it is important to play with her in this area as well as let her eat and sleep here. give your dog a special bed; this can be anything from an open crate to a large cardboard box to a beach towel. in the beginning, she may eliminate in here but once she realizes that this is her special den, she will try to avoid soiling it. once your dog gets used to sleeping on her very own bed, you can move it around your house from room to room, where ever you go. confine your dog to her bed when ever you are somewhere other than her den. if her bed is a crate, simply close the door. if her bed is a towel or blanket, place it next to a piece of furniture and leash your dog so she can't get out of her bed. since you should never leave your dog unattended while leashed, it's an even better idea to leash your dog to yourself! tie one end of the leash around your waist or belt loop. now your dog can accompany you around your home and you can monitor her behavior" --read entire article for more useful informatione.s.

	 stolen bulldog alert
	 



      i'm sending out this nail-biting email i received from friendswhose bulldog was stolen out of their yard.  luckily, it has a happyending, but i have heard about three other cases lately that did not.note that the owners took quick decisive action!  and that is mostlikely why they got their beloved bulldog back.please note: i've changed the names to protect their privacy."hi jan,yes, it was bentley!she was taken from our backyard over the fence while joe, my son andi were in the house.  bentley, and our 5mo male puppy were in theyard between 5 -10 min alone.  the puppy barked an alert and didn't goto the fence, or i'm sure they would have taken him too.thank goodness for stupid criminals, as she was seen with thethieves at 2 pet stores the night she was taken.  the guys at petco saw them again a day later and got license plates. we are members of the bulldog club, and one of the members is a commander on our local police dept.  he ran down the plates and in the process 7 people went to jail for outstanding warrants for drug trafficking.  our final lead led to a house on bryant st. and that got another local city police dept involved, bentley wasn't there, but another bulldog was.  so, our friend had the pd relay a message that he would be "breathing down the necks of everyone at the bryant house for the rest of their days unless they returned the bulldog tonight." that worked,because she showed up at our house 3 hours later with 2 women from our neighborhood who claimed she mysteriously appeared in their backyard...although, no arrest was made directly to bentley, we think with all the other arrests the people who had her obviously got scared. she is home safe and sound!! our vet said she is ok and not to worry.we don't let our bulldogs out alone now, and i can't begin to tellyou how happy we are to have her with us again, but somehow i think youunderstand... thanks for thinking of us"phew! that was a close call and it makes my stomach turn to thinkabout it.  they were fortunate that they knew a local police officerfrom the bulldog club.  i don't want to scare you, but just remind you to be particularlyvigilant, especially if you do not have a privacy fence.your pals,jan & vivyhttp://www.vivyland.com

	 hotspots are pyoderma
	 



h - hotspots or moist pyoderma: "'hot spots' are also known as 'acute moist pyoderma'. what that means is that they are rapidly appearing, oozing, skin infections. this is just a description of a symptom, sort of like saying 'your dog has scabs'.a hot spot starts because something irritates the dog's skin. the body's response is to either itch or create an inflammatory response at the site. in cases of itching, the dog then rubs, licks or chews the site and adds to the problem. these sores can develop into severe problems in an hour or two at times.the most common irritants are probably fleas and allergies. these cause the itching that leads to the skin infection. there are many other possible sources of irritation. tick bites, besetting, burrs, mats, mosquitos, summer heat and other problems all contribute to the initial irritation that can develop into a hot spot.the best treatment for these is prevention. keep fleas off your dog. groom and bathe your dog as necessary to keep the haricot in good condition. limit other sources of irritation to the best of your ability. if allergies are a problem for your dog, work with your vet to control the itching they cause. in some dogs, all of this won't be enough and you will occasionally see hot spots anyway. the first step in treating a hot spot is to get it dry. bacteria like the hot moist environment of irritated skin. using something to dry the sore makes it harder for bacteria to grow. clipping the hair over and around a hot spot can help a great deal in allowing it to dry. there are lots of astringents that will help dry the sore, as well. my favorite is neopredef powder because it dries the sore, has an antibiotic that acts locally and a corticosteroid to control the itching and inflammation. other vets and pet owners have their own favorites. people have advocated using athlete's foot powder"--again act quickly and decisively!e.s.

mange ... what's eating your pets?: "sarcoptes scabiei var. canis, the mite of sarcoptic mange, an intensely pruritic, transmissible skin disease, is a frequent parasite of dogs, and to a lesser degree, cats and humans in singapore (s. scabiei var. cuniculi, the rabbit scabies mite, is also endemic here). the mites prefer lightly haired regions, and are most common on the elbows, hocks, ears, chest and abdomen. the disease spreads rapidly, and the entire body may be colonised by mites. the female mite tunnels through the skin, depositing eggs as she goes. once these ova hatch, the larvae burrow to the surface where they browse and feed. the larval stage then rests in a 'moulting pocket' and develops to the nymph stage. these also graze the skin surface before returning to moult to the adult stage. the life-cycle is completed in approx. 3 weeks. transmission occurs mostly through direct contact with an infected animal.mange: mange scabieinitially the pruritis is mild until the host develops a hypersensitivity to the mite, usually 3 to 4 weeks post-exposure. at this time, the itching becomes intense - hence the common name 'scabies' from the french scabere 'to scratch' - leading to self-induced traumatic wounds that exude serum, forming crusts.however, the presenting signs of sarcoptic mange can be varied and misleading, some dogs never developing 'classical' lesions. secondary pyoderma (bacterial infection) and alopecia are common signs, and may be confused with atopic (allergic) dermatitis, food allergies or staphylococcal pyoderma. microscopic demonstration of the mites from a skin scraping establishes the diagnosis, although in some cases a response to therapy is needed for confirmation.sarcoptes mites are quite species-specific, and usually cannot complete their life cycle on a non-definit" --bulldog's don't have the best immune system due to their breedinge.s.

	 more on pyoderma in bulldogs
	 



pyoderma in the canine: "pyodermabacterial skin disease pyodermas are common in small animal practice, particularly in the dog.there are several ways of classifying pyoderma but the easiest way to understand this disease is to think about the thickness of the skin and to define the infection on how deep the bacteria infect the skin cell layerssurface pyoderma:  this is where bacteria colonise the outermost layer of the skin. superficial pyoderma:  the bacterial infection is at the level of the intact hair follicle.deep pyoderma:  the bacterial infection extends beneath and beyond the hair follicle.causative bacteria  the vast majority of cases involve a natural resident of the skin called staphylococcus intermedius which becomes pathogenic (disease causing) when the skin environment changes for a number of different reasons. other bacteria and other micro-organisms may be involved but some reports suggest that over 90% of cases have staphylococcal involvement.what does pyoderma look like? the most common, owner response is that the dog itches, has red areas, often with pimples or scabs and the pet may smell. surface pyodermas may show as areas of redness and irritation, often developing in raised round, scabs. superficial pyodermas produce yellow spots which then break out into larger wheals and scabs. deep pyoderma can make pets systemically ill and produce abscesses and oozing, inflamed channels in the skin surface. certain areas may be particularly prone to infection. interdigital areas, inside ears, the groin and along the middle of the back are common sites in the dog. other diseases such as yeast infections can look very similar and so if there isn't a rapid resolution with home treatment, seek professional advice. "why does pyoderma occur?   there are too many reasons to list here but a few of the common reasons are suggested below. primary pyoderma  there is little doubt that occasionally pyoderma may develop spontaneously and for no obvious clinical reason (idiopathic). the general consensus is that these dogs probably have a compromised immune system or a congenital / inherited factor affecting skin immune systems.  atopy a name given to contact and inhaled, chronic hypersensitivity disorders, often with an inherited base. certain breeds are particularly susceptible. speak to your veterinarian at length on this complex and difficult subject. allergens incriminated vary from the house dust mite and plant pollens to human skin cells! the inflammatory skin changes, again, leave your pet open to secondary pyoderma. ectoparasites  especially fleas. apart from the trauma and irritation of individual flea bites, many dogs develop an allergy to flea saliva causing a generalized skin inflammation. this changing skin environment allows pyoderma to develop. see  flea control and parasitic skin disease  in any case of pyoderma, assume fleas may have a role to play until proven otherwise. dietary allergy  not as common as people would like to believe but is occasionally seen in dogs and because of the common daily inclusion of beef, chicken and wheat based products in dog foods we are seeing dietary intolerances being manifested as skin allergies with secondary pyoderma. change to a hypoallergenic diet, such as hills canine d/d after consultation with your veterinarian. --quick action is requirede.s.

	 skin infection: pyoderma 
	 



pyoderma: "what is pyoderma?pyoderma is a bacterial infection of the skin. it is very common in dogs and uncommon in cats. pyoderma frequently occurs as a secondary problem to some underlying condition or health problem.what causes pyoderma?pyoderma is caused most frequently by staphylococcus, a type of bacteria. other bacteria, such as e. coli, also can invade previously infected skin. several risk factors may cause an animal to be more likely to develop pyoderma. these risk factors include:parasites, such as fleas or mange mites allergies, such as flea, food, contact, or hereditary allergies hormonal disorders, such as hypothyroidism (low production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland) inadequate immune system, such as in young animals or those taking steroids animals with short coats, skin folds, or calloused skin trauma from grooming, scratching, or rooting in dirt or garbage the dog has a deep pyoderma that may respond to treatment only partially and frequently recurs"what are the signs of pyoderma? pyoderma frequently appears as a rash. it often affects the trunk, chin, bridge of the nose, and feet but it also may be generalized over the entire body. skin lesions can have a sudden or gradual onset. the animal may or may not itch. if the underlying cause is an allergy, the itching usually comes before the rash. the rash or lesions on the skin may appear as small bumps, pus-filled pimples or pockets of pus, or blood-filled blisters. there can be crusting, scaling, and discolored spots on the skin. the skin may be inflamed (red and hot). hair loss can occur, giving the animal a "moth-eaten" look. if a hormonal disorder is the underlying cause, signs can include excessive thirst and excessive urination, pendulous abdomen, lethargy, weight gain, or signs of feminization in male dogs. how is pyoderma diagnosed? pyoderma is diagnosed upon history and physical examination and by diagnostic procedures involving the skin. --my bulldog had this many times until her diet was changede.s.

	 just like us, bulldogs need exercise
	 



msn hotmail - message: "why exercise?dogs need exercise as much as people do for optimal health. ensuring that your dog gets enough exercise helps to keep your dog slim and healthy and helps to prevent unwanted behavior, which keeps your dog safe and happy.a slim dog is a healthy dog. balancing good nutrition with regular exercise helps reduce your pet's risk of obesity.an active dog is a happy dog. an active dog is less likely to misbehave than a bored dog. daily activities keep your dog happy and entertained, which helps keep him or her from nosing around in potentially dangerous items or situations. exercise also allows your dog to release restless energy in a constructive, rather than destructive, manner, which can keep you happy, too." --my bulldog is now 11 and i exercise her every day!e.s.

	 don't dip for demodectic mange
	 



demodex mites and your dog: "if you choose to use amitraz (mitaban rx) to treat the demodectic mange at this stage you will have eliminated the possibility of determining if the mange would have cleared up on her own, unless the amitraz doesn' t work.  i do not believe that you can use the ease of treatment as a gauge to determine whether or not a case of demodecosis would have resolved on its own. there is probably room to argue this point but i think it is better to be sure of this situation prior to choosing to breed a dog with demodecosis. amitraz (mitaban rx) is a very toxic medication. this is the other thing that makes me reluctant to treat a patient for a demodecosis prior to the time it is obviously necessary to do so. in order to understand how a medication this toxic ever got approved, you have to understand the whole situation. prior to the time that amitraz was available most dogs that developed generalized demodectic mange died from the disease. when i was in veterinary school this was a serious threat to affected dogs, as there was no effective treatment at the time. so when amitraz killed 3 out of the 1100 test dogs and caused other dogs to have adverse reactions, including, incoordination, severe lethargy and seizures, this was an acceptable risk -- compared to the high likelihood of death from the demodecosis.  however, this risk is not as easily justified when looking at the population of dogs who will get over the mange all by themselves, which is approximately 80% of the dogs affected by demodecosis.  i am opposed to putting my patients and their owners at risk for severe side effects when there may be no reason to do so.

	 demodex mites and your bulldog's immune system
	 



demodex mites and your dog: "demodectic mange is also contagious, in that most dogs acquire the infection from their mother. the mite usually lives in relative harmony with the dog and it is assumed that most dogs have demodex canis mites on their body.  if the dog's immune system is competent the mites are suppressed and never achieve large enough numbers to cause damage.  sometimes, local areas of the skin are affected by hair loss (alopecia) and secondary bacterial infections are common. when there are a number of spots, or the spots have spread over large areas of the body and when these spots do not clear up without treatment in four to eight weeks, the dog is said to have generalized demodectic mange. localized demodectic mange is thought to occur due to transient stress or a decrease in local immune function at the affected sites. generalized demodectic mange is thought to be due to a specific deficiency in t-cells that suppress these mites. this is thought to be a hereditary condition " --more genetic problems for the bulldoge.s.

pets symptom solver tool: "head shaking and head tilting are usually caused by an outer-ear infection called otitis externa. caused by bacteria, yeast, or other organisms, this condition is particularly common in dogs with large, floppy ears because the insides of the ears get hot and humid, creating a perfect environment for infection, says stephen simpson, d.v.m., associate professor of neurology at auburn university college of veterinary medicine in auburn, alabama. pets with ear mites will also shake or tilt their heads." --and we thought they tilted their heads to be cutee.s.

	 head shaking causes
	 



face and head probelms in dogs: "in my practice area, head shaking is a frequent side effect of allergies, fleas, mosquito bites and fly bites. allergies can be inhalant allergies to pollens, etc. (atopy), food allergies, or  flea or mosquito bite allergies (worse reaction than just getting bitten). some dogs have immune mediated diseases that make their ears itchy.  occasionally a young dog will have head shaking as an early sign of demodectic mange infestation. sarcoptic mange mite infection also can lead to head shaking. in the case of atopy, the head shaking may be the result of itchiness or it may be the result of inflammation of the respiratory tract and eustachian tube leading to problems equalizing the pressure in the middle ears or to fluid accumulation in the middle ears. antihistamines may help relieve the itchiness and sometimes help with the respiratory signs, as well. you might want to ask your vet about this, too.

	 does a bulldog even wag it's tail?
	 



why do dogs wag their tails when they're happy?: "a dog with a loosely wagging tail is usually a dog that is friendly or excited. however, a wagging tail is not always a sign of an amiable pooch. an aggressive dog might hold its tail high and wag only the tip, while a submissive or scared dog is more likely to hold its tail low and wag it stiffly. some experts believe that a wagging tail is a sign of conflict. when an animal is in conflict, it wants to retreat and advance at the same time. the wagging tail is an indication of this confusion. when you see a dog wagging its tail, odds are that the dog is in good spirits, probably running after a ball or begging for a treat. however, you should be aware that a wagging tail isn't a definitive sign of a friendly dog; proceed with caution if you think the dog is aggressive" --my bulldog wags her little tail when i come home: so cute!e.s.

why is chocolate poisonous to dogs but not to humans?: "chocolate contains theobromine, an alkaloid that dogs can't metabolize quickly. if a dog ingests a large amount of chocolate, the theobromine can build up and reach a toxic level of concentration, leading to cardiac arrest. different types of chocolate are more harmful than others, and the effects will vary, depending upon the size and weight of the dog. however, it is potentially lethal. if you know your dog has ingested chocolate (signs of chocolate poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, excessive urination, a quick heart rate, and rapid breathing) take him to a vet immediately.

	 rebellious behavior in adolescent dogs
	 



pets911 - buffalo.com: "the adolescent, or juvenile period begins as early as four months, and continues until your puppy is both sexually and behaviorally mature. sexual maturity can happen as early as six months, but behavioral maturity sometimes doesn't occur until your dog is a year or two old. adolescence is a stage in your puppy's development that is somewhat similar to the teenage years of children. it is a time of transition and physical, mental, and emotional change. the puppy's behaviors are changing from the immature behaviors of youth to the mature behaviors of the adult" . . .a time of change means that a dog's behavior patterns are variable. your puppy may immediately respond to your every request one day, and act as though he can't hear you the next. more puppy like behavior patterns may be the norm for a few days, followed by the actions of a mature dog. he may greet a stranger with typical puppy exuberance one day, and shy away from him the next. many adult behavior patterns fully develop between one to two years of age. it is not uncommon for some types of aggressive behavior problems to develop during this time. puppies of this age still have a strong urge to chew. this is normal.  --it's a good thing they're so cute!e.s.

	 methods to stop the itching 
	 



allergy problems in dogs: "cold water will usually reduce itching and produce temporary relief. it doesn't really matter how the water is applied, but it must be at least cool. this effect doesn't last long, usually less than one-half hour. adding episoothe oatmeal shampoo, episoothe oatmeal creme rinse, aveeno colloidal oatmeal, relief shampoo or domeboro's solution helps to prolong the effect. all of these products are available over-the-counter. if you use aveeno, one to two tablespoons per gallon of water, applied as a rinse, works best. follow the directions on the domeboro packet and also apply as a rinse. shampooing will sometimes help to control itching. some shampoos such as pyoben and oxydex, act to reduce the bacteria level on the skin, one cause of itching. seba lyt and other sulfer/salicyclic acid shampoos reduce scaling. lytar, clear tar and other tar containing shampoos reduce itching and oiliness. an emollient or moisturizer used after shampooing will restore some moisture to the skin and this also reduces itching. expar creme rinse can be used to kill fleas after itching and moisturize the skin. antihistamines are useful in the treatment of itching in some dogs and cats. used alone, about 15 to 25% of dogs will respond to antihistamines. used in combination with fatty acid inhibitors, such as dermcaps, efa-z and omega efa capsules, about 25 to 40% of dogs will respond, reducing scratching behavior to acceptable levels. antihistamines available over-the-counter are benedryl (diphenhydramine, 25mg capsules) and chlortrimeton (chlorpheniramine maleate, 4mg tablets).

	 prutitis - aka itchiness
	 



allergy problems in dogs: "pruritis is the name for itchiness that causes pets to scratch. several chemical reactions occur in the skin that stimulate the nerves, causing the brain to feel the itch. we treat a scratching pet by attempting to eliminate these reactions at the source and controlling the body's response to them as well. some of the chemicals involved in itching are prostglandins, arachodonic acid (a specialized fatty acid) and leukotreines. by using treatments that inhibit the action of these factors at the skin level, such as antihistamines and fatty acid competitors, we can sometimes control the itching without using corticosteroids such as prednisone. if we work to control other irritating factors such as fleas, dry skin and secondary bacterial infections we can also further reduce itching. each of these steps is very important because pets have an 'itch threshold'. this is the point where all of the sources of itching finally add up to enough irritation to cause the irresistible urge to scratch. just like pain thresholds, these levels vary from pet to pet. control of every factor that possible is important to your dog's health and comfort. pruritis is a complication of many diseases. only by careful examination, diagnostic tests and sometimes even trial and error can we come to understand what causes the itching in a particular pet and how we can best control it.

allergy problems in dogs: "most allergies that appear to be grass allergies are actually inhalant allergies to various pollens --- which can include grass pollens. the pollens collect on the grass and dogs that are sensitive to them get exposed to high concentrations running through the grass. allergies most commonly cause skin itchiness in dogs and that is the symptom you see. if keeping him out of the grass during allergy season works, that is great. if it doesn't you may need to use medications or consider hyposensitization to whatever he is allergic to." --so many things to consider in allergic reactions: diet, inhalants, pollense.s.

	 watch out for these disease carrying pesks
	 



ticks and fleas ï¿½ prevention and removal: "ticks are opportunists. young ticks will wait weeks for some warm-blooded creature to come along, and when they find it, they hop on and attach themselves to the skin, or even climb into ears. in order to lay eggs, they must fill up on the creatureï¿½s blood; then they drop off. in addition to the discomfort they cause an animal, they also may carry serious diseases that can be transmitted to humans like lyme disease and rocky mountain spotted fever. to prevent a tick infestation, brush your animal well before venturing out into known tick habitats, like open fields or forests. remove as much loose hair as possible, and treat the coat and skin with a natural flea and tick repellent (see below). work it in as well as you can. once you return home, check your petï¿½s body for ticks by using a fine-toothed flea comb. they will be evident as tiny black spots, and you may find the area around them raised or inflamed. if there arenï¿½t too many of them, you can pick them off manually with a pair of tweezers. grab them as close to the skin as possible, and slowly but firmly pull gently to eject them. pulling slowly is key; if you pull too quickly you could dislodge the body without the head. (not a big deal, but may lead to more inflammation.) if you find a large number of ticks or find them hard to remove, contact your vet immediately.

      dear dogs and cats:the dishes with the paw print are yours and contain your food.  the other dishes are mine and contain my food.  please note, placing a paw print in the middle of my plate and food does not stake a claim for it becoming your food and dish, nor do i find that aesthetically pleasing in the slightest.the stairway was not designed by nascar and is not a racetrack.  beating me to the bottom is not the object.  tripping me doesn't help because i fall faster than you can run.i cannot buy anything bigger than a king sized bed.  i am very sorry about this.  do not think i will continue sleeping on the couch to ensure your comfort. dogs and cats can actually curl up in a ball when they sleep.  it is not necessary to sleep perpendicular to each other stretched out to the fullest extent possible.  i also know that sticking tails straight out and having tongues hanging out the other end to maximize space is nothing but sarcasm.for the last time, there is not a secret exit from the bathroom.  if by some miracle i beat you there and manage to get the door shut, it is not necessary to claw, whine, meow, try to turn the knob or get your paw under the edge and try to pull the door open.  i must exit through the same door i entered.  also, i have been using the bathroom for years-canine or feline attendance is not mandatory.the proper order is ... kiss me, then go smell the other dog or cat's rear end.  i cannot stress this enough!to pacify you, my dear pets, i have posted the following message on our front door:rules for people with-out pets who visit and like to complain about our pets:they live here. you don't.if you don't want their hair on your clothes, stay off the furniture.   (that's why  they call it "fur"niture.)i like my pets a lot better than most people.to you, it's an animal.  to me, he/she is an adopted son/daughter who is short, hairy, walks on all fours and doesn't speak clearly.dogs and cats are better than kids.  they eat less, don't ask for money all the time, are easier to train, usually come when called, never drive your car, don't hang out with drug-using friends, don't smoke or drink, don't worry about having to buy the latest fashions, don't wear your clothes, and don't need a gazillion dollars for college -- and if they get pregnant, you can sell the children.   love, mom and dad
