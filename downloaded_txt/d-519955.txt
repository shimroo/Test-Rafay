ragdale is...“ragdale is a place where creativity is nurtured in all its forms. i expected the solitude, the new friendships, and the time and space to write. i just didn’t expect to be treated so well. poor, struggling artists take heed: at ragdale, life is rich.”christine piper, writer














ragdale youth engagement programragdale artists present a series of talks, lead workshops, and discuss their professional careers to students from kindergarten through college. school visits are arranged with teachers and unique programs are developed along with the artist to present topics connecting curricula to the artist’s work. during on-campus site field trips, students learn about residency programs, visit with artists in their studios, and witness the creative process directly.
