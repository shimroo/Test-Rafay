only at oakcrest







elisa torres
“it’s really good for the students to know that the teachers love their subjects and not just teaching it, but also living it." ms. elisa torres. 















jessie waites
“what i find really beautiful is that everyone here, from the students to the faculty and the faculty to the students, everyone really does want the other to be happy, and they are willing to walk with you to get you there,” mrs. waites says.















liz rolwes, dean of students
“an oakie is a young woman who strives for excellence, not necessarily to perfection, but she knows herself and is generous toward others. an oakie knows how to stand up for what she believes in and has a real love for the world, making it as good as it can be. wherever she touches, it will be better.”















stephanie passero
“(an oakie) understands that freedom is not merely saying or doing whatever she wishes, but uniting and informing her thoughts with the christian understanding of virtue,” ms. passero explains. “she understands the importance of the great thinkers of the past, and is willing to consider that foundation before reaching her own conclusions."















mary warren
"i feel like i've come home," mrs. warren says. "this is where i belong. i'm excited about watching our students grow and graduate."















margaret sweatman
“oakcrest’s mission of cultivating virtues in our daughters extends from the classroom to our courts, fields, and pools,” mrs. sweatman explains. “oakcrest educates the whole person. sports allow our daughters to experience challenges and teamwork in a unique and beautiful way that transforms their confidence into strength.” 















cynthia bertolini 
“oakcrest has really stayed true to its mission through substantial growth,” mrs. bertolini said. “that hasn’t been easy and it hasn’t been linear, but oakcrest has taken its mission very seriously in an uncompromising way.”















monica pompei
“the joy and the mission (of oakcrest) have remained exactly the same,” ms. pompei recalls. “it has been constant, the dedication to the formation of the students and the quality of the academics and the parent partnership. there is a concern for every single student here.” 















alix baldwin
“overall, the culture here is that of cheerful, hard work and that is what a music program needs to be super successful,” instrumental director mrs. alix baldwin says. “what these girls are able to do even in a smaller school is extremely impressive. music is a really enjoyable way for a girl to experience god - all of the beauty should direct to god. they love this music that hopefully gives them another way to consider the beauty of god.”















christie keuchel, head of school 
“i’ve had many friendships develop through the years because of oakcrest. i enjoy being part of the lives of the girls and hope to encourage them to do their best and love life. there can be challenges that young women face, but we at oakcrest have the opportunity to really impact the girls in a way that can help guide them to make great choices aiming for the good, the true and the beautiful.” 



















 
  





why we love oakcrest





celina heeter schneider '95, mother of addie '27 and ellie '29
oakcrest is a unique place, that truly nurtures a girl, helping her to develop into a well-rounded, thoughtful person. someone who strives to reach her potential in the vocation she has chosen, whether that be doctor, scientist, ceo or mother, while being compassionate and generous in her pursuit of excellence. the longest and truest friendships i have made have been at oakcrest. there i was able to grow as a whole person alongside people who had similar values and goals; together we grew in character and skill as we pursued new and different interests and talents.




margarita ucero, mother of ana '22
i believe in strong woman leadership. i think the school has gotten that formula right. i think the school teaches our daughters to understand what god’s plan might be for each of them and instructs them how to put those gifts to work for the greater good of humanity. the world today requires a lot from women, with many narratives, and equipping them with the truth is important for them to succeed. i think oakcrest has figured out a way to give our girls a beautiful balance of all of those elements to hopefully choose with wisdom the grace of the spirit in their minds and hearts as they go throughout their lives. and that is priceless.




frances north '20
at the end of the oakcrest journey, a girl leaves empowered to make a difference in the world around her and to continue discovering who she is and how she can best fulfill her vocation, which is truly the quest of a lifetime.




giorgina (agostini '15) narango
at oakcrest, i was the first exchange student to be sent to our sister school, orvalle, in madrid, spain. this exchange played a huge role in my interests and professional life today. i learned the importance of communicating and collaborating across differences, as well as the significance of learning languages and appreciating  different cultures.




judy gallagher '00
i learned the value of being the most knowledgeable person in the room when it comes to advocating for a position.




ana gamonal de navarro, mother of lourdes '21, bianca ‘23 and veronica ‘25
from day one, oakcrest was a very welcoming community. from the front office personnel, to the admissions team, to the head of school, oakcrest exemplifies the type of ambiance you want to raise your daughters in: respectful, faithful, intellectual and joyful.
