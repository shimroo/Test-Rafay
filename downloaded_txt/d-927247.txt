kudos to my express advisor, katie, and the techs at this dealership.  katie was professional and personable; there was nothing lacking in her customer service.  i also appreciated the cleanliness and space of the waiting area.  my car drove very well during my roadtrip after my car was serviced here. - wole ogundeleshannon price provided an excellent customer service.  she was able to schedule an appointment for my vehicle rear camera in a timely matter.  her attitude and care, provide a service beyond expected.  definitely, we will continue visiting and promoting your shop.  thanks üôÇ - maribet lopezjustin was outstanding.  he was very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. he kept us informed about the delivery of our 2022 cr-v, and once it arrived,  he informed us very well about the features of our new car.  thanks justin, and ed voyles honda for making my wife and i extremely satisfied customers. - jim adkinsmy family enjoyed our customer experience with the ed voyles team who helped us with our car purchase. the sales team made the experience exceptional.‚Äã  - blackwellsgreat dealer experience. leo was able to help us work out a deal for a new cr-v that worked with our budget in a car market with high prices and limited inventory. would recommend to anyone interested in a honda. loving the car so far! - viktor gemelev
