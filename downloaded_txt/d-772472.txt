about this site cowboys for christ (cfc) was founded in 1970 and is a ministry that god called to reach out to the livestock industry worldwide. everyone is welcome, you don’t have to be in the livestock industry or a cowboy or cowgirl to be a part of this group. we are highly evangelical and very mission minded. we don’t take the place of the local church. we work with local churches to fill the kingdom of god.
the doors of cowboys for christ fellowships are always open to everyone; the saved and the unsaved, city and country folks alike.
come as you are.
god bless you all. see you on the trail.
