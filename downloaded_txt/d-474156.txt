rooted in excellence

the lake placid horse shows have a rich history dating back to the early 1930s, with roots in gymkhanas and races sponsored by the lake placid riding club. however, it wasn’t until 1970 that the modern version of the horse shows began, marking a significant turning point. over the years, the shows have evolved from modest beginnings to becoming a premier destination on the national hunter-jumper horse show circuit.





















today, under the stewardship of philip richter, the lake placid horse shows remain a pinnacle of equestrian sport, offering world-class competition in a picturesque adirondack setting. with a rich legacy spanning decades, the shows continue to thrive, drawing top riders, enthusiastic spectators, and maintaining their status as a highlight of the summer for equestrians nationwide.
