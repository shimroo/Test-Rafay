who we are
the ucsd faculty club, a not-for-profit california corporation, was established in 1968 to provide a place for faculty, staff, and the campus community to meet regularly, both formally and informally, to exchange ideas and information. the ida and cecil green faculty club building was opened in 1988 as a dining and conference facility to be used for hosting meetings of club members and guests. membership privileges include weekday lunch, and occasional happy hours, the seuss library as a “landing spot” between classes or meetings, special events, and the ability to book the club for personal events such as weddings or birthdays.
for groups or parties of 15 or more for lunch a private room rental is required. 
please call (858) 534-0876 to make your room reservation.
