home » maine environment newslettersmaine environment newslettersmaine environment newsletters are informative news publications that keep nrcm members up to date on the environmental challenges facing maine, including ways to take actions to help.
learn about our work addressing the effects of climate change in maine, what nrcm is doing to keep maine's waters healthy, how we protect maine's forests and wildlife, and ways you can help make maine communities more sustainable. get up-to-date information about legislative issues at the state and federal level that may impact the environment maine people and visitors to our state treasure.
we also produce two special editions of maine environment. our legislative priorities highlights proposed legislation nrcm staff will be paying close attention to during each upcoming legislative session, and our one-of-a-kind report card for maine’s environment appears post-session to show where maine’s elected officials were successful—or not successful—at protecting land, air, waters, and wildlife mainers rely upon for a strong economy and healthy lives.
the natural resources council of maine is a nonprofit membership organization protecting, restoring, and conserving maine's environment, now and for future generations.

 nrcm recognizes and honors the houlton band of maliseet indians, mi’kmaq nation, penobscot nation, and the passamaquoddy tribe, collectively the wabanaki nations. wabanaki translates as “people of the dawn.” the wabanaki nations have stewarded maine for generations, stretching back to before colonial settlers forcibly occupied the area. nrcm’s office in augusta is on the unceded territory of the penobscot nation, and all of us in maine are on unceded lands once overseen by wabanaki people. let us remember this history and move forward with a commitment to justice and alignment with wabanaki nations in maine.
