back to school time





you may, at this point of the summer, be more than ready for the kids to get back to school. for parents of adhd kids, there are typically mixed emotions. yes, it will be good to get back to a regular routine and, no, you are not looking forward to the phone calls from teachers.

normal kid behavior or add?





what is normal kid behavior and how does that compare to add adhd signs and symptoms kids exhibit? it’s standard for children to on occasion fidget, forget their homework, get distracted in the classroom and to act first and worry about the consequences later. it is when these kinds of actions move from infrequent to frequent that parents and teachers begin to suspect attention deficit disorcer. if you suspect difficulties with your child's hyperactivity or distractibility, you can look at this online adhd test.

diet and attention deficit disorder





research suggest that a healthy eating plan can influence the signs and symptoms of attention deficit disorder. the foods most likely to trigger aggravation are dairy, wheat, corn, eggs and citrus fruits. because each child is unique, the key is to test and find out what foods irritate cause adhd symptoms. finding the ideal diet for your child can take time – upwards to 8 weeks to show improvements. if your child is deficient in certain nutrients, dietary supplements like attend can have a positive effect on your child’s signs and symptoms.

helping your child through better nutrition.





did you know that almonds provide more vitamin e than any other nut?  the vitamin e content works synergistically with  flavonoids in the almonds to produce an antioxidant effect beneficial to the digestive tract.so, much better for your child than a chocolate bar with almonds, is the following muffin recipe made with almonds. this recipe also is protein packed.protein muffins with almonds.½ cup ground almonds1 cup ground flaxseed.½ teaspoon baking powder1 teaspoon baking soda¾ cup whey protein powder1 teaspoon ground cinnamon½ teaspoon salt½ teaspoon ground cardamom2 eggs1 tablespoon coconut oil2 teaspoons vanilla extract2/3 c soft tofu2/3 cup grated carrotgrated zest of 1 organic lemonpreheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.mix together dry ingredients - flaxseed, ground nuts, baking soda, baking powder , whey protein powder, spices and salt - in a small bowl. mix liquid ingredients – eggs, coconut oil, grated carrot, tofu, vanilla and lemon zest – together in a large bowl. then gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients being careful to only mix until just combined. overmixing will produce a less than desirable outcome.pour the mixture into muffin tins lined with paper cups and bake for 20-25 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out clean and dry. overbaking will produce a dry, unappetizing muffin.if there are any of these delectable muffins leftover, be sure to store in the refrigerator or freeze.for more add-adhd healthy recipes, click here.

natural stress relief.





dealing with a hyperactive child can be hectic and stressful until behavior is brought under control naturally through the proper supplements, like attend, and diet, while your natural instinct as a parent is to focus on your child, for your own health’s sake, you need to focus a little on yourself.take a few moments for some of these natural stress relievers for a happier, less stressed out life.take a hot bubble bath; have one glass of wine; get plenty of sleep; walk away from the stressful situation; try yoga; take time for quiet time every day to relax, read or pray; use aromatherapy; eat healthful meals with plenty of fruits, vegetables and lean proteins; take a walk in nature; drink plenty of water; talk to a friend who is not critical or pessimistic; forgo alcohol, caffeine and tobacco; listen to subliminal tapes with a relaxation theme; exercise three to six times a week.

relieve stress by doing good.





did you know that you can relieve stress and feel great at the same time just by performing acts of kindness? it is all so very possible according to recent medical studies.in a national institutes of health study, the brain activity of volunteers was measured who donated cash to different charities as part of a computer game. when they "gave" money to philanthropic organizations instead of "pocketing" it, a part of their brains was activated that produces the hormone oxytocin. according to one of the researchers, this is a hormone that leads to relaxation.you don't have to empty your wallet to gain the effect of this beneficial brain produced hormone. you can get that same effect by simply performing a random act of kindness every day - like smiling at someone passing by. or, how about volunteering at a library reading to children or serving at a soup kitchen every once in a while.the benefits far outweigh the effort for a happier, less stressed out life.

get the lead out





 if your child has learning or behavioral issues, removing heavy metals and other toxins can greatly improve symptoms. edta chelation therapy is widely recognized as an effective treatment for people with lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, and other metal toxicities. health professionals have used edta for over 50 years for heavy metal removal. edta is completely safe, fda-approved for treating lead poisoning and toxicity.edta (ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid) works by attaching itself to heavy metals and carries the metals from the body. tricardia, an edta oral chelation therapy, is designed to cleanse and detoxify the body of toxic heavy metals and wastes, cleanse the cardiovascular system and cleanse and detoxify the liver, kidneys, gallbladder and lymphatic system. tricardia uses 1.2 grams of free form edta along with 31 other free form amino acids, a series of ascorbate complexes and phytomedicinals to aid the removal of heavy metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic, nickel and aluminum while supporting the heart, liver and other organs.

put your brain to work





 the brain is a muscle and like any other muscle, it needs to be stretched, pushed, pulled and flexed to keep it strong and supple. the term “use it or lose it” definitely applies to the brain.using the brain often will help you to become a better thinker while also increasing your ability to focus. if you flex your brain muscles often and in the right ways, you will become a more skilled thinker and increase your ability to focus.
