hey everyone, we are david and wendy carter.
we started westiefied out of a deep passion for west coast swing. wendy and i travel to events year round and are active members in the austin westie community. over and over we see the same issue.
where do i go to find information about west coast swing?
maybe it’s in your city or for an event or just trying to find resources to improve your dance.
we wanted to help so westiefied was born.
