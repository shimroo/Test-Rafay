off-world

 a security breach at a top secret facility, known as sector x, resulted in the escape of a classified specimen known only as ld100. the prognosis for humaity is bleak. you, and the rest of the survivors, must find your way to silo 59, where your only chance of escape is aboard the spaceship scf intrepid. we can only hope your escape to a new planet isn't a worse fate than being left behind.

the house of four suits

 a secret underground organization called simply "the house of the four suits" has sent you an invite to an old abandoned house connected to an unused and forgotten mortuary. unfortunately for you, it turns out this group is composed of nothing but cold blooded killers who hunt humans for sport and send the bodies of their victims to be buried in unmarked graves. your objective is to traverse these decaying hallways and find your way to freedom, before one of the four suits finds you!

sunk

 a curious look at the interior of a derelict submarine leads to tragedy as you find yourself on the bottom of the ocean, being chased by altered and distorted sea life and creatures. is this nightmare caused by the radiation leak from the sub, or from something far more sinister?

reindeer manor history and new location.


reindeer manor is proud of its new home in grand prairie, at alliance skate park located within lone star park! we were at our old location for 49 years and in that time we accomplished lots of fantastic things, countless scares and untold memories.  the area being developed led to us moving and we made the decision early on to take things in a new direction. afterall, we couldn't replicate the vibe and look of our old buildings so we decided to not even attempt that. instead we decided to go a whole new direction and while you can expect the same level of detail and terror you've become accustomed to, things will be fresher and updated far more often, with new scares and themes each season. our stage shows will remain, as well as our passion for safe and intense haunted houses. we're excited about what the future holds at our new location. and while we will always miss and fondly remember the old place, not having to deal with mud in bad weather, wildlife and neighboring development will be a welcome change and allow us to focus on what we do best...scaring you!
