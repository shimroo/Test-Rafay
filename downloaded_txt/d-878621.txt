interlibrary loan servicesmetro membership (metropolitan new york library council)
metro is an organization providing essential services and support to its member libraries across the new york metro area. with over 250 members, metro is the 9th largest organization of its kind in new york state and one of the largest in the world. some of the benefits of our metro membership include:

professional development (so we can be better librarians to service the students, faculty, and staff)
access to grants that will give us funding for various library activities and projects
learning about emerging technologies through workshops that metro provides
and various other benefits

another important benefit to our membership with metro is the interlibrary loan privileges they provide to our library. with interlibrary loan, our library will have access to collections from other metro libraries in a timely manner. metro provides our library with referral cards by subject or title and this makes it easier for students and faculty to locate desired materials or research topics of interest.​
