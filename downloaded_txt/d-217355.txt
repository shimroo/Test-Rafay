welcome
to a place of peace and prayer.
we are a faithful and joy-filled monastery of benedictine women near kansas city. our service to god’s people flows from our primary ministry of daily prayer and the witness of our community life.




share our mission
the benedictine sisters of mount st. scholastica were founded in atchison, kansas, in 1863. along with seeking god through prayer and community, we have served others for many years as teachers. today we share our faith not only by teaching, but through our ministries of sophia spirituality center and keeler women’s center. these ministries respond to the spiritual and temporal needs of our times. we also witness to the sacredness and interconnectedness of god’s creation through our spiritual formation, education, and advocacy.
