food and friends

are you looking for a fun way to help the dc community that involves food and friends?  then look no further!  the non-profit organization food & friends is looking for volunteers to help make the 14th annual dining out for life as entertaining and rewarding as possible.  on thursday, march 11th, more than 150 restaurants around the dc metro area will donate 25 to 100 percent of their profits to support food & friends' mission of providing nutritious meals to those facing serious illnesses such as hiv/aids and cancer.to make the day the resounding success it should be, food & friends is calling on volunteers to act as "ambassadors" to represent food & friends at each restaurant.  ambassadors will visit the diners' tables, thank them for coming out to support such a great cause, sign the diners up for the free sweepstakes and receive any extra contribution the diner may wish to give.  without volunteers, food & friends would not be able to continue home-delivering life-sustaining meals to thousands of area residents.  becoming an ambassador is an excellent way to help the community while having a great time.  for more information, contact eliza yoder, special events assistant, at eyoderatfoodandfriends.org   or 2/269.6826.  to become a food & friends ambassador, please visit: http://www.foodandfriends.org/site/c.knknkposhqe/b.5720913/k.f979/volunteer.htm

dc dog owners hound council to reject bag tax

from the dc gop with some minor editing (snipping) from me:washington, dc: environmentally responsible dog owners in the district are urging the dc council to reject the proposed tax on paper and plastic bags imposed under a bill introduced by councilmember tommy wells as the "anacostia river cleanup and protection act of 2009.""we all want a clean city, and plastic bags are an essential tool for keeping it clean," stated dc republican committee chairman robert j. kabel. "but this bill is just a new tax that will punish pet owners who clean up after their pets, bo obama would not be happy with this piece of legislation." kabel owns a dachshund and, like most pet owners, carries plastic bags to clean up after him on their daily walks. "this proposal will force us to purchase more costly plastic bags, rather than do what environmentalist have taught us to do: reduce and reuse!" says a petition signed, so far, by more than 100 residents and dog owners in the district.under wellsâ legislation, a five-cent tax would be imposed on all paper and plastic bags received at restaurants, grocery stores and retailers that sell food, such as cvs/pharmacy.  wellsâ bill claims the revenue will clean the anacostia river, after purchasing tens of thousands of reusable bags for low-income residents and conducting a consumer education campaign.   ânot only does this tax not make sense, but also it ignores the reality that 94 percent of americans reuse their plastic shopping bags,â says kabel.  âif we tax shopping bags, what will be next?  tires, starbucks coffee cups, ketchup packets and even old reusable bags are just some of the other things you can find in the anacostia river and its surroundings.â  the dc republican committee offered testimony to wellsâ committee hearing and offered a more comprehensive solution. the first part is to take part of the districtâs budget, which has skyrocketed 42 percent since 2004, and fund the cleanup of the anacostia river. the second is to promote recycling and work toward changing the human behavior problem of polluting. âwe should make efforts to change the hearts and minds of people so they pollute less,â concluded kabel.  to sign the petition online, visit http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/dcdogssaynobagtax/.
