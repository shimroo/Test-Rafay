we are in the dept of ecology & evolutionary biology and dept of entomology at cornell university. our lab studies the ecology and evolution of plant-insect interactions, including aspects of herbivory, community ecology, defense theory, phenotypic plasticity, chemical ecology, and coevolution. research projects include work on local biodiversity, milkweeds, and monarch butterflies. see also the cornell chemical ecology group. we are especially keen to work on combining comparative phylogenetic approaches with experimental evolutionary ecology as a means to link natural history, evolutionary convergence, and strong inference towards understanding function and ecological outcomes.
