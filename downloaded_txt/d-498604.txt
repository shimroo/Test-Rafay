 featured programs




    

tumble bees
tumble bees℠ is so much more than a gymnastics program for preschoolers. our emphasis is not on being the fastest, the strongest or the best. instead, it is on the excitement of learning.

  i love this place.  more importantly, my baby loves this place.  we do tumblebees and swim, and it has helped my baby with her social development and her motor skills.  the teachers are great, the classes are great and typically around 6 kids for my baby's age, with parents in the classes, and everyone works hard to make sure the place is clean and safe for all the athletes in the building.

  we spend a lot of time at kids first and i highly recommend.  be it swim lessons, tumblebees, a bite in book bums, or parents nights out, the kids always have a great time.  where else can you have one kid enrolled in dance and the other in karate at the same time?!  the facilities are amazingly clean, especially considering all of the kids running around. the instructors are great. and the support staff is always friendly and helpful. the website makes it super easy to enroll and change extracurriculars...as there's so many options to try!
