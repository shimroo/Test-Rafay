                  web design & development
                


                  our process-driven approach to web design and development is engineered to help your organization quickly strategize, prioritize, and execute digital experiences that matter to customers.
                















                  custom software & apps
                


                  non-software companies with great ideas on how to digitize their services or solutions, or solve a business challenge through custom software often need help turning their vision into reality. that's where we come in.
                















                  ecommerce & pim
                


                  our technology studio specializes in pim, dam, mdm implementations and ecommerce transformations leveraging the power of pimcore -- the world's most flexible and powerful unified digital platform.
                















                  kiosks & in-store experiences
                


                  customer experience and user experience intersect at the in-store kiosk. whether it's an in-room directory at a four star hotel, or a food-ordering system for a cafe, these projects demand excellence in user interface design and execution -- that's what we do. 
                















                  sales & pricing tools
                


                  what are the challenges and friction points slowing down your sales team or agents in the call center? too often the sales organization is the last to benefit from digital transformations -- ask yourself what happens if you turn that equation around?  
                















                  ux optimization
                


                  there's a big gap between usability and great user experience.  our user experience team can help you push beyond interfaces that simply work to best-in-class experiences that increase affinity, encourage sales and encourage customer loyalty. 
                



















               strategy + execution
              


no other vendor delivers the depth of strategy that lightning jar does.
