the panamanian poet ricardo miro, in his poem patria suggests that panama was made so

              small, so that it could be carried in the heart.  we all

              carry panama in our heart until the end of time.

        my goal is to bring a little happiness

        to my fellow zonians through images from home in the canal zone.  if i can get

        someone to smile, utter a wow or a sigh; then doing this web site was worth every minute

        and dollar spent creating and maintaining them.

        in perpetuity

all 
          who are zonians carry a solemn responsibility. as our parents before, 
          and we ourselves, have lived, benefited and accepted the administrations 
          of the government of the panama canal zone, we became "de facto" 
          citizens of that government – we have become "zonians". 
          that government is no longer viable, and the canal zone no longer exits. 
          yet our earned birthright as zonians, we carry forever. we carry the 
          responsibility to perpetuate this birthright so all men will know of 
          the achievements of the "ditchdiggers" and the successes of 
          the government and its society. we zonians, and other like us, carry 
          the responsibility to be the guardians of this piece of history.
