 last update feb 23 2009hello fellow letter carriers,we have to stick together people. when this mail count ends we are all going to lose. everyone better get ready to fight. this mail count is so manipulated some one should go to prison. you may think i am being negative but just wait and see. we can not sit back and take it this time. i think a class action suit may be our next move!postalsherry@yahoo.com



lets fight this time! the postal service is trying to save all the money on our backs. what the hell about potter and his $800 thousand per year pay check. were the ones breaking our backs. cut the pork belly from the post office! leave us rural carriers alone, we took our cut last year! stop the madness
