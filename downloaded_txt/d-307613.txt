                  with the aging of populations in most countries of the world, 
                  the diseases that are most common in old age take on increased 
                  importance. among these diseases, few are more devastating than 
                  alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. these 
                  conditions involve the deterioration of a person’s memory, 
                  followed by other aspects of intellectual, emotional and cognitive 
                  functioning. 
                  

                    the canadian study of health and aging is a study of the epidemiology 
                    of dementia in canada. it has followed over 10,000 elderly 
                    canadians over a ten-year period from 1991 to 2001 and has 
                    collected a wide range of information on their changing health 
                    status over that time. 

                    this web site explains the study goals and methods, introduces 
                    you to the data collected, and gives a summary of the main 
                    results. it is divided into sections written for researchers, 
                    for policy makers and for the general public.
