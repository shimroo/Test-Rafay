how it works
farmsx is the world's only trading market for farming communities direct to the market or restaurant. farmers directly own the relationship to buyers who support them.  as a farm, you make all the money other than a small 25 cent transaction fee. simply create an account on farmsx, set up payment and banking instructions, then participate. we are better together! 
bid on a single farming product or thousands of farming products to lock in the price. monetize your farming output with the only forward market for farming communities.

about us

while we have diverse experiences and backgrounds, farmsx was borne while we were teaching an entrepreneurship seminar in mali, africa to 50 promising men and women. 
one member of the seminar said his dream would be to start a meat processing plant in mali, but no bank would lend him money because there was no commodity market for meat in mali and therefore no way to lock in the price for the product.   we agreed with his conclusion that a bank should not lend him money as there was too much risk.   from there we built the first multi-purpose online geolocation based commodity exchange for emerging markets. 

using our core geolocation exchange technology, we decided to not only help the farmers and hotels in africa, but every person on the planet with a commodity market for micro-farm agriculture, transportation seats, freight and parking spots. 
through investing heavily in technology and a robust series of patents over a number of years we arrived at farmsx, shipsx, seatsx, routesx, parkedx and more.

our services









people in the city
smart citizens recommend farmsx to their friends. know where your food came from and the pride the farmer took harvesting your vegetables and livestock.  know the farmer who raised your food.







virtual farm hubs
a virtual hub is a farm community address which is common to many people on the system.  the farm community could be an actual local farm, a local farmers market or a local grocery store who carries local product. farmsx is food for the people by the people. dont see a virtual farming hub market near you? just submit your local farm of choice to our network and we will add it.
inquire to have farmsx come to your state or city.







quality and safety
all farmers back their products on the exchange. all shipments are backed by the shipsx delivery system farm to market.







policies
 commitment times and dates are firm or the contract is in default and the buyer or seller are entitiled to replacement costs for the products.







payment
since we are a market, not a service, we recommend using debit cards with your accounts to keep the financial service transaction costs free or minimal. we want you to keep as much of your money as possible. while we recommend debit cards, we do accept all forms of payment. if you do choose to use a credit card, your balance on farmsx will be increased by your purchase amount less the applicable credit card processing fees. farmsx charges 25 cents per trade for buyer and seller. the balance is transferred from buyer to seller through the farmsx bid-offer market system.







refer a friend
10 commission free rides for each friend you refer who signs up and is approved. help your friends save more money on transportation. import your contact lists to help spread the network to increase parking spots available. we are better when we work together.







price
we are a market and community of farmers, not a farm. we charge 25 cents per transaction as a fee, then buyers bid pays the seller the balance through the farmsx system. farmsx empowers people, not a company.  our favorite charity to donate to is you!







companies and schools
smart companies have partnered with farmsx to know the food quality demanded by their hard working employees and students. smart companies contribute to clean skies and better air to attract the best employees to their city. farmsx not only improves the quality of student life by creating a system for students to save time and money but the service actually benefits the culture of the university or school campus itself.







environment
combining the foodie body food search engine with farmsx, typical users are able to make 1/5th the environmental impact while optimizing their protein intake. 







transaction confirmation
review the trade and product confirmation process. see your hub to hub farming market addresses, visual hub map display of delivery and delivery confirmation details.
