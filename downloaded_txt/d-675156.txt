we specialize in nyc tenant
                engineering services
                and we primarily represent only:

                tenants
                &
                tenant associations
                &
                tenant attorneys



we
                provide the
                personal service
                you demand and need. 


                don't make the mistake of thinking the size of an
                engineering company 
				will affect the outcome of
                your dispute. 

				at a large public dhcr hearing,
                joel teicher, p.e. 
				was representing independence
                plaza tenants association, 
				a giant housing
                community in tribeca, new york city. 

				testifying
                for the tenants association in a dispute 
				over a
                substantial rent increase, 
				the building owners
                were represented by a force of ultra high-priced
                engineers, 
				architects, accountants, and
                attorneys. 

				the dhcr hearing officer ruled that
                the joel teicher, p.e. 
				engineering building
                report would be given equal weight 
				to those
                high-priced engineers and architects.

s0some recommended don'ts:

don't
                        ever agree to any landlord taking your
                        apartment 
                        without consulting a tenants' rights
                        professional.

don't
                        ever agree to anyone raising your rent
                        without consulting a tenants' rights
                        professional.

don't
                        ever agree to anything when you 
                        just have a feeling something is wrong
                        without consulting a tenants' rights
                        professional.

don't
                        ever let yourself get "put-off"
                        by anyone 
                        or any city agency, 
                        when you know something is wrong with
                        your 
                        apartment and/or building 
                        without consulting a licensed
                        professional engineer.

don't
                        ever go to court without an expert
                        witness: 
                        a licensed professional engineer (p.e.)
                        is acknowledged 
					in all courts
