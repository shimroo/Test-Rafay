i strive for excellence, i leave perfection to
   god.  since 2000, 20 yrs
puppies go home at 8 weeks with first puppy shot,
      & wormings
long coated or long hair chihuahua's can take up to 24 months of age to get their full
      coats. 
  i breed for; health, type,
      temperament,
i'm a breeder, that breeds for the average
      size chihuahua 4 to 6 lb
small but yet large enough not to break a leg
      jumping off a couch.
a chihuahua can be up to 6 lbs or larger
      sometimes.
this is still a very small
      dog
when you can have 5 in your
      lap.
yes, i will have a very small pup that the
      public calls tea cup.
but i do not breed for this nor try for
      this.
when a breeder breed's for this they breed
      small females to small males.
i will not
      risk their lives so the public can have another 2-3 lb dog.
my pups are born and raised in our home, pups
      are paper trained,
they are use to tv along with all of the
      family noises.
they are not in a "puppy
      room"
i share my living space with mother's and
      their pups.
no the pups do not run free they are in
      excersize pens.
that are 16 sq ft in size. so there is room
      for beds, food, paper,
and also important playing
      room
and mothers can come and go at will or locked
      up if needed
so our pups do grow up living with us and seeing us all
      day. 
 only breeding the long coat since
      2000, 21 years
    all pups go with a one
      year health guarantee
i strive for excellence, i leave perfection to
   god.
