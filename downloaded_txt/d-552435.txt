welcome!
greetings!  i'm one of the plethora of ryan simmons out there.  i'm originally from saranac, michigan but now live in ellicott city, maryland.  i still consider myself a michigander, however.  maryland's a perfectly nice state, but there's too much of the great white north in me.  i'm also an engineer at nasa goddard space flight center in greenbelt, maryland.  not quite a rocket scientist, but rather a rocket engineer.
if you like live music, then please check out my concerts on bonnie branch site.  i host several concerts in my living room each year.
i've added an online photo gallery page with links to a few photo galleries i've created.  i hope you enjoy them.
visit my other pages here on this site or check out some of my favorite links.  if you're interested in sending me a message, then please do.
