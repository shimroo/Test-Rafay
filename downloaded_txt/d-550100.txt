chesterton schools networkour high school is affiliated with the chesterton schools network, an internationally-acclaimed network with a rigorous, integrated curriculum designed to unlock student potential and prepare students to succeed in college and professional life, and to excel in service of family, of country, and of christ our lord.

our lady of the sacred heart academy is a non-diocesan, non-profit, independent, private school rooted in a classical academic curriculum and teaching students from grades pre-k-12, administered and staffed by catholic laymen and incorporated under the laws of illinois. independent of the diocese of rockford, the school is not an agency of and is in no way connected or affiliated with the diocese of rockford or any church; however, as faithful, practicing catholics, the school trustees, administrators and full-time teachers joyfully sign an oath of fidelity to the magisterium and a profession of faith to the catholic church. the academy maintains open and cordial relations with the diocese of rockford, and we recognize and respect the proper jurisdiction of the local bishop in matters relevant to instruction in the doctrines and beliefs of the catholic faith.
