our current sermon series“ezra: rebuilding the ruins”at new life we believe in the importance of preaching through books of the bible on sunday mornings. (for an explanation of why we think this is important, you can go here.) since pastor bob has concluded his sermon series on ephesians, he has begun a new series on the old testament book of ezra, a book that is often overlooked but that has much to say to us in our current cultural moment. there are many who believe our culture is in ruins, which was exactly how god’s people felt when they returned to jerusalem after living in exile following the destruction of solomon's temple. how did they engage in the rebuilding process? what opposition did they face? and how did god show his grace and faithfulness during this time? we will explore these and other questions as we study this fascinating book of god’s holy scriptures.
