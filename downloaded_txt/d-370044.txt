supporting our community



each year, we assist more than 10,000 people experiencing homelessness. last year, we help place nearly 900 people into affordable housing — and then support them in retaining that housing.

55 years of service



for over 55 years, transition projects has delivered life-saving and life-changing assistance to some of portland’s most vulnerable residents. whether by helping a homeless veteran and her family find housing, sheltering hundreds of people each night with nowhere else to turn, or opening new pathways to employment, transition projects represents an invaluable part of portland’s social fabric.



our work in action



our team works to engage folks at all levels of their journey from homelessness to housing. whether it's getting critical support to our unhoused neighbors on the street, providing shelter for folks to reset and set their sights on housing, or bringing online innovative, deeply affordable housing solutions, we meet and support the many needs of the community we serve.
