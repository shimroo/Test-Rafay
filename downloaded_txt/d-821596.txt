welcome totumwater



tumwater is known as the first community west of the cascades. rich in history and the home of excellent schools, restaurants and businesses, this thriving community maintains its small-town feel.
tumwater was recently voted as the fourth most popular city in washington to raise a family by nerdwallet.com.
historical tumwater is located between seattle and portland on the i-5 corridor, serving travelers with a central location for exploring puget sound and its beauty, including mt. rainier, mt. st. helens, the pacific ocean beaches, and the olympic rain forest.
the tumwater chamber celebrates being part of the community for over twenty years! our strategic plan for now is focusing on our three main goals : 1) adding value to our members, 2) promote business and tumwater, 3) grow the network. your support and participation will help us reach our goals.
