about us
we are a family owned business started in 1997 in north carolina, where we were residing at the time. the idea came when we were continually unable to find period accurate patterns for our various costuming needs through the internet. we realized there was a need for a ready resource for a variety eras which were under represented through a reliable internet resource.
we opened our store in 1997 only representing 2 pattern companies, laughing moon mercantile and moirandall patterns. more >
