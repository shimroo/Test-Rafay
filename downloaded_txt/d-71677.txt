we have assembled our collection ofbisque into  "groups".
each group is divided into  "sections" of similar items.
then each section is divided into "pages" where needed...
  
for the kitchen
kitchen ware is sectioned alphabetical by mold company's. 
this keeps accessories styles of items together.example: boothe molds - farm canister set, 
farm s/p set, farm napkin holder, etc.
