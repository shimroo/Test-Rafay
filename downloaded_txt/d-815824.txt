charleston sc based photographerphotos by jonathon stout  jonathon stout aka badjon, has been a charleston based photographer since the early 2000's. focusing lately on infrared photography and the dying age of polaroid pack film, he tries to express unique visions from his thoughts. he constantly keeps an eye out for unique scenes or old abandoned buildings. telling stories through photos is a big part of his photography.   in 2017, jonathon put together a black & white portrait series for redux contemporary art studios. it featured over 120 stark portraits people from all walks of life in charleston. the exhibit was one of the last shows in the old redux studios space (on st philip street).  more info










charleston city paper link about the show





  in early 2018, jonathon put together an exhibit at the orange spot coffee shop, showcasing 14 different framed pieces and over 100 different prints. the show was up for a month and was one of the most successful shows the shop has had.  striving to bring creative people together in charleston, badjon created a joint print pop up shop at king street collective.  the event was held on april 7th and had 14 other artists involved. more info  jonathon covered the 2018 high water music festival for the charleston city paper. he captured all the bands with his digital camera, but also shot old polaroids of some of the acts. he captured this stunning shot of local legends shovels & rope before their performance this year. more photos
