impedimetric measuremnent of exchange currents and ionic diffusion coefficients in individual pseudocapacitive nanoparticles
congratulations to prof. lior sepunaru and graduate student brianroehrich, on their publication in acs measurement science au. in this paper, they introduced a groundbreaking method- a fast fourier transform electrochemical impedance measurement over a single pseudo-capacitor. these measurements allow the identification of features at the nanoscale that give desirable properties and ultimately create better materials as a key component in fast-charging batteries. the paper will appear as the front cover, a testament to their recognition as part of the 'rising stars in measurement science.'
