our mission statementwe, the augustinians of the province of our mother of good counsel, are members of the worldwide order of saint augustine in the roman catholic church. centered in the eucharist and prayer, we search for god in community by sharing our lives, goods and spiritual journey with each other and the people of god. in harmony of mind and heart on our journey toward god, our experience of common life flows into and shapes our ministries. we continue to serve the church in schools, parishes and missions as we seek to discern new paths of service to which god calls us.
