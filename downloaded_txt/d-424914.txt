make every journey unforgettable with flying dutchmen travel

at flying dutchmen travel (fdt), we specialize in crafting unforgettable travel experiences designed around you. with over 50 years of experience, we've helped more than 80,000 travelers create memories that last a lifetime. whether you dream of a music-themed cruise, a family getaway, or an adventurous river cruise, we ensure that every journey is perfectly tailored to your desires.
since our founding in 1974, we've become known for our personalized service and commitment to excellence. in 2010, we broke new ground by booking our first music charter with royal caribbean cruise line (rcl). this move transformed the industry and helped us become rcl's number-one charter client in just ten years. our cruises have featured artists like blake shelton, melissa etheridge, kenny loggins, and dave koz, allowing travelers to connect with their favorite performers on the open sea.
as the only woman-owned agency in the music charter space, we bring a fresh perspective to every planned trip. with a deep understanding of global travel, we're here to meet your personal and group travel needsâwhether you're looking for adventure, relaxation, or a unique event experience.
