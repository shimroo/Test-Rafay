with everything that is going on in our world today, everyone is a critic.  i'm really no different, except for the fact that i'm royalty and you're not.  
   in retrospect, that's a rather large difference and pretty much makes my opinions that much better than yours.  heed the gospel...

cookie cutter rap stars

i cannot begin to explain how much i dislike most of the rap that is coming out these days, it's all cut from the same damn template and sounds the same, especially the south.everyone's talking about a damn dance move or their grill in the chorus.  shoulda lean, lean wit it rock wit it, shake it like a salt shaker...wtf?  get a lyric like you made it past the 3rd grade.i love the south, but the old south/midwest was what it was about.  three six mafia back in the day when they were triple six mafia, ugk, do or die, scarface, old lil flip, old outkast, goodie mob, old trick daddy, the original hot boys and big tymers, master p, silkk the shocker, c-murder...the list goes on and on.anyhow, now it all just sucks and it's not only the south...but mostly!  even my favorite rapper of all-time, e-40, whom i have been listening to since the 4th grade is weak on the hits and has gone completely commercial.to the point, this yung joc guy that i am hearing everywhere, and about from everyone, is the worst of them all with his awful club anthems. he must be hated on; his arsenal is whack.  the most whack of them all and i am sick of hearing it.check out joc's videos "it's going down" and "i know you see it".  listen to the lyrics, compare to the above groups, eazy-e, dre, snoop, pac, biggie, nas etc etc and ask yourself, "is this for real?  gtfooh meng"joc, you have officially been 'hated on'.  i would honestly rather listen to and watch eddie murphy's "party all the time" than your sh$! (fyi at 0:39 seconds is where eddie's video seals the victory).

just because it's free doesn't mean you should do it!

social networking wasn't that big until a year or so ago, but it definitely has it perks.  mainly for those folks that don't have the gift of gab or simply have no hair on their chest, it gives them a shot in hell of actually meeting a decent broad.   but then, there are these guys who are just simply s.o.l. no matter how the cards play out.  i get the most akward feeling just looking at this pic, and reading the by-line is just icing on the cake of uneasiness. where do you get the balls sir?  where?!

"lady in the water?"  she'll drown!

well, m. night shyamalan is at it again and this time it's with the film 'lady in the water."  i personally hold very little hope for this movie.  i'm still not sure what the big deal about shyamalan and his movies is.i will give him "6th sense"...that being said..."signs" was a decent movie with some good star power in mel gibson and jaoquin phoenix.  but for all the hype, you never saw an alien and in the end - yes i'm going to ruin it....but then again you can't you ruin a bad movie - they chase the aliens around with baseball bats and come to find out, the aliens can't get wet.so, for all the terrified people...just move to oregon or washington, the rain will keep you safe."the village" was one of the first dvd's that i really gave rts (return to sender) approval to because when i finished watching it...i threw it on the floor, yelled at it and immediately took it back to blockbuster.  i waited for that movie to come to video forever, thought it would be the scariest thing ever; i'm an idiot.  like gw says, "fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on you again but..."again, you never really see the faces of the scary animals, and when you do it's painfully obvious that it's humans in boarhead masks and robes.  the whole "village" is actually a secluded community on a nature reserve in new york (?) somewhere...very stupid.* the wolf character that i keep catching glimpses of in "lady in the water" commercials looks eerily similar in     composition to the "evil" characters in "the village"so, let's breakdown shyamalan's track record with an all-encompassing quote of sorts:"it's like being 16 and getting blueballed - all that anticipation, effort and ultimately the painful letdown..."i predict this movie will do well for about 2 days, and that revenues will fall sharply therafter. people need to stop giving this guy props...please. (the folks that wrote the new time machine actually had scarier characters, what does that say?)

i love advertising! (part 2)

so, i have stumbled upon a couple more interesting ads.  i've appropriately named them "wtf wolf" and "alabama personals"."wtf wolf" is pretty self explanatory.  i'm just not sure what he has to do with anything.  did he eat all of the crappy mortgage offers or something?  or did he eat all of the stupid applicants?  i'll go with the latter."alabama personals" is pretty straightforward too.  the only thing that would make this more authentic is a moon shine still in the background, complete with grimey bathtubs and some suped up model t's just waiting to hit the backroads with the goods.what kind of game do you think dude on the right has?  i'm thinking the one liners are something like:"i kin play the spoons.  wanna make some babies?""babydoll, i jes wanna put ma arms around yeh like a fresh possum coat""widout yeh, my life would be all sour and empty, just like ma momma's mouth"she, on the other hand, is giving that look that says it might not even take a pick-up line. anyways, you get the point....

i love advertising! (part 1)

since i am officially an advertising junky, i have to start blogging about it more.  i can't believe i have touched on it so few times.i am always amazed at the ways that creative minds try to reach people.  sometimes they're creatively smart (bk's huckin chicken), purposefully stupid ("head on, apply directly to the forehead...head on, apply directly to the forehead...head on, apply directly to the forehead" headache commercials...vomit) or just comically terrible (any lbj sprite ad...someone fire their creative team already).anyhow, since i work primarily on the internet i have chosen to spotlight some of the more intriguing ads that i run across daily.  so, enjoy part 1 of this new installment...so this ad is selling curry...would you buy anything from these guys?  they smile like that and they specialize in crap that burns your insides.  wow.  i really do not trust that guy in the background...i get this in my email from time to time and it makes me wonder about the legitimacy of certain online schooling.  have a click and check out that bottom left corner.  was this that same genius chimp that beat out launchpad mcquack to be the first visitor to mars on ducktales (please tell me you remember that episode)?this is almost as sweet as that commercial where two people are making out in the back of a car and it ends up being the parents of the young couple in the front seat.  gross...yet intriguing and most importantly, creative.
