“john and his team delivered!”
john and his team provide top tier services with a price point that will not set you back. the value is unmatched. i knew i found the right place after my first zoom meeting with john. after dealing with different attorneys in different arenas, i was a skeptic before meeting john face to face. after our initial meeting all my fears were gone. john is very down to earth and very easy to talk to. i did not sense the slightest hint of ego or intimidation that i have seen with other attorneys. john and his team delivered! i felt that with the guidance and information given to me by this company that i had full confidence in this solution to my challenges. not only did i have confidence in johns knowledge of his profession, i had full confidence that all of johns team were there to support me with any questions or concerns. i feel a thousand pounds lighter after this experience with drlc and i would send my closest friends and family in their direction if ever the situation arose.

“they were prompt and reminded me often of what the next requirements were so that i never skipped a beat.”
mr. colwell and his team were awesome in assisting me through what started as a chapter 13 and converted to a chapter 7. they were prompt and reminded me often of what the next requirements were so that i never skipped a beat. the courts know his team and work with them to see to it that matters get resolved quickly. i would encourage anyone considering bankruptcy to contact drlc first!

“it is truly a "bankruptcy miracle", and you can have one, too. i can't say enough about drlc!”
unfortunately, i had to file bk 13; but luckily, i found debt relief legal clinic. it was recommended by a friend who was worried about me because i originally filed pro se (without an attorney). i can't even imagine what would have happened if i had continued pro se. (well, actually i do know: the case would've been dismissed immediately, and i would've been screwed) but the brilliance of this team has kept my case alive for over a year now, and i can't thank them enough! it is truly a "bankruptcy miracle", and you can have one, too. i can't say enough about drlc, but let me put it simply, you're crazy if you use anyone else or represent yourself! ;)
