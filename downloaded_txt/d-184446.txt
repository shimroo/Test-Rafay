tales of a patchwork life
brighid ‘biddy’ mclaughlin

brighid ‘biddy’ mclaughlin, the acclaimed irish journalist and storyteller, has endured unthinkable tragedy—the murder of her beloved sister siobhan and the devastating drowning of her husband. yet, in the face of overwhelming grief, mclaughlin refuses to be consumed by darkness. from behind the half-door of her enchanting dalkey cottage, in exquisite and honest prose, mclaughlin reflects upon the cherished memories evoked by the objects surrounding her, carrying the reader along on a journey of grief, resilience and hope. from the delicate madeleine tray that whispers siobhan’s name to her own folk art illustrations that dance across the pages, mclaughlin’s memoir is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of storytelling to heal even the deepest wounds.

seamus murphy stone mad
50th anniversary limited edition. mercier clothbound classic
exclusive limited edition (1 of 300)
linen, creamy paper, photo inset with foil on the title.
‘in the sharply formal conversations of the stonemen, the bittersweet flavour of provincial ireland is presented with neither sentiment nor adornment.‘ —william trevor, the guardian
‘the men who have gone before us have left us a heritage to be proud of; and we feel our own contribution has been for the good.‘ —seamus murphy, from the preface to stone mad.
in ‘stone mad’ seamus murphy tells the story of his seven years spent as an apprentice to the stone carving trade, the growing knowledge of the challenges and joys of stone – and of the men who worked it. his artistic feeling for the quality responded to his workmates’ reverence for ‘the well made thing’. the result is a book of surpassing beauty, full of warmth, humour and profound perception.

the essential george boole: logic, love and legacy
machale, desmond  cohen, yvonne  
‘the essential george boole: logic, love and legacy’ is a captivating portrait of a brilliant mind and the family that shaped him. george boole, a largely self-taught genius, as a youth mastered multiple languages and scientific disciplines and later developed symbolic logic and what is now called boolean algebra, the foundation of modern computing. he rose from poverty to become a respected professor at queen’s college cork, now university college cork. 
it is believed by some that he inspired arthur conan doyle’s creation of professor moriarty, the arch-enemy of sherlock holmes. but boole’s story isn’t just about logical and mathematical prowess. he was married to a remarkable woman, educationalist mary everest. their five remarkable daughters and subsequent generations carried on a legacy of brilliance, breaking barriers in science, medicine and literature. geoffrey hinton, george boole’s great-grandson, is the 2024 nobel laureate in physics. boole’s story as one of the founders of the digital age is one of perseverance, love and ideas that changed virtually everything.

jackie loves johnser ok?
neville thompson
johnser kiely was brought up the hard way, one of a large family in a glass-splattered playground in a ballyfermot estate. johnser finds love and trouble in equal measure as his reckless impulses lead him down a dangerous path. while jackie clarke is drawn to his wild spirit, johnser’s knack for robbing and fighting could cost him everything – his freedom, family and his very life. tensions build to a pivotal night when a gun is drawn and fates are forever altered in this gritty tale of star-crossed lovers from the wrong side of the tracks. mercier press recently reissued and updated the original dublin novel (1997) of the classic love story about hard man johnser kiely and his long-suffering partner jackie clarke. this cult classic is now a cannes-celebrated film by gilles lellouche ‘l’amour ouf’ (beating hearts).
‘the most important book of its generation’ – mark cagney, morning ireland
‘jewel-like scenes of dublin’ – sunday times
‘roddy doyle with knobs on!’ – rte guide
‘thompson’s ability to, by his own admission, write for non-readers, make his books unputdownable’ – tara o’liaith
