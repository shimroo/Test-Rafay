exceptional real estate company! we've purchased two homes in the yucatan and have been impressed with the level of service provided. honest, informed and knowledgeable. very responsive in both english and spanish. highly recommend!

hello friends! as i mentioned previously, jan and i have sold our house in tamanche. i want to take a moment to commend the service we received from our realtor, realestateyucatan isaac. isaac is kind, caring, detail-oriented, thorough, and a true professional every step of the way.
the best part is...in 2016 he also brought us our buyers - rick murphy and john devine - for our beach house in telchac puerto! both houses designed and built my talented husband jan.
the photo is with jan and me and isaac in the back row, along with the new family who bought our house in the foreground.
thank you isaac for everything. we loved working with you then and now. abrazos!
april 2024
