about each, click on an image    

a little known sub-group of 
railroad steam locomotives consisted of engines that used gears together with 
steam cylinders (common on all steam locomotives) to produce more "constant" 
pulling power than the conventional and more prevalent "rod" type of steam 
locomotive.   the most prevalent geared 
locomotives were shays, 
climaxes, and heislers.  each were made by 
different companies with different means of implementing geared power to their 
drivers.  click on each of the images at the top of this page to learn about the 
specifics of each.


the geared locomotives were 
the "4 wheel drive" versions of their cousins, the "rod" locomotives. the geared 
locomotives were lighter, smaller, and had geared transmissions to provide 
steady, constant power to all wheels or drivers (as they are known in the 
railroad world). they were designed to climb steep grades (in excess of 10%), 
operate on lighter, smaller rail (for economy) and on rail that was often 
crooked and poorly maintained (also for economy purposes). 
for the most part, they were 
used in the lumber and mining industries. the rails were laid to the timber or 
minerals to provide a practical and economical means to transport these 
commodities out of their locations and to the mills for processing. the life 
span of particular section of track lasted no longer than the time it took to 
remove all the timber or minerals. once the lumber or minerals were removed, the 
rail was pulled up and moved to other areas where they would be laid for the 
purpose of removing more timber or minerals. the idea was to "get in and get 
out" as quickly and as cheaply as possible. unlike passengers or freight 
transported on the mainline railroads serviced by the "rod" locomotives, the 
logs and rocks didn't care how bumpy or uncomfortable the ride was. this often 
meant the roadbed was constructed on sharper curves as well as rougher and 
steeper grades than those made for the "rod" locomotives. in at least one 
instance, one timber company actually laid and operated daily over rails that 
were laid through  an active stream.
