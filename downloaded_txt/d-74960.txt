a hot item on the internet is the metaverse.  this is a virtual (not real) world where people can own real estate and even build houses.  the problem with all this is that the costs of land and construction are being paid in real dollars, not virtual money.  in many cases, this involves borrowed real money.  if electrical power goes down at the metaverse's servers, the metaverse disappears.  power might be restored, and the metaverse might then reappear if the servers were not damaged.  however, debts for buying into the metaverse remain; and borrowers must continue to make payments on those debts even if the metaverse evaporates.    

have you ever heard of the "bigger fool" concept?  it involves someone (a fool) buying into a not-so-great investment, hoping to sell it at a profit to a bigger fool.  to me, this is what investing in the metaverse, various crypto-coins, and non-fungible tokens (nfts) represent.

i get phone calls — robocalls — claiming to be from amazon, apple, and others.  those calls assert that a large purchase has been made against my account.  i am told to press 1 on my phone to cancel the purchase or else press 2 to confirm the purchase.  i always press 2.  i have no such accounts.

anyone who thinks government owns a monopoly on inefficient, 
obstructive bureaucracy has obviously never worked for a large
corporation.

when i turn on the faucet, water comes out.  at night, the street lights come on.  our streets are swept, and our joint school and public library continues to operate.  both children and adults enjoy themselves in our community's parks.  our public schools are as good as any other schools — public or private — in california.  deputy sheriffs patrolling our streets and judges in our courtrooms keep our community's crime rate very low in a county with one of the lowest crime rates in the nation.  mail is delivered six days each week.  in oak park, government is working; it is not our enemy.
