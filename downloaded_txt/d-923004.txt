about getbullish

		 			 		   jen founded getbullish as an advice column in 2010 after penning some notes on a napkin for a book called ‚Äúhow to make money without becoming a republican.‚Äù she has since spoken at harvard, yale, mit, barnard, jp morgan, and many others about designing your own career, multiple income streams, networking without being fake, and combating sexism in the workplace and every day. she runs getbullish from a glam office/warehouse in brooklyn. her last name is pronounced ‚Äúdi-zura.‚Äù		 			 		 




			    	      as a speaker, she‚Äôs warm, engaging, and funny. she‚Äôs got an olympian amount of energy, and she always leaves the audience with practical, appealing tips for taking action.			    	       -meg ahern


			    	      jennifer is funny and engaging, and provides useful information and techniques you can implement immediately. she has a knack for taking complicated concepts and explaining them in a way that‚Äôs accessible.			    	       -lindsay lavine


			    	      i am grateful to the beautiful brains of jen dziura who had the ballsy idea for the bullish conference, and the gumption to follow through on that ballsy idea.			    	       -jamie lee
