fair warning, if you're having a bad day: it brought the racists out of the woodwork.http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/09/11/haddayr/








i love cussing, queers, the first amendment, and disgusting but brilliant insults.

does this mean i have to love football now?"i think people might say, 'but why did you have to go so far?'""it's about the swearing, isn't it?""does that not discredit maybe the argument you're trying to make? would you write it differently if you had to do it over?""no, i wouldn't . . . people who look at the letter and all they take from it is the swearing? you're not looking at the message of the letter. i agree that the swearing might be off-putting at times, but i enjoyed writing it. it's entertaining for me to craft a well-honed insult."oh, kluwe. my one true love.http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1684512068001?bckey=aq~~,aaaacc6ogze~,l0btvfk9n15fmf18purmad2hu9up9yrl&bctid=1828544462001(context, if you don't already know it: http://deadspin.com/5941348/they-wont-magically-turn-you-into-a-lustful-cockmonster-chris-kluwe-explains-gay-marriage-to-the-politician-who-is-offended-by-an-nfl-player-supporting-it)edited to add: omg and then this http://blogs.twincities.com/outofbounds/2012/09/08/out-of-bounds-blog-no-8-inquisitive-kitten-pawing-at-yarn/

more information on the cancellation of the public auction (this may not be a victory, for instance, as the 'owners' could be contemplating a private sale): http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/08/24/black-hills-sacred-site-auction-cancelled-130890some context in terms of what might be next based on the united nations special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples:http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/sale-of-the-sacred-how-pe-sla-may-test-uncharted-waters-of-undrip








update: pe’ sla auction cancelled

wow!from the pe' sla: help save lakota sioux sacred land! page:"for immediate release: update: pe’ sla auction cancelled on direction of owners’ representative; the tribes of the great sioux nation are moving forward on their own behalf with lastrealindians, inc. in continuing to raise money to ensure pe’ sla will be protected as a sacred site, forever."http://www.indiegogo.com/pesla-lakotaheartland?c=activity








please help the lakota sioux preserve their sacred site

 august 22nd, 2012 (11:36 am)

10  

you guys, please help if you have any money at all. i am just so heartbroken that the lakota sioux have to buy the land that is theirs back, and of course they aren't anywhere close to their goal with only 36 hours left.  i'm not talking in the general like: "all of america is theirs" way. i mean this land specifically was theirs according to treaty until white folks found gold on it, and the "owner" has been "allowing" them to use it. now, developers are trying to hoist up the price and run a road through it. i am unemployed but i'm still donating something; if everyone gave just a little they'd have it. their donation amounts start at $1.00.http://www.indiegogo.com/pesla-lakotaheartland








minneapolis voters: primary information

 august 9th, 2012 (01:25 pm)

one of my dearest heart-friends is naomikritzer, who is hilarious, smart, well-informed, and deeply opinionated. if you want to make a more informed choice in the upcoming primaries, take a look at naomi's vigorous look at the candidates:http://naomikritzer.livejournal.com/265297.htmleven if you don't live around here, her roundups of elections are delightfully funny, often casually cutting, and generally great fun to read.
