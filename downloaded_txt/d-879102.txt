coopers closet is the golden triangles original and largest semi-annual childrens consignment event. we celebrated 20 years in 2022 and added a much anticipated annual adult consignment event in 2023!
 
whether you are a consignor looking to make extra money and clean out your closets or a shopper looking for great bargains and selections, coopers closet is here to serve you.
 
we are proud to offer new and gently used infant, children, and adult items such as name brand clothing, boutique clothing, shoes, nursery items, toys, baby equipment, furniture, home decor and so much more!  
 
thank you to everyone who has helped make coopers closet such a success! we hope that this success will carry on into the future as we continue expanding and growing into the adult and childrens consignments of north mississippi!
