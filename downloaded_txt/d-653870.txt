craftsmanship, value & quality
traditional "old fashioned" craftsmanship is hard to find these days in a society where cheap services, often delivered with short cuts and substandard materials can be tempting to the unsuspecting consumer. country landscapes is proud to be in the business of creating landscapes with craftsmanship and style which will stand the test of time. our ethos is one of quality without compromise. having been established since 1991, we know the quality of our work is appreciated by our clients long after the price is forgotten.














although anyone can make something cheaper, we use the best engineering practices and the best materials, which saves you money by saving you the cost of having to have work repaired or done twice! specialist environmental knowledge and qualifications in subjects as soil agronomy enable us to get the job done right first time whether that be a lawn drainage system, driveway preparation or planting of a tree, orchard or even a new woodland.
