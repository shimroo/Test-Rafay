now on viewreclamation: aboriginal ancestral homeland and resilience of the muwekma ohlone tribefebruary 8 through may 4, 2025in 1925, famed anthropologist alfred kroeber incorrectly claimed that the costanoan native peoples of california had become extinct. consequently, the muwekma ohlone — largely based in the southern regions of san francisco bay — lost federal status even though tribal members had been enrolled with the bureau of indian affairs between 1928 and 1971 and had even served in the united states military. through the images of tribal photographer kike arnal, this exhibition explores the traditions and vitality of the muwekma ohlone and their ongoing struggle to regain federal status and secure their own sovereignty.
