the longest continuously-running film festival in northeast pennsylvania!















opening night documentary continues to make a large splash















for more than 200 years, the borough of milford, a small county seat in northeast pennsylvania, venerated tom quick jr., who was in 1733 the first white child born in the region. quick was famous for having murdered delaware (lenni lenape) indians in the upper delaware river valley, after having witnessed his father’s death at the hands of the lenape. now, mayor of milford, pennsylvania sean strub, director christopher king and associate producer daniel strongwalker thomas present ‘burying the hatchet: the tom quick story,’ about how one majority-white community comes to terms with its violence past as a means to grow, march forward into the future, and heal.

announcing our opening night filmburying the hatchet: the tom quick story















produced by sean strubwritten and directed by christopher kingassociate producer, daniel strongwalker thomas for more than 200 years, the borough of milford, a small county seat in northeast pennsylvania, venerated tom quick jr., who was in 1733 the first white child born in the region. quick was famous for having murdered delaware (lenni lenape) indians in the upper delaware river valley, after having witnessed his father’s death at the hands of the lenape.in the decades following, tom quick became part of local lore, lionized in books, articles, songs and on stage. in 1889, an eight-foot zinc obelisk monument was erected in milford in his honor. over time, the monument increasingly became a point of deep conflict and re-evaluation, especially in recent years. this new documentary puts history in context and tells the fascinating story of how the community of milford sought to redress an ugly chapter in history. it began with milford’s mayor, sean strub, who reached out to the leadership of the lenni lenape tribes that had been dislocated from their milford homeland in the late 18th century and invited them to discuss how this history could be responsibly addressed.burying the hatchet: the tom quick story is about how one largely white community and disenfranchised tribal leaders worked together to reconcile the past and forge a shared path forward to reestablish a lenape presence in lenapehoking, their original land, based on trust, friendship and an inspiring and healing vision of the future.
