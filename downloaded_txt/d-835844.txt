mixer taps vs standard taps – which is better? 

april 28, 2023april 24, 2023 



despite the various designs of basin taps, your choice will likely be between standard and mixer taps. both taps are great, so it boils down to your preference. before choosing, you should know the features and benefits of standard and mixer taps.
standard taps
standard taps come as a set, one for hot water supply and another for cold water. however, some taps have one spout with two faucets. it is hard to control the temperature in these taps because you get extreme temperatures. if you want warm water, you’ll have to open both taps. 
basin taps have different designs, but the concept is the same. although they are traditional taps, they have stood the test of time mainly because they are timeless, easy to install, and reasonably priced compared to mixer taps. 
despite the advantages, standard taps have some drawbacks.

these taps take up more space than mixer taps.
the turn taps are hard to open for some people, such as children, people with disabilities, or those with hand injuries. 
they cause accidental burns when one opens the wrong tap. for example, young children may accidentally open the hot water tap.
taps fitted on the sink are sometimes difficult to clean, especially the ring around the sink. 

standard basin taps are ideal for people with;

a tight budget.
large sinks with adequate space for two faucets.
a sink with one, two, or three installation holes. 

mixer tap
the mixer tap (thermostated tap) allows hot, cold, and warm water through the same basin tap. the lever controls the temperature of the water flowing through the spout. you can easily change the water temperature by moving the lever.
the mixer tap has disc or ball-shaped valves that open and close depending on how you move the lever. when you want warm water, both sides open slightly to allow hot and cold water to mix as they flow out of the tap. 
mixer taps fit bathrooms of different styles and are favourable in households with young children and older people. 
mixer taps have several benefits. 

you get the desired water temperature quickly.
these taps are fitted with flow limiters to control water flow from the hot and cold water supply. this is why the water temperature is controlled easily. 
it lowers your water bills because you won’t waste water trying to reach the right temperature.
the taps are modern and stylish. they have a slim profile ideal for minimalist bathroom decor. 

you should get a mixer tap if you have;

a flexible budget.
a small sink or a small bathroom.
high water bills and are hoping to control wastage. 

both standard and mixer basin taps are durable. the mixer taps have a 5 -10 year lifespan, while some traditional taps can last 20 years. however, taps will last as long as they are well-maintained. identify issues as soon as they appear, and get a professional to fix them whenever possible. 
when choosing one tap over the other, you need to determine which is more suitable, depending on the type of sink, bathroom decor, and size of the bathroom. you also need to consider ease of use for all your family members.

how to maintain basin taps

april 25, 2023april 24, 2023 





basin taps, like other fixtures, need to be maintained. some popular brands are designed to last a long time. however, if properly maintained, all bathroom taps will serve you for a long time. there are several actions you can take to keep taps in great shape. 
clean the taps regularly 
tap water leaves mineral deposits, grime, and even dirt every time you open the tap. the deposits will depend on the quality of water in your area and the water source. however, when these deposits are left to buildup, they affect water flow.
clean the tap with a soft cloth and a soapy cleaning solution. you can occasionally spray a descaler to remove limescale. however, you should consider the material of the tap when using commercial cleaning products because some are sensitive to some effects.
for example, products that have alcohol, phosphoric acid, and hydrochloric acid damage taps with a brass finish.
check taps for leaks
don’t wait for the dripping sound from your tap to act. taps start with a small leak but worsen if you don’t fix the problem. often, it is easier to fix the initial leak. the longer you take, the more water you will lose, and sometimes the damage on the tap gets worse. 
as soon as you spot a leak, find the source. sometimes the leak is at the o-ring, where the tap meets the sink. other times, it is at the tap mouth. when you spot the problem early, the fix will not just be more straightforward, but it may be cheaper as well.
avoid abrasive cleaners
when cleaning, avoid using abrasive cleaners because these will leave scratches on your sink tap. stainless steel is one of the materials least resistant to scratches. however, some, like brass and wood, scratch easily. it is best to avoid abrasive cleaners, irrespective of the tap’s material. 
use water filters in the plumbing system
water filters along the plumbing system prevent limescale and grime buildup along your basin taps. this is especially important if the water source is hard water. the minerals in the water create a layer in the taps, eventually clogging the pipes and faucets. water filters will keep sediments and minerals from getting to the tap. 
control the water pressure
high water pressure is great because you work faster. unfortunately, when the pressure is too high, it can damage the plumbing system and tap. if your area has high water pressure, you can set up the pressure regulator to control it. 
get a professional to inspect the taps
get a professional if you don’t know what to look for when inspecting taps. washers and seals wear out over time, and you need to replace them before the taps start leaking. taps will perform optimally if all the parts are in great shape. 
tap maintenance will prevent common problems like reduced water flow and leaks. you will save some money because you won’t experience leaks that cause water wastage. delays in fixing tap issues may result in tap replacements, which can be expensive.

if you plan to go for the traditional or a modern type of tap, then do your homework once again. each type has its pros and cons, and you should be aware of all. for instance, for wall mounted type of tap, getting repaired later on is truly troublesome. it might take a hell of money, and the entire look of the bathroom may have to be changed, for that matter.
at the same time, if your washbasin height is such that it doesn’t allow floor fitted tap, then better decide something else. the floor type also comes with an open fitting, and you won’t be able to hide all the pipes hanging along with taps. 
one size fits all might not work:
each type of toilet taps in singapore has its unique characteristics. you can’t just have all types in your place and can’t choose one for all fitting. it is not one size fit all. you can have a customized look and feel for your kitchen and bathroom, and you can choose the same for all. the decision is all yours. just make sure you know what it takes to have one choice and not the other. in the end, the money required in purchasing one type and get it installed is also essential.

after 4 years the bones of children grow rapidly and they need a mattress with firm material because the firm structure supports the backbone and helps in the development of the body parts. when a child reaches 7, the time of sleep reduces to some extent. also, children of such age do not sleep for hours, rather they normally have disturbed sleep pattern. thus, getting the right mattress is very essential.
asking recommendations of medical practitioners:

how entrepreneurs benefit from kickstarter shops in singapore

september 6, 2020august 27, 2020 



raising capital has been a great challenge for many entrepreneurs. some have incredible business ideas that are likely to succeed, but because they don’t have sufficient funds, they never realize their dreams. 
although singapore has created mechanisms to make access to capital easy for entrepreneurs, startups are a challenge for many lenders because they carry a greater risk than established businesses. fortunately, crowdfunding has increasingly become an option for creative entrepreneurs who believe in their business prospects and seek financial support from multiple sources. 
kickstarter singapore shops are one of the platforms available for entrepreneurs to seek financial support from those who believe the business is likely to succeed. there are several benefits to choosing this option as a source of capital for a startup. kickstarter shops are a way of doing business that benefits the customer and the designers of such products. delivering quality and innovative products to customers helps to improve lives and allows new solutions to help the world. an example of a kickstarter product selling online platform that does so successfully can be found here.
great way to market and validate your ideas
although all business ideas deserve a chance, not all of them are valid. sometimes your business idea may have a wrong concept, or it may not be viable. unfortunately, some of the startups that fail do so because the entrepreneur did not carry out an extensive feasibility study. using kickstarter to raise funds is a great way to discover what people think about your business idea. 
not all entrepreneurs who seek support in the kickstarter shop get the funds they need. if your business idea is not getting a positive response, you should use this chance to analyze and improve it. otherwise, it may be best to develop a different strategy that potential investors will find appealing. 
quickly build a following
in this age of social media, most companies have come to rely on having a massive following because many followers often translate to a greater client base. kickstarter campaigns will help you get funding and a client base ready to purchase your products.
you will also save time and money since you will not follow the traditional production process. for example, if you are going into manufacturing, potential buyers would already be anticipating the products even before you officially start marketing them. 
a more rewarding and faster way of raising funds
anyone who has sought financing from a bank will tell you how time-consuming and cumbersome the process is. even though you are getting capital from one place, the number of times you will need to visit the bank to plead your case can be overwhelming. 
kickstarter makes it possible for you to reach out to hundreds or thousands of people, so you might raise all the capital you need within a short time. some of the people who will contribute will focus on the project’s potential, while others may only be interested in giving you a hand.
others may choose to support you because of the return on investment, depending on what you have promised them in return for the investment. so, given that contributors have various reasons for supporting you, you are more likely to raise funds much faster with minimal effort.
on the other hand, banks must weigh the risk because bad debts have an impact on the institution’s credibility. so, they do everything possible to ensure they are investing in a worthwhile venture.  
before giving up on your business plan because you do not have capital, it is best to ensure you try all avenue, including crowdfunding sites like kickstarter. you need to remember that you are competing with other business ideas, so you need to have a convincing and appealing profile that will attract more people.

importance of communicating with your kickstarter funders

september 2, 2020august 27, 2020 



if you were lucky to get the funding you need for your project from backers in kickstarter, it is rude to walk away with the money without maintaining contact with your backers. you also never know; you might need their backing again in the future.
people who back projects in kickstarter shops do so because they believe in the product. most, if not all, want to know your progress and possibly the challenges you face along the way. in addition to financing the business, some of your backers may have the expertise to help you navigate the problems you might encounter. 
discuss the funding milestones
sometimes it takes longer to get the capital you need. other times, you might not meet your target within the stipulated time. it is appropriate that you maintain contact with those who have already backed your project. 
you can do this by sending them a monthly or bi-weekly newsletter where you mention your funding progress. if you have a great rewards program, some of those already backing your product may opt to help you reach your target, especially if it is taking a little longer to get all the money you need. 
give updates about production
kickstarter backers enjoy seeing the campaign they backed raise all the money it needs and seeing the product in the market. they hope their investment was worth it, and it is only right that they are made aware of the production process and the market’s response to the product. 
it is especially important to keep the backers updated if they have a stake in the business or if you offered rewards. giving production updates makes you authentic and makes it possible for your backers to buy the products when they are ready for the market. if the backers expect rewards, they can easily remain patient in case you face challenges during production because they were informed of the hitches. 
notify them of new product lines and other variations of the product
when launching a campaign at the kickstarter store, it is recommended that you stick to one product instead of marketing your entire product line or shop. this will help you capture the attention of potential backers faster. however, this doesn’t mean that you should only produce the product you marketed. as your business grows, you can introduce variations as you build your brand.

avoid buying these types of mattresses for your child

october 5, 2019september 25, 2019 



a child not only requires a proper
rest at nighttime but also a relaxing nap during the day. it is one of the most
essential for their growing bodies. it governs how they act, behave,
emotionally and socially grow and learn. they need a comforting environment to
relax in for the journey ahead. if he or she does not get that environment,
then it not only takes a toll on their health but hinders them in progressing
in every field. 
studies show that disruptive sleep patterns are associated with autism, adhd and insomnia that have potentials of getting aggravated if not corrected. now, many children suffer from these problems because of lack of sleep. parents can play a part in avoiding this among many others is getting a comfortable mattress for them to sleep on. till age 10 a child generally requires 11 to 12 hours of sleep, which is more for children under 6. 
therefore, they require a comfortable surface to sleep on that will not disrupt it. many good mattresses are available nowadays with varying types and kinds, but it is preferable to choose that best fits the child and his needs. all children have different requirements and patterns of sleeping that need to be put into perspective when going to get a mattress. many recognized companies deliver good quality mattresses for kids but there are those as well that do not. it is important to recognize such qualities and stay away from. such varieties are:
promotional mattresses and seasonal deals
the buyer needs to be aware of such
deals because there is a catch with such types of mattresses. and it usually
shows up in the form of cheap and low quality. the materials that the mattress
is made of is are surely low quality and that is the sole reason they’re being
sold off at such a price. 
mattresses that are too thin
mattresses must consist of a firmness
and density otherwise they do not conform to the contours of the body whereby
not aligning according to the human spine. therefore, the type of mattress
chosen must be of a uniform density and firmness so that it supports the human
spine and the rest of the body parts. it must be remembered that children have
developing bodies and require those mattresses that support their growth spurts
as well. thin or less density mattresses do not cater to these developing
stages in children
temperature absorbing mattresses
while sleeping the body releases a
lot of heat and for those mattresses which do not provide a release of the
accumulated heat cause a lot of discomfort. this is especially true for little
children because they already have a very fragile sleep and any small
discomfort can hinder them from having a complete sleep. 
mattresses with no warranty
such mattresses are sure to possess
low qualities and for this very reason they do not come with warranties or come
with a very small one. buyers must be cautious of such types because buying one
is usually a onetime investment and for those that spoil early can be hard on
the budget.

supportive and comfortable mattress types for children

september 30, 2019september 25, 2019 



children require more hours of sleep than adults as their little bodies are developing so having a good night’s sleep is so much more important. it affects their health, social development and creativity to a profound amount that might otherwise have negligible impact on an adult. a mattress is where children spend most of their precious time on and it needs to be a certain way so as not to hinder their developing bodies but to support and give comfort to. the routine patterns of children in singapore require them to be all-rounder’s, and to back that up they need a resting schedule. a factor that is most fundamental to having a good night’s rest is having a comfortable children mattress. 
mattresses
come in a variety of sizes and types but it fundamental to get one that
supports the need of the child. another important aspect of choosing the right
mattress is to look for one that is equipped with the right materials as well.
this article will investigate details of which materials are available in
different mattresses and how to choose one that fits a child’s needs.
memory foam mattress
these
types of mattress mold around the contours of the body, thereby, giving support
to each curve. this has a visco-elastic technology which means that while being
firm it also retains its shape. also another impressive quality that these
mattresses possess is that they do not warm up with rise in body temperatures
but have a cooling effect as well. these types of mattresses are very popular
nowadays however, with toddlers or infants they might not be the best choice as
they have an effect of smothering the body which may not suit these younger
children. 
foam mattress
cheaper
than a regular memory foam mattress and made from ordinary foam these
mattresses do not support the body as much and also do not restrict motion
transfer. they may suit smaller children because they do not have an effect of
smothering. 
innerspring mattress
these
mattresses also offer a better contour around the body and are more durable
than other types. made from open coils or pocketed coils, these mattresses fit
a child very well while also considering the amount of mess a child puts their
mattress into. these have been a favorite of parents so far because of their
low cost and durability.
latex mattress
made
of more natural materials than a memory foam mattress and has greater
durability than a regular spring mattress, this type has also been very popular
with the parents. however, a downside that these mattresses possess is the fact
that they can be very heavy. in addition to this, they do not come cheap. latex
is a more expensive and long-lasting material for bed-making. 
apart
from these types and varieties, parents should invest more in the ones that are
made with more natural materials. studies have shown that more children suffer
from allergies than ever before because of the continual breathing of toxins
that they absorb from their vulnerable surroundings.

provides relief to your kids, so it needs to provide comfort to their backs,
legs and other body parts.
so, if you are planning to choose a mattress for kids, then you need to look out for the following factors:
go for brand you trust

which you trust, and which has market value as well. it would be better to see
their reviews on the official web pages to check what people has to say about
them. reputation matters a lot to see what people has to say about the seller. you
can also talk to people who have kids and are using mattresses for their kids.
money matters: what is your budget?
the biggest question which
one needs to keep in mind is the budget allocation for buying a good mattress.
this will help you in making/keeping quick decision about choosing the right
mattresses. even budget on hand also allows you to select the brand which falls
within your allocated budget.
selecting mattress size: height, length and width 
the size and length of the
mattress depends upon the length and height of your child. if your child is in
a growing age, then better go for longer mattresses with better quality so to
enhance its life and usability. also, if the child has a habit of keeping toys
along, then the size of the mattress also needs to be longer. another thing to
be considered is the size of the room as well. you need to see the placement of
the bed in the room along with other things, like study table, toy corner and
other things. the mattress should not be that it makes the room congested and
shouldn’t be that short to not accommodate your child.
choose a suitable mattress type

mattress suits the requirements of your child. there are number of mattresses
available in the market each with specific specifications, thus each has been
designed to keep in mind the customized requirements of all types of clients.

of mattresses available in the market, which are 
spring mattressesnon-spring mattresses (which

another good tip is the testing of the mattress by your child. since your kid knows his comfort level and can very share with you his likes and dislikes, then it is not a bad option taking your child along when choosing a mattress. you can provide them with number of options to choose from. they can be asked to sit, feel and even lay down to check the support that mattress provide to their back.

best non-surgical aesthetic clinic treatments in singapore

june 17, 2019june 17, 2019 



if there were something you could do to look
10 years younger, would you do it? you are likely going to answer
“yes” if you are in your 40s or 50s and have started to experience some
signs of aging. 
regardless of your age, you need to keep it in
mind that there is something you can do to improve your looks or look younger
than you currently do now. if you are new to cosmetic procedures, you may
assume that all skin treatment and enhancement procedures involve going under
the knife. but that is not exactly true, as there are a handful of non-invasive
procedures that can help you achieve a youthful appearance. 
over the years, companies and experts have
created alternative solutions to invasive surgical procedures by improving
their equipment and tools as well as their practices. this makes it possible
for us to achieve a defined chin and get rid of fat without undergoing a
painful surgical procedure. 
in this article, we are going to be looking at some of the best surgical procedures you can opt for in an aesthetic clinic in singapore. 
fillers
this is one of the most popular aesthetic
treatment procedures in singapore because it is effective, affordable and its
effect is long lasting. injectable fillers are one of the best ways to get a
youthful look if you are on a budget. it is also perfect for fixing concerns
linked to facial aging. 
dermal fillers are somewhat different from
other injectables in the market that are made from clostridium and botulinum.
they can be derived naturally (or synthetically) and are injected into the skin
to reduce folds, wrinkles, depressions, and plump up certain areas. 
 thread lift 
a thread lift is an effective procedure for
lifting saggy facial skin to produce a youthful appearance. the procedure
involves the use of sutures that are made from the exact same materials used in
surgeries to close wounds. the threads are strategically used to hold reposition
facial tissues in place, just like a suspension cable.
the procedure can rejuvenate facial skin and
restore youthful contours in areas like the neck, cheeks, jowls, and brows. the
special thread used in the procedure comes with knots or cones that help
stimulate collagen production and hold lifted skin in place. the results can
last from 1 to 4 years depending on the thread used. the ideal candidates for
this procedure are those between the ages of 35 to 65 years.  
microdermabrasion 
this procedure removes dead skin cells and
accumulation through the use of a minimally abrasive instrument to exfoliate
your skin. it is popularly known as the “lunchtime facial” because it can be
done in less than 30 minutes. within that time, accumulations, dead skin cells,
and dull surface layers will be carefully removed. also, collagen production
will be stimulated. people who have undergone this procedure reported a
significant improvement in their skin texture, and tone. the procedure can also
be used to address fine lines, enlarged pores, and mild acne. 
 final note 
these are by no means the only non-surgical
procedures you can get at an aesthetic clinic, there are many more. to narrow
down the one that will able to address your issue, you should consider visiting
a reputable aesthetic clinic with state-of-the-art equipment and qualified
doctors.

i often hear the word “capacity cracking”. it means that the number of people scheduled cannot be gathered. there are times when the number of people cannot be gathered for the capacity that the university is recruiting. it is said that the problem of declining birthrate is being influenced.
economic problems due to the recession are also considered. school management will become difficult for what students will not gather. devices are necessary to acquire many students. it is a loan/school expenses support plan that supports the students of orico at that time. loan the cost of tuition fees and teaching materials costs to the students.
since it becomes installment payment, the economic burden will be reduced and users will be more. schools to be introduced are increasing every year. school officials are a must-see. let’s start by querying from the site. follow the screen and enter the necessary information. first of all, i will select the questions to ask. i want to introduce it immediately, i want to hear detailed stories for consideration, i want to collect information only.
if there is anything else i would like to ask, i will write it in detail in the question column. enter a corporate name, school name, school location, contact person name, contact phone number, mail address. finally, press the accept button and the operation is complete. i will get in touch as soon as confirmation is taken. it is important to take action.
