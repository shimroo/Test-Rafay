about silent voices
silent voices is a pregnancy support center that has provided real choices and real help to women in san diego county since 1984. our staff and volunteers have all had many years of experience in helping women sort out their fears and feelings about pregnancy.
we are not here to condemn or judge — we are here to answer questions, provide resources, and to listen. whether you’re pregnant now or have already had an abortion, we care about you, and we want to help.
