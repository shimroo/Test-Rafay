april, 2023the  important lawsuit update
 

we are pleased to update you on the status of the challenge to the trenton-mercer airport expansion in federal court . on april 3, 2023  attorney, steven tabor, filed the final legal brief in the united states court of appeals for the third circuit.  a request for oral argument would give counsel the opportunity to present this case in person to the judges. we are awaiting the court’s decision on this request. 
 
the briefs highlighted mercer county’s the deceptions over the years as it expanded its infrastructure, operations, and daily flights without a thorough evaluation of the environmental and health impacts of its expansion. 
 
it has been requested the court to: (1) vacate the federal aviation administration’s 2022 approval of the county’s latest expansion project; and (2) require the county to prepare an environmental impact statement (eis). an eis would involve a rigorous evaluation of the environmental and health impacts of the airport expansion on the surrounding communities.
 
as you may recall, the county’s latest project involves quadrupling the size of the existing terminal, constructing parallel taxiways, doubling the number of gates, adding boarding bridges, doubling tsa screening, increasing the terminal apron by 43 percent, and increasing the size of the runway protection zone. this enormous project comes on the heels of years and years of piecemeal development that has allowed the mercer county to exponentially expand the airport without properly considering its effects on the community.
 
thank you for your support as we all continue to object and move ahead with this challenge. iplease check out see trentonthreatenedskies.com
