let's empathize with the reader





						in "confessions of an advertising man," david ogilvy recounted 
						how a great copywriter understands the importance of user experience. 
						in this true story, max hart (of hart, schaffner & marx) and his advertising manager, george l. dyer, 
						were arguing about long copy.
					

						dyer said, "i'll bet you ten dollars i can write a newspaper page of solid type and 
						you'd read every word of it."
					

						hart scoffed at the idea.
					

						"i don't have to write a line of it to prove my point," 
						dyer replied. "i'll only tell you the headline:
						      this page is all about max hart."
						
						— confessions of an advertising man,  chapter 6, "how to write potent copy"



						that scenario took place almost a century ago, yet it's as current as today's ux thinker.

technology"the language of the prospect, not a bit 
                               more technical than that." whatever the technology, its producer and its buyer often speak at very different levels. 
                               and, we tend to forget that they speak yet another language over the backyard barbecue -- plain english. part of my job as a copywriter is to bridge those gaps.

sales promo"sales promotion" used to be just couponing. 
                               today it's much more. i see it as anything that brings the prospect to the register, order form, or handshake. and i've done a lot of that.

there's more than one way to do just about anything. 
but fewer "best ways."
want to make more money? make yourself seem different. what's your position, your 
					unique selling proposition, your benefit and personality? why should people like you more?
it's like that joke about the mule. first you have to get their attention. but 
					that joke never mentions the next step, which is just as important: show them which way to move.
position yourself in their mind by using effective advertising concepts and headlines, 
					call for action, and get things moving in a big way.

									let's look at the big picture, to make more of your budget 
									and improve the aim on your target. find ways to do more, better, for less.

hundreds of articles and press releases.
editorial content that people actually want to read.
as people's reading habits, 
						social values and media choices have changed, so has the nature of advertising, to include seo and 
						web content with editorial value, not just overt "salesmanship."
i've changed, too, having written hundreds of articles on a wide range of subjects, including topics 
						such as paper processing machinery, telephone messaging, life safety, hearing physiology, 
						cognition, acting techniques, small-business practices, audio recording technology and much more. freelance or not, the one thing your copywriter needs 
						to know is ... how to learn.

my first love.
it's not my only love, but it's where i got started -- as a copywriter and producer of radio commercials. 
						lately i've focused again in this field as a trained, experienced voice actor, and writing authority-building articles on related topics 
						(some rather loosely related) such as telephone messaging, hearing physiology, cognition, acting technique, 
						audio recording technology and much more.
