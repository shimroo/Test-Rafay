stay involved





even if you are not running for public office, there are plenty of ways to remain involved in the community. after living in fort smith long enough to have a feel for the community, i and my wife began to spend time with at least a couple local organizations. we don't get to do nearly as much as we want, but we do what we can, whether it is public speaking or knocking on doors for local candidates during election years. those may not be grand actions, but one need not do anything particularly earth-shattering or newsworthy to make a difference. making a difference is what ultimately matters.
