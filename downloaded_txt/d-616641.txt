i want to 
				thank you for visiting my web site customknives.com. i'm  a.t. 
				barr, i've made custom knives since 1979, and i'm a voting 
				member of the knifemaker's guild. although i plan on making 
				knives for many more years, i'm also a purveyor of fine custom 
				knives.


i sell other makers' and collectors' knives on consignment. 
            i'm different than most purveyors. i am also a custom knife maker. 
            with me being a maker, i am able to explain to a prospective buyer 
            why a specific knife is sometimes two or three times more expensive 
            than another. i've been making custom knives since '79 and have been a 
            member of the knifemakers' guild since '95. also, your custom knives are fully 
        insured while at my home where they are stored in a large gun safe, and 
        my home is fully wired with a professionally installed and monitored 
        		(adt) 
				alarm system. all custom knives are 
				commercially insured while in transit 
        to a knife show or when shipped to a buyer. 

        		if you are a collector who wants to move some of your 
				collection, your name is never made public. it does not matter 
				if you have one custom knife or 100 custom knives, i can sell 
				your knives. manufactured knives 
do not sell 
				well on my web site.
