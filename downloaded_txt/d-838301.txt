if you want the best attorney in town, larry shaheen is your man. he's been my attorney for 5 years now, and i can't tell you enough how nice it is to have him in my corner - he's honest, hard working and a passionate guy who will go to bat for you in your worst moments. the rest of the firm is awesome too, from the receptionist full of character to the support staff and the other attorneys. i'm very thankful to have them.
