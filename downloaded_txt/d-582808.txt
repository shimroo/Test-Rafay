gemology tools professional is windows software for researching data of gemstones. the program was started by me, bill wise in 1993. i started it because there wasn’t a program out there for gemologists. surprisingly, there still isn’t a stand-alone program over 30 years later (that i know of). 







* work arounds for mac include installing parallels (not free) or using wine (free). wine does not require the purchase of a copy of windows. we’ve even had customers pick up a very cheap used windows machine because even a 25 year old machine will run gt pro!
