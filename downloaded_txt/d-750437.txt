the band



the idea of north ‚Äî australian a cappella at its finest.



a quintet of musicians, serious about their music without taking themselves too seriously. a bespoke array of harmony-loving vocalists, bringing meaningful music to humans around the globe. an act that audiences come to see for the music, and come back (with friends & family) to see for the feels.with 15 albums, two ‚Äòbest jazz album‚Äô arias and 5 aria nominations under their belt, this group of singers have mastered the art of instrument-free performance. they really need to be seen to be believed, and believe them you will.

support  music



since recorded music became almost free and live performance has become the only way for artists to make an income, the demand for venues and services surrounding live performance has increased and pushed costs up. this makes every tour a financial challenge.many of you have asked how you can continue to support the group, so our gofundme page gives you a channel to donate to the idea of north‚Äôs ongoing viability. any donations received will go directly towards touring and running costs and is hugely appreciated. your ongoing support helps us fulfil our mission of bringing high-quality, positively-affecting music to audiences across australia and the world.
