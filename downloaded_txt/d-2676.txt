when writing reviews, share your personal experience. offer details and tips that others will find helpful in either selecting or using a vendor.
personal experience: please only share your firsthand personal experience, not what you've heard from others.
accuracy: make sure your review is factually correct. reviews with factual errors may be removed. feel free to air your opinions, but don't overstate or misrepresent your experience.
business owners: business owners can address reviews by posting a reply. replies shouldn't be used to launch personal attacks, advertise, or offer an incentive to change a review.
