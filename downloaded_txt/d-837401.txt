daylight world map changes - offices in dark areas might be closed. 
					  the world has 244 countries divided into 9 telecom zones.


					  our telecom activites started in 1671 with louis pajot & leon rouille inventing in our house
					the royal french postal services for king louis xiv. 



					the third bourbon king had already spend part of his chidhood in our old villeroy bourbon mansion  (vb.com)
					first and since 1370 owned by the villeroy family.



					horses were carrying letters from our house  located in the heart of paris at 11 rue des dechargeurs 

					to thousands of pajot & rouille or thurn & taxis post relais. 



					you see our old postal gate in the  above pictures.





					spirit of telecommunication stayed in our walls  and  in the memory of the  thurn & taxis  family.



					thanks to one of them,  1986,  we open a small sony phone boutique 50 m up the road,  cremerie de paris no2



					leading in 1993 to a long distance telecom office and the very first internet cafe in france 

					both operating from cremerie de paris no1 at vb, the  old postal mansion.


					many american tech pioneers came by while travelling through paris where  public internet access was hard to find.



					under their influence was invented  the phone book of the world
					and vb.com (very beautiful / villeroy bourbon), one of the 676 two letter .com.





					a



					 jewel left by the fashion designer coco chanel,
aimee de heeren a ww2 secret service agent and kind of a james bond girl
					 and a man from the first  flight to the moon   helped.


today the magic of the past turned the former  royal post center / cybercafe turn into a
meeting place for  the worlds most famous brands.


again we have the chance to run into many pioneers,

they don't come to send letters
or to 
get internet access, 

but to show their latest products and inventions ...

discover their  pop up stores  while surfing through our phone book ot the world.


our vb mansion  is exactly the same,

even the water fountain for the post horses is still in place ... 

times have changed 

but spirit of telecomunications is full alive ...
