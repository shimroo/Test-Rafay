                                  shrimp 'n stuff
                                
shrimp 'n stuff restaurant opened in 1976 and quickly became known as "the place where the locals love to eat." since 1976 we have had many guests visiting our fine city from across the u.s. who tell us they wished they had found shrimp 'n stuff the first day they arrived and assured us they will be back several times before they leave galveston!
