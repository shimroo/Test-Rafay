greece




most of the worldâs oldest civilizations were born on the 
					banks of some great river, but european civilization flourished 
					thanks to the sea. itâs the greek sea that the romans enviously 
					named mare nostrum. with the sea surrounding three parts of 
					their country, the greeks established contact with the people 
					of asia, africa and the rest of europe at a very early stage. 
					thus, they attempted distant journeys not merely to trade but 
					also to see and learn and in short, were the first to engage 
					in what we could call tourism.

					chania




the city of chania is built according to archaeological searches, 
					on the ruins of a big ancient town. the evidence up to now leads 
					us to the ancient kydonia which, according to diodoros sikeliotes, 
					was founded by minoa and was one of the three big towns of crete. 
					its name is read ky-do-ni-ja on a knossos table of linear b 
					scripture. the kasteli hill, east of the port, owing to the 
					fact that it was adjacent to the sea, made an ideal position 
					for prehistorical settlements. architectural remains that have 
					survived and belonged to big buildings start at the early minoan 
					period (1900-2200 b.c.).
