how can i be certain of the purity?we make sure our products are tested for purity, we even go as far to make sure they are not only tested independently, but also by local companies  that you can trust.
where are our supplements shipped from?we ship all our supplements from our facility in hong kong.
what is tmg?tmg stands for trimethylglycine, also known as betaine. it is a naturally occurring compound found in various plants, particularly sugar beets, and in some animals. tmg is chemically classified as an amino acid derivative and is involved in several biological processes in the body. it is commonly used as a dietary supplement and is known for its potential benefits, such as supporting heart health, liver function, and methylation processes in the body. tmg is also used in some cases to help convert homocysteine into methionine, which can contribute to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. additionally, tmg may have applications in athletic performance and muscle strength. however, as with any supplement, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before using tmg to ensure it is suitable for your specific health needs and circumstances.
