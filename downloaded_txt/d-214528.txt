   durango, colorado is located in
            the animas river valley just a few miles southeast of the
            13,000-ft. high la plata mountains. local attractions
            include the durango & silverton narrow gauge railroad,
            purgatory resort (skiing), mesa verde national park, and
            some of the worlds most frightening highways and jeep
            roads.

in 1982 norman beerger filmed
            and produced what is probably the best video ever made for
            anyone that would like an armchair scenic aerial tour of the
            grand canyon. both the 1-hour and 2-hour versions are
            helicopter tours accompanied by a classical music sound
            track. the included notes can be used as a mile-by-mile
            guide for either the 1-hour or 2-hour versions.

            chama rockfall - a pictorial study
a large rockfall occurred in a
            remote area of the upper rio chama headwaters sometime
            between sept. 1998 and june 2005.  there appears to be
            no available information about the rockfall, and the author
            happened to find it while browsing with google earth.

            glacier. it appears that this anomaly of the taku glacier is
            about to end as the taku appears to be going into retreat.

creationism, intelligent design evangelism,
            religious cultists
               creationism




















            = willful ignorance
a brief review of the
            fallacies of creationism and intelligent design
            evangelism. noahs flood is physically impossible, but that
            doesnt stop creationists from perverting reality in an
            attempt to force their religious beliefs on everyone else.
            is the willful ignorance of the creationists a result of
            fear?

              patriot




















            bible university
very few people have had a
            chance to see the current location of kent hovinds alma
            mater - mostly because its a long way from any other
            educational institution.

              what




















            causes a creationist to be a creationist?
the answer is:  
            fear!
            1) fear of evolution.
            2) fear and hatred toward gays/lesbians.
            3) fear of women.
            4) fear of death.
            5) fear of losing their all powerful father.

            are curves generated by rolling one circle around another
            stationary circle. examples and graphical illustrations are
            given.    

               partitions
how many ways are there to
            subdivide a set containing "n" items?

               rooted
            (oriented) trees
a rooted tree has a single
            vertex (node) desiginated as a "root" (usually at the top).
            travel along any of the edges is directed toward the "root".
            a table is given showing how many structurally different,
            rooted trees exist given "n" vertices.

               non rooted
            (free) trees
a non-rooted tree has a free
            form where no vertex has priority. a non-rooted tree can be
            twisted, deformed, contorted, etc. into many shapes without
            altering its structure. again, a table is given showing how
            many structurally different, non rooted trees exist given
            "n" vertices.

               ordered
            binary trees
a binary tree is rooted tree
            where each vertex can have a maximum of two edges that
            connect to lower portions of the tree. the "root" is
            normally depicted at the top. edges from any vertex in the
            tree will descend either to the left (left branch) or to the
            right (right branch).

               structurally
            different binary trees
how many structurally
            different binary trees exist given "n" vertices?

               structurally




















            different graphs
an unlabeled graph may have an
            arbitrary number of vertices with none, one, or more edges
            connecting some or all of the vertices. if you have "v"
            vertices and "e" edges, how many structurally different
            graphs can be constructed?

            of sorting algorithms
a common task for computers is
            to sort data as an aid to analyzing it. time trials and
            source code are provided for: bubble sort, insertion sort,
            median-of-three quicksort, multiple link list sort, and
            shell sort.

            1) a, b, c, are positive integers
            2) x, y, z are positive integers  > 2
            3) and a, b, c have no common factor?
            if you can answer the above question (with either a yes or
            a no), the american mathematical society has a $1,000,000
            prize waiting for you.
            bad news - there are no counterexamples up through cz

 the great global

            television producer martin durkin has fraudulently
            misrepresented both the data involved and scientists who
            have researched global climate. movie director durkin has

global warming deniers
            misrepresent the scientific facts of global warming /

            take the form of paid political propaganda, ignorance,
            outright lies, etc. the people responsible for these
            misrepresentations can vary from think tanks and lobbyists
            that are financed by large corporations down to ignorant
            individuals. in particular: the oregon

one of the

              in recent years is that global warming stopped in 1998.
              as per usual, this claim is another deliberate gwd

          malignant narcissism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malignant_narcissism

"malignant narcissism is a psychological syndrome
            comprising an extreme mix of narcissism, antisocial
            personality disorder, aggression, and sadism. often
            grandiose, and always ready to raise hostility levels, the
            malignant narcissist undermines organizations in which they
            are involved, and dehumanizes the people with whom they
            associate."


          "a narcissist is a pathological liar who will lie about
          anything and everything for the sole purpose of gleefully
          watching you sift through the word garbage."

          i hate everyone in the white house!: trump seethes as

          narcissistic rage: what causes narcissists to rage?
http://narcissisticbehavior.net/what-causes-narcissistic-rage/

narcissistic rages are not reactions to stress,
            but rather based on the underlying fear of not getting their
            needs meet, a fear so great that it will endure even after
            the threat is gone (vaknin).  because the narcissist is
            hypervigilant to narcissistic injury, he is constantly on
            the lookout for slights, insults, criticisms, or
            disagreements (real or imagined), all of which are
            experienced by him as complete and humiliating rejection, to
            which he will automatically and instantly fly into a
            rage.  the raging narcissists usually perceive their
            reaction to have been triggered by an intentional
            provocation to cause them injury, or prevent them from
            accomplishing their grandiose fantasies.  their
            response to such insult and injury is to detach from the
            person, direct his rage towards the person in a cold and
            aggressive manner, and to devalue the person as they go; to
            other people, the rage is incoherent and unjust.  this
            rage impairs the narcissists cognition, therefore impairing
            their judgment. during the rage they are prone to shouting,
            fact distortion and making groundless accusations with
            punitive and hate-filled malice.

            self-enhancement is a prominent feature of narcissistic

donald trump on golf


          quotes from rick reilly - author of commander in cheat: how
          golf explains trump

to say donald trump cheats is like saying
            michael phelps swims. he cheats at the highest level. he
            cheats when people are watching, and he cheats when they
            arent. he cheats whether you like it or not.

            ive found that to be true with golf. the guy who plays
            slowly on the course is going to be molasses in meetings.
            the guy whos generous with compliments on the course is
            going to do the same at dinner. and the guy who cheats on
            the course is going to cheat in business, or on his taxes
            or, say, in politics.

            why cheat? why lie? why exaggerate his handicap, his
            scores, his club championships? because he has to, says
            harvard psychiatrist dr. lance dodes, co-author of the
            dangerous case of donald trump. he needs to be the best at
            everything. he cant stand not winning, not being the best.

             as for claims that the trump administration is
          being unfairly blamed for an unexpected pandemic, the 29
          january 2019 report from the office of the director of
          national intelligence states:

          on jan. 29, 2020:
https://news.yahoo.com/trade-adviser-warned-white-house-122107510.html
a top white house adviser starkly warned trump
            administration officials in late january that the
            coronavirus crisis could cost the united states trillions of
            dollars and put millions of americans at risk of illness or
            death.

            the warning, written in a memo by peter navarro, president
            donald trumps trade adviser, is the highest-level alert
            known to have circulated inside the west wing as the
            administration was taking its first substantive steps to
            confront a crisis that had already consumed chinas leaders
            and would go on to upend life in europe and the united
            states.

            the lack of immune protection or an existing cure or
            vaccine would leave americans defenseless in the case of a
            full-blown coronavirus outbreak on u.s. soil, navarros
            memo said. this lack of protection elevates the risk of the
            coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling
            the lives of millions of americans.

          was warned in advance about a possible pandemic, please see:

          after the coronavirus (covid-19) was officially




















            declared to be a pandemic by the world health organization,

            know anything about it,
          (click

             in 2016 the national safety council prepared a
          white house playbook outlining what the president should do
          if a pandemic appeared likely. playbook for early response to

          biological incidents

          nope. how many lives would have been saved if donald trump had
          followed what the experts had recommended vs. trump's own
          ignorance and arrogance?

              in october 2019 the center for disease
          control ran a simulation of a pandemic and documented:
that officials at the departments of homeland
            security and health and human services, and even at the
            white houses national security council, were aware of the
            potential for a respiratory virus outbreak originating in
            china to spread quickly to the united states and overwhelm
            the nation.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html
          nothing was done.

   note: the above covid-19 chart
            has been updated through oct. 13, 2022 data. covid-19 is
            expected to become a persistent, low-level endemic disease
            in the u. s. the chart will not be updated again unless
            another spike in u. s. cases occurs.

                in june, 2021 florida started reporting
            covid-19 cases on a weekly basis instead of daily. this has
            caused wide fluctuations in the daily numbers, but both the
            7-day averages and the smoothed calculated results are
            capable of smoothing these fluctuations.

          covid-19 cases in the u. s. and for the state of colorado.

          total number of deaths in the state of colorado.

             for comparative purposes, the number of americans
          killed in combat were:
          1) korean war (1950 - 1953): 33,686
          2) vietnam war (1955 - 1975): 47,424

          data source:

             as of december 17, 2021, the covid-19 virus has
          killed more americans than the combined total of american
          combat deaths in world war ii, plus world war i, plus the
          korean war, plus the vietnam war, plus 10 years of automobile
          related deaths.

            up through jan. 2021, the death rate per capita in the
          united states averaged more than 5 times the death rate in the
          combined rest of the world. (since then, the u. s. death rate
          per capita has improved, - but just for the vaccinated portion
          of the population.) data sources: john hopkins university ( https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html

          curves fitted to the daily observations. the dashed lines are
          7-day, centered moving averages for the two data sets.

             on a per capita basis, while trump was president,
          the united states had over 6 times as many cases as the rest
          of the world. also, the united states has had over 5 times as
          many deaths per capita as the rest of the world. if the u. s.
          death rate per capita equaled that in the rest of the world,
          then u. s. deaths from covid-19 would be about 200,000. and in
          donald trump's deranged mind "i think we've done a great job".
https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/world/meanwhile-in-america-may-1/index.html


          my stance on the refusal of people to get vaccinated:
          if the willfully ignorant, anti-science, anti-vaxers refuse to
          get vaccinated; by all means, let them have their way. when
          they get sick and die, their elimination will only improve the

          cases in new zealand during march 2020 - similar to what
          happened in the u. s. to fight the disease, new zealand
          instituted a "lock-down" to isolate those people who were
          infected. unlike the u. s. where many people have an attitude
          of "the only person who is important is me", new
          zealanders respected the lock-down. the result was a rapid
          decline in new cases during the month of april, and the
          disease was under control by the 2nd week in may. from the 2nd
          week in may, lock-down controls could be relaxed. and of
          course virtually all economic restrictions and hardships could
          safely go back to normal.


               all of the above blunders by donald trump
          were duly rewarded by march 26, 2020. the u.s. became number




















            1  in the world - as measured by the greatest
          number of people that had become victims of the covid-19
          coronavirus. china has far more people than the u. s., but
          their government listened to expert advice and stopped the
          spread of the virus in china. in the u. s., ignorance and
          arrogance were in charge, and guess what the result has been?

             as shown in the may 9, 2020 web page of "the
          guardian":
          donald trump: this is going to go away without a vaccine.
          its going to go away, and were not going to see it again. (video)
          (and how many lives latter will that be?)

          finally, we have donald trump's advice for a deterrent to the
          covid-19 virus:
          nbc news (link)
"president donald trump suggested the possibility
            of an "injection" of disinfectant into a person infected
            with the coronavirus as a deterrent to the virus during his
            daily briefing thursday."

              and there's always the "medical advice"
          (promoted by donald trump and fox "news") that
          hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are effective medicines and
          a "game changer" in the fight against covid-19. trump: "what
          have you got to lose?". turns out that "what have you got to
          lose?" is your life. from the journal of the american medical
          association: "here we present analyses until day 13, with
          lethality as the primary outcome." ( link
          )
          also "study finds no benefit, higher death rate in patients
          taking hydroxychloroquine for covid-19". ( link
          )

          rex tillerson said it best - f***ing moron

             and now that dr. fauci (a recognized medical
          expert and director of the national institute of allergy and
          infectious diseases) has become an unperson because he wont
          promote donald trumps conspiracy theories, trump has turned
          to a new doctor who was born in cameroon (africa), whose
          medical degree is from nigeria, and is the founder of fire
          power ministries.

trumps




















          new favorite covid doctor believes in alien dna, demon sperm,
          and hydroxychloroquine

          ( link




















            to article )

          the president is pushing the coronavirus theories of a
          houston doctor who also says sexual visitations by demons and
          alien dna are at the root of americans common health
          concerns.

          a houston doctor who praises hydroxychloroquine and says that
          face masks arent necessary to stop transmission of the highly
          contagious coronavirus has become a star on the right-wing
          internet, garnering tens of millions of views on facebook on
          monday alone. donald trump jr. declared the video of stella
          immanuel a must watch, while donald trump himself retweeted
          the video.


           
             as for how we got into this mess, rush limbaugh
          (see http://www.durangobill.com/gwdliars/gwdliarsindex.html
          ) worked for years cultivating an ignorance is a virtue and
          hatred against fellow americans is good system. he convinced
          enough americans so that donald trump was elected to finish
          the job of destroying what used to make america great. the
          process was somewhat like setting up a long row of dominoes.
          the coronavirus tipped the first domino over.

            to usa today article
"the possibility of a pandemic is a challenge
            donald trump is unqualified to handle as president."

            "trumps demonstrated failures of judgment and his repeated
            rejection of science make him the worst possible person to
            lead our country through a global health challenge."


          a final note on the "value" of donald trump's medical
          knowledge. did you know that according to donald trump, the
          noise from wind turbines causes cancer?

          note to those compiling donald trump's "enemies list(s)" and
          "fake news list(s)":
          please add my name to your lists.
          for voting purposes, the author is a registered "independent".
          however, it seems likely that donald trump would consider my
          viewpoint as a member of the "new far left fascism".

the author of this web

          it shows the location of the randomly generated 3,076 sq. mile
          plot that the author has adopted as part of nasas earth day
          2017 program.

             we are living in an age where many people think
          that anti-intellectualism and ignorance are virtues. the
          author of this website takes a contrary view. if america is to
          maintain its great status in the future, we must educate our
          people so that they are competent in the fields of science,
          technology, engineering, and mathematics. if instead, our goal
          is to revive the coal industry so that more of our citizens
          will die of black lung disease, america will not be great
          again.

             the author supports nasas efforts to learn about
          our planet so that we can make it a better place to live. the
          author supports the ideal that our voters should be an
          informed electorate.

          thomas jefferson - a properly functioning democracy depends
          on an informed electorate.
