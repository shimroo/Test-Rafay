we are zu design



zu design is a tarndanya/adelaide based gallery and workshop run by jewellery designer and maker jane bowden. established in 1997 and located in gay’s arcade in the rundle mall precinct, zu design has represented over 300 contemporary jewellers from around australia. it is an inclusive space that offers studio access, practical support, retail opportunities and curated exhibitions to both emerging and established makers.the initial foundation of zu design began in 1992 with the gold fish studio, an artist-run space created by jane bowden, juliet michell and peter jeffrey. in 1995 the gold fish studio added roman kielczewski and relocated to jamfactory. at the end of this tenancy in 1997, jane ruljancich joined jane, juliet and roman to create a new collective named zu design in gay’s arcade. zu design was created with a deep passion for supporting the arts and showcasing local creatives. now in its 27th year of operation, zu design continues to nurture and support the skills, talents and careers of australian makers.
