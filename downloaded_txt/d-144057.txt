        one door mental health would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands on which we live and work, and pay our respects to the elders past, present and emerging. we express our gratitude that we can share what is, and always will be, aboriginal land. we hope that in the spirit of reconciliation we can move forward together to a place of justice, healing and partnership.
