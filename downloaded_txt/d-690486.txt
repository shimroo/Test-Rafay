3 bits

slappytankerthree bits of advice that i'd like to put out there, even if only to myself.1) always be the better person. it may suck in the short term, but in the long run, you'll respect yourself and it's nice to know you acted respectfully, mindfully, and can be righteous about being a wonderful, civil, honorable person. 2) trust your instincts. don't be suspicious; rather, know your _______ (fill in the word - nemesis, enemy, former friend, assfuck who disrespected you and has no integrity whatsoever, etc.)3) don't obsess. find positive outlets. take the high ground. don't focus on the thing holding you back. find things that will cultivate positive feelings and surround the world with more love. the world needs more love.god, grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, the courage to change the things i can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

slappytankeri'm proud of myself today for taking an initiative to look out for myself and take better care of me. i went to a clinic and got tested for hiv. there wasn't much concern and i wasn't worried, i just like to get tested regularly to ensure i'm safe.hiv negative, once again. so that's good.

slappytankernever mind how long it's been since i've made an entry.anywho, i'm once again taking things one day at a time, and again focusing on getting into healthy habits and taking better care of my body and my soul.the habit i focused on last night is when i want to get something done, instead of a.d.d./space out and procrastinate and say i'll do it later, i'll just fucking do it. last night's example: doing the dishes and taking out the trash, despite just getting home after the drive from orlando and a long weekend. just fucking do it, karen.i'd love to say i'll update more often, yada yadda yadda, but i'm not going to make promises or broad statements and feel compelled to fulfill them.so, today i just gotta get through this tough, busy, stressful, clusterfuck of a work day, and get up tomorrow to do it all over again.hope things are well with you all. drop me a line and let's catch up.

super quick post


feb. 4th, 2010 at 9:39 am



 


slappytankerhey all, quick question/request!for those of you coming to orlando in july (for infinitus, etc), what's your travel schedule like?i'm trying to plan for time off of work, and since i live an hour from orlando, it'd be good to know who is coming when so i can plan accordingly in case people plan on visiting daytona beach whilst down in florida :)also, for anyone who doesn't know - i will be at the convention, but will not be formerly attending. that means no quidditch, no opening feast, closing feast, etc. i'll just be around the area for evening hanging out and day activities - universal park, etc.  i'm going to get a season pass for universal, wooo yay florida residency discounts!* * * * * * * * in other news, i'm trudging along in classes again this semester. i'm taking italian ii and getting by, and food sanitation and safety so i can get my servsafe certification and be a licensed food manager. also looking into building up on the business idea i've been throwing around for the past couple years, and now have the resources to get that moving.eventually i want to start a video blog series and get all kinds of cool creative stuff on a website, so that means i've got to get at least a month's worth of content before launching. right now i've got work and school 7 days a week, so i'm super looking forward to spring break. before that, bike week is coming to town again, so i'm working on a shit-ton of chainmail jewelry to sell. hoping those proceeds will be enough for set-up costs for the company.my friend mikey in dallas put it well: "you are a go hard or go home girl."   my mind functions on 2 levels: work my ass off, and do abso-fucking-lutely nothing and get my mind straightened out again.haven't been surfing since before christmas, thanks to getting sick over the break and daylight savings time. i've got a wetsuit, which works when the water is around 55 and above. when it's colder, i can't stand having cold feet :p  it's also really hard to get a good, solid pop-up with the suit on (since it's new and tight and i could really go for getting back in shape), so when i get it on, i'll take the boogie board and get the suit stretched a bit more each go.so, things are going really well. life stuff is coming together, and i feel like january 2010 was the time to get things lined up. now it's all about putting ideas into motion.* * * * * * *finally (and pretty randomly), does anyone else notice that when music is playing, all the love songs come on when we least want to hear them?!?!?!and i'm still not drinking! last drink i had was on new year's eve 2008 (before it became '09) and i don't miss it much. every so often, maybe once every 6 months, i'll feel like having a beer and then it goes away. we'll see where this goes, but so far, i think it's all for the best, for me.

slappytankerlot to catch up on, but wanted to pop in for a quick post. i'm curious to hear your responses!what, in your mind, is sexy?  it can be in regards to attraction, appeal, etc to a person, thing and such.here's mine, not limited to of course, and in no particular order:intelligence, strength (physical and emotional), humor, red and gold (!! xd!!), emotional maturity juxtaposed with a silly side, navy blue and beige, uniforms, knives, creativity, compassion, fast learners, italian (the language), and um... eating ice cream off people :)so, let's have yours!

few quick things...


oct. 5th, 2009 at 8:39 pm



 


slappytankerin a few hours, i'll be officially another day, another year, another decade older.people talk about how we receive these profound insights over our lives, most specifically that we are more receptive to them in our 30's.i've done enough catching up over the past couple months to make up for the hullabaloo that is our 20's, and i look forward to the next 30 (or more) years.the past week has been particularly trying, but once again i realize that the foundation for all blessings is realizing what we *already* have, and that i already am everything i want to be.a few things came to mind.1) i had a sex filter going for like, a minute. and now there's no need for it, so it and the specified entries are gone. i kept it for a little bit because i thought i'd need a place to put it and where i wouldn't forget, but i realize that i *don't* forget and don't need to broadcast it.2) musicals really, really cheer me up :p i'm watching mama mia!3) i can surf! i mean, i'm giving it my best shot and i'm actually doing it! yay!4) joy and tragedy are two causes for reunion, and i love my friends in good times and in bad. i love with all my heart because it's just what i do. there's nothing wrong with it, and i know it can be much. but, it's me. i've never done anything half-assed, and there's no "wasting" something i've got a clear abundance of.so, i'm going to spend the night hanging out and just enjoying my own company. i had intentions to go do more on the last day of my 20's, but if i'm supposed to be all "comfy with myself", what better way to celebrate than by watching mama mia! with the sing-along on and chomping on a coffee toffee twisted frosty?okay 30's - here i come!

i can haz a happy with that cheezburger


sep. 5th, 2009 at 10:18 pm



 


slappytankeri've noticed a few things that are very slight changes in me, and it's definitely attributed to the fact that i'm really happy here.  life has been so good to me; i'm immensely blessed. i live in a beautiful place, i've lived with two of my best friends, and i *love* my job. i feel like what i'm going through now is the complete antithesis of my life in dallas.when i graduated college, i remember saying that i wanted to work and get a lot of life experience, and kinda let higher power guide me. that's exactly what happened - i took an ass-kicking for years at a job i was excellent at but was draining my soul, but in the process, i learned a lot about stress management, multitasking, and developed an excellent skill set.it's amazing how life transpires and all these crazy things happen... and then it feels like everything turns up in the right place, as it should.sparky and i watched "p.s. i love you", and the only time i cried was at the end during a very sappy, happy moment. i realized that i only cry now when i'm happy (for other people - fictional or not, for myself, for people i love, etc), and though i do get a bit upset/angry/afraid, it goes away after a bit.sometimes i think about what my life was like when i first started this lj, and how frequently i would bitch about how things were. in all truth, i was convinced that i deserved it; i had created that reality.after i took a huge bound and quit that job and changed my life, things did get immensely challenging, but the risk paid off. it paid off huge.these things all happen in good time. a friend of mine in dallas helped me realize that god is infinite and he does things on his time. it was frustrating to hear - after all, i was injured, broke, unemployed, living with the grief of losing someone i love, and going through so much change - but it sunk in. especially in hindsight. of *course* in hindsight!today i got to spend the day with sparky, who is absolutely one of my best friends (we also had a discussion regarding best friends - there isn't really a top dog bestie the way we see it. we all have people we know, acquaintances, friends, and best friends. we don't have to choose!), and tomorrow i get to hang out with pat and her family.after i go on a date tomorrow morning, mwuahaha :)  and! another one on monday!i think about the promise i made to myself, that even though i gained weight, i'm still the same person. i've earned my way through the blessings in my life, and i deserve something great. once i finally let that idea sink it, i let the universe know that i am anything i want to be.i am sexy. i am smart. i am attracting the right things for me right now. i am definitely the queen of win :)we all deserve to be happy. and though our personal happiness is relative, the idea that we are allowed to have it is, in my mind, universal law.go, my awesome friends! go, and find your happiness :)i hope you have an amazing memorial day weekend, and see you on the next leg of this journey!
