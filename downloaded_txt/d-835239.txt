lesson iii: which scripture? whose tradition? 



									in this month’s lesson, we try and figure out whether those who wrote the new testament understood that they were adding to the scriptures. for not only did the lord jesus not directly instruct his disciples to write down his words and deeds; there are also no instructions as to who should do it. the question of who should write the new testament is a question about authority. did those authors know what they were doing? and did they have some understanding of the authority with which they were doing it? if we are to find our way back to the beginning- we must know what the beginning looked like.

the charity of anathema 



									there is a common misconception amongst modern churchmen, that the image of the church with an outstretched hand requires that the hand be empty. nothing could be further from the truth. when the church goes out to meet the world, she carries with her the fullness of truth. not a list of proposals or thoughtful suggestions. but in order for the world to come to the truth, the church must overcome the errors the world has accepted. in this article, fr pius explores the true nature of pastoral charity: that charity and silence in the face of error are eternal enemies.

veritatis splendor and the eschatological projection of the moral life (part i) 



									this is the first article in a three-part series dealing with st john paul ii’s encyclical: veritatis splendor. this encyclical was published in 1993 and is one of the most comprehensive teachings in the church against the tyranny of moral relativism. one of the principal ideas of the encyclical was the knowability of moral truth and its connection to our relationship with almighty god. fr paschal in this article explores the intrinsic connection between moral truth and eternal life.

lesson ii: whose scripture? which tradition? 



									as catholics, when we think of sacred scripture, we tend to take its existence as a given. we never ask ourselves why the first christians wrote down their experiences and why it would occur to them to do so. after all, we still had the jewish scriptures which the lord himself referenced on many occasions. why was there a need for a new testament when the old one seemed to be perfectly acceptable? in this article, we examine the tradition that made the writing of a new testament perfectly obvious to the first christians.

the cross, not an armband 



									australia day is upon us. and as has become our custom, an argument brews about what date this day should be celebrated. at the heart of the debate is a profound misunderstanding of our nations and its day. a profound misunderstanding that originated in our failure to understand what a christian nation is and that ours is a christian nation. in the following special article, we examine a better way of understanding our national day and its date.

wrong turn at the fork 



									much of what ails the church is that she has lost sight of where she is going. if we are not convinced that there are dangers- mortal and eternal dangers- present in our christian lives, then we are more likely to be careless bout taking a wrong turn and less than vigilant in trying to turn back to the rite path. sin is a less serious reality when we believe there is no real penalty for it. in this article, fr pius examines the reality of hell and our need to embrace the lord’s teaching and the church’s tradition surrounding this doctrine for the benefit of our souls.

when the path forward leads back 



									the catholic church, in order to be faithful to her mission, must never divert her gaze from her divine lord. for no reason and never for a moment. a self-absorbed church is a broken church. only the virtues of courage and daring will help her find her way forward to discover what she has always possessed: her tradition.

does tradition have a tradition? 



									sacred (apostolic) tradition is one of the pillars of catholic doctrine. but from where did the idea for tradition come? does sacred tradition have an origin? can it be argued that sacred tradition has a tradition? in this series we begin to examine the origins of the apostolic tradition that lie deep in the church’s history in order to shed light on the direction we need to go today.

saint john henry newman and the development of doctrine 



									st. john henry newman, canonised in 2019, remains one of the most admired and studied intellectual thinkers of the 19th century. his major work, an essay on the development of christian doctrine, remains one of the most influential works in recent history. in this essay we explore why that is, and why you should read.

the orientation of hope 



									the virtue of hope, before it is a virtue is a passion. a passion that is guided by the intellect, but is only raised to the level of virtue by grace. as christians, we are called to cultivate the virtue of hope in deepening our relationship with the lord.
