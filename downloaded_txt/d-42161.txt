setting a dream home

  

modular home setour client, mike fasheh of custom modular concepts, designed a dream house with his forward-thinking and knowledgeable homebuyers in bergen county, nj. modular prefabrication suited their timeline, budget, and vision for a modern farmhouse, while allowing them to stay engaged with the build process from inception to punch list. after transporting completed modular boxes from our factory in moosic, pa, to their site, the customers utilized drone technology to document the home set, a one-day installation process culminating in a custom-designed fresh canvas ready for personal touches. follow along on their instagram account as they continue to infuse their incredible style into every corner of their new home.
