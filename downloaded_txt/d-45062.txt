the modern
frisbee was invented in 1964 by
      ed
headrick, while he worked for wham-o co. by 2000 the  secrets to
throwing frisbee discs  accurately
and far, became studied by frisbee experts, documented, and
eventually put into this influential, instructional dvd. revealed here are the do's and don'ts
through slow motion and freeze frame technology; to show stance, hand
and arm position, and movements. it is a great gift to beginners, as it
is a
huge breath saver for all teachers. 
 anyone interested in improving
their (or
training other's) forehand, backhand or skipping will want to check out
these instructions. great techniques to quickly improve throws for ultimate, disc
golf, dogs, freestyle, and frisbee golf, folf.
 ... it will rev up your
game to a point that will make others wonder, "how are you able to
 throw so well?"... : -
)

  
 btw,
the free frisbee disc that you
get, will fly exactly as these key instructions indicate. simply step
outside, and start practicing. you will soon be grinning from ear to
ear because to your delight, you will
quickly be using instructions that few people actually know. your
throwing partners (and others) will comment on how you are making such
excellent throws, and they will ask you to share your secret with them.


when shown to new players (of even the youngest ages!), these
instructions have proven to advance everyone's frisbee disc throwing
skills after just one casual viewing. for those who go on to
study it, their throwing skills will advance forward multiple years, in
25 minutes! 


"the
 heave h.o.e. method is an excellent example of teaching beginners how
to throw a disc. i have been disc golfing for some time and for months
i was
unable to properly teach my daughter (age 12) how to throw a disc. like
motodom says, "in 25 min of watching this dvd," you can learn to throw
 a 
disc. my daughter, on her 3rd throw after watching heave h.o.e., threw 
an innova disc 175 feet! she
 thinks this dvd is great. thanks motodom for a wonderful 
teaching tool."
errol c. grapevine,tx

... a "must see" for every pe
and health class. now-a-days, the
heave h.o.e. dvd is being used by hundreds of pe teachers across the
country, creating a "frisbee conciousness" in thousands of youngsters
instantly. which translates into huge fun for the enitre lifetime of
those of kids! if you are a teacher, start your students off right. the
more they learn, the more fun they have!

good walk defined: phd's study on disc golf yields 
intriguing findings

as a nation, we simply do not walk very much. we tend to watch tv, drive our cars and sit at our computers. when we choose to walk rather than sit, we burn more calories and our hearts have to work a bit harder. if we keep walking, our bodies adapt to this kind of good stress and we become physically fitter. ideally, a person should walk around 10,000 steps a day to maintain a healthy level of fitness. with support from the pdga, the first nation-wide research study to examine disc golf and physical activity is complete.

the
heave h.o.e. movement keeps floating on the cutting edge, connecting
high profile stuff like: obesity, youth-at-risk, after school program
needs, latch-key kids, alternative to computer games and tv, etc,.

 
david m.
young, 
university professor,
an advocate for healthier communities


we are focusing on practical
living (physical activity and nutrition). a heave h.o.e. package was
given to each attendee in an academy in which 30 p.e. and health
teachers participated to learn how to incorporate disc golf into their
curriculum. the academy was funded by a grant from the kentucky dept.
of education.

heave
h.o.e. is not only well done, it also sends a good positive image and
message of disc sports in general.

 several common throwing errors
are diagnosed, so if you're having difficulty with that tough forehand
toss, give heave h.o.e. a shot!
 
the internet disc shoppe


our
program teaches students about nutrition and physical activity. we gave
flying discs to 10,000 children in 12 schools, and a heave h.o.e. lesson
plan package
to all the p.e. teachers. all the teachers felt that heave
h.o.e. was really helpful in teaching the kids the proper throwing
method.
