fuel injector serviceoem & performance fuel injectorsport & tbi $25.00 ea - (gdi) direct injectors $40.00 ea

















we service gasoline fuel injectors using venom's custom designed and built computer-controlled injector flow-testing equipment. why buy reconditioned fuel injectors when we can make yours like new again. fuel injectors rarely die. they just get dirty. fuel injector service restores them back into like new condition and performance. your injectors are cleaned and flow tested on our flow bench and ultrasonic cleaning machine. after cleaning new injector parts including filters, o-rings, spacers and pintil caps are installed. they are returned with a before and after flow report. 
off-the-car injector cleaning and testing is the only way to verify that each injector is doing its job and allowing each cylinder to operate evenly for peak performance that can also improve fuel economy. replacement cost of a new fuel injector can be $150 or more. with our cleaning service, we can restore most fuel injectors to like-new condition for a fraction of the cost of a new injector. most injectors can be restored to a like-new condition through our ultrasonic cleaning process and then verified with our testing process. on today's computer controlled engines the oxygen sensor(s) can only average the air / fuel mixture of all the cylinders. this can cause some cylinders to run rich and others to run lean if all the injectors are not flowing equally. side by side flow testing is the only way to verify they are working well together.
