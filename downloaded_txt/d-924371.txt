5/5/08 08:57 pm - im the only one who finds my bitching amusing
ohchrist, i have to vent now about how stupid and fucktarded internet people are sometimes, because if i dont ill explode randomly probably at a group of kindergarden kids.dear person :3like, wtf, i seriously hope you find this, and then i hope you realize how much i desperately wish for you to die of ass-cancer i swear to god. how long can you put up a show and pretend you give a fuck about anyone other than yourself? better yet, how long before everyone else sees you for the attention-cow you are? i dont honestly think ive ever really wanted someone to die a horrible death so much in my life, and when you whine about how you cant afford rent and how all this bad shit seems to happen to you it makes me happy, and i guess that would make me a monster if you didnt fucking deserve it. so if you get to whine about how much you hate my best friends and wish they were dead, i think i deserve that same privilege. if you get to visit our pages to monitor our every move then its fair game for me to poke around on all your websites. i hope you and all your sluts get hit by a train or something, and then a few months later no one even remembers who you were, because i know youd be thrashing in your grave if you didnt get your own parade and memorial and w/e the hell else. you can kindly back the fuck out of our lives if you hate us so much. stop calling us out on your journal you cunt. if you think im losing sleep every night in fear of your hoard of 12 year old fanbrats you are mistaken. sometimes i wish i were rich and not horribly tiny because id love to fly over and knock out your teeth, but i guess ill just sit here and bitch at my journal instead of starting some shit with you because i dont think i cant stand any more of your bs and drama. but seriously, get aids. i hope your hands just explode some day so you can never draw or look up porn or stuff food in your face, or get off at night because im pretty sure as far as a life goes thats about it for you.- ryncakesi am a hypocrite and i have no spine, but the day she sets me off, the day she even tries talking to me, im going all outtags: ibitch, icomplain, iwhine

3/22/08 08:32 pm - birthdees and why they suck :d
because. its that one day of the year that is so dedicated to you, making sure you're the center of attention with people trying too hard to do nice things for you so they just end up being pushy, when you'd rather just hide out in your room all day and look at porn or cry under your blankets. i wish everyone would forget about me sometimes, but then i guess that would be lonely and i'd cry more. maybe i'm thinking more along the lines of avoiding the internet-people. i've just been so full of hate and jealousy over the most pointless shit, and i don't see why anyone admires me or bothers to im me. ever. i love my friends like a fat kid loves cake, but i don't think i make a good friend, deep down. maybe thats why people like me. coz i certainly do bs everything a lot. holyfuck i wish i had a spine. so i could just tell everyone i hate their friends* and i don't give 2 shits about their bffjill because she's not me, and i think their friends rping sucks, even though ive never read it before. i told you i'm selfish. but i lie and fake it all the time so i guess thats the only reason people like me. uh uhhhhhhh. im thinking aloud and i clearly need to pick up a new hobby. also, ive been lashing out and hateful as fuck lately, so don't get personally offended plzkthnxbut seriously. i'd love to know whats wrong with me sometimes. i feel guilty when its my birthday, i don't like being around people i love the most. i'm thinking maybe i need to give up on art because graphic design or w/e i go into will mean i have to draw for other people on their time and that kills my spirit to draw, and teabags it for good measure.  fkekdjfkls fklfddddddddddfffffuck.where's the [/internet forever] key? =a=;* ok, i don't hate friends of my friends, i've seen most of them around on the internet, and i must admit, they're pretty fly, i just get jealous because i suck.tags: baww, emo, i fail life, i suck

3/12/08 09:37 am - :c i just got buttraped by life.
lololol so i got offered an internship :'d but. its unpaid. its for concept art designs for landscapes and buildings which i dont draw, ever. its way the hell on the other side of town. and they want me to go over 3-5 times a week. ok, i dont have the fucking gas money, especially if im not getting paid, to do this. :i what the hell, i was all excited too, and then i just had a dildo of epic fail shoved up my ass. christ. *headdesk* i know i get the wbe, but its not worth it when i have to pay $40 a week on gas. i maybe have enough money to make that last 12 weeks. but that means i cant spend it on anything else like.... like my awesome spring break. ;a; gaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy. srsly, ive never been more screwed over in my life. well yeah, probably. but i really needed this, and now... e_e; at least we have the job fair tmmr. i finally put together my resume, and in turn, realized.... ive done prettymuch nothing with my life. but i do have a lot of digital art qualifications :c too bad the market isnt so big for us atm. ohwell, ill just go and bat my lashes and show them pictures of all the pretty "girls" i draw. >>; i had to alter a buncha my art in the last few days to make it..... not sexual... and gay. 'n' oh zexion, forgive me for calling you a little girl.also. brawl. i wish pepople would shuttup about it :i; *shotdead* its more rl people annoying me, to be honest. yes its awesome. yes its the best ssb game yet/ever. yes it has 47593748 super duper features. and its not the fact i dont have the game, really xd; i dont like vgs that much, nor do i have the time for them, so im not in any rush to get it. i'll probably play it at tech when we have another free day and be totally in love with it, but until then, i dont care, and that seems like the only thing anyone wants to talk about anymore. but i suppose it was just as bad when kh ii came out or w/e, so ill drop it and let everyone have their fun.im turning into a crabby old man ' ^ ';tags: baww, rant, ryn complains too much, skool sux, wangst

so.  i almost made a tutorial for colouring the other day. then i remembered im retarded and a stuck up bitch who isnt willing to share her limited abilities with people who still filterrape and m0arlenseflare their ``look what i drew on lined paper`` art. juuuussttt thought id share. ive not abandoned this place, really, im saving up some decent porn art for the fanart journal, and i really just dont have anything worth while to say here..... and ive been dedicating what time isnt spent on school or sleeping, to doing a one of the 30 crossdressing themes each night, so i dont really have time to update lj. on that note, i think imma be pulling an all nighter tonight :i; im tired as fuck but i have a bajillion things to do before vday for my fags. soyeah.also, guys. i think i should finally let you all know.its been tearing me up on the inside keeping it from you.but i have......( read more...collapse )thats all.... i has a zit on my eyebrow :i;;;; or in it? w/e its the most painful feeling ever but at least no one can see it ..... yes you needed to know that. *rubs face in zitcream for an hour now*  and, party 0n friday fuck yeah. *d*tags: random shit

i really hate trying to configure my journal so everyone can see it and comment on it etc. if you cant post a comment here and youre not a registered user i guess note me on da, i dont really know.anyways. if all goes as planned and annonymous posting to all veiwers is inabled, then. i wanna know some things i can improve on. like, person-wise i mean. not in the art. im working on that already and da is kinda a better place to help me. but like i wanna be a g00d awes0me friend 0kay? so tell me things that make you go x( about me or anything youd change, no matter how horrible you may think you sound. i... believe i have annonymous posting permitted so go all out. really, it`ll help me so plz plz? ;n; *comments to not be so shy or feel guilty over things that arent even my fault will be ignored. people have told me this for years. i cant help being insecure.*tags: ryns a gay
