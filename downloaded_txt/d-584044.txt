building a business with a beat, leadership lessons from jazzercise--an empire built on passion, purpose and heartâ 




judi sheppard missett is a fitness icon who, at just three years old, discovered a passion for dance that would eventually fuel a global fitness empire. after an early life spent honing her dancing skills and a career as a professional jazz dancer, missett had an epiphany: why not combine the art of jazz dancing with the science of exercise to help others achieve a healthier, happier self-image and life? the wildly enthusiastic response from her first 15 students inspired her to launch jazzercise, inc., the world's leading dance fitness program with a cumulative $2 billion in global sales. 
 
for the first time ever, missett reveals the secrets behind the company's five decades of enormous success. in addition to helping millions of men and women improve their health and well-being through dance fitness, missett has inspired 8,500 franchisees to achieve their dream of owning and running their own business. now, through powerful personal stories, practical proven-successful advice and insights, missett shares how you, too, can transform your passion into a profitable business.    
 
july 2019 update:  just two weeks after the release of building a business with a beat, publisher mcgraw-hill professional reported that, due to sales that were "blowing them all away," a second edition printing has been ordered.





revisiting florida's missile crisis, october 1962




historians call the cuban missile crisis "the most dangerous moment in human history." for floridians -- civilians in the path of the largest, fastest military mobilization ever made on american soil -- it was a time of rampant fear and inexorable dread. in her intimately gripping third novel, a place we knew well, susan carol mccarthy digs into the riveting panic, fears and uncertainties of those 13 historic days. through the emotional repercussions on the avery family and their central florida community of college park, mccarthy vividly recreates the largely forgotten impact of the crisis on everyday citizens. “susan carol mccarthy’s genius is in turning history over to muscle-and-blood human beings who variously hope, fear, lash out, hold steady, and tear at the seams. if you weren’t there, this is as close to living through the cuban missile crisis as you will ever come.” ~national book award-winning author tom mcnealoctober 2016 update:  a place we knew well wins a coveted royal palm literary award. see events page for details.

 tampa mayor pam iorio welcomed susan and friend evangeline moore to the county-wide celebration of tampa-hillsborough reads. 


one book, one community:tampa-hillsborough reads tampa, fl - mayor pam iorio joined the friends of the library for the one book, one community: tampa-hillsborough reads press conference featuring author susan carol mccarthy and evangeline moore, daughter of slain florida civil rights leaders, harry t. and harriette v. moore. "mccarthy's extraordinary debut novel, lay that trumpet in our hands, was inspired by real events that took place in the 1950s after her family moved to florida. this story of courage and compassion will touch the hearts of readers and remind longtime residents of the 1951 double murders of civil rights activist and florida naacp leader, harry t. moore and his wife harriette," the selection committee said. mccarthy and her special friend and guest evangeline moore, the moores' only surviving daughter, visited tampa for a series of one book, one community special events and programs.















"the best fiction always bears a strong resemblance to real life...mccarthy blends fact, memory, imagination, and truth with admirable grace." ~the washington post
