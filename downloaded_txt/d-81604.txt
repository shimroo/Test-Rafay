the une portland campus for the health sciences

for decades, une’s portland campus has been home to many of the university’s health professions programs including pa, pt, ot, pharmacy, nursing, dental medicine, and more. in 2025, une’s college of osteopathic medicine will move from the biddeford campus into the new harold and bibby alfond center for health sciences in portland. by bringing our health professions programs together into one interprofessional learning community, we will establish une’s portland campus for the health sciences as the center of health care education in northern new england.
