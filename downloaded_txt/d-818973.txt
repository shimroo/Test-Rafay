create a long lasting memory




for those moments you don’t want to forget




christmas is a special time of the year, good for thinking, reflecting, and understanding that we are all a part of something greater. how is it possible to convey all of this in a gift? it would certainly be difficult to express with just another toy or trivial item.





 



1. enter your very own star name and date. name it after a friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, husband or wife, to someone who has passed away in honor of their name or why not name a star after yourself.
 




 



2. choose your style. pick your color of the star poster and choose your pendant to create a piece of artwork that is unique and personal for you and your loved ones.
 




 



3. customize your message. write a special message, memory or text and create custom art just for you and your loved ones.

i purchased the twin star kit for my parents for their 30th wedding anniversary and they couldn’t have been more pleased. they now share a star in the sky with both of their names on it, what better gift to link them as one eternally?
