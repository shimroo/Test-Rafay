the natural 



choice 



 



























 



beauty 



 



 bring a slice of nature into your home with southern cypress. with undeniable charm and character, cypress can complement any architectural style and design scheme. and its authentic look and feel can’t be matched by faux, wood-look alternatives. 







 



durability 



 



from coast to coast, cypress is an ideal building product to use where good looks and durability really count. and it’s built that way, naturally. cypress trees produce a preservative that protects the wood from decay and repels insects like termites and carpenter bees. 







 



versatility 



 



cypress is a superior wood to use for outdoor projects ranging from siding and decking to furniture and pergolas. and cypress is right at home indoors as well, where it can be used anywhere from floor to ceiling to make a house your home.
