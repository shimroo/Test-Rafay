the bike line our founders, tom & nancy revard, loved the simple joy of riding a bicycle so much, they opened the bike line in 1979 with a simple mission to share the joy of bicycling with everyone.  today, second generation owners charlie, bill & jimmy continue the mission their parents started by helping people discover the beautiful sport of cycling.  the bike line has something for everyone and we've got the brands to prove it.  we proudly represent trek, pinarello, bianchi, bmc, seven cycles, stromer, linus, zipp, assos, wahoo fitness, saris and many more.  we look forward to having you visit!the bike line facebook  the bike line instagram   the bike line email
