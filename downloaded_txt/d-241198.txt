island travel & tasting tour -- anguilla a review of island cuisine, cocktails and luxury resortsby stephen gilberg 
in this issue of the island travel & tasting tour, we feature the secluded island of anguilla. as with each island tour, we review the spirit brand for which the island is known as well as one of the most luxurious places to stay. in addition, we feature some of the local restaurants in order to give our readers a taste of what they can expect to experience. ready to join the travel and tasting tour?
anguilla: simply paradise
there are many people who have never been to anguilla. but of those who have, few people have been to anguilla only once. the island is simply magical and you instantly form a special bond with it.
 anguilla, bwi is an english independent territory in the northeast corner of the caribbean. its greatest asset is its 11,000 industrious, conscientious, fun-loving, and welcoming people. with tourism as their largest industry, anguillians are committed to showing you their beautiful island with pride and hospitality.
what anguilla lacks in size, it more than makes up for in its much sought after caribbean asset  pristine, powdery beaches. the island is long and thin, creating an endless shoreline of over 30 of the world's most beautiful beaches. many are over 1½ miles long  and not one has a high-rise. some are entirely unoccupied while others have beach bars or spectacular private villas. the waters off of these beaches are equally spectacular. boasting 12 miles of white coral coastline, anguilla is a snorkeler's and scuba divers paradise. the weather is warm but always breezy. the winds come from the east and keep you cool during the day. read more
