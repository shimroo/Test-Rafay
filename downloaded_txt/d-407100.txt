search engine friendly web design
welcome to aperfectmix.com, started way back in 2000 by tom mix. i am no longer taking on projects as i am happily employed full time. yes i know this page is dated! the original design was left in place as a virtual historical landmark and to be honest i just have not had time to redo it. i'd like to eventually move it to drupal. you are welcome to have a look at our directory of previous web design projects. i would also encourage you to have a look at my web development resources page page which i do spend time updating. you are always welcome to contact me for any questions.
