financial stringency at sunderland 
september 19, 2017 by wg 


sunderland fans are understandably disappointed at an indifferent start to the season.  some of them think that owner ellis short is ‘asset stripping’ the club in preparation for a sale.  they are particularly aggrieved that so little of the £30m transfer fee for jordan pickford has been spent on new players.

which player offers most value for money? 
september 18, 2017 by wg 


one can spend millions on a player who then doesn’t live up to his potential, doesn’t fit in with the rest of the squad, causes trouble in the dressing room, gets injured and eventually has to be sold at a loss.
alternatively, one could spend relatively little on a player who fits into the team well, keeps himself fit and shows more talent than was anticipated.

barnsley takeover has great potential 
september 16, 2017 by wg 


outgoing barnsley owner patrick cryne is terminally ill with bowel cancer and does not expect to see the end of the season.  his poignant programme notes for tuesday’s carabao cup tie (actually written by his wife jean) justifiably attracted widespread and sympathetic attention on the internet and my thoughts go out to him and his family at this time.
at the match against aston villa in the 66th minute supporters in all four stands stood with their mobile phones illuminated and sang the name of their 66-year old owner.

cobblers police investigation statement 
september 14, 2017 by wg 


it is clear that the northamptonshire police inquiry into alleged financial impropriety connected with a £10.25m loan to northampton town football club (under its previous ownership) is consuming considerable resources and is being conducted in a commendably thorough fashion.

it was ever thus 
september 14, 2017 by wg 


today i submitted a proposal for a book based on this site which has already received an enthusiastic reception from the potential publisher.  the book will open with a warning about too much sepia-tinged nostalgia about how football used to be.  i watched football in the 1950s and there are many different ways in which it is incomparably better today from the state of the pitches to the facilities for spectators.
