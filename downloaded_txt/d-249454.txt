oh, 
	you want more?  then a fresh 
handy 
	surefire business tactic you shall have!  will skippy 
	return anytime soon?  perhaps, perhaps...

    
old updates:
   




happy 
2004, everyone! just when you thought we had packed it in for 
good, i went and added another 
handy 
surefire business tactic. sassy. i haven't spoken with skippy in 
awhile, but the word on the street is that skippy might be 
primed for a comeback. we'll see.




still 
alive, still no redesign.  we're shooting for 2006 on that.  
until then, i added another
handy 
surefire business tactic.




thanks 
for all the emails, and no, we're not dead!  maybe 2003 will 
bring that elusive total redesign.  but instead of holding our 
breath, let's read some fresh fortune cookies, 
shall we?




oh, 
what's that?  that.  over in the corner.  why, i think 
it's a new article.  maybe you 
should read it.




more 
amusing fortune cookies have 
been added.  some lame ones have also been tacked on, but it's up to your 
to decide what's what.




guess 
who stopped by this weekend?  why, the famed person behind
   
ask skippy, that's who!  and now there are 20 new questions and 
answers posted for your amusement!  thanks to a certain girl for 
the assistance.




i 
got another set of ducks in the mail.  up on the 
duck page they go.  thanks 
guys!  oh, and i should have some new content posted in the next 
day or two.


    
 hey there!  be sure to sign the 
guestbook with your comments!  
thanks...

hey, want to see a goofy picture of
    my brother?  how about a normal one
    instead?  perhaps a kinda blurry shot
    of my cat is what you're looking for instead?
speaking of dan, have you checked out the story
    of dan's new jeep yet?
want to see a normal picture of me?  are you sure?! click here.
did you find a bad link?  you
    had better head to the bad link page!
want to see my tribute to my girlfriend?  go see marissa's page.
instead of links all over the place, i'm opting for a page of links.  i call it....the link page.  check it out!
if you, or someone you know, works for yahoo, infoseek, or any other major (humor)
    index, click here. 
do you like guests?  do you like books?  well, have i got a great link for
