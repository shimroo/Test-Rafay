the north, relax on the gold coast or swim at the great barrier reef. meet australia’s unique native animals found nowhere else on earth, or take a road trip from one vibrant city to another. explore sydney, melbourne, and adelaide or fly to tasmania. there are many ways to enjoy a luxury holiday in australia, making this one of the best holiday destinations in the world.new zealand is a land of jagged mountains, deep temperate forests, volcanoes and cave systems. it is the perfect destination if you like wilderness walks or are an adventure seeker. you can hike along a glacier one day, learn about maori culture the next, and taste fine wines at top-notch vineyards on the third. new zealand’s cities may be comparatively small, but they are picturesque and friendly. you’ll quickly discover why kiwis have a global reputation for warmth and good humour.jewels of the south pacificthe south pacific is a vast area dotted with idyllic tropical islands. the lush islands are rimmed with pristine beaches and coral gardens flourishing in clear blue seas. hayes & jarvis can take you to three wonderful archipelagos: fiji, tahiti, and the cook islands. pick any of these jewels in the ocean for your holiday, and you will find yourself immersed in exotic island life and local cultures.fiji is a group of over 330 volcanic islands with picturesque mountains, forests, and sandy beaches surrounded by fantastic coral reefs. you can expect water sports, relaxing on coconut tree-lined beaches, and warm fijian hospitality at your luxury resort. the largest island in french polynesia, tahiti has a reputation for pampering and indulging its visitors. no one ever leaves these islands disappointed. when you’re in this gorgeous corner of the planet, stay in an over-water bungalow, walk to hidden waterfalls, watch migrating humpback whales, and hop a ferry to nearby moorea island. the cook islands promise an ocean teeming with amazing marine life. you can explore these cerulean waters by snorkelling, diving, or glass-bottom boat. learn about the history and culture of the local pacific islanders as you interact with them and explore their paradisical land, food, markets, and cultural village. australasia may seem like a long way from the uk, but embarking on a journey to this part of the southern hemisphere is an investment in a lifetime of good memories. whether it’s the whitsunday islands or ayers rock, whale-watching in kaikoura or indigenous maori culture, mesmerising coral reefs or polynesian hospitality, book one of our australia multi-centre holidays or let us
