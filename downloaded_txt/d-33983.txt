"advise her to eat sh-- and die."





parents at coconut grove elementary school are calling for the ouster of principal eva n. ravelo this week after she told a parent in an e-mail to "eat sh-- and die."the controversy, which is now under review by the miami-dade county school district's central office, started monday. abigail dubearn, a member of the school's educational excellence school advisory committee, or eesac, had asked ravelo and other council members whether student representatives of the committee "could be notified today and be invited to attend and participate'' at monday's meeting.ravelo, 44, then replied to dubearn's e-mail with the message: "advise her to eat sh-- and die." ravelo spelled the swear word as it appears here — without the last two letters.maria orjeda, the school's reading coach, who spoke on behalf of ravelo, said the principal meant to send the e-mail about dubearn to her assistant principal, ramón dawkins, instead of dubearn.dubearn could not be reached for comment thursday."ms. ravelo takes full responsibility for the mistake. she apologized to mrs. dubearn on tuesday," orjeda said.the principal, who is still running the school, has been instructed not to speak with the media, orjeda said.this principal should be expelled!  that is what would happen if a student did the same.  the fact they she meant to send it to her asst principal does not make this better. expel principal ravelo!!!

govt agencies 'dropped the ball' in sex abuse case





a near total breakdown in communication, procedure and protocols throughout several government agencies, might have allowed a suspected child molester to leave the jurisdiction without being brought to justice, according to the findings of a committee to investigate alleged cases of sexual abuse at the eight mile rock high school (emr).  the final report of the committee was presented and tabled in the house of assembly by committee chairman and englerston mp glenys hanna-martin yesterday. hanna- martin said that one of the most disturbing things the committee discovered through research and public hearings, was that "teachers, administrators and staff were all aware of allegations and failed to report it."  those allegations were reportedly leveled against former emr art teacher andre birbal by several male students, long before he was arrested and questioned in connection with the alleged molestation of one of his former male students last year.
