question: i'm attempting to find out how to use a wmi or vbscript to modify the default "open with" program for a given 'file type' in windows xp. (both local and remote systems using wmi) i have users that want to open .doc files in wordpad.exe instead of wordview.exe.is there an object or method that exposes this availability? if so, does anybody have any code snips? i have to update about 1000+ computers and i would like to send out this script via sms or during login.batany help would be greatly appreciated!answer: the following command-line should do the trick for you:%comspec% /c assoc .doc=wordpad.document.1-or-cmd /c assoc .doc=wordpad.document.1this can be executed from a batch file.

winexit.scr permissions





question: when a limited user uses the winexit screen saver, i get the following error message:"error encountered while creating registry key.  make sure you have set value and create subkey permissions."answer: the winexit.scr does not run correctly under limited accounts by default. however, by altering the permissions for a registry key, you can resolve the problem.see : logoff screen saver does not function in windows ntnote that this kb was written for windows nt, but very much applies to windows xp as well.for configuring the registry permissions, see the kb below:how to use the windows xp and windows server 2003 registry editor features
