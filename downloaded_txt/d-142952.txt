bullet fine artphotographyhouse of bullet























































































timothy s. kump, aka bullet, is an interdisciplinary artist whose striking original works are created using an amalgamation of drawing, graphic/digital design and photography.  he calls his style graphic fine art.  he received a bachelor of fine arts degree (with honors) in communication design from parsons school of design in new york city.  coming from a background in graphic design, bullet’s fine art work is based in either drawing or photography and expresses a unique creative vision which embodies original, colorful, bold imagery with stylized graphic compositions.  bullet’s work reflects his many varied interests and his artistic influences and inspirations are ever evolving.  whatever creative discipline he starts with, whether it’s the human artistic skill of drawing, or the use of creative photography, his process next moves into the modern digital realm.  original drawings are scanned and recreated as vector art.  digital photographs are creatively altered and enhanced to magnify the aesthetic quality of each image while adding to the originality of each work.  bullet thrives on creating imagery that exudes simple sophistication.  like his commercial work, he hopes his fine art is imbued with a modern, yet classic, timeless quality that can be appreciated and enjoyed for many years to come.  bullet fine art™ works are available on apparel and as fine art originals and prints for the home or office.  artist bioawards / exhibitionscurriculum vitae
