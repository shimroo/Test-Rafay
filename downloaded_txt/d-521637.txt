 not only was david's real estate office recommended, we were told he himself was the man to do the job because he was a go-getter. we listed out home while on vacation in july 2013. david explained the process in detail at our dining room table.
                thomas








 it was a pleasure working with erik with the sale of our existing home and the purchase of our new home, at the same time. erik was on top of everything we needed to address and provided the support to make sure the sale and purchase of both houses went smoothly and they did.
