“when i would show several renoir films each year, i was always struck by their relevance, because every year there seemed to be an event or news that directly connected to this ‘old’ movie. i find la règle du jeu as most illustrative perhaps – all sorts of people from different social classes and backgrounds all making decisions that are understandable in one context, and yet have disastrous and horrific consequences in another. […] i think being a successful filmmaker means you have a keen eye for human behavior and human drama. renoir’s whole theory of humanity was that people across class had more in common than people within nations.”
elizabeth vitanza, “does renoir still matter today?” (lingua romana 18.1, fall 2024)
