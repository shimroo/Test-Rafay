january meeting
from criag vechorik and his bride elaine.
just for fun, this is our wedding photo.    we got married 27 years ago today.   we rode the 1951 r51/3 with the steib ls 200 sidecar, and got married standing beside the rig.


at today’s meeting we voted to have a catfish fry at roosevelt state park on april 12, 2025 at our regular monthly meeting. we will also ask for those that would rather have a burger or dog let us know so we can accommodate. we also would like you to bring your significant other for a good time. alan will head the event up and will be asking for help.

ride reports and tall tales: 
glad to report that dan is back in the saddle and today’s ride was a great way to get him back in shape!!   
alan and laurissa made a 485 mile day riding to stockton, al and back. we met up with 700+ other bikers on dec 30 for what is called the last ride of the year. very cold morning but we had some fantastic riding on roads we had never been on before.         
december meeting
ride reports and tall tales:ricky is a dual sport fanatic and again made a good ride this month. this time it was a bdr in ga in places around suches and eljay. the weather was wet and everyone went down at least once, and they all had a great time.
alan and laurissa went for a ride last weekend to eldridge children’s home. if you remember it was chilly last weekend. we left out friday morning in 28 degree weather and friday night it was 24. electric gear and fantastic roads made it a very good 2-day ride.
others made some local rtes but poor ole dan has been on the sidelines recovering from foot surgery, not to worry because in just 1 more week he will be back in the saddle, ye-haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
others like alan and laurissa have only made short rtes.
november meeting 
ride reports and tall tales: 

ricky is another quiet rider but loves to ride. has made several trips but his ride to nc with friends was good. like most groups he stated that there was two groups in one, one group was the “hell bent” group and the other was a more sedate one that got to enjoy the scenery. he had a great time.
others like alan and laurissa have only made short rtes.

october
ride reports and tall tales: 

dan has found a group called motorcycle sport tourers association that he spent a week riding with in west virginia. as the name suggests it is for riders that like a little sport in their riding. they have a good web page that you can check out. dan and bill made the ride but even though they had to fight rain they had a very good time.
ricky made a trip to nc but because of bad weather had to cut it short.
ricky is going to branson in the near future and if you want info just contact him. he also told of a web page for adventure roads fl
steve got bored and fueled up the ole gs and made a trip to ozark, al. just happens that his son’s gf’s father runs a bar there. they had a live band and steve rode up and was given the nick name of “ mississippi bad ass”.
bobby brooks is once again wearing out tires. he make a trip to bristol, tn and rode all the good roads like 421 “the snake” and others. then he turned around and went west to moab, ut and denver,co.  how do you do it!!
alan and laurissa also made a good trip. we rode to orlando and snagged the auto train to dc. then rode to annapolis, md, cape may, nj, mt. washington, nh the northeast to quebec city, qc, canada. then across canada to banff national park, calgary, ab, montana, glacier national park, on to lolo pass and then south through idaho and utah where we road atvs in moab. we actually met up with bobby. then on back home. 30 days and 8,450 miles.    

august 
ride reports and tall tales: 

most of us make day and lunch rides and while on the hunt for good eats dan found a country buffet named annie m’s in flora. it was good enough that he recommended it for a meeting location so that is where we will have the september meeting.
ian is the long distance rider this month and made it to the moa rally in redmond, or. he had a good time but stated that the rally was not as good as last years and attendance was down. it was very cold for a ms boy with the lows in the 30”s. with ice on his tent he wore all his cloths to bed. ian stayed a little longer to visit family and got to enjoy a good 4th of july fireworks show. he also stated that the 6,000 mile ride to and from was long and lonely.
alan and all his “boys” trailered their dirt bikes and side by sides to durham town off road park in ga. they road for 3 fantastic days before returning back home to the daily grind.
david pell road to florida for a good visit with his sister in tampa.
bobby brooks and his bil bryant headed out for a 5 day trip to ne tn but turned back after unexpected issues. bobby stated that he will return to tame hwy 421 “the snake”.


july
ride reports and tall tales:

most of us make day and lunch rides and kerry told of his ride to lorman. he had a good lunch at the old country store. however, when he stated that it was not as good as its reputation many others shouted out that they agreed. another new very good lunch place is lpf southern market on hwy 481 just north of morton. it is well worth the ride!
bobby brooks never ceases to amaze us. he made a ride to shreveport for lunch, then another to oxford and even toured the military park in vicksburg. and then he made it to it to damascus, pa on his honda 250. he trailered it north and rode parts of the mid atlantic backroads discovery ride. a 1050 mile route on forest service roads, rock, dirt and very small country lanes that goes from va to southern ny.
ricky made it to southern pennsylvania for the high point moto cross races.
steve is camping outside of starkville and as always he brought his honda 125 dirt bike. he has ridden all sorts of back roads and trails. when he started riding in tall grass he discovered that some chiggers and ticks were hanging on so he turned around. he said that he was having a good time.
