a quick back story; a few years ago, i purchased a very cosmetically-challenged 1999 anniversary miata so i could teach my kids how to drive a stick. once my children embraced the mechanics of driving a standard, and muscle memory became second nature, we decided to turn the miata into something fun. thus, the exocet build was born. as one modification begat another, we decided to jump off the deep end and do our on efi right down to building the harness. although i had done efi before, doing a stand-alone setup was quite the learning curve. with the basic setup complete and the car able to start and run, i reached out on a local forum for help with tuning. this is where shane benson answered the call. i’ll have to say, when shane and i began this journey, i did not expect the level of attention to detail and commitment to the task that he put forth during this tune. with the miata being so popular, i figured i would get something close to a canned tune and that would be that. i could never have been more wrong. first off, shane sent us a very detailed spec sheet to fill out. once this was done, shane logged in remotely on my laptop and started working his magic with the tune. during the process, we hit a couple of snags here and there and worked through these with ease. due to my work schedule as a pilot, completing the tune took several weeks. shane commitment never wavered, his patience never ran lean. in fact, even though i know shane was busy with other clients and family, he would treat me as though i were his most important customer.
over the course of our working together on this project, shane and i set up communication via email where i would do runs, log data and then send the data file to him to revise and send back to me. during the tuning process, i was fortunate enough to have shane’s travels route him through my neck of the woods. shane stopped by and he and i were able to take the car out for some hands-on tuning. lots of fun and smiles as we were able to experience all the hard work, determination and dedication come into fruition.

one of the best things about getting your car tuned by aim is shane’s excellent ability to explain and teach you what he’s doing as you go. we started off getting the car sorted out to be able to drive on the street, and made gradual iterations to get drivability, boost control, and power to where i wanted it. throughout the whole process, with each revision, shane asks how the car feels & explains what he adjusted. with this, i now feel pretty comfortable going into tunerstudio and playing around with my settings as i see fit. but if i ever have any questions, i know i can shoot him an email and he’ll be right back with me.
my car truly drives like factory until you press the loud pedal. the drivability on street is divine. but when you put your foot down, the car moves. the linearity of boost and power is stellar. my dyno guy even commented on how linear the car feels. shane was able to get my car running great again, got me to where i wanted to be power wise, and set up extras like closed loop boost control, all while being prompt and uber friendly.

now about the car. the car is basically oem turned up to 11. idle is smooth, low, predictable. throttle response is nearly as good as it has ever been, much better than before i got a ms3 and was using the tuning cards (only m45, no intercooler or pulley before). not that its the top of my list, but i get better gas milage than i did before the tune. and of course a very notible amout more power. the increase in power was most evident in the high rpms. 5000-7000 felt a bit flat before. now the car pulls harder all the way to redline. being able to see and feel the changes as we went through multiple revisions was also a good education and very interesting as well, and legit fun as i was able to see the improvements happening in real time.
