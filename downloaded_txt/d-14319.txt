social justice: black lives matter
ipsl stands with all who condemn police brutality, systemic racism, discrimination
                                    and oppression of any kind. we stand in solidarity with the black lives matter and
                                    bipoc communities to build just relationships and invest in one another’s liberation.
​we want to convey our deepest sympathy and solidarity with all summoned to action
                                    by the senseless murders of george floyd, breonna taylor, ahmaud arbery, and many
                                    other people of color.
at ipsl, we want to be of service to you and communities around the world to bring
                                    justice and healing and further advance the goal of peace that we all share. to address
                                    issues of racial injustice, we need to to build the type of systems we want to see.
                                    words mean nothing unless we change our behavior. we commit to progress, action, and
                                    accountability. we commit to being actively anti-racist.
