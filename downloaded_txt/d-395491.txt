phoenix arizona




may through september, it is imperative to give your trees shade. these upcoming months are not for the “weak of heart."  please remember to not cook your trees.  it can happen in just a few hours.




 







dappled shade is a premium as it allows for short periods of sun followed by cooling off periods in between. tree survival is based on many factors we often don't consider such as:








-size of tree and pot
-plant species
-watering habits of owner
-wind and sun exposure throughout the day.
-depth of pot.
-placement in yard
-soil composition

our rock star

 


























welcome the sonora suiseki club of arizona







 
 
the art originated in china where stones were admired for their natural beauty. they were used in miniature landscapes and depicted in scrolls. stones then made their way to japan where it was refined into an art form. this art form featured stones with uncut natural beauty and shapes were admired for generations. the stones were placed at just the right angle in their container or stand that enhanced the all-important viewing.
learn: rules & techniques, attend shows, trips to collect stones of your own.
meetings are on the 2nd tuesday each month starting sept 11th @7:00pm
location: valley garden center 1809 n. 15 av. phoenix az

bougainvillea 'rescue'







these photos are out of order, but we salvaged some bougainvillea cuttings from an abandoned office complex sept 3rd. check out the tough love, take no roots, approach. bonsai club guru gary said “guaranteed to grow” using this method. bougainvilleas are survivors
