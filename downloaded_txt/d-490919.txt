when the flow of material gets stuck, shake it loose!
for many years, the necessity to store material in bulk has created a problem - how to get it out of the storage vessel. typical problems include bridging, ratholing, clinging and arching. once a pluggage exists, it becomes necessary to remove it in order to continue with production. one of the first things an operator will do is try to dislodge it in some manner. historically, techniques such as water and air lances, silo cleanout equipment, shot gun blasts and even dynamite have been used to eliminate material blockage. the most common means of material removal over the years is the use of a sledgehammer.
having lived with these storage flow problems for decades, new techniques were developed to reduce these occurrences and address storage flow problems before a blockage occurs. one safe and efficient solution is the industrial vibrator, invented by edwin f. peterson in 1944, and the start of martin engineering.
martin engineering manufactures vibrators to prevent bin and hopper flow problems as well as rotary electric vibratory drives for industrial processing equipment.
the application of vibratory drives to processing equipment has found acceptance throughout industries world wide, primarily in increasing production throughput and reducing operational costs. the most typical applications include conveying or feeding, screening, draining, dewatering, product sizing, compaction, testing of components, as well as bin, hopper and chute evacuation.
industry applications for vibration solutions:

coal mining and processing
coal-fired power plants
steel
mining
cement
aggregate
biomass
recycling and waste management
fertilizer
smelters and foundries
ports and terminals
pulp and paper
rail and truck shipping
metals
grain hauling and food processing





our solutions for your biggest challenges:









electric vibrators
use reliable and economical electric power to improve flow, feed, separate or compact. 









ball vibrators
running 75 years strong, the original industrial vibrator since 1944. ideal for applications requiring less force. quieter operation and simple installation. 









roller vibrators
powerful vibration generated by a single moving part that requires no lubrication. 









piston vibrators
deliver timed individual strikes. ideal for stubborn flow problems like sticky material. 









hydraulic vibrators
vibration that works reliably in applications where electricity is not available. 









turbine vibrators
perfect for smaller bins and hoppers. quiet operation uses less energy. 









screen vibrators
use vibration energy to sift bulk solids or sort small items by size. 









concrete form vibrators
martin® concrete form vibrators solve common problems in the precast industry. heavy-duty electric externally-mounted vibrators will improve productivity and increase material strength and compaction. 









portable pneumatic vibrators
high-frequency vibration designed to run off of pneumatic air power. 









truck vibrators
thoroughly unload bulk solids from dump truck beds using industrial vibration. 









railcar vibrators
break up obstructions and compacted material buildup, allowing cargo to move easily through unloading ports.
