announcing my new book series, investigators! here's the official synopsis:
meet the investigators. with their gadgets, know-how, and super-fast transportation system (they flush themselves down toilets to speed through the sewers!) mango and brash are the scourge of the super villain landscape! as vest-wearing employees of the special undercover investigation teams, they solve all kinds of mysteries and frequently butt heads with their arch-nemesis: a former agent known as crackerdile.
riddled with puns, potty humor, absurdism, and hilarious twists, investigators is the perfect series for dog man fans looking for their next great read! it’s kid-friendly comics at their best.
the first book comes out on february 25th, 2020—so a few months after the second kitten construction company book, a bridge too fur. and like that series, it is also from first second books. you can read a little bit of what i've had to say about the series at paste magazine, here: https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/05/graphic-novel-reveal-john-patrick-greens-investiga.html

i know i am behind in keeping my website up to date, and i'm certainly late with this announcement, but it will at least be exciting news for a while:

written by new york times-bestselling author dave roman and illustrated by john green,
teen boat! is the story of a boy with the power to transform into a small yacht!

          from breaking out in barnacles to facing pirates and detention, all the challenges of adolescence are given a nautical twist.

        being a teen and being a boat means dealing with a lot of pier pressure!

after a year hiatus i will be attending san diego comic-con again, july 21-25. i will be at the comics bakery table in the small press area. it's table l-06, which can be found somewhere on this map: http://comic-con.org/cci/cci_exhib_1.php
i will have original pencil pages of the phineas & ferb comics i've been doing for disney, and i should also have the first two junior graphic novels that i've adapted (which can also be found on amazon here and here.) i will also have the new space office #2 mini-comic, plus teen boat and jax epoch comics. and on sunday at noon i'll be on a panel with dave roman and raina telgemeier doing some fun interactive comics making stuff.

i've updated my site! most of the new content can be found in the games section. there are screenshots of some games i've recently worked on, plus videos of stuff i've worked on for sony playstation home. i also added handy links to pdfs of my resume and portfolio at the top of this page.

deja vu! again it's been almost a year since an update! as usual, i've been very busy. over the summer i colored background art for one adventure game which is still pretty much under wraps, and i've also been doing the background art for puzzle bots, an adventure game which should come out late this year. since the spring i've also had a day job where i'm senior lead concept designer. sounds impressive, but i can't say too much about it other than if you have a playstation 3 and go into home you might come across some of my creative this halloween. it's a real stretch from my own work like nearly departed. speaking of halloween and zombies, i've decided to release an in-progress build of nearly departed so far. the game is still incomplete, and there are still some weird quirks to it (after playing awhile, animations start to play out of sync and dialog gets skipped, but the game is still playable, up until the point where you'll get "that part of the game is incomplete" messages.) you can find a new download link at the nearly departed page. hopefully i'll have another update sooner rather than later but my track record certainly speaks against me.

wow, it's been almost a year since an update! well, that can only mean i've been busy. and since i am updating, that means i can finally talk about the confidential project i've been working on all this time. i've been doing artwork for a computer game that will be coming out in a few months, and you can read all the details and see screenshots in my games section.
