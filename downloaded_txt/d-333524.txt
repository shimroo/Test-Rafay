the serpent website

the serpent is one of the
    most
    improbable
    musical instruments ever devised. in use almost continuously since
    its
    first appearance in 1590, it continues to find a place even in
    today's
    high-tech musical environment. this website provides basic
    information
    on all aspects of the instrument, from its early history through the
    present
    day.
    the content of the serpent website is intended for the interested
      lay
      person, not for serious musical research. news and other timely
      information
      is excluded, since there are other sources of information
      specializing
      in those areas. refer to the listed publications, periodicals,
      organizations
      and links and
        forum for more information.
