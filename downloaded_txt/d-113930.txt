      the succulent plant page  covers all aspects of succulent plants.learn how to grow succulents, how to identify succulents and from which countries they originate.look up botanical words in the glossary of botanical terms.    succulents are very popular ornamental plants because they are incredibly easy to grow.    the striking geometric forms, leaf textures and colours of succulents fit well with modern decor.   succulents cover a size range from miniature to tree-sized, so can fit every well-lit space.   a collection of succulents including some cacti  provides colourful flowers & interest throughout the year.   many succulents are very tolerant of the dry atmosphere in centrally-heated homes and offices.    desert-adapted succulent plants usually prefer plenty of bright light, even full sunshine.    succulents thrive and flower best on a sunny window ledge.   over-watering kills more succulents than anything else; a degree of benign neglect is actually a virtue.   always choose a pot or planter with drainage holes.    hardy succulents can be grown outdoors in the garden, patio planters or cold frame.   succulents are essential features of water-conserving and arid landscaping.        this page is © copyright r.j. hodgkiss 2024. last update: 08/01/2024email:  webmaster
