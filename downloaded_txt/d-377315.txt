                holmes in british comics - sherlock holmes

              up as holmes in classic british comics.
newspaper archives
vintage
                  theatre reviews - and other
                articles on sherlockian theatrical performances from the
                late 19th and early 20th century news archives. selected
                for their entertainment value, or for their commentary
                on the tastes and foibles of their times. may i
                recommend herbert
                  kelcey as a good one to start with?
forgotten
                  parodies - reproduced in full
                here, for the first time (as far as i can tell) since
                they were first published - sometimes for quite obvious
                reasons.
what else is here?

yet to come
the books waiting in the "to read"
                pile. if your book isn't here, i
                haven't got it...why don't you mail me a copy?
periphera
novels and stories that are almost but
                not quite sherlockian enough to appear in the main
                section (except that some of them do).
bloopers
a catalogue of clangers in sherlockian
                pastiches. find them here.
a pastiche
                  writer's dictionary
usage guide :
                a listing of examples of american-english and other
                inappropriate usages commonly found in pastiches, with
                their british-english equivalents and examples of
                correct usage from the canon.

does it include every pastiche ever
                written?
no, of course not. currently, i've
                indexed 496 novels (and a bit
                of i, sherlock holmes - i just can't get up the
                will to do the rest of it), 2220 short stories, 214 children's and young adult
                  stories, and 63 comic strips or graphic novels.
                click on the links for details of the editions used.
                more will be added on an irregular basis. there is no
                perceivable rhyme or reason to the order of inclusion,
                nor is the presence or absence of a story any indication
                of its literary merit.
as the number of sherlockian
              stories has increased into floods over the past few years,
              i can no longer hope or afford to keep up with them all -
              if you are published by mx, self-publishing or
              print-on-demanding and want to see your book here, you
              will need to send me a copy.
