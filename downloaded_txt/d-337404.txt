what happens?
in short, performances and lectures from the best magicians in the world combined with amazing informal jam sessions in the lobby and bar area. and not much sleep!
magifest is different from other conventions. we don‚Äôt schedule events to overlap, so you will be able to see every single session.
we put in breaks, so you can grab food, hang with your friends (and make new ones), and simply decompress a little to take in all the amazing magic you‚Äôve just learned.
and because we limit attendance, it‚Äôs not so busy that you have to fight to get a seat at shows, or the bar is 20 people deep, or you can never get a seat in the lobby.
you‚Äôll get to eat, sleep and breath magic for three, wonderful days. surrounded by like-minded magicians. you‚Äôll reconnect with old friends, and make new friends that will last a lifetime.
magifest also boasts the largest dealers room of any magic convention in america. you‚Äôll be able to see - and get your hands on‚Äîmany brand new, unreleased books, tricks, and more. this means you‚Äôll be ahead of the pack, and have the latest and greatest before anyone else!


who should attend?
everyone who shares our passion for magic! we have some of the best professional magicians in the world who come as attendees because they love the convention. equally, beginners and less experienced magicians come too, because they want to learn from, and be inspired by, the magicians who they get to see‚Äîand meet‚Äîat the convention.
it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôve been into magic for your entire life or just a few months. magifest is an inclusive convention and everyone is made to feel incredibly welcome.
if you‚Äôve never been to magifest, or any convention before, we‚Äôre organizing some new events this year to make sure you feel welcome, can make new friends, and most importantly become a better magician.
how much is it?
this is the good bit. it‚Äôs just $300 and that gives you three days full of incredible magic. you‚Äôre going to see, and learn, so much new magic that compared with anything else, magifest is the best value in magic.

how to book a room








introducing magifest basecamp



                    we have all felt overwhelmed by the idea of coming to a magic convention. what if you don‚Äôt know anyone? are people friendly? who will you chat with? who will you have dinner with? what if you‚Äôre nervous or anxious?
                

                    this year, we‚Äôre proud to announce new offerings designed to help first-timers, or those who want to make more friends feel as welcome as our magifest veterans.
                

                    we‚Äôre calling it basecamp. a safe place you can return to any time you need.
                

welcome event
                    after the first session, all first-timers are invited to a breakout room where you‚Äôll get to meet your hosts
                    josh and andi and your other friends-to-be. we‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre welcomed properly and get to meet each other.
                    friendships could be formed here that will last you a lifetime. we can‚Äôt wait to meet you.
                

basecamp tables
                    we know how it can feel awkward for a first-timer or magic beginner trying to join a jam session already in
                    progress. or that the idea of eating alone can feel intimidating. so, this year, we‚Äôre reserving special tables
                    in the convention area exclusively as your ‚Äúbasecamp‚Äù.
                

                    these tables will be marked with table tents and will often have hosts present to help people get to know each
                    other, to encourage us all to help each other with moves, or tricks, and to just generally have the best of
                    times. whether you‚Äôre working on a new trick or just want to see some cool magic, these tables will be a great
                    place for basecampers to gather.
                

special pins
                    a special pin will let everyone know you are a basecamper. beyond being an awesome collectible, this will help
                    magifest veterans better welcome basecampers and ensure you experience the very best of magifest.
                

                    magifest is undoubtedly one of the best weekends of the year for magicians and mentalists. we don‚Äôt want you to
                    miss anything. so we‚Äôre doing everything we can to make sure you feel welcomed and have an incredible
                    experience.
