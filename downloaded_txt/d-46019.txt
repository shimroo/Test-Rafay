overview


i have been working with clay for more than 40 years. i had a long hiatus in the middle of my artistic career to work at a more conventional job in the computer industry. i also taught in the art department of cambrian college for a number of years.
i love form – from the anthropomorphic abstractions of henry moore and essential forms of constantin brancusi to the soft, flowing beauty of auguste rodin’s la danaïde and his emotive burghers of calais..
if one considers a scale with romantic on one end and classical on the other, i tend to be more on the romantic end. i love spontaneity and the emotive responses it can evoke. although i plan my work to some extent, i would not continue unless there was room for spontaneity. as brancusi once said:
“there are idiots who define my work as abstract; yet what they call abstract is what is most realistic. what is real is not the appearance, but the idea, the essence of things.”
