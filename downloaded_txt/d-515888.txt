welcome to the pacific coast baseball league!


pcbl is la's premiere adult 18+ baseball league.  we are an adult recreational league that prides itself on having some of the best fields, competition and players in all of la county!  our playoffs and all star games are held on some of the best fields in the area.  our regular season games are on college & high school varsity fields throughout la (with real mounds, grass infields, fences and dugouts!)  every game will have a minimum of two umpires, and all games and player stats are kept online for all to see!  our spring season begins around february/march and is 18 games, and our fall season begins in september and is a 10 game season.  we also host a mid-week evening division, for those of you who think baseball shouldn't just be played on the weekends and prefer playing under the lights!
 
so if you love the game of actual baseball, still have the competive spirit and appreciate organized baseball... then pcbl is the place for you!  joining our league is easy.  click join now and register in the player pool. after that, either come to one of the open tryouts that are held before each season, or wait to be contacted by one of our teams during the season.
