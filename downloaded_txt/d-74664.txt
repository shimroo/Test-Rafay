“the family stopped for a delicious lunch for the most amazing clam chowder i have ever tasted. the inn was very warm and inviting, rich with history in a village older than most places i’ve visited. the service was really good and the red lion turkey sandwich was delicious! you can spend a lot of time just hanging out in the parlor area chatting with strangers! great stop don’t miss it!”- frank p






we had the pleasure of staying at the red lon inn this past weekend, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. our room was incredibly comfortable, with charming, cozy touches that made it feel like a home away from home. the highlight, however, was the staff- they truly went above and beyond to ensure we were taken care of. from the warm welcome upon arrival to the attentive service throughout our stay, everyone made sure we felt comfortable and valued. t's clear that hospitality is a top priority here, and we can't wait to return. highly recommend!- abigail m.






“absolutely outstanding. several friends of mine and i had saturday dinner in the dining room. food was delicious. service was impeccable. and, the setting was magnificent. what a magical experience!”- timothy






“the red lion inn is a relaxing and peaceful place. we enjoyed the food in the dining room and in the pub. it was peaceful to sit on the large front porch or in one of the many sitting rooms. there is so much history to the inn and in the lovely town of stockbridge.”- amanda v.
