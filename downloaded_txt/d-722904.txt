mrha land acknowledgement
as we gather on the traditional territory of the algonquin anishinaabe nation, we acknowledge their enduring presence and deep connection to this land. we pay respect to their elders past and present, and recognize their ongoing stewardship of the land, waterways and resources. we also acknowledge the historical and ongoing injustices faced by indigenous peoples and commit to building meaningful relationships based on mutual respect, understanding and reconciliation.
