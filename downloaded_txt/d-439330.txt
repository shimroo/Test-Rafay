her mission:one race.jane elliott, internationally known teacher, lecturer, diversity trainer, and recipient of the national mental health association award for excellence in education, exposes prejudice and bigotry for what it is, an irrational class system based upon purely arbitrary factors. and if you think this does not apply to you. . . you are in for a rude awakening.

  




 











the blue eyes &brown eyesexercise
in response to the assassination of martin luther king, jr. in 1968, jane elliott devised the controversial and startling, "blue eyes/brown eyes exercise." this, now famous, exercise labels participants as inferior or superior based solely upon the color of their eyes and exposes them to the experience of being a minority. everyone who is exposed to jane elliott's work, be it through a lecture, workshop, or video, is dramatically affected by it.

acclaim for thebrown eyes &blue eyesexercise



it won't help much to be prepared to face jane elliott. this elderly woman will tear down any shield. even we, the spectators in blue eyed, can't get rid of this feeling of uneasiness, embarrassment, anxiety and utterly helpless hatred when she starts keeping people down, humiliating them, deriding them, incapacitating them. no doubt about this: for three quarters of the time in this documentation jane elliott is the meanest, the lowest, the most detestful, the most hypocritical human being hell has ever spit back on earth. but she should be an example for all of us.stuttgarter zeitung
