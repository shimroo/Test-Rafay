"the level of service and support far exceeds all
                                                vendors that i have worked with. once you start using the product, it
                                                becomes almost second nature. it does a great job of tracking the
                                                professional development registrations for the 160,000 employees in the
                                                nycdoe. i highly recommend this product..."

                                                commitment to emerging areas of professional development â such as
                                                teacher evaluation â has helped us stay ahead of the curve in reporting,
