your pet is special! their personality, breed, and the household they are raised in all play a role in how they respond to you.  we custom-tailor our programs to fit your needs and their personality.our approach is different  if we teach your pet how to communicate only with us, it leaves you in the same place once they are returned to your supervision and care. instead, we partner with you and teach you how to understand how your pet communicates and help you build desirable life-long habits in your companion. the results are simple. the program is designed for you to teach your dog the behaviors they need to be a well-behaved companion, and you will have the knowledge and skill to effectively guide them with confidence.

why dog training fails  



many dog training programs fail because owners are not included in the process. it’s also true that where you train him is just as important as the how. if you train him at the park or at a pet store, it will be very difficult to fix the behavior problems driving you crazy that are happening at home. so training at home and school first, then adding distracting locations once your dog understands what we are asking of him, is important.training at home and making owners part of the process allows us to build their confidence as they learn lifelong habits for well-behaved companions.the owners who will be most successful are the ones whoactively participate in hands-on learningcomplete homework assignments to assure your dogs understanding of the conceptskeep their weekly appointments and fully participatepractice their new skills consistently in the real worldshare what they learn with the entire household

meet lyn richards pawlowski,founder & chief dog trainera positive reinforcement trainer, since her first job as a dog walker at age 15, lyn has been helping dogs and their owners build stronger connections. in her early years at other dog training programs, she saw a gap when it came to training the dog and the owner together. and often, the training was too complicated for the owner to replicate after the initial program was over.

that’s where doglogic began - with the goal of creating a training program that benefits both the dog and the owner, and is easy to understand and repeat. over the years, lyn has worked with a variety of dog breeds, personalities, and circumstances and has written articles and co-authored a book on the subject of obedience training. she is an assistant agility trainer at all dogs gym, and competes with her own dogs in cpe agility trials. lyn is also a dog trainer mentor for animal behavior college and has trained other new and experienced dog trainers in her unique training approach.
