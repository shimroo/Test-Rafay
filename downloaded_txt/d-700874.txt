gael szymanski
"i love the fact that jewish federation of delaware not only supports its jewish community, but reaches out to our non-jewish community as well. our federation gives us a sense of belonging not only to our local community but educates and connects us to israel and jews all around the world."







ellisha caplan
“why federation? because i know that it is the one place where my donation is going to help with the greatest needs in our jewish community. whether that means ensuring our values and traditions are passed on through programs like pj library, or ensuring aging holocaust survivors are receiving medical care and healthy meals halfway around the world, when i give to federation i know that my gift will be used responsibly, and it is making a difference.”







caryl marcus-stape
“jewish federation of delaware serves our local and global communities with transparent accountability as the wise stewards of donors’ philanthropic giving. i put my family’s trust in federation – together as one.”







lisa dadone-weiner
“jewish federation of delaware does an absolute world of good for people that are in true need and often dire need of aid.”







jaidy schweers
“of all the organizations i could donate to, i choose jewish federation of delaware, simply because i have seen my contributions make a real difference.”







ginger weiss
“it gives me great pleasure to give back to our community. i donate to the jewish federation of delaware because it provides significant support to organizations and institutions that mean so much to me.”







meredith rosenthal
“jewish federation of delaware means many things to our local community and beyond, but to me it means “bayit,” or home.”
