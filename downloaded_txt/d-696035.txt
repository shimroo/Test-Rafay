 read our reviews

   
 we had a great room that opened up right onto the river with adirondack chairs and fire pits. usually at these older hotels the furnishings and bedding is older as well, but our room was decorated beautifully! i slept so well.
randy h., aspen, co


 
 great place to stay in the lost sierra. clean, comfortable, lovely white noise coming from the river. trails, trails, trails!!
-nina g., valley center, ca


 
 this is a fantastic, cozy, clean, and quiet little hotel right on the river in downieville. the owners are very nice and helpful, and ready to make sure you have a great stay. 5 stars and will definitely return!
lisa d., reno, nv


 
 what a great place! right on the edge of a river in an old historic town. the staff was super friendly and we couldn't have been happier. the place was clean and the beds were comfortable. nice restaurants and a coffee shop in town, too.
shawn p., santa cruz, ca


 
 we come here every year for mountain biking season, and recently started coming over the winter just to enjoy the little town and peace of the mountains. the location here is nice because you can walk to everything.
michael t, north bend, wa


 
 perfect way to start our day in the sierras! can‚Äôt recommend enough.
oliver jensen


 
 great spot for delicious coffee, snacks, ice cream, and a small food selection. the lavender latte is my new favorite, perfectly balanced. they have a ton of grab and go snacks and their breakfast sandwich is huge.
jen powell


 
 we had a wonderful breakfast here the morning after thanksgiving. michelle welcomed us with a big smile and made us the most delicious avocado toast and panini. she even made us some apple slices with warm caramel sauce. so yummy!! the coffee was excellent too.
iben s


 
 great food, coffee, and service!we stopped here on our way down from the mountains and are so happy we did! downieville is such a cute little town and cold rush makes a great addition to it! the service is incredible and everyone working there was so friendly.

  historic monday moment! 

this is the downieville blacksmith shop that stood before the great flood in 1937. today the carriage house inn stands in its place, right along the jersey bridge. you can even see what is now the @riversidemountainlodge across the way! 

the inn was rebuilt as a larger building, as it has been home to the town post office, apartments, a barber shop, and more. extra care has been taken to restore the inn with mid-century decor, while providing modern amenities like eco-friendly soaps and bath products, luxury linens, and cozy furniture giving each room its own unique welcoming feel. 

today the inn has nine well appointed rooms, with lovely views of both downtown and the downie river. while all other rooms have full bathrooms our jersey and craycroft rooms share a shower down the hall, giving you that home-away-from-home feel. from the yuba suite, you have a peek-a-boo view of the confluence alongside the durgan bridge! 

the carriage house inn has been home to many a mountain people; to miners and loggers and prospectors of all kinds. it's a special place to rest and relax with the sound of the river rushing by, a place of work and connection, an oasis for celebration, a warm winter destination, an air conditioned summer reprieve, a place people don't want to leave, and the front door to a long list of adventures. 

it is spot that many recall fondly, as it is a special place at the confluence of two pristine mountain rivers. carriage house is our inn, our home, and our little slice of heaven in the #lostsierra.

we are seeing the first signs of spring here in downieville, while still crunching snow around beneath our feet. the weather had been gorgeous. sun beaming through the trees, fish jumping, river roaring, and folks walking down main st. 

this weekend, john (from the one and only coyote creek kitchen), will be serving breakfast and lunch inside la cocina de oro! he has been opening the doors for guests in town, as well as locals, to enjoy and partake in delicious options. don't worry.. it's just a seasonal pop-up, while the team at la cocina enjoys their winter break. üòÑ
