    children, youth,

﻿& families

 children’s ministries at christ church are thoughtfully planned to engage children in the mysteries of our faith, the rhythms of our worship, and the work of god in the world. the spiritual and developmental needs of christ church’s children are a priority here, and children are an essential part of our life together as a church.

  

children's ministries

 christ church youth ministries exist to inspire, empower, and celebrate youth, in partnership with their families, to develop a life-long identity in the body of christ.
