about blues experience:






for his brand-new project blues experience, shimabukuro joins forces with his friend, drumming legend and founding member of fleetwood mac, mick fleetwood, to create a fresh new take on the blues. “i’ve always wanted to do a blues
                      album and when mick and i started talking about working together, i thought who better to work with than mick fleetwood?” the result is something exhilarating and unique, as these two titans of their instruments reinterpret some
                      of the greatest songs written by some of their favorite songwriters in a blues setting.






“mick’s like the point guard on a basketball team making everyone around him play better. it’s really incredible. he has such a huge presence, charisma and energy. it was such an honor to do this project together.
