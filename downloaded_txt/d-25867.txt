keystone property inspections
                athens, al






        our process: how keystone property inspections works for you

initial consultation
every inspection begins with a thorough discussion to understand your unique needs, whether you are purchasing a residential or commercial property. we take the time to outline the entire inspection process, addressing any specific concerns you may have about the property and setting clear expectations.

comprehensive property inspection
our licensed and experienced inspectors conduct an in-depth examination of all major systems and components, such as the foundation, roofing, plumbing, electrical, and hvac. we encourage you to attend the inspection, allowing us to explain potential issues as we find them. this hands-on approach ensures you gain valuable insights into the property’s condition and helps you make well-informed decisions.

use of advanced technology
at keystone property inspections, we go beyond the surface by using cutting-edge tools like thermal imaging. as an optional add-on service, thermal imaging helps detect hidden issues such as moisture intrusion, electrical hot spots, and insulation voids that may not be visible during a standard inspection. this technology allows us to offer a more comprehensive analysis of the property.

detailed inspection report
you will receive a clear, detailed digital report at the end of the inspection or within 24 hours of the inspection depending on the condition of the property. the report includes high-quality photos, straightforward explanations, and recommendations for any necessary repairs or maintenance. this user-friendly document provides you with a comprehensive overview of the property’s condition, empowering you to address concerns confidently.

post-inspection review
we understand that the inspection process can feel overwhelming, so we take the time to review the report with you either in person or over the phone. this step ensures you fully understand the findings, and we will answer any questions or concerns you may have. our goal is to make sure you feel empowered and informed before moving forward.

follow-up support
our service doesn’t end once the inspection is completed. we’re here for you if any follow-up questions arise or if you need clarification on specific findings. if necessary, we offer re-inspections after repairs to ensure everything has been properly addressed, giving you peace of mind before finalizing your decision.... see more
