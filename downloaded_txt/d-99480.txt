hello !!
my name is sylvia holtman    and i am the craftsperson behind sylcraft beads and jewelry. i live in central washington state and we generally have great weather here in central washington.  summers are warm and sunny and spring is just right.  we usually have a little snow in the winter although this year it was quite cold and our winter lasted a long time.  the cat just came inside and said forget it out there !!
 
 i have been making my handmade lampwork glass beads since 1997.  
this was added to the gemstone wire jewelry that i had previously been making.    
 as you explore this site you will see some of my work displayed. 
we have moved our retail store online at this time but local pickup is available if you purchase your items through our online store and choose this option. no shipping costs are added for local pickup.

a little bit on glass beads
glass beads have been a part of our society for millenia.
since glass beads were used for trading purposes and to identify a person of stature in society, glass beads become intricately woven into our world.  
native americans used beads as adornment and many beautiful works of art can be found adorning clothing worn for ceremonial purposes.  most beads used were tiny glass seed beads and were sewn into the garments to become part of the actual fabric structure.  bone and other types of materials were also used to accent the look.
glass beads as a trade element were highly prized and used to trade for furs and other items. as you can see, glass beads are not a new idea !!  ;-)
i think we still use jewelry and beads to identify the more "elite" in our midst.  just think of the movie stars and musicians who use jewelry to show their abundance. 
handmade art glass beads have also made their impact around the world.  this is not a new idea either as the art of lampworking has been around for thousands of years and some interesting antique beads have been found.  however, as american and other glass workers constantly challenge the techniques, more and more  handmade glass art bead designs appear.  
i hope you enjoy my personal take on this beautiful wearable art form !
sylvia  :-)

beads
 please note that beads are handcrafted and will vary in size and possibly in color.
 beads all begin as a rod of color--
 
either transparent or opaque of some kind 
(i use imported italian glass or czech glass as a general rule)
the rod is then heated in a propane/oxygen torch to a molten state and then formed by hand into the beads you will see as you enter the bead sections of the store.   no molds are used in this process. 
they are then annealed for at least 8 hours in a kiln at the proper temperature so they do not crack later. it is quite a process !! but so fun...
here are examples of some of the beads you will see as you browse the store...
