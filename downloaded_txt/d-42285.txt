2009 nba draft live blogging the lottery





1. blake griffin - la clippersno surprise here. clippers get a beast and should try and trade randolph but doubt they get any takers.2. hasheem thabeet - memphis grizzliesnot sure he's worth the # 2 but you can't teach height. great shotblocker but no offense, is a project.3. james harden - ok citygood pick here for ok city. they get a polished scored and there really was no need for them to grab a pg when they have other needs.4. tyreke evans - sacramento kingskings liked evans all along. surprised they didn't take rubio.5. ricky rubio - minnesota timberwolvest'wolves need a pg desperately. they get rubio at # 5. what worries me about rubio is can he handle the physicality of the nba?6. jonny flynn - minnesota timberwolvesstrange pick. is a trade coming for either rubio or flynn. seems to be..stay tuned.7. stephen curry - golden state warriorsnelson cannot resist the run and gun style that curry will fit right in. good pick at # 7. will he actually get minutes for g state? i hope so.8. jordan hill - new york knicksouch...not that hill is a bad pick but the fact that curry goes one slot ahead of ny kills me. hill is a solid pick here and with david lee rumored to be leaving as a free agent this could be his replacement.9. demar derozen - toronto raptors he's a project but could develop into an all star player. i think he does nothing this season for toronto but three years from now he could be a factor.10. brandon jennings - milwaukee bucks reminds me of monta ellis. he needs to develop, the time in italy did nothing for him. too many holes in his game to take seriously next season. milwaukee needs help.11. terrance williams - new jersey netsthere was a promise in place two days ago. much better pick that hansbrough. new jersey is in full on rebuild mode, going to be a long year nets fans.12. gerald henderson - charlotte bobcatsthere is a promise here in place here as well.13. tyler hansbrough - indiana pacersi thought ty lawson would be the pick.....wrong ty. anyway, he will be a solid role player in the league for the next 10 years. has a chip on his shoulder don't underestimate that.

nba mock draft 2.0





going to be a wild nighthere it is :1. la clippers - blake griffin f oklahomathis is a no brainer for lac (i hope). in a draft such as this griffin is the safe pick.2. memphis grizzlies - hasheem thabeet c uconnthey could easily go with rubio but mike conley picked it up last season and the grizzlies think he is their pg of the future. they have time to develop a project such as thabeet.3. ok city thunder - ricky rubio pg spaini cannot see rubio slipping any further than this slot. whether its ok city taking him or a trade develops. rubio is the pick at # 3.4. sacramento kings - stephen curry g davidsonassuming the kings do not get rubio, they take the next best thing : stephen curry.5.minnesota t'wolves  - james harden g arizona stthis would be a solid pick for a young team with a need for a scorer. the pieces are fitting for the t'wolves, pg will be the focus next6. minnesota t'wolves - jonny flynn pg syracusejonny flynn has risen up draft boards all season long. # 6 seems about right for a player who has some holes but his strength, speed and ability to take to the rim are huge factors in his rise.7. golden state warriors - brandon jennings pg italycould be one of the steals of the draft. jennings is not nba ready but in year 2 or 3 the warriors are going to be a force in the western conference. jordan hill is a strong possibility here.8. ny knicks - tyreke evans g memphisupside pick here. knicks are not in it to win this upcoming season so they can take a chance on evans who may develop into a versatile pg/sg. he is not the knicks # 1 choice at this point but they would be happy to have him slip to them at # 8.9. toronto raptors - jordan hill f arizona hill slips to toronto who is ecstatic with this pick.10. milwaukee bucks - james johnson pf wake forestbig time acc banger should help toughen up this soft team 11. new jersey nets - dejuan blair pf pittnj is looking for a "beast". with blair on the board he fits this profile. 12. charlotte bobcats - terrance williams f louisvillepromise is in place, twill goes to charlotte.13. indiana pacers - ty lawson pg unci think lawson is the pick and he'll be backing up tj ford until tj's next injury. this pick will also allow the versatile jarrett jack to play more off the ball.14. phoenix suns - gerald henderson sg dukesolid pick here for phoenix. henderson is not flashy but he brings defense, toughness, and some scoring ability to a team that has potential to make a deep run if the team stays in tact and everyone remains healthy.15. detroit pistons - bj mullens c ohio stthere may be a promise in place for the pistons to take mullens here. this makes some sense to me but i'm not a huge mullens supporter. he is a long term project who really needed another year at ohio state. with this pick detroit is accepting the rebuilding stage of their franchise. what a great run they had though.16. chicago bulls - demar derozen sg uscderozen slips to # 16. he had a disappointing year with the exception of the ncaa tourney. too many question marks are what's preventing him from going higher, the talent is there but can he put it all together consistently?17. philadelphia 76ers - jrue holiday g uclai'm torn on holiday. he is all over the place when it comes to scouts opinions. is his disappointing one season due to ucla's system? is he the next russell westbrook? i was hoping he would return to ucla and prove himself worthy of a top five pick, he'll get his chance in philly instead.18. minnesota t'wolves - omri casspi sf israel  19. atlanta hawks - eric maynor pg vcuwith lawson gone maynor is the choice here at #19. there is talk of resigning bibby which would allow maynor to play a bench role and not be expected to contribute right away.20. utah jazz - austin daye f gonzagabig mystery as to what your going to get from daye. i think with the veterans utah has in place this would be a good fit for the versatile although inconsistent daye.21. no hornets - wayne ellington sg unchornets need someone who can step up and score. ellington will get plenty of open looks and should contribute immediately. 22. dallas mavericks - earl clark f louisvilledallas is a team in full on middle of the pack mode. i think this pick comes down to either clark or casspi. i'm going with clark as he is more nba ready right now. let's not forget that going into the season clark was projected to be a top five pick. this could be a steal at # 22 for a team desperate for young talent.23. sacramento kings - jeff teague pg wake forest24. portland trailblazers - darren collison pg uclafor the record i think portland trades out of this pick. for mock draft purposes pg is the direction i assume they will take if they do not make a trade. collison who was steady his entire career at ucla (except in big games) could be the pick here. i projected him originally in the second round as i feel that where his value is, a first round selection and guaranteed contract seems like a reach for him.25. ok city thunder - tyler hansbrough pf unc hansbrough gives this young team a solid bench contributor.26. chicago bulls - toney douglas g florida stwith ben gordon potentially leaving the chi with the their second pick toney douglas is their man. toney is a seasoned acc combo guard who really improved his stock in his final year at florida state. center is also a need for the bulls but no real options here.27. memphis grizzlies - chase budinger sf arizonachase finds his way into the first round and may help the grizzlies in a bench role. they need scoring help in the second unit, chase may slide into that role. 28. minnesota t'wolves - nick calathes g floridafor financial reasons the wolves pick calathes with the thought of him as an asset for the future.29. la lakers -dajuan summers g georgetownthe lakers championship team will be looking for bench help. with the lack of consistency from sasha vujacic,shannon brown, etc. i would expect the lakers to go guard or combo guard with this pick. ariza may be bolting la as well.30. cleveland cavaliers - taj gibson pf uscthe cavs are in need of another big man. taj gibson out of usc is the pick. jonas jerebko is a scrappy forward out of sweden who may be able to help in a year or two but in year two will lebron still be a cav?

2009 nba mock draft





this may go down as one of the worst drafts in history. i do expect there be some trade activity, mostly from teams that want to trade back or out of this draft. i do like this years crop of point guards though. barring trades here it is :1. la clippers - blake griffin f oklahomathis is a no brainer for lac (i hope). in a draft such as this griffin is the safe pick.2. memphis grizzlies - hasheem thabeet c uconnthey could easily go with rubio but mike conley picked it up last season and the grizzlies think he is their pg of the future. they have time to develop a project such as thabeet.3. ok city thunder - ricky rubio pg spaini cannot see rubio slipping any further than this slot. whether its ok city taking him or a trade develops. rubio is the pick at # 3.4. sacramento kings - stephen curry g davidsonassuming the kings do not get rubio, they take the next best thing : stephen curry.5. washington wizards - jordan hill f arizona wizards have a talented team but are looking for flexibility. trading jamison seems to be a lock so i'm going with jordan hill as the pick. harden woould also be a very strong possibility if no jamison trade is made.6. minnesota t'wolves - james harden g arizona stthis would be a solid pick for a young team with a need for a scorer. the pieces are fitting for the t'wolves, pg will be the focus next.7. golden state warriors - brandon jennings pg italycould be one of the steals of the draft. jennings is not nba ready but in year 2 or 3 the warriors are going to be a force in the western conference.8. ny knicks - tyreke evans g memphisupside pick here. knicks are not in it to win this upcoming season so they can take a chance on evans who may develop into a versatile pg/sg. he is not the knicks # 1 choice at this point but they would be happy to have him slip to them at # 8.9. toronto raptors - dejuan blair pf pittblair is a boom/bust type of pick. toronto needs a banger down low and this is the best available at # 9.10. milwaukee bucks - jonny flynn pg syracusejonny flynn has risen up draft boards all season long. # 10 seems about right for a player who has some holes but his strength, speed and ability to take to the rim are huge factors in his rise.11. new jersey nets - tyler hansbrough pf uncnj is looking for a "beast". with blair gone they reach for hansbrough. i do not like the pick but i'm buying the rumor on this one. credit to chad ford for the leak.12. charlotte bobcats - james johnson pf wake forest  mj will be phoning this one in from the clubhouse after his second round of 18. johnson will provide frontcourt help that will okafor & diaw especially.13. indiana pacers - jeff teague pg wake foresti think teague is the pick and he'll be backing up tj ford until tj's next injury. this pick will also allow the versatile jarrett jack to play more off the ball.14. phoenix suns - gerald henderson sg dukesolid pick here for phoenix. henderson is not flashy but he brings defense, toughness, and some scoring ability to a team that has potential to make a deep run if the team stays in tact and everyone remains healthy.15. detroit pistons - bj mullens c ohio stthere is a promise in place for the pistons to take mullens here. this makes some sense to me but i'm not a huge mullens supporter. he is a long term project who really needed another year at ohio state. with this pick detroit is accepting the rebuilding stage of their franchise. what a great run they had though.16. chicago bulls - demar derozen sg uscderozen slips to # 16. he had a disappointing year with the exception of the ncaa tourney. too many question marks are what's preventing him from going higher, the talent is there but can he put it all together consistently?17. philadelphia 76ers - jrue holiday g uclai'm torn on holiday. he is all over the place when it comes to scouts opinions. is his disappointing one season due to ucla's system? is he the next russell westbrook? i was hoping he would return to ucla and prove himself worthy of a top five pick, he'll get his chance in philly instead.18. minnesota t'wolves - ty lawson pg uncthe rebuilding of the t'wolves backcourt continues with the seasoned pg out of unc. i like the pick to bring in an experienced player who should be getting major minutes right away. injuries with lawson are a concern but to me this is a solid pick.19. atlanta hawks - eric maynor pg vcuwith lawson gone maynor is the choice here at #19. there is talk of resigning bibby which would allow maynor to play a bench role and not be expected to contribute right away.20. utah jazz - austin daye f gonzagabig mystery as to what your going to get from daye. i think with the veterans utah has in place this would be a good fit for the versatile although inconsistent daye.21. no hornets - wayne ellington sg unchornets need someone who can step up and score. ellington will get plenty of open looks and should contribute immediately. 22. dallas mavericks - earl clark f louisvilledallas is a team in full on middle of the pack mode. i think this pick comes down to either clark or casspi. i'm going with clark as he is more nba ready right now. let's not forget that going into the season clark was projected to be a top five pick. this could be a steal at # 22 for a team desperate for young talent.23. sacramento kings - omri casspi sf israelafter filling their backcourt need with stephen curry the kings turn their attention to another need, scoring from the sf position. can he step up right away? probably not, but an intriguing prospect for the kings future plans.24. portland trailblazers - darren collison pg uclafor the record i think portland trades out of this pick. for mock draft purposes pg is the direction i assume they will take if they do not make a trade. collison who was steady his entire career at ucla (except in big games) could be the pick here. i projected him originally in the second round as i feel that where his value is, a first round selection and guaranteed contract seems like a reach for him.25. ok city thunder -terrence williams g/f louisvilletwill is a solid pick this late in the first round. he does a lot of things to help but does not stand out in one particular area. why does ok city take him here? i think he fits the backup sg/sf perfectly on this young team and his defense should get him on the floor rather quickly. ok city is building and this is going to be a fun team to watch next season.26. chicago bulls - toney douglas g florida stwith ben gordon potentially leaving the chi with the their second pick toney douglas is their man. toney is a seasoned acc combo guard who really improved his stock in his final year at florida state. center is also a need for the bulls but no real options here.27. memphis grizzlies - chase budinger sf arizonachase finds his way into the first round and may help the grizzlies in a bench role. they need scoring help in the second unit, chase may slide into that role. 28. san antonio spurs - derrick brown f xavier the sf position is a concern for the spurs and brown may be able to come in and at least seize a backup role right away. 29. la lakers -dajuan summers g georgetownthe lakers championship team will be looking for bench help. with the lack of consistency from sasha vujacic,shannon brown, etc. i would expect the lakers to go guard or combo guard with this pick. ariza may be bolting la as well.30. cleveland cavaliers - taj gibson pf uscthe cavs are in need of another big man. taj gibson out of usc is the pick. jonas jerebko is a scrappy forward out of sweden who may be able to help in a year or two but in year two will lebron still be a cav?

all star draft update





halfway through the ncaa season there are two contenders for the #1 pick in the draft :blake griffin - oklahoma maybe the best athlete in the draft. has a superb inside game. explosive dunker, has an incredible vertical leap. on top of all that he is a rebounding beast. i do not see any scenario where he does not go # 1 overall. this is a can't miss prospect.hasheem thabeet - uconn  hasheem certainly made the right move in staying in school. he is a gamechanger like no other in the ncaa on defense, offense comes and goes. major improvements have been made throughout his uconn career and continued progress in reaching full potential justifies a draft selection in the top two.

jajuan johnson anyone?





sleeper alert : jajuan johnson from purdue.as i mentioned in my mock draft post back in june :13. jajuan johnson f/c - sophomore purdue : should be a double double machine in the big ten in his second season. was a project coming into purdue but has increased muscle and has been coached to have more of an impact on the defensive end. very raw but his potential is what gets him drafted in this spot.the #13 ranking was higher than anybody ranked him before the season. now i have heard from two sources that he has started to generate legit interest in that range and could go higher. keep an eye on this kid and don't forget who had this info first.

will rajon rondo go down as the best player in the 2006 nba draft?





rajon rondo and the 2006 nba draft: look, i know its early to look back on a draft but i am going to do it anyway.the first pick made was also the first international player to go # 1 overall : andrea bargnani. so far, you can certainly question that pick but the draft overall at least at this point will be looked at as one of the weaker drafts in recent memory. in my opinion there is one exception :rajon rondo : phoenix must be kicking themselves right now as there couldn't have been a better fit than rondo playing in the fast paced phoenix offense.the suns essentially sold this pick to danny ainge and the boston celtics at # 21 and without hesitation rondo became the pick. there was definetely some risk involved here for boston as rondo's college career was a rocky ride on the court due to consistency and player role issues and off the court due to a embattled relationship with coach tubby smith. the biggest negative regarding rondo was his outside shooting prowess. at the time nba gm's were looking for that zone busting three point shooting point guard, not your old school play maker type. guards selected before rondo included:brandon roy at # 6 who is a top notch sg for portlandrandy foye at # 7 who is more of a combo guard,and has battled injuriesjj redick at # 11 nba quality shooter and not much elsethabo sefolosha at # 13, combo guard not a gamebreaker, selected too early.ronnie brewer at # 14, good pick; defensive standout and will be one of the best players in this draft.quincy douby at # 19, good scorer in ncaa, not so much in the nba due to strength and not being able to hold his own defensively has cut his minutes.so as you see, theres only one guard that you can make an argument that his draft selection justifies itself and that's brandon roy. ronnie brewer, although a solid nba guard is simply not an outstanding player by any means.now, for the forwards and centers drafted before rondo, there are two standouts :lamarcus aldridge # 2, once again here's another quality nba player but being worthy of the # 2 pick is questionable.rudy gay at # 8, is now coming into his own as a player. in fact i would put him in the top three players in this draft and anyone who doesn't think so is crazy.so now back to rondo, who i'll remind you was picked at # 21. was there really 20 players picked ahead of him? seriously? there are some truly gruesome picks in this draft for sure and nba gm's have been known to be total morons but come on now. the top three in the 2008 hindsight nba draft would go something like brandon roy, rudy gay, rajon rondo. wait, rajon rondo? but he can't even consistently shoot free throws why would he be drafted in the top three? well, there is a mostly forgotten art in today's nba and that is hustle. hustle and raw talent combined with the motivation to be a better player is the mix that makes up rajon rondo. you want twenty point scorers who are plentiful (right now there are 31 players above 20 ppg)then draft roy or gay. i'll gladly take rondo over either of those players any day. a great defensive point guard is a rare commodity these days and one that can slash and make plays going to the hoop is even more in demand. now, is rondo a great shooter, not by any means. the key is that he is working hard at it and it is consistently improving while at the same time rondo knows his limits. he takes shots in the flow of the offense like a traditional point guard and drives when he can. his # 1 priority is finding the open man, almost to a fault. rondo is what a pg should be. he's a winner and should make his first all star roster this season.it has to be noted that rondo happens to play with three future hall of famers in kevin garnett, paul pierce, and ray allen. that will make life easier for any young pg, right? wrong! sure, those players can make rondo look better than he is but the fact is that without rondo the celtics team suffers almost like the lakers without kobe. it's hard to imagine one player especially a young pg who can make that much of a difference to a veteran team. there is also immense pressure when playing with a talent like garnett who is not afraid to get in your face when you make a mistake. rondo was able to handle whatever has been thrown at him in his young career and i am going out on a limb here and saying that he will go down as the best overall player in the 2006 nba draft.
