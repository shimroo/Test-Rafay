togaware has nearly 40 years of experience in open source
  software engineering, artificial intelligence, machine learning and
  data science. from our consulting and research services we have
  learnt many lessons and have a wealth of knowledge that we bring to
  bear on new projects and emerging challenges in the areas of machine
  learning, data science, analytics, and data mining.
togaware is particularly proud of the freely available resources
  that are widely cited and regularly used internationally. our sites
  host over 5000 unique visitors every day with very many regular
  return visitors.
we enjoy developing tools and insights to deliver good outcomes
  for society. software is creative expression, beautifully crafted,
  and lovingly nurtured. it is prose that is a pleasure for those who
  care to read, understand, and learn. the free software movement
  looks to share ideas so that those who follow can build on our
  contributions for the benefit and enjoyment of all.
we have extensive strengths in developing apps using flutter/dart
  that respect an individual's privacy. our philosophy has evolved
  through over 30 years of deploying r and python based solutions for
  data science in production environments (data science and gnu/linux), through providing
  resources for data scientists to be productive in r (onepager, rattle and latex), and developing technology
  and thought leadership for the future of data science (privacy).  
this site is hosted in the cloud by opalstack.
