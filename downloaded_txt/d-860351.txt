pomace, a by-product derived from the pressing of fruits such as grapes, apples, and olives, holds great potential as an organic fertilizer when properly processed. however, its quality as fertilizer heavily depends on how effectively moisture content is controlled during the granulation process. in this blog, we will explore how moisture content influences the granulation of pomace and the machinery required to optimize this process for better-quality fertilizer production.
the importance of moisture content in fertilizer production
moisture content plays a critical role in the overall quality of granulated fertilizer. too much moisture can result in weak granules that fall apart easily, while insufficient moisture can lead to poor binding during the granulation process. this imbalance can significantly affect the efficacy of the final product. for instance, high moisture organic waste like pomace requires precise moisture control to ensure the production of firm, long-lasting pellets suitable for agricultural use.
industries focusing on composting, as well as those involved in pomace fertilizer production, understand the need for balanced moisture content. in the production of organic fertilizer from pomace, maintaining moisture within a specific range is essential for effective microbial activity and efficient nutrient release. granulation, in particular, demands moisture to facilitate the binding of particles, ensuring that the final granules have the appropriate hardness and shape for easy handling and application.
which fruit waste can be used in pomace dryer
raw materials and their moisture needs
organic waste materials such as pomace are excellent raw materials for fertilizer production because they are rich in nutrients. however, these materials typically have high moisture content, especially after extraction from fruits. this presents challenges during granulation, as excess moisture must be reduced to prevent clumping or weak pellet formation.
pomace from fruits like apples or olives often contains moisture levels exceeding 70%. in such cases, effective dewatering or dehydration processes are necessary to reduce moisture content to optimal levels for granulation. pomace can be an excellent source of nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for plants, making it a valuable component of composting and fertilizer production. the need for moisture reduction in pomace fertilizer production cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the performance of the final product.
machines for moisture reduction in pomace fertilizer production
when it comes to processing pomace into high-quality fertilizer, the role of machinery is indispensable. the first step in the process is typically the dehydration or dewatering of pomace, which helps reduce its moisture content to an acceptable level. the pomace dryer is a key piece of equipment in this step, as it efficiently dries the organic material by removing excess moisture without damaging the structure of the pomace.
another critical piece of machinery in the process is the composting machine. it plays an essential role in breaking down organic matter, enhancing microbial activity, and reducing moisture content through the heat generated during composting. the composting process is often combined with the drying phase to further lower the moisture level, making the pomace ready for the granulation phase.
the granulation process itself is facilitated by a wet granulating machine, which helps bind the dehydrated pomace particles into pellets. the wet granulation process ensures that the moisture content is just right, allowing the granules to form solid and durable particles that will not crumble or break apart easily during storage or transport. in this process, moisture reduction is critical in ensuring that the granules retain their shape and integrity.
process stages: moisture reduction and granulation
the production of high-quality pomace fertilizer granules follows a precise sequence of steps designed to manage moisture content at each stage:

dewatering phase: the initial moisture content of pomace often exceeds 90%, requiring immediate reduction through the use of dewatering machines. this phase helps lower the water content before further processing.
composting phase: as the material undergoes composting, additional moisture is evaporated, helping to reduce water levels. the heat generated during composting further accelerates this moisture reduction.
drying phase: following composting, the pomace enters the drying phase, where specialized dryers remove remaining moisture. this step ensures that the moisture content falls below 10%, suitable for the granulation process.
granulation phase: with the moisture content now at optimal levels, the dried pomace is granulated using a wet granulation machine. this process binds the material into compact, solid pellets, ready for use as high-quality fertilizer.

conclusion
in the production of organic fertilizer from pomace, moisture content is a key factor that directly affects the quality of the final granules. excess moisture can result in weak pellets, while insufficient moisture can hinder proper granulation. by incorporating the right machinery at each stage of the process, such as the pomace dryer, dewatering machines, composting equipment, and wet granulators, manufacturers can ensure that pomace reaches the optimal moisture level for granulation, resulting in durable and effective fertilizer pellets.

a double roller granulator, also known as a roll press granulator, is a crucial tool in the granulation process of fertilizers. it uses the extrusion force and friction force from its rollers to make powder material into granules. this article explains a step-by-step guide on how to manufacture charcoal-based fertilizer granules using a roller granulator.

raw material preparation:
the first step involves preparing the charcoal by crushing it into a powder form. other materials to enhance the fertilizer’s nutrient content, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium sources, should also be ground into a fine powder. the ratio of these materials will differ depending on the desired final product’s nutrient requirements.
mixing:
once the raw materials are ready, mix them thoroughly to achieve a uniform composition. high-quality granules are a result of a consistent mixture.
feeding the double roller granulator:
the next step is to feed the mixture into the double roller machine. the machine features a hopper that receives the mixture. an adjustable speed motor drives the hopper to ensure a steady flow of the material into the granulator.
granulation process:
the crux of the granulation process lies in the extrusion and pressing of the raw material. the roller granulator uses its two rollers to compress the powder, creating enough pressure to form granules. the gap between the rollers determines the size of the granules. therefore, depending on your desired granule size, you can adjust the gap accordingly.
screening:
after the granulation process, the next step is to separate the formed granules from the excess powder. this separation is done through a screening process. the granules are sieved, and any ungranulated materials are returned to the hopper for regranulation.

drying and cooling:
the granules are then dried to reduce their moisture content, enhancing their stability. after drying, the granules are cooled to room temperature.

the agricultural industry relies on fertilizers to enhance soil fertility and crop yield. among the many types of fertilizers, single super phosphate (ssp) stands out as a cost-effective and widely used phosphatic fertilizer. the production of ssp is both intriguing and complex, involving a series of chemical reactions and processes. in this blog post, we delve into the manufacturing process of ssp and how it contributes to sustainable agriculture.
what is single super phosphate (ssp)?
single super phosphate, often abbreviated as ssp, is a granulated fertilizer containing 16-20% water-soluble phosphate (p2o5), which is beneficial for plant growth and soil nutrition. it also supplies sulfur and calcium to the soil. ssp is especially popular in rain-fed agricultural areas due to its ability to provide nutrients in a form that is readily available to plants.
phosphate fertilizer production
the manufacturing process of ssp
the production of ssp involves several key steps, each critical for the quality of the final product. here’s an overview of the process:
1. raw material preparation
in fact, the ssp production is making fertilizer from rock phosphate, which is mined from phosphorus-rich deposits. the quality of rock phosphate is critical, as impurities can affect the efficiency of the manufacturing process. the rock phosphate is crushed into fine particles to facilitate chemical reactions.
2. sulfuric acid reaction
the crushed rock phosphate is then mixed with sulfuric acid in a reactor. the chemical reaction between rock phosphate (mainly fluorapatite) and sulfuric acid is exothermic and releases heat. the chemical equation for this reaction can be represented as:
`ca3(po4)2 + 2 h2so4 + 4 h2o → 2 ca(h2po4)2·h2o + 2 caso4·2h2o`
calcium phosphate reacts with sulfuric acid to form phosphoric acid and calcium sulfate (gypsum) along with water. this plays an important role in single super phosphate manufacturing process. it is advisable to use a mixer with stainless steel lining.
3. curing
the slurry from the reactor, which consists of phosphoric acid and gypsum, is transferred to a curing area where it is allowed to mature. the curing process is crucial as it helps in the completion of the chemical reaction and the solidification of the mixture.
4. granulation
the densified material is passed through a ssp granulator, where it is shaped into uniform granules. the granulation process enhances the physical properties of the fertilizer, making it easier to handle, store, and apply to fields. click here to learn more

5. drying and cooling
the granules are then dried in a rotary dryer to reduce the moisture content. following drying, the granules are cooled to stabilize them and prevent caking.
6. screening
after cooling, the granules are screened to separate the fine and oversized particles. the on-size granules are the desired product, whereas the fines and oversized particles are usually recycled back into the process.
7. packaging
finally, the ssp granules are weighed and packaged into bags or bulk containers for distribution to wholesalers or directly to farmers.

preparing for granulation
before starting the granulation process, ensure that the zeolite powder is of appropriate particle size and moisture content. the powder should be fine enough to allow for proper agglomeration and should typically have a moisture content between 30-40% to facilitate the formation of pellets.
setting up the disc granulator

adjusting the disc angle: set the disc angle between 40 to 60 degrees, depending on the desired pellet size and the material properties.
setting the rotational speed: the disc speed should be adjusted to create optimal tumbling action, allowing the material to roll and grow into pellets.
preparing the disc surface: a layer of powder is spread on the disc surface to prevent sticking and to initiate the granulation process.

the granulation process

feeding the material: start feeding the zeolite powder into the disc granulator while ensuring an even distribution across the disc.
pellet growth: as the pan rotates, the material rolls and collides, picking up more powder and growing into pellets. water can be sprayed onto the mixture if additional moisture is needed.
pellet sizing: smaller particles stick to larger ones, and the continuous rolling motion helps to round off the pellets, enforcing a uniform size.
processing duration: the process continues until the desired pellet size is achieved, which usually takes several minutes.

post-granulation steps

drying the pellets: once the desired pellet size is obtained, the pellets are transferred to a drying apparatus to reduce the moisture content and harden the surface.
cooling and screening: after drying, the pellets are cooled and then screened to separate the properly sized pellets from the undersized or oversized ones.

the npk fertilizer manufacturing process









fertilizers are key to enhancing soil fertility and boosting crop yields. among the most popular fertilizers are npk blends, which contain varying ratios of nitrogen (n), phosphorus (p), and potassium (k). the manufacturing of npk fertilizer is a complex process that combines these three nutrients in a single, granular form.
raw material sourcing
the process begins with the sourcing of raw materials. nitrogen is typically derived from ammonia, phosphorus from phosphate rock, and potassium from potash. these materials are critical for creating a balanced fertilizer that can cater to the nutritional needs of various crops.
the granulation process
once the raw materials are procured, they are transported to the production facility where the granulation process begins. this involves the application of a high-temperature treatment, where the materials are partially melted and then cooled to form a solid mass. the resulting product is then crushed into smaller, uniform particles. there are types of granulators for your choice. such as disc pelletizer machine, rotary drum granulation equipment and extrusion granulator.
blending the nutrients 
after granulation, the particles containing different nutrients are thoroughly mixed to create a uniform blend. this blending is a crucial step as it ensures that each granule has the correct proportion of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

formulating different npk ratios
different crops require different npk ratios. therefore, the blended granules are formulated into various npk ratios to suit specific agricultural needs. for instance, a common ratio for many crops is 20-20-20, which represents an equal percentage of each nutrient. so we can also provide you with 20:10:10 npk fertilizer manufacturing process and 17:17:17 npk fertilizer making line.
quality control
quality control is a vital part of the manufacturing process. samples from each batch of fertilizer are tested in a laboratory to ensure that they meet the required nutrient specifications. this step also checks for the presence of heavy metals and other contaminants.
coating for efficiency 
the granules may then be coated with substances that reduce moisture absorption and prevent caking, which helps maintain the quality of the fertilizer during storage and handling. in some cases, coatings are also used to control the release of nutrients once the fertilizer is applied to the soil, improving its efficiency.
packaging
the final step in the manufacturing process is packaging. the npk fertilizer is packed in bags that are resistant to weather and handling to ensure the product reaches the end-user without any loss of quality.
delivery and application
once packaged, the npk fertilizer is distributed to agricultural suppliers or directly to farms. farmers then apply the fertilizer to their fields, often using specialized equipment to ensure even distribution and optimal soil incorporation.
environmental considerations
the manufacturing of npk fertilizers also comes with an environmental aspect. manufacturers must adhere to stringent regulations to minimize emissions and waste. additionally, research is ongoing to develop more sustainable and eco-friendly manufacturing processes that reduce the carbon footprint of fertilizer production.
through the careful orchestration of sourcing, granulation, blending, and quality control, the npk fertilizer manufacturing process ensures that farmers around the world can sustainably produce the crops that feed our growing population.

step 1: material selection and preparation the first step in large scale granulation is selecting the appropriate raw materials. the quality and consistency of these materials are critical to the success of the granulation process. raw materials may be powders, crystals, or other forms, depending on the desired end product.
once the raw materials are selected, they must be prepared for granulation. this may involve pre-blending, milling, or other processing steps to ensure that the materials are the correct particle size and have the necessary properties for granulation.
step 2: mixing the next step is to mix the raw materials together to create a homogeneous blend. this step may be accomplished through a variety of methods, such as tumbling mixers or high-shear mixers. the goal is to ensure that each particle is coated with the necessary binders and excipients, and that the resulting blend has the desired characteristics for granulation.
step 3: granulation once the raw materials are blended, it is time to granulate them. there are several different methods of granulation, including wet granulation, dry granulation, and melt granulation. wet granulation is the most commonly used method, as it allows for the production of dense, uniform granules.
in wet granulation, the blended materials are mixed with a liquid binder to form a wet mass. the wet mass is then processed through a granulator, where it is broken down into smaller particles and screened to create uniform granules. the granules may then be dried to remove any residual moisture.
step 4: drying drying is a critical step in the granulation process, as it ensures that the granules are stable and free from moisture. depending on the method of granulation used, drying may be accomplished through air drying, fluidized bed drying, or other methods. the goal is to remove the appropriate amount of moisture without damaging the granules.
step 5: sizing and screening once the granules are dry, they may need to be sized and screened to ensure that they meet the necessary specifications for the end product. this step may involve passing the granules through a series of screens to remove any oversized or undersized particles, or using specialized equipment to achieve the desired particle size distribution.
step 6: finishing and packaging the final step in large scale granulation is finishing and packaging the granules for shipment. this may involve additional processing steps, such as coating or polishing, to ensure that the granules have the necessary appearance and characteristics for the end product. the granules may then be packaged in appropriate containers, such as bags, drums, or totes, and labeled for shipment.

chicken manure is a rich source of organic matter that contains essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, that are essential for plant growth. however, it is also a potent source of pathogens, such as e.coli and salmonella, that can be harmful to humans and animals if not properly treated. composting chicken manure is an effective way to turn this waste material into a valuable resource that can be used to fertilize plants and improve soil health. one of the most popular methods for composting chicken manure is by using an organic fertilizer fermenter.
what is an organic fertilizer fermenter?
an organic fertilizer fermenter is a device that uses microorganisms to break down organic matter and transform it into a nutrient-rich fertilizer. the fermenter works by creating an environment that is conducive to the growth of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, that break down the organic matter in the chicken manure. the process of composting is accelerated by maintaining the ideal conditions, such as temperature, moisture, and aeration, for the microorganisms to thrive.

how does an organic fertilizer fermenter work?
the process of composting in an organic fertilizer fermenter involves three stages: the thermophilic stage, the cooling stage, and the maturation stage.
the thermophilic stage
the thermophilic stage is the first stage of composting, and it involves raising the temperature of the chicken manure to kill off any harmful pathogens. the ideal temperature for the thermophilic stage is between 55-65°c (131-149°f), which can be achieved by adding a source of carbon, such as wood chips or straw, to the chicken manure. the carbon acts as a food source for the microorganisms, which then generate heat as they break down the organic matter. the heat generated during this stage helps to kill off any harmful pathogens, making the compost safe to use as fertilizer.
the cooling stage
the cooling stage is the second stage of composting, and it involves lowering the temperature of the chicken manure to allow for the growth of beneficial microorganisms. the ideal temperature for this stage is between 45-55°c (113-131°f), which can be achieved by regularly turning the compost pile and adding water to maintain moisture levels. the beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, help to break down the organic matter in the chicken manure and convert it into a nutrient-rich fertilizer.
the maturation stage
the maturation stage is the final stage of composting, and it involves allowing the compost to mature for several weeks to several months. during this stage, the compost is left to sit without any additional inputs, allowing the beneficial microorganisms to continue breaking down the organic matter and releasing nutrients. the compost is then ready to be used as a fertilizer for plants, which helps to improve soil health and promote healthy plant growth.

spreading on fields
horse manure can also be spread directly on fields as a natural fertilizer. this method is more commonly used in rural areas where there is plenty of open land. before spreading the manure on fields, it is important to test the soil to determine its nutrient content and ph level. this will help you determine how much manure you need to spread to improve the soil fertility.
if you plan to spread horse manure on fields, it is important to follow the guidelines set by your local agriculture department. generally, you should not spread manure on fields that are near water sources or on steep slopes where erosion may occur. you should also avoid spreading manure on fields that are near residential areas due to the odor.
burning
burning horse manure is not recommended as it can release harmful gases and contribute to air pollution. additionally, burning manure can be dangerous and can lead to accidental fires. if you have a large amount of manure to dispose of, it is better to compost it or spread it on fields.
landfills
horse manure can be disposed of in landfills, but this method is not environmentally friendly. landfills are designed to store waste, not to decompose it. when organic matter is placed in a landfill, it breaks down anaerobically, which produces methane gas. methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. therefore, it is best to avoid disposing of horse manure in landfills.
in conclusion, horse manure is a valuable resource that can be used to improve soil fertility and structure. composting and spreading on fields are the most environmentally friendly ways of disposing of horse manure. if you have a large amount of manure to dispose of, it is important to follow the guidelines set by your local agriculture department to ensure that you are not causing harm to the environment. by properly disposing of horse manure, you can help reduce waste and improve soil health.

a rotary drum granulation fertilizer making plant is a type of equipment used for producing granulated fertilizers. it involves a rotary drum granulator, which is a cylindrical container that rotates on an inclined axis. and it is one of the most common methods used to produce granulated fertilizers.  it offers several advantages over other methods, including high production capacity, consistent quality, and low energy consumption.
the materials for machine to make fertilizer
the granulator is fed with raw materials, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (npk) fertilizers, along with other additives, such as urea and ammonium sulfate. these materials are mixed and granulated through a process of rolling, agglomeration, and tumbling, creating spherical particles that are easy to handle, transport, and apply.
tips to make granular fertilizer in the process
the process of rotary drum granulation involves several steps. first, the raw materials are mixed together and formed into a moist, homogeneous mixture. the materials used in the mixture typically include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (npk) fertilizers, along with other additives such as urea and ammonium sulfate. these materials are carefully measured and mixed to ensure that the final product contains the appropriate balance of nutrients.
once the mixture has been formed, it is fed into the granulator, which is a large, cylindrical container that rotates on an inclined axis. as the granulator rotates, the mixture is heated and rolled along the length of the drum. this rolling action causes the particles to stick together and form larger agglomerates, which eventually become spherical granules.in order to read more ,please click here.

size of granules to adjust in your machine
the size of the granules can be controlled by adjusting the speed of the drum and the amount of moisture in the mixture. as the granules grow in size, they are tumbled around inside the drum, which helps to smooth their surfaces and create a more uniform shape. this process of rolling, agglomeration, and tumbling continues until the granules reach the desired size and shape.
once the granules have been formed, they are cooled and screened to remove any oversize or undersize particles. this ensures that the final product is of a consistent size and shape, which makes it easier to handle, transport, and apply. after screening, the granules are dried and coated with a protective layer to prevent caking and improve their storage and handling properties in your fertilizer production line.
advantages for rotary drum granulator fertilizer production line
one of the key advantages of rotary drum granulation is its high production capacity. the process can be automated, which allows for continuous operation and high throughput. this makes it an ideal method for producing large quantities of fertilizers in a cost-effective manner. additionally, the process is highly efficient, with low energy consumption compared to other granulation methods.
another advantage of rotary drum granulation is its ability to produce high-quality fertilizers with a consistent nutrient content. the rolling action of the drum ensures that the particles are evenly coated with the fertilizer mixture, which helps to ensure that the final product contains the appropriate balance of nutrients. this is essential for healthy plant growth and crop yield.

a rotary drum granulation fertilizer making plant is an efficient and cost-effective way to produce high-quality fertilizers, particularly npk fertilizers, which are essential for healthy plant growth and crop yield. the equipment is widely used in the agriculture industry, and it offers a number of advantages over other granulation methods, including high production capacity, consistent quality, and low energy consumption.inquiry us for details about https://www.fertilizerproductionproject.com/rotary-drum-granulator-fertilizer-production-line/.

if you want to make fertilizer, there are many reasons to do so. in most cases, people that own large company is where they do a substantial amount of garden, they will need to replace nutrients that have been extracted from the soil. this is a natural part of the growing process if you have been planting and growing different crops for many years. it will enable you to continue to do so for many years to come. however, you may not realize how difficult this is to do. if you have never purchased the components of fertilizer before, it can be a problematic task. here are the top three reasons that people will attempt to make their own fertilizer.
replenish nutrients
the first reason that you should consider fertilizer making procedure is that it will help you replenish nutrients in your soil. you can make these using different types of equipment, with different fertilizer production technology that will lead to the rapid production of fertilizer that you can use. without doing so each year, you run the risk of depleting your soil of the nutrients that are needed for the different crops that you are going to be planting.

increase nutrients
when you are increasing amounts of nutrients in your soil, it could be due to the type of crops you are growing. for example, you could be growing soybeans, and these will require an abundance of either phosphorus, potassium, or other nutrients. when you are able to increase these levels, it ensures that you will have the ability to grow your crops to the highest capacity possible. you could purchase double roller fertilizer granulator from another company, but it’s better to make them on your own. this gives you full control over the levels of the nutrients that you will be using.
purchasing new areas to plant crops
if you do not know anything about the soil that you will soon be planting in because the land is new it pays to simply add the nutrients that you know that you will need. nitrogen is one of the top nutrients that is used by most plants. therefore, adding phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium to your soil will ensure that you will be in the manufacture of chemical fertiliser. it doesn’t matter if you are planting in early crop, or one later in the year, as the plant will still need most of these nutrients.
these are three of the main reasons that people will add nutrients in the soil. you can find a manufacturer of granulation technology for solid fertilizers, this will make the process easier on you. you can purchase the base components, and combine everything together, such as creating npp fertilizer that so many people use. once the fertilizer is in the soil, you can plan your crops with the full confidence that you will not have to worry about their ability to grow. in no time, you will have crops that will be breaking records because the time to add the necessary nutrients that each one of them will use.

if you have ever wondered how to compost animal manure, this article will show you how to achieve the correct ratio of red to brown. it will also show you how to test the manure for moisture levels, turn the pile regularly, and avoid runoff from soggy heaps. here are some other tips to help you compost animal manure:
red-brown ratio for composting animal manure
there are two terms that are often confused with one another, the red-brown ratio and the greens-to-brown ratio. they both refer to the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in organic materials. in making compost from cow manure, carbon plays a major role. a good ratio is at least 30:1, with greens equaling less than 30:1. if you have a red-brown ratio of 30:1, then you’ll be better off starting your compost pile with the proper ingredients.
testing for moisture in manure
to test for moisture in animal manure, you will need to collect samples from various locations. generally, you will need about one pint of the material for each test. ensure that the sample is not rinsed or diluted because this will dilute the composition and alter the results of the nutrient evaluation. most manure is mixed with water before application to the land, so you will need to reduce water in proportion to the amount of manure. you can use a dung dryer machine.
 
quickest way to make compost
 
site selection
of course one of the most essential aspects of making compost on a large scale is to find the proper site. it is essential that your compost pile is not going to be in an area that is prone to flooding, excess moisture, or excess heat. ideally, your animal manure compost pile should be in a well-drained area with a 2% slope and tightly packed soil and run-off into a containment pond.
turning pile regularly
turning your pile regularly is critical for its health. it is essential to turn it frequently when temperatures are below 100 degrees fahrenheit. turning the pile also helps to aerate it. ideally, you should turn it every three to four days. you should avoid letting the pile sit at temperatures above 70 degrees fahrenheit, as this will kill the microbes that aid in the decomposition process. in addition to aerating your pile, turning it regularly with a compost making equiptment will ensure that it remains dark brown and smelling earthy.

using a front-end loader
a front-end loader is an ideal tool for composting animal manure. its bucket can accommodate approximately 3 yards of material, and can be enlarged from four to six inches on the top, sides, and cutting edge. this enlargement increases the compost’s volume by 30 to 50 percent.
as you can see, it is not all that difficult to make powder fertilizer from manure. in fact, if you follow the above steps it will become second nature to you. simply remember the importance of choosing the right site, using a front-end loader, turning the pile on a regular basis, test for moisture, and always be seeking out the proper ratio. these simple tips will ensure that you make quick organic fertilizer for the season.

 fertilizer production  


there are a multitude of farms around the world that rely upon quality fertilizer for their crops. without adding nutrients to the soil, it would be impossible to keep up with production quotas. many of the crops will extract important nutrients from the soil. if they are not replenished, the crops will not grow as expected. this can lead to fewer crops, discovering of the plants, or they may simply not grow at all. here is a quick introduction to fertilizer manufacturing so that you can understand the process.
what is fertilizer manufacturing?
the fertilizer industry often uses certain chemicals that are needed for the soil. this will include urea, ammonia, phosphate, nitric acid, and also ammonium nitrate. you can either produce compound fertilizers which will include two or more different components. you can also utilize straight fertilizers which will only be one of these nutrients. there are often chemical reactions during the process of creating fertilizer that will bind these components together. the purpose of fertilizer manufacturing is to create materials that can be spread onto crops. this is often done by combining everything into pellets that can be stored and used to enrich the soil.
the production line for fertilizer making
how are fertilizer pellets made
fertilizer pellets are made using certain types of machinery. some of these include a fertilizer granulator which can use organic materials that are combined into pellets that can be easily spread. these are traditionally in a cylindrical format. however, some of the granules can be made into balls. you will want to use a fertilizer granulator that can produce a large amount of fertilizer, and do so at a minimal cost.
different types of fertilizer granulators
there are several types of fertilizer granulation machines that you can take advantage of. the most common is the organic fertilizer granulating machines. there is also the rotary drum churning granulator, rotary drum granulator, and disc granulator which is very effective. you can produce both wet and dry types of fertilizer. they are also differentiated by size. you can easily find a source for a small fertilizer plant if you only have a small number of crops. if efficiency is important to you, you will want to use a large rotary drum granulator. these are extremely large, and highly efficient when it comes to producing fertilizer pellets for your business.

2. parameters to consider with these production lines
there are several systems that can be used to produced compost fertilizer and form a production line. they must work together to produce the final product. for example, you can use a hydraulic compost turn that will help convert the compost into fertilizer. this will then be sent to the wet or dry crushing machine. a rotary screen will sift through that material, and once combined, an automatic packaging machine will do the rest.
if you have no ideal about the dsign of different types of fertilizer production line, the following page has an introduction about it.
 
how to build an ideal fertilizer production line?

consider the parameters such as the size, production capacity, and the amount of power that each system is going to use. also take note of the mixing and granulation system, along with the drying and cooling system, before you make your final decision. whether this is for a new granular or powder fertilizer production line, it will be as efficient as possible.
 
3. five designs for granular and powder fertilizer production lines
the first design will involve using a belt conveyor that will take everything to a granulator machine. the second will involve using a bucket elevator, combined with the granulator, for larger more extensive projects. the third will use a fertilizer crusher, mixer, and a disc fertilizer granulator. this will lead to dryer and screening machines. the fourth design will involve using a dryer with a dual conveyor belt system, with a standard pan granulator, with rotary dryers that can increase production levels. finally, a compound fertilizer production line might be exactly what you need. this can be utilized for both powder and granular products. this will include a belt conveyor, bucket elevator, and a disc granulator system that will deliver the materials to drying, cooling, and rotary exchange machines that will complete the process.
 
whether you decide to produce organic powdered fertilizer in its dry form, or granular fertilizer instead, you need a sx fertilizer production line that is highly efficient. it is important to have every component combined together to produce the best possible results. in some ways, each of these apparatuses is identical because of the final product and how it is used. it just depends on whether a fine powder, or granules, will be best suited for the type of farming operation that you are managing.

rotary gear drum granulators can be very worthy investments because of their multi-purpose nature. however, to reap maximum benefits from your purchase, you have to buy the machine from a trustworthy supplier. otherwise, you will end up with a granulator that cannot stand the test of time. that said, let’s look at how you choose capable suppliers for a granulator.

questions you must ask a rotary gear drum granulator supplier before choosing them

what is unique about you as a manufacturer?

without needing to brainstorm, your chosen granulator manufacturer should be able to inform you about their unique selling capabilities. this should be a part of their elevator pitch to you. they should tell you what makes their firm unique and what do they do that no one else does. that way, you can tell whether it is beneficial to buy from them.
keep in mind that cost isn’t everything. this is because other variables, such as supplier reliability and delivery speed, are as crucial when selecting a supplier. if you buy your granulator at a cheap price yet they take an eternity to deliver, you’ll soon have to start looking for a new supplier.

what do previous customers have to say about you?

before you choose a rotary gear drum granulator from a certain supplier, you must ascertain that they have a good reputation. therefore, ask your supplier for a list of previous customers who are willing to vouch for them.
you may request to see case studies or testimonials that advocate for the service and products they offer. alternatively, you could request to meet with their references or previous customers if possible. if they have a bank of satisfied customers to choose from, they should not hesitate to give you access.


how would you explain your pricing mechanism?

you shouldn’t choose your suppliers only based on price. however, it’s a good idea to ask them how their company’s pricing compares to their competitors. do they consider themselves to be low or high-end?
getting a sense of how they present themselves will offer you a decent indication of their pricing as well as the quality of their rotary drum granulators. it’s also a good idea to make a self-assessment form for potential vendors to fill out. this can be used to find pricing and quality gaps, as well as learn more about the supplier’s activities and the industry you operate in.

what are your after-sale services?

when picking a supplier for a granulator machine, you have to ask them if they offer after-sale services. these include repair during the warranty period, installation, and delivery services. a supplier who offers such services is more likely to produce high-quality machines. this is because they know that they’ll be held liable if anything goes wrong after the sale.
wind up
the rotary gear drum granulator you buy will only be as good as the manufacturer who made it. for this reason, you must pick your supplier very wisely. this will save you the trouble of having to go back to the market again after your granulator malfunctions.

understanding dry granulation procedures
when machines are able to utilize dry granulation, they are not going to use any type of binder or water during the process. during the manufacturing process, the raw materials are going to aggregate together. this is typically done through some form of primary powder under high pressure. all of this will be squeezed together, forming the fertilizer granules, which are going to maintain their integrity throughout the process. dry granulation is perfect for small to medium-sized fertilizer plants. they are also very inexpensive by comparison to the wet granulation machines.
overview of wet granulation procedures
the main difference between dry and wet granulation is that water is used with wet granulation machines. the materials tend to move through the drum, and once they have solidified, it will be done through a pressing force. wet granulation does require some amount of drying. this is usually accomplished with a disc pan granulation machine, drum fertilizer granulation equipment, or a similar device. one of the most popular is the tower spray granulation machines that are able to spray water on the materials as they are being produced. although the efficiency levels are very similar to dry granulation machines, these are much more comprehensive in their design in most cases.

fertilizer pellet production is one of the most viable economic activities in the agricultural sector because of the increasing demand for fertilizers. in addition, all you need to start your fertilizer business are a few pieces of equipment such as a fertilizer granulator.
unfortunately, maintaining the efficiency of a fertilizer granulator is not easy, because its efficiency reduces with age. that said, let’s look at the things that reduce your granulator’s efficiency.
4 factors that reduce the pelleting efficiency of a fertilizer granulator
1. improper servicing of the granulator
improper servicing could mean insufficient maintenance practices, but it can also mean excessive maintenance. infrequent maintenance might allow problems to go unchecked, leading to a domino effect of reduced efficiency. on the other hand, carrying out maintenance too regularly brings disorder into the machine each time the procedure is done.
when a specialist opens up the granulator, there is always the possibility of damaging the machine. whether it’s breaking a frame, losing a bolt, or unintentionally flapping a wire in the wrong direction, the risks are many. as such, servicing your granulator frequently increases its chances of becoming inefficient.

2. inexperienced machine operators
operator mistake is another prevalent cause of reduced efficiency in a fertilizer machine for granulating. humans aren’t machines, which is both good and bad. as a result, we make mistakes from time to time owing to exhaustion or forgetfulness.
most plants provide educational training and good communication routes to machine workers so they can properly operate complex pieces of equipment. however, when workers are filling in for others, it’s not uncommon for them to work on unfamiliar machines. because of the worker’s lack of technical knowledge, not only may the machine fail, but it could also be damaged causing it to have low-efficiency levels.
3. omission of preventative maintenance procedures
there are many reasons why world-class maintenance programs prioritize preventive maintenance over reactive maintenance on any machine. one of these reasons is that it ensures that a machine remains efficient even with age. besides this, preventative maintenance plans can reduce equipment failure by up to 45 percent.
unfortunately, many managers still do not understand the importance of preventative maintenance. as a result, they only pay attention to a machine once it is broken. sometimes, run-to-failure maintenance is frequently the best technique for non-critical machinery. however, a lack of planned inspections might cause subtle indicators of impending failure to be missed, resulting in deteriorating performance.
4. the aging factor
no matter how careful you are with your making granules machine for fertilizer, it will still become inefficient at some point. this is because wear and tear are impossible to stop especially when the machine is frequently used. while some worn-out parts may be replaced, it eventually beats logic to do any more replacement when the machine is too old. at such a point, the only viable option is to buy a new machine altogether.
wind up
maintaining the pelleting efficiency of a fertilizer granulator may seem hard, but it isn’t. this is because all you need is to understand what reduces the machine’s efficiency. that way, you’ll be able to mitigate those factors and enjoy high efficiency for as long as possible. when you require to know more information about the fertilizer pelletzier, you can visit the following link.

cow dung is one of the best raw materials for making organic fertilizer granules. with the rapid developments in the cattle industry, manure pollution is one of the biggest problems for managers supervising cattle farms. in most places, environmental pollution due to cattle waste has even exceeded industrial pollution sources. that’ why producing organic fertilizer from cow dung is the best way to make use of the material and reduce environmental pollution in the process. you will require professional cow dung processing equipment to deal with large scale production of cow dung manure. this article provides information on how to process cow dung materials into organic fertilizer granules.
before using cow dung as organic fertilizer, it’s important to fully ferment the dung. fresh cow dung is a source of many types of pathogens on the farm. fresh cow manure is not considered an organic fertilizer until it’s processed and produced into organic fertilizer granules. composting is the best way to convert fresh cow manure into organic fertilizer granules. without composting, the fresh manure cannot be used on plants because it can produce a lot of heat to burn the roots and seeding through the natural fermentation process. fresh dung can also spread parasite eggs and other disease-causing microbes on your farm. fermenting and composting the fresh cow dung isn’t difficult. you can easily do it in long windows.
windrow composting is the best method to make organic fertilizer from cattle waste on your own farm. when you ferment the fresh cow dung in long windrow compost turners, you can get organic fertilizer in 20 days. in case you are worried about rain affecting the composting process, you can build a greenhouse to protect the windrows during the rainy season. here is how you can compost cow dung quickly and save time and money in the process.
. fresh cow dung should be compost after adjusting the water content of the manure. the high water content (85%) in fresh cow dung isn’t suitable for hot composting. that’s why you need to remove some moisture from the fresh dung before the composting process. you can either add an accessory material to absorb the water or use a manure dewatering machine to remove the water from the dung. grass ash, sawdust, carbon, and straw are some of the best accessory materials for this purpose.
. dried cow dung is much easier to compost compared to fresh and raw cow dung. you should add some water during the composting process when composting dried cow dung. in fact, the proper content of moisture is important when composting cow dung. it will help to speed up the composting process.
are you wondering how to process fresh cow dung into organic fertilizer granules? if so, you have come to the right place. there are so many methods of composting fresh cow dung and producing organic fertilizer granules from it. the aforementioned article provides important information on how to process fresh cow dung materials into organic fertilizer granules.

 manure making machine, organic manure processing  


an average-sized horse produces nearly 40 pounds of manure every day. in terms of fertilizers, you get 40 pounds of gold dust regularly. of course, only if you recycle the manure and convert it into a fertilizer. with more than 7 tons of horse manure per year, you can start an organic fertilizer business soon. but how will you do it? here’s how you should recycle horse manure and make fertilizer out of it.
making a compost pile
with heaps of organic material in your backyard, starting a compost pile is the easiest and most sensible thing to do. a compost pile will decompose horse manure rapidly and that too in bulk quantities. you can add vegetable skin, garden clippings, and dried leaves and twigs into the mix.
a compost pile creates a combination of chemicals, heat, and beneficial bacteria that increases the speed at which the manure decays. the end result will provide nutrient-rich topsoil that you can use as an organic fertilizer in your garden or even sell it to people who produce fruits and vegetables in their greenhouses. it is the key processes for making your horse manure materials into available fertilizers.
disposal machine for horse manure management
building a composter
• try creating an 8 foot by 8 foot space with a cement pad. surround the area by three 5-foot walls to accommodate your horse’s manure. make sure you create concrete walls. this will fasten the composting process. containment of manure breaks it down quickly. for a free-standing compost pile, try to cover it with a black plastic. this will amplify the sun’s heat and offer adequate temperature for the manure to decompose.
• fill up the area with horse manure. put one layer first. then spray water on it. don’t put too much water; just sprinkle enough to keep the compost pile moist. spread another layer on top and water it again. cover the pile with a plastic or jute tarp to protect it from direct sunlight or rain.
• also, aerate the pile every day. stir the pile from below. try to mix the pile over and over so that all the areas get enough air. it will rapidly decompose the manure and accelerate the decaying process. the more you twist and turn the manure, the more air it gets. and don’t forget to water the manure every day. consider it as growing a plant. watering the manure and airing it increases the bacterial content that enhances the decaying of the manure.
it takes a few weeks for the manure to decay completely. once it starts decaying, you will notice that its quantity starts reducing. that means 40 pounds of manure will become 20 pounds of fertilizer. and that is enough to keep your garden healthy for months.
most people who have horses in their stables sell their manure to local farmers. since you don’t require any chemicals, the crops that grow are free from artificial fertilizers.
the only challenge in composting horse manure is maintaining the moisture levels and aeration. you need to check the moisture levels regularly to ensure that the manure is decomposing quickly. with a horse manure organic compost turning equipment, you can get the high quality organic compost efficiently.

 horse manure granulator  


did you know that it is possible to make fertilizer pellets from horse manure? even if you have a small scale horse farm, you can still turn stable waste into a sizable quantity of fertilizer pellets. with the right machinery and production line, horse manure can be converted into fertilizer pellets. the two main pieces of equipment that are needed for production are a drying and crushing machine and a horse manure fertilizer pellet maker. for large-scale horse farms, a rotating drum fertilizer pellet machine should be used. for small scale horse farms, a new granulator machine should be used.
there is a huge market for bio organic fertilizer granules as they are more environmentally friendly. bio organic fertilizer pellets can be made from all sorts of organic manure waste. examples of organic waste from horse farming are horse manure and stable waste (ie, barn bedding hay). since horse manure from a stable is mixed with lots of hay and straw, it contains a large amount of energy. this means that the energy in horse manure fertilizer pellets is comparable to that found in fossil fuels like coal and oil.
producing fertilizer pellets from horse barn waste is not a very complicated process. what’s more, there are lots of high-quality machines in the global market space, including horse manure granulator and waste crushers, that can make the process much more efficient.
horse manure fertilizer granulator
the first stage of processing horse manure and stable waste into fertilizer involves drying the waste. it is possible to air-dry the waste, but it will take a long time, so it recommended that you invest in a manure drying machine or dewatering machine to speed up the process.
once the waste materials are completely dried, the next stage is the crush the materials into a fine powder. fortunately, there are lots of horse manure crushing machines for sale online. to avail of the best prices on such machinery, check out suppliers in china.
the final stage involves turning the powder into pellets using a horse manure fertilizer pelletizer. as previously mentioned, for small horse farms, a new designed fertilizer granulation machine is likely to be the best option. meanwhile, for large-scale industrial horse farms, a ring die pellet machine would be more appropriate. the output rate of flat die turned pellet machines ranges from around 50kg/h to 400kg/h depending on the model. a ring die pellet press can process over 2.5 tons of dried horse manure waste every hour.
the house manure fertilizer produced have many advantages. they can be sold for high profits in the marketplace because renewable fuel sources are much sought after. many people might be worried that horse manure pellets will give off a bad smell when burning, but they just smell like firewood burning.
in order to get the best prices on dewatering machines, horse manure pellet makers, crushing machines and pellet bagging machines, make sure that you obtain price quotes from multiple vendors. in addition, don’t be afraid to check out horse manure fuel pellet production line equipment for sale from overseas suppliers.

 fertilizer granulator  


are you searching for a machine that can produce fertilizer in the easiest way possible? a pan granulator can give you high efficiency with an affordable cost. what’s more, you can use the same machine to make a variety of fertilizers. its main use is to granulate/ crush powder fertilizer into fine pellets. the granulation rate of this piece of equipment is as high as 95%. in fact, its granulation rate is higher as compared to almost every fertilizer granulation machine such as new organic fertilizer pellet mill, double roller extrusion granulator machine, and rotary granulator.
there are many different of pan granulators such as laboratory pan granulator, organic fertilizer pan pelletizer, disk pan granulator, npk compound fertilizer granulation machine, and disc pan wet granulation machine. before you learn how the machine works, it’s better to know the type of materials you could utilize for pelletizing using the equipment.

different raw materials for pelletizing using a pan granulating machine
a pan granulator equipment can make a variety of fertilizers using a variety of materials. by using different raw materials, the machine can help you to make both compound fertilizer and organic fertilizer. for producing organic fertilizer, you can make use of materials such as sheep manure, cow dung, chicken poo, etc. in case you have large amounts of animal wastes, but you have no way of handling them, you’ll need to seek assistance from a disc pan pelletizer. the pelletizer can convert these animal wastes into useful and valuable organic fertilizer granules.
a disk pan granulator is much suitable for making compound fertilizer, unlike the organic fertilizer granulator machine. for instance, you can produce using nitrogen source or others.
– nitrogen source: ammonium carbonate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, urea, etc.
– potassium source: potassium sulfate, potassium chloride, etc.
– phosphorus source: calcium magnesium phosphate, diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate, dicalcium, calcium, etc.

how does the pan granulator work in granulating materials?
the granulation machine breaks down powders into pellets by use of centrifugal force. so, what should you do to operate it?
– once you feed the materials into the inlet of the machine through the top, the granulating disk will then rotate.
– since you can see the materials as they rotate in the disk, ensure to spray enough water depending on the effect of granules. due to centrifugal force, friction and finally gravity, the materials will soon become pellets.
– the scraper can remove the agglomerations left behind on the disk wall. this makes sure that all materials get granulated perfectly to form a good pellet appearance.
– once the pellets are formed, they’ll discharge through the outlets. if there are any unqualified pellets, they can be re-granulated.
a pan granulator machine is a fundamental tool in a fertilizer production line. it is the most suitable method you can deal with your animal manure by granulating it into organic fertilizer. these fertilizer pan granulators allow materials with sizes that are below 50mm. still, the raw materials should maintain a 25-30% range of moisture content.

 the materials to make fertilizer compost  


do you know what should and should go into your compost? by screening materials that you do not qualify, you will have the best ingredients for your compost pile.
the materials that make up compost are raw and they typically come from waste. these organic disposable materials can come from a variety of places in and around your home. they can also come from your garden or your home. the more organic waste that is used for composting, the less of it that ends up in landfills.
recent studies done by the epa have shown that over 20 percent of the country’s solid waste system consists of food scraps and yard trimmings. this results in plenty of waste that ends up in landfills when the more eco-friendly alternative would be to compost it instead.

the advantages of composting
one of the best reasons to compost is that you will know what is going into your composting material, and you can keep the things that you do not want out. you have the ability to balance the compost to your specifications, and you do not have to rely on just one component.
instead, you can choose a range of ingredients for your pile. these ingredients are usually divided into green and brown materials. the more variety you use when choosing the materials, the more nutrient rich the compost will be. it will be filled with diverse microbial life and micro nutrients that are necessary in the composting process.
ingredients to include
the following is a small list of things that you should use for composting material. they include:
grass clippings
leaves
coffee grounds
dry dog food
lint from dryer
organic manure
wine
dust
there are some items that you can include in your compost, but it is important to know that these materials may need additional prep time before they are ready. you can mix them in with your composting materials, or you can place them in a pile in your backyard.
however, be aware that it may take several seasons before they are suitable for composting. these items include:
newspaper
paper bags
toothpicks
egg cartons
saw dust
pine cones
corn cobs
items to screen
there are some materials that should be avoided when composting, and there are other materials that are definite no’s in the composting process.
the items that should be avoided include materials such as twigs and large branches.
animal products and excrement should never be included in compost by compost windrow turner. materials such as:
animal droppings
fish skin
fish bones
animal bones
milk
cheese
how to increase composting time
compost will begin to ‘cook’ once temperatures reach 120 degrees f, and there are several tips that you can follow to speed up this process.
after screening the unwanted materials, shred the larger materials for your compost. this allows bacteria to break it down faster.
it is better to add large piles of materials into your compost at one time.
finally, always make sure your compost is in the sunlight.
composting is a great way to increase the health of your garden, while also saving the environment. to keep your compost pile organic, screen for unqualified materials such as animal waste, animal products and synthetic chemicals.

 cow dung powder making machine, windrow turners  


everywhere there are cows, you can always be sure of one thing, there will also always cow manure. as beef and dairy farming intensified, industrialized and specialized, the need to find urgent solutions for cow dung environmental pollution problems became real. as a result, many machines were inverted to turn cow dung into powder fertilizer.
let’s consider the fact than an average beef cattle unit produces around 10.5 tons of manure annually, and an average dairy cow unit produces more than 15.4 tons of manure annually. to put things into perspective, a city with 410,000 residents produces less waste than a single dairy farm consisting of 2,500 animals. cow dung pollution is a huge global problem. in some countries, pollution from cattle manure exceeds industrial pollution. many people wrongly believe that animal waste is “natural” so it’s not dangerous, but that is not the case.
fortunately, cow dung can be converted into an excellent organic fertilizer powder. it contains all the nutrients plants need to thrive and it’s rich in organic matter. the npk profile of cow dung is 1% potassium, 4% nitrogen, and 2% phosphorous. the other constitutes of cow dung besides micronutrients and organic matter are various enzymes and microorganisms. in order to convert cow dung into fertilizer powder, specialized machines are often needed. the fertilizer produced can vastly improve soil structure and fertility. what’s more, the fertilizer can promote healthy microbial growth and prevent common root diseases and rot.

cow manure is a good organic fertilizer, but if you put fresh cow dung onto the soil, the vast amounts of ammonia produced can cause a horrible odor and burn crops. in addition, unprocessed cow dung can be high in salt, depending on the diet the cattle were fed, which is not ideal for crop growth. to create a nutritious fertilizer, cow dung must be composed. natural fermentation of cow dung can take a long time, but fortunately, there is now a range of modern composting machinery in the marketplace designed to speed up the process.
cow dung must be fully fermented before it is applied to agricultural soil. otherwise, it will cause soil temperatures to increase, which can damage crop root systems. furthermore, fresh cow dung is full of harmful bacteria and pathogens, which can be damaging to the surrounding environment and water supplies.
to turn cow manure into a safe organic npk powder fertilizer, it must be fully decomposed. the best way to compost cattle waste is to invest in the best cow dung fertilizer machines, like self-propelled compost turners, hydraulic windrow turners, and dewatering machines.
high-grade npk compound fertilizer is in high demand and it is relatively cheap to produce. by producing powder fertilizer from cow dung, you can help to deal with the mounting global environmental pollution problems associated with mounting animal waste. what’s more, with the right equipment, powder fertilizer can be processed further into granules or pellets. granules are easier to store and transport. check out the latest granulation machines to complete your cow dung fertilizer production line.

 organic compost fertilizer turner  


if you want to set up and run a successful organic fertilizer making business, you need to choose your equipment with the greatest possible care. all processes and the stages of the production line need to be as efficient as possible, in order to enjoy a good productivity, and therefore a nice profitability rate. the compost making stage is one of the most important steps of the fertilizer production process.
this article takes a closer look at the main advantages of using a compost turner for organic compost making, rather than relying on natural fermentation alone.
compost making is the first step in turning animal manure and agricultural waste into high quality organic fertilizers. this stage is extremely important, because it influences the quality of the raw matter you’re going to use to make bio fertilizer granules. there are two ways you can obtain this compost. the first way is to allow the manure to go through the natural fermentation process. the second, and much better way is to use a compost turner to speed up the fermentation and to make sure that the resulting matter is homogeneous and ready to enter the next stage of the fertilizer production process.
here are a few advantages of using compost turner equipment rather than waiting for the natural fermentation to occur.
the organic compost turner machine helps making the materials more uniform and loose. this results in better quality compost, and therefore in better quality organic fertilizer. if you want to avoid such problems, you should consider investing in a reliable compost turner for your production line. furthermore, if you want to add auxiliary materials into the mix, you’ll need a compost turner to obtain the uniform matter required to make high quality compost. without a compost turner, it wouldn’t be possible to add all substances you want to obtain the desired result.
the traditional fermentation method has the disadvantage of environmental pollution. if you want to avoid such issues, you should always use a compost fertilizer turning machine rather than natural fermentation. in addition, the traditional method results in a higher number of contaminating microorganisms in the compost. this is a major issue that may affect the quality of the fertilizer, killing the roots of the plants and contaminating the soil. on the contrary, using a compost turner will allow you to lower the temperature of the compost and to increase its oxygen content.
the other advantage of a manure compost turner is the speed of the process. when you turn the compost, fermentation happens much faster than when you allow it to occur naturally. this means that you’ll be able to process a higher volume of waste over a certain period of time. when it comes to large scale farms and fertilizer production plants, this can make a huge difference in terms of work productivity and profitability rate.
as you can see, investing in a reliable compost turner is the way to go if you want to obtain the high quality organic fertilizer your clients expect.

 manure making machine, organic manure processing  


when you run a farm, you have to manage piles of animal waste. you need to clean all spaces, to collect the waste and to dispose of it in an eco-friendly and effective manner. smart farmers take advantage of this situation by turning their animal waste into available fertilizers which they use for their own crops or they sell to other farmers for a profit. this article takes a closer look into the process of turning waste into organic fertilizers by using a manure making machine.
first of all, you have to take into account the types of manure you’ll need to use as raw matter. chicken manure, for instance, is extremely rich in nitrogen, as well as potassium and phosphorus. this makes it a balanced and nutritious fertilizer. at the same time, it can destroy the roots of plants, if you didn’t not properly compost them. cow dung and horse waste are also high in specific nutrients that can help you obtain better crops. this is only one good reason for you to do your homework before investing in a manure making machine. these are good manure for you to make organic fertilizers.
the basic process that turns animal waste into organic fertilizers starts with composting. if you don’t know too much about composting, you should try to gather some relevant information before anything else. you’ll understand the proper composting methods for manure compost making, as well as the main things you should avoid.
next, you have to check out the main features of manure making machines. since you have to find a way to get rid of animal waste anyway, why not turn it into something useful and profitable? this is the role of manure making machines. most of them make granular fertilizers which you can either use on your farm or pack and sell to other farmers in your neighborhood.
the basic functioning principle of all these machines is very simple. raw matter enters the machine and it gets turned into dust, and then mixed into a kind of paste. a special mechanism compacts this matter and forces it through an opening. this mechanism is very similar to the one used by older meat mincers. the extruded matter takes the shape of a cylinder with the same diameter as the opening. a special device turns these cylinders into small granules of organic fertilizer. you can choose the size of the granules by making some adjustments to the manure fertilizer pellet machine. similarly, you can choose what type of raw matter you want to process. however, make sure that your machine has this function, as not all of them do. you can also choose the amount of water in the manure, hence being able to control how the end result will look like.
the resulting fertilizer granules are ready to use. however, you may want to find the appropriate packaging size, and to pack the fertilizer to have an easier time at transporting and storing it. you can ask any manufacturer of manure making machines to provide you information and guidance throughout the purchasing process. this will help you make the right choice for your farm.

 september 12, 2019 
 agriculture recycling  


agricultural waste is classified as residue from growing, along with the initial processing of agricultural products that are raw such as crops, poultry, cattle, meat, vegetable, fruits, etc. this is also a term used for both organic (natural), along with non-organic wastes that are produced from different farming activities. this can include horticulture, dairy farming, livestock breeding, seed growing, market gardens, grazing land, woodlands, and nursery plots.
agriculture fertilizer made by tongda fertilizer making machine
agricultural waste also comes in liquids, solids, or slurries which will depend on the actual agricultural activities. food and agricultural industry wastes and residues are categorized by seasonal productions. they also need to be removed rapidly from the agricultural environment to prevent interferences or delays when it comes to other types of agricultural activities.
today, there are 3 main methods on how to make use of fo different organic wastes. this includes providing energy sources, animal raising, and soil improvement. the effective and safe method used to process these green wastes includes an organic fertilizer granulator. these machines work by granulating the organic wastes preparing them for the process of recycling. this method not only relieves pressure to the surrounding environment but has offered a way to convert waste into something profitable.
for example in europe, despite the fact that waste production has increased to an all-time high, the overall amount of municipal wastes in the landfills has dropped significantly. over the last 10 to 15 years, landfilling has dropped by 5.6% every year.
many of these organic wastes are now used as the primary raw materials for the production of organic fertilizers. once this waste is converted into an organic-based fertilizer it is commonly used to improve the soil after the process of granulation and compost.
at this stage, there are 3 accepted approaches along with the appropriate machines for granulating organic wastes. these include the flat die pellet mill, the latest organic agriculture fertilizer granulator, and the disc pan granulator.
the process of granulating wastes that are organic has offered a way to convert this agriculture waste into effective fertilizers, which offers a convenient method to control nutrients. these machines also turn the waste into granular and dry fertilizers which can then be stored, package and then sold. when compared to the chemical fertilizers, the organic fertilizers are a far better option when it comes to improving the quality and structure of the soil, in the way of supplying essential nutrition to plants. this is also important when it comes to the overall development of pollution-free, green, and organic agriculture.
the advantages of waste management
the main advantage of effectively managing and dealing with agricultural waste has to do with economic and environmental reasons. when feasible, reusing animal waste during farming operations assists with reducing the hauling costs associated with commercial fertilizers. adding recycled animal waste to soil helps to maximize the content of organic matter in the soil. this helps to increase the nutrient availability to plants and crops and helps to improve the potential of the soil to hold water. the best waste management practices also lower the impact of surface and water contamination.

 in vessel composting, organic fertilizer compost  


generally speaking, the way of in-vessel composting is the organic matter fermentation method that involves confining of the composting materials in a vessel, building, or container. the composting method utilizes aerobic fermentation technology in decomposing the organic materials in very high temperatures. based on the categorization of composting systems, this in-vessel composting system can be associated with the biologic reactor system since the biologic reactor is often a vessel in which the fermentation procedure takes place. as the aerobic fermentation process progresses, the temperature and the air flows can be properly regulated in this type of composting system. what’s more, when compared to alternative traditional composting systems, the in-vessel composting system is less affected with bad weather and also the offensive odor is significantly reduced.
in vessel composting equipment
what can you compost with an in-vessel composting equipment?
with the help of a fully closed in-vessel composting equipment, you can ferment the available organic wastes into high-grade compost product. additionally, there are numerous types of organic wastes that you can compost while using such a piece of equipment, for example, sludge, green waste, sheep manure, cow dung, chicken manure, pig manure, and so on.
since this compost bin comes with in-built rotating blades, all types of raw materials can be well-crushed to achieve better and effective fermentation with this closed equipment. therefore, this in-vessel composting system is the most suitable option to achieve resource utilization of wastes in ecological agriculture development, as well as animal breeding industry.
no pollution
both anaerobic fermentation and in-vessel composting have differences and similarities. as the most popularly used fermentation methods, they both adopt the breakdown process of organic matter with the help of microorganisms. however, they function in different ways.
when it comes to in-vessel composting, it utilizes the aerobic fermentation technology, and the entire fermentation procedure needs oxygen, that the bacteria will absorb, then oxidize and decompose all the organic wastes. on the other hand, anaerobic fermentation is completely different. after some microbial metabolic activities of the organic waste in anaerobic conditions, carbon dioxide and methane are the products. in other words, if you do not want any pollution created during the fermentation process, the in-vessel composting method with an organic fertilizer could be an excellent option.
benefits of using in-vessel composting method
application of this type of composting method has its benefits. some are listed below:
– due to the closed fermentation condition created inside the in-vessel composting system, there is an increase in the composting process of your organic materials. what’s more, it also enhances the organic composting time’s efficiency.
– like mentioned earlier, the process involved in organic treatment does not pollute the environment. it also saves on the energy used.
– change in climatic conditions cannot affect the effectiveness of the functionality of the in-vessel composting system. even if the temperature falls below 20°c, the system can function normally and effectively to ferment the organic wastes.
– a fermentation tank automatically regulates the entire fermentation process; this helps you in saving on the labor cost needed.

the first thing you’ll need is a solid business plan. you have to estimate the amount of chicken manure you can collect on a daily basis, in order to know how to pick the right equipment for your organic poultry manure fertilizer production line. if you’ve run your chicken farm for a while, you shouldn’t have problems with estimating the amount of raw matter you’ll collect per day.
next, you need to check out some manure pelleting machines. these chicken manure fertilizer pellets are convenient because you can pack them as needed to ship them to your clients or to store them for your own use. there should be enough information about such equipment on the internet, so you’ll probably find all the details you need without having to waste a lot of time doing research.
you should also become familiar with the working principle of these manure pellets machines. basically, they prepare the raw material and then extrude it to form cylinders of fertilizer. after the extrusion, these cylinders break into smaller granules. they are ready for packing and shipping. of course, this is only a simplified overview of the process. you’ll also need to learn about the good quality raw matter and about the auxiliary devices you may have to buy. all manufacturers of chicken manure pelleting equipment should be able to offer you all the details you need to make an informed choice. before ordering your equipment make sure that you have enough storage room for it. remember that you’ll also need to store the raw matter and the finished product somewhere, the fertilizer bags that will come out of your machine.
using your machine is a matter of getting some effective operator training. many manure machine manufacturers of such machines provide their clients with detailed user manuals and with this type of operator training. this is something to keep in mind for the moment when you’re going to search for price quotes from different manufacturers. always try to get at least three quotes and compare the side by side to find the best one. in fact, the nest isn’t necessarily the cheapest offer, but the one that best suits your needs and your specific requirements. if you need operator training and a longer guarantee, go for the company that offers you just that, even though you may need to pay a higher amount for your machine. the gains will be well worth it. your business needs to rely on high-quality equipment and on savvy operators. this is the only way you’re going to be successful in your work.

 chicken manure pellets machine, how chicken manure is turned into pellet fertilizer  


as a smelly and slightly wet animal waste, chicken manure has a limited value and attracts flies. however, in more recent years, chicken poo or manure is not used as a type of organic fertilizer, which has offered chicken farmers with an effective approach on how to handle this type of waste. not only is this method efficient in dealing with chicken manure, but offers a profitable return by turning the manure into pellet fertilizer.
the process of creating organic fertilizer pellets from manure includes:
• collection of the chicken manure
• drying followed by sterilization
• burden mixing
• pelletizing
• cooling and screening
• measuring and cutting
• storing the fertilizer pellets
if you have plans to start your own small factor in order to make fertilizer pellets, the investment will involve the following:
• crushing machine
• conveying machine
• mixing machine
• pellet making machine
• cooling machine
• packing machine
due to the fact chicken manure when it is fresh is alkaline in comparison to manure that is dry, it will burn the roots of plants and even attract pests and insects. this is the reason why it is not advisable to use the manure directly.
when creating fertilizer pellets using fresh chicken manure it becomes possible to add other microelements and mineral substance to the fertilizer according to varying nutritional requirements when it comes to grasses, flowers, vegetable, and plants.
the fertilizer pellets that are made using a fertilizer pellet machine creates a high density and uniform size which makes these pellets very easy to store and well as transport.
complete waste to fertilizer production line
the process of making fertilizer pellets using chicken manure:
• manure drying
due to the fact that fresh chicken manure has a very high moisture content. the initial step in the process is to dry manure. the moisture in the manure needs to dry until the moisture content reaches 15% or less. the drying process is the most important step in the entire process.
• manure crushing
the manure becomes a lot looser after the drying process. the machine then utilizes a hammer mill which crushed the manure into a powder which measures between 2 to 5mm in diameter. the crushing process makes the product easier to work with
• producing the pellets
after the process of crushing, the powdered manure is then ready in order to make these materials into pellets using a pellet machine designed to handle chicken manure.
• pellets cooling
the next step of the process involves cooling the hot pellets down. this part of the machine includes a flat die pellet press, or a ring die pellet mill. from here the cooled and dry pellets can now be stored and then transported.
both cattle and chicken manure is a suitable material to produce fertilizer pellets. the organic content of manure from chickens is nitrogen (25.5%), phosphorus (1.63%), and potassium (1.54%). once the chicken manure has undergone a process of fermentation, the end product is an organic and high-quality fertilizer. the end product offers a highly rich nutrient-content. this fertilzer offers many different uses for plants and vegetables.

 cow dung recycling, dewatering machine  


in order to solve the issues caused by an excessive amount of fresh cow dung, it is a viable option to compost the dung and turns it into organic fertilizer.
cow dung is a product that is derived from the waste produced by cows. this waste has the potential to provide organic materials that are highly rich in a number of different nutrients which include potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen. more importantly, cow manure contains ammonia in high levels which is capable of stopping the pathogens from spreading and growing. thus, making cow dung manure into fertilizers is good for not only recycling waste, but also your crops.

once composting fresh cow manure with a fertilizer machine, it is able to provide attractive benefits to both organic farms and gardens. the processing method to turn cow manure into an organic fertilizer involves a few important steps:
• collect the cow dung and dewater the waste
fresh cow manure contains high concentrations of water, so the first step will involve using a dewatering machine in order to achieve a water content that is below 85%. it is also important to remove the excess moisture to prevent bacteria and pathogens from spreading.

• combine the dry cow dung with organic waste
cow manure is a heavy material that needs to be combined with other organic substances such as dead leaves, garden debris, vegetable waste, wood, sawdust, straw, and hay, etc,
• composting and fermentation
once the organic mixture is combined well, the waste is placed into fermentation grooves to allow the waste to ferment.

about cow dung dewatering
a dewatering machine is an important part of the process to turn cow dung into usable fertilizer. the dewatering machines usually include a screw-press machine which separates the fresh dung into a solid and a liquid. once the separation process is complete, the content of water left in the cow dung is around 30%.
how does a cow dung dewatering machine work?
the screw press cow dung dewatering machine is made up of an engine, reducer, screw device, pipeline, and hydraulic pump. this machine dewaters the raw materials using a screw press.
the hydraulic-pump featured in this machine serves the purpose of transporting the raw cow manure into the dewatering machine. from here the screw-shaft will press the liquids out of the dung. this process creates pressure whereby the liquids are forced out through a screen into an outlet. after these processes, the moisture content in the dung is around 30 to 40%.
even though cow dung is regarded as one of the best organic fertilizers, the fresh dung has high levels of ammonia, a strong odor and often contains an excess amount of salt. the fresh dung also carries pathogens and bacterias. the process of dewatering the cow manure is important along with the correct fermentation and composting techniques. once the cow dung has been composted it is easy to process the end product into granules or powder.
once converted into fertilizer the cow manure supports the growth of important microorganisms once mixed into the soil. it also helps to improve soil texture along with assisting the soil with maintaining water.

organic fertilizer production 



why does a commercial disc granulator play an important role during eco-fertilizer production?

 by basil 
 september 4, 2019 
 disc granulation machine  


before we answer the first question, let’s take a step back and first address exactly what a dis granulator is. a disc granulator is a machine that is designed to finely grind composting materials such as raw manure like chicken, rabbit, cow, horse, etc. into fine pellets that can then be used as fertilizer.
the machine is round (hence the disc) and it has an area where the manure can be placed into the granulator and then it’s turned on to process the manure into the fine pellets that will be used as fertilizer. the granulator allows for increased production and offers a higher yield of the process so that farmers are able to capitalize on their business.
the wet granulator also works to reduce the dust that is naturally kicked up when the process is going on. the granulator, by being more enclosed helps to prevent the levels of dust from escaping and causing any breathing issues for the farmer or employees.
for a large scale operation, the disc granulator will help to increase production while requiring less labor-intensive work for the company. since all of the matter is organic, this is an excellent eco-friendly way to increase production without the harsh use of chemicals or other equipment.
the advantages to the disc granulator are numerous. adjustments can be made to the disc to determine the final output size of the pellets. different sizes can be used in different types of fertilizer. it works to ensure that the pellets are all uniform in size which helps to break the pellets down once they’re applied to the ground or crops.
smaller sized businesses will find that the disc granulator can help to increase production and thus give a larger return on investment. the more return on investment the better equipped the company is to remain in business and have a steady flow of customers.
materials can be gathered from a variety of sources and placed into the pan granulator and then processed. packaging can be as simple or elaborate as desired and the final product can then be sold either at the same location or transported to another facility for distribution.
the disc granulator works by adding dry materials to the top of the equipment and the materials are then degassed and compressed. the arc-shaped notch is made up of two different rolls that will reverse rotation at varying speeds to condense and then form the pellets.
during this process, the materials are then condensed into the disc and the stress is adjusted to ensure that the pellets are all naturally separated within the space and using the aid of gravity and the surface tension the pellets are then complete for distribution.
disc granulators are available in various models and not all models are the same. always ask questions before purchase and fully understand the way that the machine works to ensure that you’re getting the best fertilizer machine for your specific needs in your fertilizer production. a commercial disc granulator can save a business a lot of time and money when it’s utilized correctly.

 pig manure comnposting method  


animal manure is high in nitrogen which makes it a great fertilizer. however, you cannot use fresh manure as a fertilizer because it will contain materials that are harmful to your plants. if you have a pig and want to use their manure for compost, there are some steps that you need to take.
turning machine for pig manure composting
prepare the compost site
before composting pig manure, you need to start a compost site. a lot of people use compost bins, but you can also make a compost pile instead. regardless of the method of compost, you need to choose the right area. it is recommended that you choose a shaded area which is a distance from any trees. this is important because tree roots are drawn to compost and will grow into the compost if it is too close.
if you are using a compost bin, you will need to set it up according to the instructions from the pig manure machine manufacturer. if you are creating a compost pile, you need to create a drainage system by creating a trench. the trench will need to go across the middle of the base of the pile and will need to be covered with a hardwearing fabric. a thin layer of twigs will then need to be laid down to assist the drainage.
creating the compost pile
once you have your drainage in place, you need to add some organic material to the pile. this layer of material will need to be 6 to 8 inches deep. the material you can use include grass clippings, leaves, weeds, shredded paper, wood ash, and animal bedding. sod can also be added to this layer. once the layer is in place, you need to moisten it with some water. how to make full use of your pig manure with other organic material, go here look at what fertilizer plant designer does?
you can now add the pig manure to the compost pile. the layer of pig manure should be around 1 inch thick. this is important because you have to maintain a proper ratio of pig manure to organic material. if you are going to add other animal manure to the compost, you need to reduce the amount of pig manure in the layer. the recommended ratio of organic material to animal manure is 6:1 which means 1 inch of animal manure for every 6 inches of organic material.
once the layer of animal manure is the right size, you will need to moisten the compost again. after moistening the compost, you need to add an inch of soil to the top of the pile. the entire pile should then be moistened again. the layering should be continued until the pile reaches approximately 3 to 5 feet in height. it is important that you moisten the layers as you go.
the compost pile should be left for a few weeks after creating and continually moistened. you will need to periodically mix the layers together. the pile will need to decompose for 4 to 6 months before you can use it in the garden.
pig manure is a great nitrogen addition to your compost, but you need to create your compost pile correctly. the manure needs to be mixed with organic carbon-based materials. you also need to leave the pile to decompose for up to 6 months before using it. welcome to https://fertilizerplantdesigner.com/composting-pig-manure/ for more details in compost pig manure process, steps, machine selections, etc.
