a  kindergarten pupil told his teacher he’d found a cat, but it was dead.how do you know that the cat was dead? she  asked him.because i pissed in its ear and it didn’t move.  answered the child innocently.you did  what?! the teacher exclaimed in surprise. you know,  explained the boy, i leaned over and went pssst! and it didn’t move.

i have a problem. i'm addicted to lotions. seriously.  at any point you can go in my purse and there will be at least 3 lotions. i like choices.i don't remember how i found margaret, but when i saw her etsy shop and all the packages of samples she sells, i almost swooned.  (hehe, picture me swooning and laugh your ass off)look:these are just 2 of the many i purchased.  they have 8 samples in a set, eight samples in a sweet little bag. heaven!  these make great treats to put in a card or just have a few in your purse.she also sells full size lotions, but i fell hard for the "tottle"its a 1 oz refillable lotion bottle. perfect for the project bag, purse or car!the lotion itself is perfect. not too heavy, absorbs quickly and non-staining. perfect for your knit kit.  i actually feel like the "cracks" in my hands have been filled in.  the scents are nice, there are plenty of choices and none that i tried was overwhelming in any way. (i don't like per-fumy scents).  i applied the lotion about 10 am and at 2 pm my hands still feel nice and soft.oh and most importantly, the service is 5 star.  you should know i'm big on customer service. if i'm giving you my money i at least want a "thank-you".  margaret is quick to convo and super pleasant. go. buy. you won't be sorry.labels: blabber

the  dog's diary   8:00 am - dog  food!  my favorite thing!  9:30 am - a car ride! my favorite thing!   9:40 am - a walk in the park! my favorite thing!10:30 am - got  rubbed  and petted! my favorite thing!12:00 pm - milk bones! my favorite  thing!  1:00 pm - played in the yard! my favorite thing!  3:00  pm - wagged my tail! my favorite thing!  5:00 pm - dinner! my  favorite  thing!  7:00 pm - got to play ball! my favorite thing!  8:00  pm - wow! watched tv with the people! my favorite thing!11:00 pm -  sleeping  on the bed! my favorite thing!   the  cat's diary day 983 of my  captivity     my  captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. they  dine  lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and i are fed hash or  some sort  of dry nuggets. although i make my contempt for the rations perfectly  clear, i  nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my  strength.     the only  thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. in an attempt to  disgust them,  i once again vomit on the carpet. today i decapitated a mouse and  dropped its  headless body at their feet. i had hoped this would strike fear into  their  hearts, since it clearly demonstrates my capabilities. however, they  merely made  condescending comments about what a "good little hunter" i am.  bastards! there was some sort of  assembly of their accomplices tonight. i was placed in solitary  confinement for  the duration of the event. however, i could hear the noises and smell  the food.  i overheard that my confinement was due to the power of "allergies." i  must  learn what this means, and how to use it to my  advantage.     today i  was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors  by  weaving around his feet as he was walking. i must try this again  tomorrow, but  at the top of the stairs.     i am  convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. the  dog  receives special privileges. he is regularly released, and seems to be  more than  willing to return. he is obviously retarded. the bird must be an  informant. i  observe him communicate with the guards regularly. i am certain that he  reports  my every move. my captors have arranged protective custody for him in an   elevated cell, so he is safe. for now ..."i am your evil overlord. fear me"labels: funny
