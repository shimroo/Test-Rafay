honeymoon photos and videos are up!
published on monday, december 25th, 2006 at 4:16 pm by justin

well, in less than 24 hours i was able to do what’s been eluding me for over three months and i got all of our pictures and videos up. here are the pictures: 
honeymoon i - athens
honeymoon ii - santorini
honeymoon iii - mykonos
honeymoon iv - istanbul
and a couple random, low-quality videos here. 
enjoy — we sure did!

at long last…
published on monday, december 25th, 2006 at 3:33 am by justin

i am finally beginning to get our honeymoon photos online, fearing the shame of passing the new year when our honeymoon was in september. episode one, athens, is now online here. i’ll be working on santorini, mykonos, and istanbul in the (very) near future.

updates still brewing…
published on friday, october 13th, 2006 at 2:43 pm by justin

 
we’ll hopefully post some more stuff soon, such as wedding and honeymoon pictures and other tidbits about the wedding. but we’re both kind of busy right now. 
in the meantime, check out jim’s photos here. 
we hope to have some of our own pictures (that others took with our camera) as well as the official photographer’s ones before too long, so stay tuned! 
also, feel free to post your own links to photos in the comments — we’ve got some already, but share them again if you like.

almost
published on thursday, september 7th, 2006 at 8:33 am by michelle

i thought i should post something before the end… er before the wedding that is. this past week has flown by, the past year has flown by. i can’t believe all that we have accomplished, this has to be the biggest thing i have ever done/involved myself in. and i am so excited. i cannot wait for saturday! i just don’t want it to all go by too quickly. too bad there is no slow down button i can press.
the next two days are going to be busy. the moms, justin and i are off to the vineyard today to have the final walk thru and hand over all the stuff. i think that is going to be refreshing since after that most things are out of our hands. then tonight everyone starts coming into town. 
yay… i’m getting married!

out the door
published on wednesday, september 6th, 2006 at 4:29 pm by justin

whooosh… we’re out the door and getting on the road, not to return until after a journey of thousands of miles. i got my car back after over a month of repairs, rental cars, and lots more and we’re packed and ready for the next three weeks. wish us luck!

looking back (and laughing at myself)
published on tuesday, september 5th, 2006 at 11:39 pm by justin

we’ve got much to do, but today i officially wrapped up work for the next couple of weeks and we worked on a couple of key tasks tonight. tomorrow we drive up to connecticut and begin our wedding weekend. 
i was just browsing over the site and remembered our archives, which have been fun to go over. take a look if you’ve got some time. i found this excerpt from our first post pretty amusing: 

…today we picked a date, booked a caterer, signed on a location, and oh yeah, michelle bought a dress. we went from like 5% done to what feels like 75% done. iâm sure as time goes on weâll realize thatâs more like 5% to 10%, but hereâs hoping for more…

yeah right, past justin. you wish.

relaxation… well, not yet
published on monday, september 4th, 2006 at 6:40 pm by justin


i’m finding it hard to relax today. basically we’ve had a good past three days, where we slept in, worked on wedding stuff all day, and then read, watched tv, and i played warcraft by night (including until 4am, last night). but despite all of our lists, i can’t seem to relax — i feel like even though we’ve mapped out the details of who’s putting what table where (and when) and our beautiful seating chart is done, something will crop up. i’m trying to make myself realize that at this point, anything that comes up can be handled in stride and that we’re done planning… i think. i just continue to feel like saturday at about 5pm we’ll realize that we don’t have socks or something. 
i finally today started spending some serious time looking into greece and turkey and preparing my language skills. so far i’ve got “hello, how are you?”, “my name is justin”, and “how much to buy all of your delicious spanakopita?” in greek. mmmm. i can’t wait. our hotel in athens is on syntagma square, which means easy access walking to tons of things we want to see. i’m trying to figure out if i should document some things at the end of each day or if i should just wait on all of it until we get back. but i need the vacation mentality now, since there’s actually not a lot of work we have to do between now and saturday. 
we’ll have to practice our dancing a bit more tonight, too. that is one little thing to stress about. 
p.s. if you’re hungry, don’t look at this.

shuttles: what you need to know
published on monday, september 4th, 2006 at 2:55 pm by justin


if you are staying at our hotel, please be sure to mention that you are with the petruzzi/miller party so that you get a sheet with the shuttle details on it. there is a 24/7 foxwoods shuttle that runs on the half hour, but we will have a special shuttle going to and from the vineyard as well. there will be a couple choices of when to head back to the hotel so hopefully we can accommodate everyone. we’ll put a note in the rooms to remind me you to ask the front desk for details if you don’t have them already. 
can you tell that we’re kind of tightly wound about details at this point?

weather
published on thursday, august 31st, 2006 at 5:39 am by michelle

with the wedding fast approaching… i have become addicted to checking the weather.com site for a hint to what our day will be like. keep your fingers crossed, but right now they forecast it to be mostly sunny and 73 degrees.
