the wellington edge










in the pursuit of investment excellence, we’ve chosen to do things a little differently, including the way we structure our ownership model, organization, and investment platform.


view more











independence & scale
as one of the world’s largest privately held asset managers, we take the long view, innovate and invest when others pull back, and are accountable only to our clients. our ownership model contributes to the depth and continuity of our talent.




            learn more
          







marketplace of ideas
our collaborative culture is not just talk. we’ve spent decades designing an open organization in which our investors can leverage every pocket of intellectual capital to sharpen their own insights and portfolio decisions.




            learn more
          







integrated investment capabilities
we believe that our clients’ challenges require an integrated approach to research, portfolio management, and solutions design across asset classes. we pair deep multi-disciplinary research resources — career analysts, embedded data scientists, client strategists — with independent portfolio teams operating in an entrepreneurial “boutique” environment. 




            learn more
