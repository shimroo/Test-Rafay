orthodox christian association of medicine, psychology and religion (ocampr)
welcome to the orthodox christian association of medicine, psychology and religion (ocampr). ocampr is an affiliate ministry of the assembly of canonical orthodox bishops (formerly scoba) and a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit corporation.
ocampr exists to foster interdisciplinary dialogue and promote christian fellowship among professionals in medicine, psychology and religion. members pursue an understanding of the whole person which integrates the basic assumptions of medicine, psychology and religion within the orthodox christian faith. ocampr is for those who seek to understand and experience the best relationship between theology and the healing arts and sciences in order to offer their services in the light of christ’s truth and the church’s healing wisdom.
ocampr members have access to monthly online, 1-hour community of practice gatherings focused on education and networking.
