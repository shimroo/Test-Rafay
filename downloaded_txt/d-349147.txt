                              they are retained as tag files that
                              accompany and modify the original files
                              when they are opened into

                              original state at any time thereafter,

                              remaining untouched. because of
                              this, you can now consider your
                              original jpegs to be like digital
                              "negatives" for use as a lifetime

                              printing. with that in mind, it's a
                              good idea to have a long term
                              cataloging plan before you copy your
                              original pictures from your memory
                              cards to your hard drive so you can
                              easily find them in the future. it's
                              wise to make permanent backups of your
                              original files in another location (cd,
                              dvd, external hard drive, etc.) in case
                              something bad happens to your computer.
                              you might even want to create your own
                              website to showcase your photos.
                              (that's how i got started with
                              lonestardigital.com). having your own
                              website gives you your own private
                              space in a remote website hosting
                              server as another place to store your
                              backups.

                              needed white balance or exposure work
                              were difficult to correct, requiring
                              strong photoshop skills and time
                              consuming work to get acceptable

for
                                 exposure correction, the traditional
                                 photoshop process involves working
                                 in levels, dragging the shadows
                                 slider to the right for
                                 overexposure, dragging the highlight
                                 slider to the left for

                                 middle slider left or right to
                                 achieve a new midtone balance,
                                 followed by a brightness and
                                 contrast adjustment to tweak the
                                 results. advanced photoshop users
                                 often apply advanced masking
                                 techniques before working in levels
                                 to make exposure corrections to
                                 shadows, highlights, or specific
                                 color ranges. photoshop cs2 &

                                 that has control sliders for
                                 exposure, offset, and gamma. the
                                 exposure adjustment tool is easy to
                                 use, works surprisingly well for
                                 underexposure, but works poorly on
                                 overexposure.

                                 traditional photoshop process
                                 involves trial and error sampling
                                 with the eyedropper tool in levels
                                 to find the best baseline white,

                                 easiest to use, and reasonably

                                 complicated to use than traditional

                                 of reduced size preview screens that
                                 make it difficult to properly

easy
                              exposure & white balance correction
                              was the main reason i switched from
                              jpeg to raw back in 2001 when nikon
                              capture 2 software was introduced with
                              its user friendly white balance and
                              exposure compensation tools.
three years later, my excitement
                              about further industrywide improvements
                              to raw conversion software motivated me
                              to publish a short web article
                              titled "why
                              shoot
                              raw?".
as time
                              went on, i continued shooting raw
                              because of the technical processing
                              advantages and the enhanced quality of
                              the images they provided, but i missed
                              the practical side of shooting jpegs.
                              

the
                                 down side of raw files is that they
                                 require a computer with special raw
                                 conversion software to process,
                                 view, or print pictures. cameras and
                                 megapixels advance year by year,
                                 requiring faster computers with
                                 bigger hard drives, more processing
                                 power, more memory, and updated
                                 software to recognize the new camera
                                 raw file format changes.


the
                                 up side of jpegs is that every
                                 computer, every web browser, and
                                 every kind of imaging software knows
                                 what jpegs from any kind of camera
                                 are and can handle them with no
                                 problem. other than having larger
                                 file sizes due to more & more
                                 megapixels, jpegs haven't changed
                                 since digital cameras were invented.
                                 jpegs can be quickly and easily
                                 loaded up & viewed on any
                                 computer or portable image viewing
                                 device, viewed in any e-mail, and
                                 printed anywhere without any special
                                 software or equipment.

dual
                              format shooting options became standard
                              in later model high-end cameras,
                              providing both a raw and jpeg file of
                              the same picture. this gave me the
                              opportunity to enjoy the best of both
                              worlds. i could share, view, or print
                              the jpeg copies right out of the camera
                              anywhere & anytime, and still have
                              the raw files for advanced post
                              processing. 
but
                              dual format also means fewer total
                              pictures per memory card because of the
                              space taken by the additional jpeg
                              files. and it takes considerably longer
                              to transfer the dual set of raw plus
                              jpeg picture files into a
                              computer.
so
                              should you shoot raw? jpeg? or
                              both??
if you
                              want the absolute best image quality
                              your camera can deliver, shoot
                              raw.
if you
                              prefer the simplicity & ease of
                              working with jpegs, adobe camera raw
                              can now give you nearly all of the
                              technical processing abilities of a raw
                              file. 
if your
                              camera can shoot raw plus jpeg at the
                              same time, do it. even if you don't
                              want to work with raw files now, save
                              them for the possibility that one day

                              and make your favorite pictures even

                                                your lcd panel will

yes,
                                                you can choose

                                                resolution setting,
                                                but it will degrade
                                                your display quality.
                                                in many cases, what
                                                people consider to be
                                                a poor quality lcd
                                                monitor or laptop
                                                screen is simply the
                                                result of displaying
                                                other than its full
                                                native resolution.
                                                that's because the
                                                output pixels don't
                                                line up perfectly
                                                with the screen's
                                                pixels and the
                                                details become
                                                slightly
