the black rod



the origin of the usher of the black rod goes back to early fourteenth century england . today, with no royal duties to perform, the usher knocks on the doors of the house of commons with the black rod at the start of parliament to summon the members. the rod is a symbol for the authority of debate in the upper house. we of the black rod adopted the symbol to knock some sense and the right questions into the heads of legislators, pundits, and other opinion makers.

f for fizzle, f for flop, f for failed: mb nurses grade the ndp government






february 03, 2025












at the end of the ndp government's first full year in office (november, 2024), the manitoba nurses union surveyed its members to the achievements of the new administration. the results, released last week, were a stinging rebuke to wab kinew and his touted reforms of health care in the province. by every measure in the survey, the ndp fizzled, flopped and failed. "overall, grade the performance of the government in living up to its many promises with respect to improving health care and patient outcomes,"  asked the union. 66 percent of respondents said the ndp either failed-- and things have gotten worse-- or there was "no improvement, with things the same as before." the ndp promised they would hire hundreds of new nurses to open more beds and eliminate the mandatory overtime that was eroding nurse morale. "grade the effectiveness of the government's staffing initiative on vacancy rates and/or nurse workload in your facility/site/program." 61 per...

fight. fight. fight. we say no to the fp vendetta against george dangerfield









january 31, 2025









the winnipeg free press thought that the recent death of a respected crown prosecutor was a pefect opportunity to malign and defame him with impunity. they didn't anticipate that the vile effort would damage an innocent victim- one of their own. katrina clarke is listed on the fp website as an "investigative reporter." she hasn't made much of a mark at the paper, so when offered a juicy story, it looked irresistable . "... the late prosecutor is linked to five wrongful convictions involving eight men who collectively spent more than 100 years in prison for crimes they did not commit." read the story.  "... the cases have left a trail of various forms of misconduct — undisclosed evidence, a reliance on junk science and secret deals with crown witnesses. they have also spawned two commissions of inquiry and required payments of millions of dollars in compensation for victims." "dangerfield was an outlier, a driven prosecutor blinded by tunnel vi...

do you want to understand donald trump, past, present, and future? read this.









november 15, 2024









(originally published february 19, 2017)  ten years ago new york real estate developer donald trump wrote a book called 'trump. think big and kick ass'. today he's president of the united states of america donald trump. and the line of people with sore asses includes hillary clinton, barack obama, the entire democratic party, the republican party establishment, and pretty much most of the news media.  they should have read his book. we did. to help you understand donald trump past, present and future, we've culled  thirty-three trump tips to attain the top: "  * i love to crush the other side and take the benefits. why? because there is nothing greater. for me it is even better than sex, and i love sex. * in a great deal you win---not the other side. you crush your opponent and come away with something better for yourself. in negotiations i go for the complete win. * i have learned that it is important to focus on the solution, not the problem. if you put all your ...

overwhelmed nurses in open revolt at union's coziness with the ndp gov’t









june 28, 2024









eight months, one budget and one contract later, wab kinew is staring at his worst nightmare---a nurses strike.   nurses at manitoba's largest hospital, the health sciences centre, have rejected the labour contract the new ndp government presented to them this month. their bargaining committee has gone back to government to find some solution but the ndp has already told them there will be no more money, only words---possible changes to wording in the contract.   mnu   the ndp and shared health (employer) has refused to work with the manitoba nurses union to address concerns presented in the proposed contract. should shared health nurses vote in favor of a strike, delays in healthcare will be inevitable across the board in manitoba.   this is a slap in the face of the union's top leadership who have been wab kinew's biggest backers and who sold him to the public as the great saviour of health care in manitoba.   a nurses strike would be the second vote of non-confidence in ...

about me













we are citizen journalists in winnipeg. when not breaking exclusive stories, we analyze news coverage by the mainstream media and highlight bias, ignorance, incompetence,  flawed logic, missed angles and, where warranted, good work. we serve as the only overall news monitors in the province of manitoba. we do the same with politicians (who require even more monitoring.) published since 2005 on territory ceded, released, surrendered and yielded up in 1871 to her majesty the queen and successors forever.
