welcome 
					to our mountain
  
 
our story
  


mountain mist 
						productions 
 celebrates 
					the ongoing literary and artistic talents of our special 
					little international group. we began on the 8th may, 2000, 
					with a generic domain of ebooks.plann.com.au. now, the 
					main site at
					
https://1stmist.com 
					serves as an easy guide to what is available. 
					take a look 
					around and bookmark what interests you.
					
  
 
beginning as authors and 
					artists, our endeavours now also serve to entertain as we celebrate our "old-fashioned" mission. 
	projects and websites introduced on 1stmist.com highlight the many skills of 
					our storytellers, historians, authors, poets, entertainers, 
					musicians, artists, photographers, illustrators, doll-makers 
					and general crafters. other and often combined subjects and 
					techniques further showcase the varied talents of the group.

  we thank you for your visit 
					and for taking the time to make up your own mind. if 
					something doesn't appeal, it is 
					perfectly acceptable to just  glide on by.... come back next week or in 6 months - you will 
					be most welcome. you are in charge - no 
					pressure, no spam, no tracking, no cookies, no extraneous 
					advertising, data mining, bulldust or blah, 
					blah, blah.... get the picture? we are who we 
					are and we love what we do.
