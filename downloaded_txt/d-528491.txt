chris burge |  national facilities director / corporate compliance & safety officer/ igourmet









weâve been working with road scholar transport since 1999, first for some of our regional volume ltl shipments and full truckload needs, then for our custom critical shipments to the nuclear power plants we serve. the service was excellent, and they quickly became our go-to carrier regionally. when we absolutely need to have something delivered â be it night, day, weekend, or holidays â they have always delivered for us. we continue to utilize their services to this day as well as their new brokerage arm which has also been excellent.

the challenge
over the years, weâve transported thousands of valuable shipments, delivering them quickly and safely to their destination but we had never been asked to transport a brain tumor directly from an operating room to a lab. true to our core, we listened to the logistical challenges, and collectively rallied our resources to help one of the most innovative companies in the world of immunotherapy on their path to save lives.
road scholar solution





the challenge
one customerâs supply chain consisted of a network of independent distributors to final the deliveries to the local stores. their distribution issue was twofold â not only did shipper âaâ need the product delivered on time to their distributors to keep costs down and customer service levels up, but they also needed to maximize space on the trailers to fit as many cases as possible.road scholarâs solution is still working after 20 years. click below to learn how we solved their distribution issues.
road scholar solution





the challenge
a new york metro shipper had two very pressing issues â on time and damage-free deliveries. the shipping process in place for the fragile product this customer manufactures involved a driver backing into their door, floor-loading goods, pulling out, and heading to the delivery. when the product finally arrived at their clientâs construction site, it was both late and damaged, making for a very unhappy â and most likely not a repeat â customer. click below for the rst solution.
road scholar solution





the challenge
one of road scholarâs clients had raw material supplier issues arise that caused their customer to have to purchase large quantities of raw materials and eliminate a distributor. their customer asked our client to store these materials for them, but our client didnât have the room to store large quantities, nor the capability to handle inbound and outbound as required. click below to see how rst solved the problem for our client â and their customer.

awareness campaigns
road scholar transport
it all started with a pink tractor-trailer in support of breast cancer awareness. today, we have over 40 pieces of equipment in support of charities and causes! these ârolling billboardsâ are raising awareness for dozens of affiliations, groups, and causes. a single awareness trailer on the road receives between 30,000 â 80,000 impressions in a single day. inquire about having one of our trailerâs serve as a backdrop at your next event. we will do our best to accommodate and help the cause!
