about us


more than 100 years ago, grace raymond hebard—uw faculty member, administrator, librarian,
                  and wyoming historian—began collecting the papers and reminiscences of wyoming’s pioneers.
                  her research on the history of wyoming, the west, emigrant trails, and native americans
                  became the nucleus for what is known today as the american heritage center (ahc). officially
                  established in 1945, the center now holds over 90,000 cubic feet of historic documents
                  and artifacts in more than 3500 collections—placing the ahc among the largest non-governmental
                  archives in the nation.
today, the ahc contains important holdings in numerous areas. its western history
                  archives include materials on early women’s suffrage and political achievements, native
                  americans, ranching, politics, authors, and under-documented communities. other featured
                  collecting areas include transportation (railroad, highway and air travel), mining
                  and energy extraction, entertainment and popular culture (with important collections
                  featuring hollywood, music, radio, television and the comic book industry), natural
                  resources and the environment, and military history. the ahc also serves as the primary
                  archives for the university of wyoming. connect with us on our social media platforms
                  - facebook, twitter, instagram, virmuze, and our blog - where we are #always archiving.
