connecting with your neighbors in the past



neighborhood genealogy, maybe the best description of this project. it is a neighborhood history but the focus isn't known institutions, such as dunbar high school, or any particularly famous or notable people. no. it is the neighborhood as a whole, from the common laborer living as a lodger under someone else's roof to the notable landowner and everyone else in between.like a family genealogy, the census is the greatest source of information for finding out about the regular citizens and neighbors who occupied the area now known as truxton circle.â the truxton circle: a neighborhood genealogy project has been financed in part with federal funds from the u.s. department of the interior, national park service. however, the contents and opinions contained in this website/publication do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the u.s. department of the interior.also many thanks to my project partner north capitol main streets, inc. â for this project and other neighborhood efforts and businesses they support.
