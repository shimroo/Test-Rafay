about the child support lien network (csln)
our history
in the past, it was a relatively rare occurrence when child support agencies collected a payment from an insurance settlement. child support officials collected monies from insurance claims only after the happenstance of coming upon the knowledge of such claim settlement information provided by the custodial parents or third parties. often, opportunities to collect from the claim settlement were missed because the claim was paid before a lien or income withholding order could be issued.

child support lien network
the state of rhode island (ri) established the child support lien network (csln) in 1999 under a 1998 federal ocse grant to extract data from each delinquent child support obligor file into one accessible, easy-to-use database for the purpose of asset matching, specifically intercepting insurance settlements owed to delinquent child support obligors. a supplemental 1999 federal ocse grant extended csln to four other new england states. the grant has expired; however, states outside of new england may now join csln through the execution of this agreement with the state of ri as host state of the csln.

child support lien network
the law required states to enter into agreements with financial institutions conducting business within the state for the purpose of conducting a quarterly data match. the data match is intended to identify financial accounts held in banks, credit unions, money market mutual funds, etc., belonging to parents who are delinquent in the payment of their child support obligation. when a match is identified, state cse programs may issue liens or levies (referred to in the statute as "freeze and seize" procedures) on the accounts of that delinquent obligor to collect the past-due child support.
