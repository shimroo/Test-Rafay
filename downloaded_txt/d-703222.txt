secret police and lack of privacy and
i don't want to remember.
now i just want to prosecute the bastards
sign the petition to get a special prosecutor for bush war crimes 

.jon stewart
i love him. i love him. i love him. and where he goes i"ll follow. i'll follow i'll follow, well, not to crossfire unless i can watch it on the internet. all hail jon stewart and see him speak for us, the masses, on crossfire. wow. that was old too. i should have a separate entry from stephen colbert, but i'm too lazy at the moment. right now i'm just trying to pitch all the anger towards the prior administration. more later. 
i love al franken! i do i do i love al franken 
 wow. this stuff was old. right now i'm so excited to call him senator franken. number 60. except i want him to be number 59 and for them to kick out joe lieberman. 
al franken and jon stewart together 
watch this clip of the daily show where jon stewart talks about al franken.

things i learned

                  bohemian club and bohemian

                  video by alex jones)

healthy eating

parents
              against junk food -- christopher kimball, the host of america's
              test kitchen and editor of cooks
              illustrated magazine is help leading the way for healthier
              food for kids and grown-ups too. i get his email
              newsletter which provides healthier but tasty versions of great
              food, like today's included banana bread and new york cheese cake.
              these recipes are reduced fat but they demand good taste. 
i'm also a big
              fan of dr.
              andrew weil who believes in integrative medicine. integrative
              medicine is healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the
              whole person (body, mind, and spirit), including all aspects of
              lifestyle. it emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and makes
              use of all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative.
              

study for
              free at mit?

 yup.
              pretty cool huh? the drawback: no credit or access to staff. still.
              mit for free. and it even rhymes. i don't understand how they do
              the music and physical education classes but all i have to do is
              click to find out.

wal-mart sucks
but i still think
            workers and management of safeway and all california grocery stores
            have to get together to unionize wal-mart.

 fog 

which is why our headquarters are in
  san francisco. okay, at first we weren't so excited about the fog, because it is dreary and cold. but after spending a weekend in the hot sun, we have come to really appreciate it. more san francisco sites:
  

bay area back pages - this cool web site, created by ron horii, tells all about the bay area. he has pages on different parts of california; where to go biking, hiking, camping, swimming; views and places to take kids.sf station - san francisco's premier, progressive on-line arts and entertainment information resource.  about.com's guide to san francisco - i rely on about.com's urban legends page, which is fantastic, so this should be good as well!  zpub's
          san francisco history index - fantastic site with links to all
          kinds of information about baghdad by the baykfog - i love it when
        i am coming south through marin and the approach to the golden gate bridge
        is covered in fog, and then i come upon the sign saying that clean up
        for litter is made by kfog! 
fogfest -- okay, it's
        in pacific, but they're just down the beach from here.


  babies 

somebody must have
      said be
        fruitful and multiply because 
    the babies just keep bouncing out. go 
    on, take a look. 
okay, sammy isn't a baby
      anymore! if you don't believe me, go visit his
      web site. don't forget to
      look at his birthday wish list under toys. really, it doesn't have to be
      his birthday to give him toys. that's what he says anyway.

  jobs 
 vacuum kitty does not provide employment for anyone, so we at vkp 
  have to find outside jobs, and since we love the bay area, we will continue 
to work here. check out our bay area job resources. 
  books
 reading, writing, and just holding them in our paws. this is of course why we publish. here are some great links to all kinds of stuff: 
  

 bird
          & beckett books & records -- i used to kid them about their
          hoakey web site, but it's no longer hoakey and jeepers, mine is! b&b is a wonderful independent book store that provides
          more than just reading
        material. if you're ever in glen park, check out the poetry, jazz,  
        literary and political events. don't miss friday night jazz with the
          chuck peterson quintet.
powell's -
          my very  favorite book store, though unfortunately for me it's in portland,
          oregon. this place is huge. they have both new and used books, 
          and they're in order, not just piles of used books, but alphabetized
          and  everything! i could spend hours here. the bookstore is reams better
          than 
          any web site, but they have a good web site too. check out their great
           deals and their top
            25 novels of all time (includes the modern library's top 100). 
    

ayer
               company publishers california books - interesting collection of
               books  about california, including many gold rush books, san francisco,
               native 
          americans, california government history and more. my favorite title is
                920 o'farrell street. update: i saw this book at the library recently,
                so i checked it out and read it. way cool! i highly recommend it
    to all san franciscofiles.

ichapters.com -
              offers very flexible purchase options including the purchase
              of chapters in electronic format from college textbooks, electronic and
              print textbooks at discounted prices.
bookopoly it's the self-proclaimed best place to buy and sell books. not an auction! phew. this was recommended to me by a visitor to my web site who had a good experience there. 
        
nerd 
                world: books

barnes and noble - they have great free classes available. you just buy the books and hit the books.
    

bookpool.com - discount technical books

borders

how could you forget amazon.com


here are some services that search for new and used books:

 cheapbooks -
    find the best book price by searching more than 100 bookstores worldwide
    in just a matter of seconds. their service is totally independent, comprehensive
    and fast!
direct textbook -
        the site searches new and used bookstores showing a listing of availability
    and price for around 2 million books at online stores and student book exchanges.

21 north main - was recommended to me by woo-kie. this site lists and directly sells inventory of over 2700 used book stores in north america. it is clean, quick and convenient.
    

advanced book exchange - very cool web site that helps you find out-of-print books
      
      
alibris is affiliated with some 800 booksellers, and has it's own huge warehouse in sparks, nevada.
    

bibliocity searches 951 booksellers.
    

bibliofind searches "thousands
                  of booksellers"
                                        
bookfinder.com may be the best site of them all, especially since it includes bibliofind, bibliocity, advanced book exchange, powell's, and other book sites.
bookprice.com is
      a free innovative service of finding the 
    best price on a purchase of several books together. this service is more
       useful than the standard services which perform one book comparison at
      a 
    time, and can save more money when buying several books together.
campusbooks a  free comparison shopping website for textbooks. they search over two dozen bookstores, including amazon, barnes & noble, ecampus, half.com, textbooks.com, to find the lowest prices in textbooks and it takes only a matter of seconds.

  work

 did you know
      that i do web sites? yes indeed! not as much as i used to but i was the webmaster
      for the pacific exchange, fka pacific stock exchange, for four years. their
      web site looked better then -- not so busy, and more stately. i'm not providing
      a link to it because i have nothing to do with how it looks now. well, perhaps
      some of the internal pages. 


afghans
        for afghans -- my foray into the non-profit world. this is a great
        organization that inspires american (from u.s. and canada) knitters and
        crocheters to make wool afghans, blankets, hats, mittens, socks, sweaters,
        and vests for people in afghanistan. plus they deliver! it feels much
        better to make something tangible with your own hands that you know will
        go to a person to keep them warm than to contribute money that will be
        dispersed
        in an unknown way for who knows what. of course monetary gifts are very
        important but it is much more abstract. go to the site to see photos
        of the kniteers and crocheters, learn about afghanistan and find out
        how you can help! while i would love to take credit for the design, alas,
        it is not mine. i coded the original site and have stayed on as a web
  consultant.
d.l.
        price investigations    -- investigations all over california, specializing
        in workers' compensation, general liability, subrosa/surveillance and aoe/coe
        investigations. for some reason, i couldn't figure out how to put color
    in this site. 
federal
      gym site -- this site is for the department of labor employees' gym in
      san francisco. see how easy it is to put color on a web site? i particularly
      like the wednesday yoga class.
alvarado
              elementary school -- although i did not do the original design,
              i have definitely made it my own. you recognize the lack of color? yup.
        that's me. anything in color, well, it's probably from before my time.
sammy's
                web site -- the colors are all his idea. as is the content.
          actually, all i did was the coding..
other sites: 

redwood
          computer,
          but the site has changed -- it's much slicker now
pacific
        chamber symphony - the design has mostly changed on this one
habitat
                for humanity san francisco -- i just maintained this site before
            it looked so nice. i wanted to build a house but ended up helping on
                the web site
janet bogardus -- it was quite nice when it was my design but i must admit way nicer with the new design, plus i just couldn't finish it. but at least i got her going! 
learntosee.com        i
      did the code for this, not the design



i also did various intranet
    sites, the human resources content area of the cch web site circa 1998 and
    a site for megan levitan when she ran for supervisor in san francisco in
    2000.. 
 food 
 our current book
    and labor of love. vacuum kitty's food book 
  television 

  and we proudly admit it. this was our first book. and if you like tv even half as much as we do, you'll love the tv party web site.

  sleep 
a friend of mine spent a year collecting answers from many people 
  to the following question: what do you prefer, food, sex or sleep? the 
  answer is obvious: whichever of these you get the least quantity or quality. 
  i thought she should add bath or shower to the list. i mean, if you were in 
  prison for five years, once you got out you wouldn't say honey, let's go 
  home so i can take a nap. that's when i realized that shower or bath should 
  be added to the list. i've smelled those guys (ask me about my internship at 
  the aclu), and i know if i 
  was in there, i'd want a nice long hot shower followed by a fresh supply of 
  clean underwear when i got out.a new twist on this whole thing for those of us at vkp is that after having a baby, the most important thing is sleep! i was surprised at how much i think and talk about sleep and poop. well, frankly i wasn't surprised about the poop, but the sleep. wow! my favorite present is getting to take a two hour nap!
  quotes 
 "peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from god." -

my favorite author:

 j.d. salinger. 


i like these other ones too:

  all contributors to television 
  and food - now you can visit two of their web sites: 


¡wunderbar! -- vincen'ts
	    web site
electric linda land
mark humphreys - trough records now you can purchase three of his cds through amazon.com

songs at the moon - my favorite, because it's like a greatest hits album. if you don't own any cds by mark, this is the best lace to start.
angelenos - a must for all people from lala land
leap day  - unfortunately you can't hear a sample of tide pool which is one of mark's most beloved songs.


  kurt 
  vonnegut jr.

 ira levin (i don't have 
    a good link for him yet. let me know if you find one.) 


  sherri 
tepper

  i
        really need to update this section. i haven't added a new author since 1996!

  


my
    very favorites'  start with "r."

other things i like:



  


        our new puppy, toby!
        
our kitty: skeeter
              (who has moved to vacaville) and our riping kitties scout and spike


and our new kitty:
          emily!!!
  my once beloved kitty. this is a picture of her 
            
feather beds 
        

 magenta (the color) 
        

 blenders (vacuum kitty loves all home appliances): the 
                      love blender romance homepage


 vacuum cleaners are very important: stark's 
                        museum of vacuum cleaners.

camping 
            - i prefer backpacking but i can't get anyone else to go! 
            
painting, drawing, and anything where you get to spread around a 
        bunch of colors. 

 movies. 
i really
                                  like the sound 
                                effects in movies. somehow walking in a building never sounds
                                that  good in real life. sound america also has sound clips from lots
                                of great 
                                movies, cartoons and tv shows, including south
                                 park! 
 peanut 
          butter ice cream! my latest favorite. mmmmm. peanut butter.
        






  



speaking of movies, these are some favorites:


 the 
  graduate (no, i'm not stuck in that era.)
casablanca 
    (perhaps an obvious choice, but have you seen it lately?) 
  
everything by woody 
        allen, except september. i even liked alice. 
  

and everything by charlie 
          chaplin.
      
holiday 
      - it has my two favorite actors: cary 
            grant & katharine 
            hepburn, introduced to me by my good friend alison. 
        
favorite late night tv movies: 
          

 go 
                  ask alice although admittedly i haven't seen that one in over 
            ten years. 
diary 
              of a mad housewife ti-naaaaaaaa
back to 
                  the future - i can't believe how many web sites there are related 
            to this movie.

most overrated film, although i suppose it's good: dances with wolves. 
            
 did you notice how i reverted from plural 
                  to singular? 


okay, i'm not a big fan of jeff 
      bridges, but i this his web site is smashing! 


  




 speaking
of movies, these are some of my favorite tv shows:

 the
        west wing -- if
      only he were the  president!
csi -- the original,
        not the spin-offs. but maybe they'll do a csi - bagdad by the bay. 
desperate
            housewives    -- okay; i've never actually seen it. but if it's half as good as i imagine
        . . . wow!
saturday
          night live!
            -- it's gone through years of not being good, but lately, it's been great!
            even though jimmy fallon left :-( and will ferrel too. but tina fey and
            maya rudolph are still there! i also like rachel dratch and horatio sanz.
            it's a great cast.
south
          park -- mentioned above. love it!
the
                  daily show! -- jon stewart makes loves to the camera, which happens
            to be me and every other person watching his show. that dog!
the colbert report 
the
                    history channel
                  -- i love lots of shows on this station, like ufo files, modern marvels,
                  and command decisions. i think. if that's the one where they ask you what
                  you would do then give you some choices. of course, they don't give you
                  enough background information to be able to intelligently answer the questions.
  still. it's fun.

discovery
                  channel    --
                      i love the myth busters, fbi files and the real detectives. i don't like
                      those motorcycle shows.

the

              it for fun, mind you; it's a wonderful reference.
