testimonials 



 










as a 3rd generation dog groomer a lot of different products have been used as far back as the 60’s to modern day. and the double k ultimate® shampoo and the solution™ conditioner are by far the best yet. it really did give roxy more volume to her coat, as well as luster. my customers even noticed a difference without telling them i switched shampoos. i normally use bark 2 basics and was ready to place my order and decided to put it on hold. so if you would have a representative call me i would like to place my yearly supply of shampoos and conditioners with double k.

						we were hooked on grimeinator® after the first shampoo! i recently opened a new shop and have been looking for a shampoo that did what the ad said. i saw your ad for grimeinator® in groomer to groomer magazine and called to inquire about the free samples. what a wonderful product! the smell was wonderful and the dog's coats look great.

						wow!! what a difference emerald black shampoo makes! i groomed my standard poodle today and bathed her in the emerald black® shampoo. wow!! what a difference!! her hair looks like crushed black velvet!! and the smell, ahhhh... her hair is so soft, and beautiful, that you don't realize how short i trimmed her. i didn't realize also how dull looking her hair had become. the emerald black® seemed to rejuvenate it. thanks for recommending it. 






the cutting edge 






						i recently used double k's grimeinator® deep cleaning and conditioning shampoo here in my grooming shop. i was amazed at the quality of this product! it not only smelled pleasant, it made even my dirtiest clients "squeaky clean"! my customers were very happy...and that makes me very happy! thanks double k!
