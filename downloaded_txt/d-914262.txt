support daly mansion: restore history and water lines! 



discover the past while shaping the future at the daly mansion. our century-old water line, crucial to the mansion’s operations, urgently needs replacing. we’ve secured a significant part of the funding through a $100,000 montana historical preservation grant, but your support is crucial. help us raise $20,000 to match this grant, ensuring not only a renewed water supply but also the continued restoration of the mansion’s historic third floor. every contribution makes a difference. donate today and become a part of this vital preservation effort. 



act today and be a cornerstone in conserving our heritage!
