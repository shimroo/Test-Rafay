faire le pont 



for the love of wine, food, & community 






















welcome to faire le pont 



wine food, events 



we are much more than just a first class winery.  our restaurant is the perfect place for that special occasion or to meet friends and enjoy an outstanding dinner with great company.  we are also a place where you can kick-back, enjoy a wonderful glass of wine and some of wenatchee’s great sunshine.  our outdoor deck and seating areas are so inviting!  on cold or rainy days, enjoy a glass of wine by our warm see—through fireplace. 











 







attenton to detail 



our wine making is second to none 



we produce world class, ultra-premium wines from locally grown grapes. production levels are between 3,500 to 5,000 cases of wine per year. our grapes come from the nearby yakima valley, alderdale, mattawa, and red mountain where we work hand-in-hand with premium growers to insure we get only the very best grapes. we source by site and row. all fruit is hand picked and sorted. we use the gentlest possible process to ensure maximum extraction in the production of our wine.
