denver boulder couriers has definitely been one of the most important and happiest parts of my christmas preparation this year!  thank you to chris for not even batting an eyelash when i started our conversation with “i have an unusual request”.
and by the time i texted my sister-in-law that your courier was 20 minutes away, she had received it.
