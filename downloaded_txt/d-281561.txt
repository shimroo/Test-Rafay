  we don't just sell 'em, we make 'em
customers come to us for many reasons. sometimes it's out of
necessity because they have a broken seat belt or their dog
chewed the seat belt webbing. any way you come to us, we're
happy to help. as a true seat belt manufacturer, we know exactly
how to make your seat belts to meet and exceed all applicable
us regulations.
when we reweb or refurbish your seat belts, we
use all the same thread, machines, and components we'd use to
make brand new seat belts. as the manufacturer, we can build
to your exact specifications and build them quickly. you can put
your trust in our products.
