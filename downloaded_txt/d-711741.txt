 aquaman triathlon is the official wetsuit partner of triathlon canada offers members significant discounts on wetsuits including cell gold, dna, and bionik, accessories like our signature duffle bag, floats, water socks, and hoods. best neoprene wetsuits for men, women, unisex triathletes and open water swimmers with maximum speed, flexibility, comfort, warmth, scs for buoyancy and hydrodynamics. the gold cell is a high end model with high performance capability that will keep you warmer. this model is made with the metal cell technology with neoprene on the outside and inside, treated with scs to make it very slick when in direct contact with the skin and the water. the end result is that the neoprene stays very close to the skin and allows virtually no water into the suit. thereby, your body has to heat less water, keeping you warmer. the suit is made with two layers of giga #40 from yamamoto giving it a very good quality/price ratio. this model is a perfect suit for a triathlete who is looking for performance and warmth. you will love the flexibility, comfort, lightweight feel, fast removal, and warmth in cold water . the shoulders of the cell gold are made of giga #40 to allow maximum flexibility for totally free movement. the forearms have the “aero design propeller” to provide a better catch of the water during the pulling phase of the stroke. the collar, made of giga #40 has a new “revolving collar” which positions the front of the collar forward by 20 degrees and is 2cm lower allowing for more comfort and reducing the entry of water through the collar area. the bionik offers triathletes a wetsuit of the highest quality with a reasonable price tag. this wetsuit has a classic concept, meaning textile on the inside, and the outside made of the japanese neoprene yamamoto #39, with an scs coating also covering the entire outside. the neck, shoulders, and arms are yamamoto giga #40 neoprene. no other wetsuit on the market offers this combination of neoprene for the price! the shoulders are also extremely flexible and allow for excellent range of motion. the forearms have the “aero design propeller” to provide a better catch of the water during the pulling phase of the stroke. bigger velcro behind the neck for easier closure. hips roll control – aquaman has added a panel of rubber dome to the hips to help flotation and balance when you are on your side. dna is constructed of yamamoto #39 with a number of aquaman technical innovations. the suit is made with 17 panels to give a snug cut. the torso is made with #39 yamamoto treated with scs and smoothskin neoprene on the upper legs, rear, and back. the shoulders are made with #39 neoprene and the ultraflex textile on the inside provides great flexibility. the forearms have the “aero design propeller” to provide a better catch of the water during the pulling phase of the stroke. hip roll control – helps with hip stabilization with a panel of compressed dome rubberfrom yamamoto. swimming and triathlon wetsuit made with yamamoto neoprene with scs coating at strategic points for optimum comfort and a real swimming aid yamamoto 39 neoprene is a must in wetsuits: it ensures flexibility, lightness and slickness in the water. yamamoto 39 is an eco-friendly neoprene made from limestone rather than petrochemicals. blind - stitch - glued thermotape the job of a wetsuit is to let in a little water as possible! the bonded/stitched assembly of the neoprene panels guarantees 100% watertight seams. this is also the most effective and the most robust assembly technique. flex zip - it is vital that the back zip should be as supple as possible, because performance is impaired by discomfort. our exclusive aquaman flex zip technology offer swimmers unmatched comfort by freeing the arm completely and extending the reach as far as possible. back flexion is enhanced by more than 12% and arm reach increased by at least 7 cm. flash system - the flash system performs several functions: first, the collar is 3 cm high at the back to protect the neck. the flap that protects the two velcro fasteners is designed to eliminate any risk of neck rash. the flask system opens as part of the movement of the quick transition zip and thus also helps in taking off the wetsuit.
