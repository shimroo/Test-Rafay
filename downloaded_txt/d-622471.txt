lazair
      - 25 years now and still going after dale kramer and peter corley started
      to build the lazair ultralight. 
the
      lazair has become to pilot and builders one of the safest ultralights ever
      built 
and
      a track record to prove it. the integrity of the lazair ultralight is far
      superb from many ultralights of it's era and possibly one of  
the
      best still around today.  there are still many  lazair
      microlights flying all over the world  and plenty sitting idle in
      barns 
and
      hangars waiting for ultralight pilots and builders  to find them.
      there are a few of us that have been around since the early 
days
      of the lazair and still very active. with a plentitude of knowledge, all
      of us lazair pilots and builders should be able to 
use
      our tips to help one another .  a message forum is set up here forum
       to help each other share among
the
      pilot and builders  tips for all lazair series.  mix together
      tedlar, dacron, 2024, 6061, a couple of rotax  185
 and
      some work make the  lazair  a true  delight to fly and you
      part 
of
      the classic lazair twin era making you feel like a true pioneer of flight. 
a 
      lazair  forum  on yahoo  
      has been started and there isa real sweet forumn at the official lazair site here .
a
      special thank you to all that have shared the info on the various aviation
      sites that pertain to  the lazair and the ones 
who
      have sent in help and files to us.  hopefully we can collaborate
      together to provide a superb collection of lazair information . 
if
      anyone has further info they want to share or have hosted here (ie files,
      photos etc )  please drop us a note.
