message from our superintendent

it’s that time of year when people have to scrape ice off their windshields, shovel snow out of their driveway and endure slick roads before they can even make it down the street for a cup of coffee. at least that’s what i hear from people who moved here from other parts of the country but for us, it’s the best time to get outside and do something fun.
