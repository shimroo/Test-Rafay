honored studio



this summer we had the honor to take 175 of our competition kids to one of the biggest dance competitions in the country! at this event the kids had the opportunity to not only take class with some of the best teachers in the industry, but they were able to be a part of staged pieces by the faculty, be on set and be featured in a nike ad, and most importantly compete for the national title! being such a big event, to qualify for the big grand prize of honored studio you must have dances in the categories of ballet, tap, jazz, contemporary, and hip hop in the 12 & under and 13 & over categories, but qualifying is only half the climb. from there the dances compete and then out of all the studios, the top 5 are selected to recompete and perform in the honored studio competition where some of the most incredible dancing and artistry is shown. finally it is at the last night of the event where the gala is held and the big announcement is made where we gratefully accepted the title of honored studio of the year
