                      our newest msr and lcr actuators squeeze into tight spaces.


for precision instrument builders who need smooth motion package, the msr is a linear
					   positioner that provides sub-micron level precision. these positioners are ideal for variety
					   of applications ranging from imaging systems in digital pathology equipment, to metrology
					   instruments in semiconductor or electronics manufacturing.

                       the lcr positioners are ideal for oem instrument manufacturers looking to maximize roi yet retain the
					   simplicity of an off-the-shelf solution. a complete package with motor and drive, bearings, seals and sensors
					   offered with multiple drive train options and variable lengths and cross sections.

                      parker introduces ethercat servo functionality!

parker's p series and psd servo drives now
                       offer ethercat motion-bus compatibility.  ethercat is an
                       open, real-time network operating over fast ethernet at 100
                       mbit.  parker's drives implement ethercat as a controlled node using the standard can over 
					   ethercat ds402 object library.
						
                       the new p series are compact, support motors with low cost absolute biss-c, incremental
					   encoder or resolver servos and are 240/400/480vac. see for yourself how applications in tube
					   bending, pharmaceutical automation, life science and food and beverage have benefitted from ethercat.

                      stealth gen ii. so much more than just a
                    planetary gearhead.

the stealth
                      generation ii planetary gearheads incorporate
                      design enhancements to provide superior
                      performance for the most demanding
                      high-performance applications. the gen ii
                      family provides higher radial loads and
                      increased service life for improved
                      performance. helical planetary gearing
                      provides high torque and low backlash.
                      universal mounting kits allow for faster
                      delivery times and simplified mounting. the
                      best part, all of our gearheads are proudly
                      manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility
                      in the usa.

                      shatter the thrust force and life
                    barrier with the new eth cylinder!

parker has completely
                      re-engineered the et cylinder into a
                      next-generation ball screw actuator product
                      that delivers equivalent thrust forces and
                      life to that of a similar-sized roller screw
                      product. up to five times the force and ten
                      times the life of it's predecessor!
