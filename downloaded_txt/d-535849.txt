established in august of 1996, we believe this 
				to be the oldest elkhound rescue page on the internet. it arose from the 
				common desires of group of people with one common goal: to find caring, 
				loving homes for norwegian elkhounds and elkhound mixes, in both the 
				united states and canada.  eventually these desires and goal became the 
				foundation of a rescue organization called the john nelsen moosedog 
				rescue fund. 

if you cannot adopt a needy elkhound now, 
but would like to help with our efforts, you can make a donation to:
 john nelsen 
																moosedog rescue 
																fund
																p.o. box 65
																mendenhall, pa 
																19357
																or
																via paypal

your donations and gifts are tax deductible. 
we have received our determination letter from the irs and are classified as a 
tax exempt organization described in section 501c3.
if you wish to refer a needy dog to us, please use 
the submit for adoption form to provide as much 
information as possible.  we are a national rescue and need information on 
the location of the dog as well as the legal owner or responsible party.
