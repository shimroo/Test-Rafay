deemed the “best houston golf value”



always known to be one of the best houston golfing secrets, the oakhurst golf club continues to be near the top of the list for houston golfers. our houston golf course is located just north of downtown on highway 59. for those of you who remember our past, we originally opened as bentwood country club in 1994, but during our $1.5 million renovation in 2004, we became the oakhurst golf club. today our clubhouse looks as immaculate as ever and our course continues to be manicured to the highest of standards.
we feature 18-holes and 7,002 yards from the championship tees which meander among towering pines and mature hardwoods native to the area. designed by dave marr and jay riviere, this houston golf course presents a formidable but not overwhelming challenge. you get to golf a balance of straightaways and doglegs with each offering wide fairways and challenging approaches. the greens are massive, averaging 7500 square feet, and they are well manicured and consistent.
