the artists
the stuart collection commissions work by noted contemporary artists from around the globe who think in interesting ways.  when an artist is identified, they are invited to the university to explore the campus and imagine where their work could come to life. many of the individuals who have designed works for the collection are associated with movements or attitudes that are seldom represented in public sculpture collections, from robert irwin to kiki smith and mark bradford.

kahnop · to tell a story
the stuart collection’s newest addition has been likened to an “ocean of words.” the 800-foot-long pathway created by ann hamilton features 1,300 quotes from an estimated 300 sources connected to uc san diego. some words are raised like a rubber stamp, while others are engraved into the basalt stones. the work also includes a feminist poem called "yeechesh cha’alk" ("a woman’s heart"), written by two of the university’s scholars, dr. alexandria hunter and eva trujillo, to honor the regional history of the kumeyaay nation.
