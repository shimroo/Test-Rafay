new chapters…making two national television series, dozens of recordings, and touring around north america were some of the most wonderful years of our lives. it was, as they say, a very good run!in 2020 we decided to turn the page and give more time to other interests that had taken a back seat to a demanding concert and recording career as “judy & david.” we’re still both dedicated to the lifelong pursuit of communal song – and still dedicated to each other and our three great kids (who are, of course, no longer kids)!judy is now cantor judy adelman gershon, leading music at temple emanu-el in toronto as their cantor and composer in residence. judy is also the founder and artistic director of the toronto jewish chorus and the co-founder (with david) of education arts canada.david divides his time between being the chair of education arts canada and the musical director of the danforth jewish circle in toronto, among other pursuits.we continue to create music for kids, mostly in the form of musicals that tour with education arts canada. eac is a leader in touring educational musical theatre in canada. if you’re interested in treating the kids in your school (especially in ontario) to any of these shows, have a look at educationarts.ca and drop a line to our great team!when not making music, we’re happily spending time with friends, family, and our poodle, zoe. thanks to all the judy & david fans who continue to reach out to us – many of whom are now grown and using our music with their own kids.enjoy our music on youtube here.we’re also on spotify and many other streaming services.thanks for stopping by and, as we always said, “keep on singing!”yours,
