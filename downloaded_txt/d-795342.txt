how to implement an erp software without failing

				november 4, 2016			


one of the goals of every organization is to have a system where information can be retrieved in the shortest period of time. but what do you do when the information you require from your central database isn’t easily accessible? what do you do when your current system can no longer support your business needs?
transition from one stage to another isn’t always easy. itâs just like an emergency relocation to another city with all your properties; sometimes, your important things get damaged. but if you have done careful preparation, all your items have the tendency of being safe. it is the same for an organization that wants to implement a new enterprise response planning (erp) software such as one from msc consulting.
the success of this implementation lies in its preparation or planning in moving from the old to new system. the implementation of the software requires changes in the current system and depends on a number of factors such as: the size of the organization, the budget of the organization, the number of modules required, and the time frame of the change process. no matter the factor, we got you covered in this article because a well designed implementation plan is the key to success.
consultation or selection of team: some organizations prefer to source for consultants to carry out the responsibility of studying the current system and designing what the new system should be like. because of low budget, some organizations select their own team which may comprise staff from different departments. one of the reasons for implementing a new erp software in an organization is because the current system has limitations or has become outdated and gets difficult when it is being used. knowing when to make an implementation is vital. the team must answer questions such as: is the cost of maintaining the old system higher? is the software outdated? is it faster to do work manually when compared to the system? lack of understanding of what is required will lead to the failure of the implementation.
software vendor selection: looking for the right erp vendor is vital and this will be based on the report of the consultant or team. since each erp software has its uniqueness , you have to choose the one which will perfectly solve the problem at hand. in choosing a vendor, you must check their records and years of experience, not forgetting reviews from other clients. the vendor should provide at least three clients they have worked with so as to be sure they have the ability to perform the implementation.
implementation: this begins when there has been an agreement between the organization and the software vendor. implementation should be in phases, to ensure smooth transition. the implementation comes with a lot of changes, therefore the organization must be in pace with that change.
training: after implementation, there should be a training session with the team members of the project or those who will be in charge of the system. training should not only be documented, but must be a physical practical session for those involved. learning to operate a new system takes time, therefore enough time should be allocated to it to ensure smooth operation. there should be an operational support group which will be available, in case other employees need to be taught.



common mistakes while implementing itil solutions in your organization

				july 16, 2016			

being certified in itil will allow you to integrate a number of operational improvements in your organization. but it does not always go according to plan. the desire to show your enthusiasm and apply what you have learned can backfire if you do not do so carefully. 
take a look at 4 of the most common mistakes you can make when applying itil knowledge in your organization.
1. assuming itil is the solution to all your problems
itil is not a magic wand which will solve all your problems once you have a certificate for it. it is merely a set of guidelines and best practices in it service management which allow you to tackle these problems effectively. you could implement the best solution after a lot of consideration and it could still fail. no matter how highly certified you are, the implementation of itil practices differs from one organization to another. the results are also vastly different based on the follow through.
2. forming new teams
itil is a practice which has to be included in your day-to-day activities. anyone can be a part of the process. but a lot of times, you end up forming a new team to implement itil. there is absolutely no need for a new team because you can include employees who are smart and willing to learn, not necessarily trained in itil, to implement solutions. if you do form a team, ensure the people you select are able to fit into roles such as project managers, owners, stakeholders etc.
3. not assessing risks
when you are implementing a change in your process, it is necessary to assess the amount of risk involved. you should always ensure there is a backup in case the proposed solution fails. consult enterprise managers and senior management to have a level of accountability where the change has a greater risk. failure to do so can lead to a breakdown in productivity and impact the business negatively. 
4. integrating itil in every single process

once you have learned the importance of itil and its advantages, you may be tempted to implement it in each and every process. this is not necessary because some processes may already be successful and do not need any additional interventions. before implementing solutions analyze where itil can be used and apply it there effectively. 
there are a number of service providers who specialize in training and providing itil certification in singapore. millions of certified professionals all over the world already use it successfully in their organizations. by improving customer satisfaction, communication, and reducing costs, itil offers many benefits, but only if it is applied properly.
