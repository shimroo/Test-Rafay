bicycle access council



our mission 
the  bicycle access council  was a non-profit (501c3  23-3083804) advocacy organization that serves as a forum for pennsylvania bicyclists and as an ombudsman for bicycling issues.
it was the objective of the  bicycle access council  to make bicycling on roads throughout the commonwealth safe, respectable and a transportation choice by educating its membersand the motoring public.
the bicycle access council is no longer active and does not accept donations or memberships.  this site is the continued legacy and resource for pennsylvania bicyclists.
