are written in small, well-illustrated, easily understood segments with several questions at the end of each segment to test understanding. answers to the questions are provided on separate answer sheets and can be used by the trainee for either immediate feedback or held by the instructor for later review. information is highlighted in supplemental margin notes. special typefaces and arrows draw the trainee's attention to especially important information and clarifying comments. key information is further reinforced in the segment questions to ensure understanding before moving on to new material.at the end of each course book is a set of review questions which allow the trainee to test their understanding and review the content. the answers to these questions are included in the answer sheets that come with the course. there is also a separate completion exercise for verifying the trainee's understanding of the course material. answers to the completion exercise are included in an administrator's guide with is part of the package.these courses also include a demonstration exercise for evaluating the trainee's mastery of the content in the workplace.this training format is being used effectively in both the classroom and in self-study environments. a number of apprenticeship programs and community colleges are using these programs for classroom instruction. industrial plants most often use them as self-study modules.



   do you offer self-study courses?

  




  our training materials are written in a format called "programmed instruction". each page is divided into 5 sections, called "frames", which contain instructional information. the trainee must provide a written response in a provided box and the correct answer is provided for reference, initially covered by an "answer mask". if the trainee's response is correct, they proceed to the next frame. if not, they are encouraged to review previous frames for more context before trying again. this format is designed for a high rate of success and provides a five-step learning process, which is repeated 5 times per page.
