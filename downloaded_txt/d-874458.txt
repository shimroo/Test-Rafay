get funky






growing up in the 70s, it was the time to express yourself and start expressing your soul. everyone was dancing in new and exciting ways and the music started popping.
i remember the parties and gigs from legends of soul and funk that would perform every weekend. if i could go back to that time i would. take me back to the time that was good for your soul!

















this blog






now you may be thinking how is an old-timer like me making such a vibrant blog on the internet, well i have a secret weapon which is my granddaughter eliza.  she kept listening to me go on and on about the old days of funk and soul and how youngsters should get involved with this decade and she said well why not start a blog and here i am! she does all the designing and i do the writing and now i am as happy as can be.
this blog has really brought a new lease of life into my soul after my wife passed away a year ago and i am excited to share my thoughts on music, art, and photography with anyone who is interested.

4 ways that photographers see things





































art comes in many different forms, from drawings to paintings, to sculptures. it can be found displayed in people’s homes, in art galleries, down high streets, and in fields.









professional photographers will consider lots of different things that many of us have not even thought about before pressing the shutter button of our camera.









a sculpture can be defined as a three-dimensional representation of something or someone, either in realistic or abstract form, which is typically carved from stone, marble, bronze, plaster, or wood.

pure soul






one of my favorite songs from the decade and although it's old it never gets old. i will forever remember the first time i heard this song.
i was hanging out with my friends and i could hear it playing from some guy's car stereo. we just stopped and started dancing right there in the street. the sound took us and we felt the power of soul right then and there.
give it a listen and see what you think!
