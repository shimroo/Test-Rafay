dillard, ga has been nestled in the blue ridge mountains since being settled in 1794 by captain john dillard. nearly 100 years later, the postal service officially named the town after its founder. the railroad connected dillard in 1907, allowing the outside world to come enjoy the booming mountain town. a few good decades went by, and then the depression hit. like much of the nation,
dillard was strongly affected. captain dillard’s great-grandson, arthur dillard, ended up losing the general store. times were hard. after wwii the town bounced back in a big way. a boarding house and restaurant, the dillard house, was renovated and quickly became a popular destination for well-to-do atlantans. the then president of coca-cola, robert woodruff, was among
the many that fell for the blue ridge charm of the town. the dillard house is still here and the town still carries on the tradition of southern hospitality. whether you’re just looking for a relaxing stay and a good meal, or to get out in nature with scenic hiking trails and white water rafting, dillard is here for you. come stay a while!
