* note: the published medical research has linked igg-mediated food intolerance and food allergy to over 118 chronic & "nagging" ill-health conditions.  click here to review a sampling of the peer-reviewed, clinical research, which has been published over the course of the past many decades in the world's most recognized medical journals.
are "healthy foods" the cause of your poor health?  

			our finger-stick igg elisa food intolerance screening is a patient friendly method for detecting igg-mediated (delayed) food allergy without the need for a full blood draw!

			many companies require an individual to obtain an ordering physician to prescribe their testing and they rely upon a blood draw being performed by a licensed medical professional.  this is not the case with our igg elisa food intolerance test! 

accurate, cost-effective & extremely convenient

			a simple "pin-prick" to the end of the finger allows the necessary amount of blood required to perform our igg elisa food intolerance test.  because of this unique benefit, you are able to save time and money by not having to have a blood draw in order to learn what foods are the cause of your ill-health.
