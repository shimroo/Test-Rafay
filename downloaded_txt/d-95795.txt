philosophical work in the department of logic and philosophy of science tends to be
                     strongly integrated with the natural and social sciences and with mathematics.





 faculty and student explore issues in general philosophy of science and meta-philosophy,
                     as well as more specialized studies in five research groups:
 

history of philosophy of science

logic and philosophy of mathematics

philosophy of biology and the behavioral sciences

philosophy of physics

probability, induction, and formal epistemology

 


 
lps enjoys strong cooperative relations with uci's department of philosophy; in particular, the two units jointly administer a single graduate program leading
                     to the ph.d. in philosophy. learn more . . . •
