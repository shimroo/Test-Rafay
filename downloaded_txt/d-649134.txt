the mountain state railroad & logging historical association’s
directors voted to dissolve the organization in november 2023. the
association's assets are being transferred to the friends of cass, a
new 501(c)(3) corporation that is dedicated to supporting the cass
scenic railroad state park and to msr&lha’s mission of collecting,
preserving, and publishing information about west virginia’s historic
lumbering and railroad operations. you can visit the  friends of
cass website at  https://friendsofcass.org/.

questions 




the
climax locomotive restoration project


 
the association's involvement in the project to restore the cass scenic
railroad state park's climax steam locomotive ended in december,
2015.
the new operator responsible for the park's railroad operation and
maintenance, the durbin and greenbrier valley railroad, informed the
association that its assistance in the project was no longer
needed. 
the association began the massive restoration project in 2002 and it
was estimated to be approximately 80% complete. the remaining work on the locomotive was completed by dgvr
personnel.


the climax had its inaugural run during a dgvr railfan event on
september 7, 2019. some work remained to be done, but the locomotive
was able to pull two loaded log cars on the recently rebuilt line along
the greenbrier river north of cass.  click here
to see a youtube video of the restored locomotive in action.

much of the
association's focus is on the cass scenic railroad state
park because of the park's collection of geared locomotives and its
link to the lumber and logging railroad industries. the links

barnhart log loaders: john a. taubeneck has created an extensive list of barnhart log loaders. these small
360-degree swing cranes were built by the marion steam
shovel company of marion, ohio, and were used in logging operations
throughout the country. the list can be downloaded as a 145kb pdf
file here. mr. taubeneck
is very interested in any additions or corrections to the list. his
contact information is in the file.
list of west virginia's logging railroads: the late
max robin was one of the primary researchers into the history of west
virginia's logging railroads and he produced a list of west virginia's
logging railroads. his list was last updated in 2005 and was a work in
progress. max died in 2021 following several years of declining health.
the list is obviously incomplete, may be the most comprehensive list of
west virginia logging railroad information available. it is hoped that
future researchers will be able to fill in some of the many blanks. the
list can be downloaded as a excel file here and a pdf file here.
