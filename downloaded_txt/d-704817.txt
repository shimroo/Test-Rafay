jessica & edward le take franchising to next level.in 2014, they teamed up with noted franchisor, john leonesio, to take the concept to the next level. “we wanted to grow quickly with the right systems in place from the onset and as john had done with massage envy and the joint …the chiropractic place, we knew he would be able to assist us,” says edward. in 2012, admark began the rebrand of amazing lash studio.  we started by redesigning the logo and moved on to the corporate id and print collatoral.  once the new look was established, we redesigned the website and launched it together with the new corporate intranet which runs on the nebhub franchise management platform.to date, 602 regional developer licenses have been sold and over 258 franchises in 27 states.
