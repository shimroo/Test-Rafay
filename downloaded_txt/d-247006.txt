                    travel brochure. in today's era of exotic travel destinations, it's hard to imagine a private transportation system devoting the effort and expense to promote a state park. yet that's exactly what this1928  brochure from the buffalo, rochester & pittsburgh railway represents. the brochure beckons people to visit the allegany state park in the state of new york  for activities like camping, fishing, and relaxation. presumably the railroad hoped park visitors would travel there by train, since br&p rails ran close to the park in the vicinity of salamanca, ny. allegany state park still exists as do the ex-br&p rails, but you can't take a passenger train there anymore. click on the image for a larger version. see past featured items.
