welcome to arneberg.com! this is my own personal home page.
i've been active on the internet since 1988, starting with email and
newsgroups. i discovered the web in 1994 and have been creating web
pages ever since. i don't do web design for hire; i only create web
pages for myself or for organizations i'm associated with. (good
thing, too, 'cuz i won't win any awards for design! i like to do
'em quick and dirty, and keep them simple and efficient.)

enjoy!
