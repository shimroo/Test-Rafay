blackness is not a monolith














we are cd forumwe elevate black artists and communities by encouraging healing, joy, and radical expression through equitable access, supportive mentorship, and opportunities for sustainable creativity and non-monolithic representation in the arts.led by pioneering black women, femmes, and nonbinary folks, we drive towards a future where intersectional identities shape every facet of the arts sector. through exhibitions, performances, workshops, and more, we foster creativity, enrich cultural dialogue, and promote artistic and economic empowerment.
