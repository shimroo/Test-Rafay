about blue star 



our legacy of innovation and excellence  



blue star sports apparel is more than a brand – we’re a legacy of innovation and commitment to excellence. as a second-generation, woman-owned michigan company, we have been at the forefront of sportswear for schools and organizations since 1982. 
our journey began with pioneering american-made custom warm-ups and introducing our own line of uniforms. we continued to redefine the industry by launching the first sublimated uniforms for high school teams.
