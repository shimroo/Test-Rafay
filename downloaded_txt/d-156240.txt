      sending my most heartfelt and sincere condolences to the friends,  families,  and coworkers of the victims who so tragically lost their lives on that fateful day. that day unfortunately left a massive mark in the memories of all americans that day. when it happened i was in kindergarten so i didn't and couldn't grasp the magnitude of this act of evil, but know, as a 28 year old man i appreciate and respect the sacrifices that were made that day from the first responders to go in to the burning buildings and to save as many people as they could. with that being said, i would like to send my peace and love to the heavens to the beautiful souls who lives were taken way too soonüïäüïäüôèüôè

      dear souls lost on 9/11,

as i sit down to write this letter, my heart is heavy with the memory of that tragic day. though many years have passed, the pain and sorrow remain fresh in our hearts. even though i was only five years old that day, every time i look at the nyc skyline, i feel that something is missing up there. 

your lives, though cut short, left an indelible mark on the world. you were mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, friends, and colleagues. each of you had dreams, aspirations, and a unique story that was abruptly ended on that fateful day. we honor your memory by striving to live our lives with the same courage and resilience that you showed.

to the families and friends you left behind, we offer our deepest condolences and unwavering support. your loss is unimaginable, and our hearts go out to you. we stand with you in remembrance and solidarity, ensuring that the legacy of your loved ones lives on.

in remembrance,

e. siavoshy

      remembering all those who died on 9/11, they are not forgotten. 
the day is etched in my mind as i had woken in sydney very early on the morning of 12/11 to see on television what was occuring and then going to work at mercer that same morning into our sydney office - it was surreal, and no one really knew what to say or do.

      9/11 started as an ordinary day, but turned out to be the opposite, as so many lives were changed, and our country has also changed since that day. so many lives were lost, but we remember them not because they died, but of what they did right before their lives were cut short. we remember the thousands of acts of bravery presented on this day, so many people sacrificing their lives for other, sacrificing their own lives in the process. we remember and honor those people. god bless.

to a friend on september 11 

to see your face,
to hear your voice,
to share the radiance of your smile,
the spirit of your intellect and wit,
and the nurturing embrace of your caring nature ‚Äì
all these and more abide within a living memory,
a hologram at best,
a ration that by definition must be enough,
though it will never be enough.

the anniversary of your loss,
our loss,
magnified by the many people
for whom your life was a precious gift,
is but one occasion
within a coursing river of days and moments
in which somehow your countenance is etched
and presence felt.

and in that place where yearning dwells
and dreams bear fruit,
you sit beside me in a contemplation
timeless,
wordless,
and magnificent.

hello again, my friend, hello.

      like most of us, i remember exactly where i was that day and what i was doing. in germany, we were far away at the time, but we still felt the pain that all new yorkers and americans felt at the time. and that is still the case today. i often think about september 11, 2001, not just the anniversary. when i started working at marsh, i heard about the terrible loss of the employees at the time. it is unimaginable to me how one deals with such a loss. on a day like today, when all the memories of the deceased are even more present than usual, my thoughts are with you. i am praying for you and your loved ones. best wishes from germany.

      a few years before the attacks i visited marsh new york and met a local colleague. we became good friends and kept in touch regularly.  the day of the attacks i was in my office in antwerp (belgium). my colleagues and i were totally shocked by these events.  i was mostly thinking about my friend/colleague in new york, but luckily she was in the office building on 6th avenue at that moment.  a few years later i returned to new york and the colleague showed me the memorial.  we were both impressed and very moved.  this must never happen again. not in new york and nowhere else in the world.

      this occurred before my time at marsh... i still remember watching this unfold on tv as the office i was working in at the time ground to a halt in disbelief. terrible scenes - indelibly etched on everyone who witnessed it. so incredibly sad for those who lost loved ones. always remembered.

      i wasn't an employee at the time of this tragedy but wanted to share that my son visited the twin towers last year in nyc.  when he heard how many lives were lost just from mma he called me as soon as the tour was over.  needless to say he was very overwhelmed with emotion.  my prayers go out to the families and collegues whose lives were changed forever.

      i was employed in the houston marshmc office preparing to leave for the office, when i saw the plane hit the first building on a morning show followed closely by the second, where we also had offices. it was devastating. over coming weeks, the depth of the horror became more and more clear. for the privacy of the families who had lost loved ones, the names were withheld for a time. i called jimmy's extension over and over, hoping if he didn't answer, his spirit would feel the many people who cared. 

what these people could have accomplished, enjoyed, and created is unquantifiable. 

every september, the first pleasant weather day in texas, is overshadowed by the horror that occurred by the memory that beautiful, yet horrific day.

      when this first happened it was so unbelievable and heartbreaking but i was on the west coast far from this tragedy and didn't know anyone in the towers but now over 20 years later i have become almost obsessed with this tragedy and have watched everything i could find and have gotten to know via the stories a little about who these beautiful souls were. i think the reason this haunts me so is because it could be me or you or any one of us. these were every day people going to work living their lives and then in an instant their whole world is changed forever this goes for the people who perished and for the ones that were left behind. i want to go to the memorial and feel the grief and sorrow close up and then honor these people that died so unnecessarily. even though i didn't know anyone in the towers i feel such a deep sense of loss. i will never forget what happened on sept 11,2001 i pray for healing for all that have been impacted for the families and the friends. i hope they are resting in heaven.

naquela manh√£, perdemos 358 colegas. lembramos deles, de suas fam√≠lias e de todos que morreram naquele dia.

      in the uk i heard on the news on the radio that a plane had hit one of the twin towers in ny.  i had watched a film no long before where a plane hit the empire state building in ny so wondered if this was something similar.  we put the tv on once we got home and were horrified to see the events unfolding in ny.
this is an event that has affected the world and those innocent victims must never be forgotten.  like us they were just ordinary people going about their day to day business.
thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of those lost.

      it is as fresh today as it was 22 years ago when i was on a routine call with the other cio's of the mmc companies when the 1st plane struck the first tower.  i had planned on being in the office of my friend and colleague gary lasko on the 95th floor for that call.  running late, i went to my office in the 50th floor of the south tower to join the call.  that moment is forever etched in my memory as well as the last words of gary who was speaking when the plane hit directly in his office.  the question of "why was i spared" that day is only known to my lord and savior jesus christ.  i am thankful for every day i have breath since 9/11 and only know that god's plan for man and each one of us is perfect.  it is never clear or understood in this life.  trusting in eternity with christ according to his sovereignty and grace is available to all.  i pray that the souls lost on 9/11 knew christ and are in his presence in heaven for all of eternity.  
psalm 18:16-19 
he sent from on high, he took me;
    he drew me out of many waters.
17 
he rescued me from my strong enemy
    and from those who hated me,
    for they were too mighty for me.
18 
they confronted me in the day of my calamity,
    but the lord was my support.
19 
he brought me out into a broad place;
    he rescued me, because he delighted in me.

      on this day, i think about the colleagues and friends we lost and their families. i was working for marsh at 1166 when this happened and my heart immediately sank when i heard the news. the wounds are still fresh and i still remember the smiling faces of those we lost. i will never forget.

      i was only a child when the attacks happened. i remembered watching the first attacks on tv from home. seeing the tears in my mothers face, i knew something was horribly wrong.  after making my way to school, all the teachers were  in silence as we all watched the rest of the horror that unfolded that day. my heart goes out to the mmc employees that lost their lives that day. may the thousands of people who lost their lives that day rest in peace.

      as a new employee, i would like to thank mmc for the sincere and loving attention you ask for all those who have been victims of this tragic event.  
at the time of the attack, i was employed by aon re and like many others saw how the planes flew into the wtc in which 176 aon colleagues also died.  
been in the fortunate circumstance of being able to visit the museum and memorials. this has left a huge impression but also made me even more aware of the importance of remembrance. 
i would therefore like to leave a message to say how much i appreciate mmc paying attention in this way, but at the same time how touched i am by the beautiful and heartwarming reactions from family, friends and colleagues.

      i was working for marsh & mclennan in 2001. on 09/11, i was at an nfpa fire code meeting at underwriters laboratories in oakbrook, il. upon hearing that a plane had hit the wtc, we had a tv brought into the meeting room, and we watched in horror as events unfolded. several committee members worked for companies that had offices at the wtc, and i think most of us knew someone who worked there. 9/11 also hit me hard because i knew the wtc area well. just out of college, i had worked for barclays bank at 120 broadway, in the block next to trinity church. i would typically get off the path train at the wtc and walk the few blocks to barclays. with all flights grounded, i was stuck in oakbrook for 3 days. eventually, i contacted the rental car company to inquire whether i could drive the rental car to portland, and how much it would cost if i did that.  they informed me that they had lost their data center in the wtc. they did not really know where all of their vehicles were, and they were charging just a flat daily rate for anyone who chose to drive home. it took 3 long days to get back to portland. i did not see a single plane in the sky until i passed the summit of the blue mountains in eastern oregon. i did not dare to contact any of the marsh colleagues i knew. as information gradually emerged, i eventually determined that i knew at least 30 people who perished in the towers. i remember all of them every year on the anniversary.

on september 11, 2001, i was working for marsh advantage america which became mercer in later years.  marsh was one of a family of companies, one of which was marsh mclennan. in my fifth year of employment, we were glued to the news that morning, and the emotion turned even darker when we were very quietly told that our corporate accounting department was in the towers, virtually at point of impact.  maybe only a few in our building knew or interacted with anyone in the towers because we were in iowa, but you still felt like an odd family.  i was taken up with emotion, and had to call my mom.  as emotion welled up, i told her "i can't watch", even though there was a small tv in the area.  she said "you don't have to watch".  i stayed at work that day, but i don't think i would have gone to work had it happened before i took the drive. i would have wanted to be with mom, knowing it would hit her hard.  

in memory of the colleagues and consultants employed with marsh mclennan.  i think of them all.

also in memory of the thousands lost, firefighters, first responders, police, service animals, passersby.  

the feeling of common loss never goes away.

      i was pregnant with my first child and working in a small brokerage in scarborough when i heard the devastating news of 9/11. my boss ushered us in a room and led us in prayer for the families who lost their loved ones. that day we were all affected there weren't any dried eyes in that room. it wasn't until i got home that i was able to grasp the magnitude of the loss on tv.

      i will never forget the morning on 9/11; i had just gotten to work and heard about what was going on in new york.  i was heading to the room where everyone was watching this on the tv, and i heard someone said a plane just hit the world trade center, i remember being scared and sad. i thought of the people that were in the office.  thinking of all the people, we lost including my friends and coworkers. all i was thinking about that day was being with my children at home. god bless all the families that lost love ones, friends and our first responders, our nation‚Äôs military and the brave fighters and police officers.

      i remember his words so clearly. ‚Äúthere‚Äôs been an awful accident in new york, a plane has collided with one of the world trade center towers‚Äù. as i talked with my colleague in the uk‚Äôs norwich office that day in 2001, and the second tower was hit, it became clear this was no accident. we were instructed to go home, where i watched in disbelief and sadness as the tragic events unfolded. a previously planned visit to new york with my mum that november went ahead and we wanted to pay our respects to those that lost their lives during those acts of atrocity two months earlier. for me, it was particularly important to pay tribute to the colleagues i sadly never knew but felt inextricably connected to. i will be forever touched by what we found amongst the broken buildings and broken hearts. the collective arms of love, unity, compassion, support, dignity and hope were wrapped around us all; it was a deeply moving and humbling experience. today, 20 years on, a floral tribute lies at the memorial tree planted in our office gardens as thoughts turn, once again, to our lost colleagues and all the bright lights that were extinguished that day. we will never forget.

      veinte a√±os y lo recuerdo como si haya sido ayer. diez de la ma√±ana  sonaba el timbre para el recreo y todas las pantallas de tv de mi colegio mostraban im√°genes en vivo de lo que estaba ocurriendo. por altoparlante transmit√≠an y no pod√≠as creer lo que ve√≠as. 

el skyline de nyc no volver√° a ser el mismo. la vida de muchas personas no volver√° a ser la misma. la ca√≠da de las torres gemelas, un evento que conmocion√≥ el mundo y 20 a√±os despu√©s nos sigue doliendo... 

por mis colegas en mmc, por los miles de personas que perdieron la vida...

siempre en nuestros corazones y pensamientos.

      like others, i have so many memories of the day - alerted to the first plane having hit the first tower a thousand miles away, the conference room television was set up to view the scene, when we saw the second plane hit. the panic followed. the frantic effort to track down friends who may have been there hoping to find them safe, hearing their stories of fear and shock. the horror of events continuing to flow, and wondering what would happen next. the slow realization that so many of our colleagues were officed there, or were in the towers for meetings. the heartbreaking, short biographies of people just like us, doing their jobs as we did, their lives in mid-stream, rolling out as memorials, for us and for their families, in the following weeks, eventually numbing in their effect.  truly, never to be forgotten. we can't forget them.

      i will never forget that terrible morning 20 years ago when i lost 358 colleagues. i watched it unfold live in disbelief from the marsh canada boardroom at the 70 university ave office.

one canadian colleague, our chief information officer, was unfortunate to be visiting our wtc offices for an it project. i attended his memorial service at st. michael's cathedral in toronto a few weeks later to remember him, other colleagues, and other victims of that terrorist event whose lives were lost on september 11, 2001.

the memories of that terrible will be forever etched in my mind.

may they all rest in peace.

i was shocked, numb, and horrified at the tv images that day and every year have remembered those we all lost. may they always rest in peace.

      i remember the day exactly as i had just arrived to work at methodist hospital here in houston texas when my boss stormed in a panic and told me to turn the tv on as he felt we were going to war.  as we watched in horror we heard on the intercom to go on lock down as we didn‚Äôt know the extent of how far this attack would span.  we continued to watch as the second plane hit.  my heart sank. we were all told to evacuate and head home.  
as we drove home i raced to pick up the kids from school, the freeways were flooded and everyone was in a hurry to get to their destination.  once i saw my kids‚Äô faces with confusion about the entire day, i rushed to hug them and felt relief but could not help burst in tears for all those that were not so fortunate.  
to this day, the anniversary of 9/11 has brought tears to my eyes.  new york has a special place in my heart.  god bless those we have lost and those who are still wounded by this tragic event.

      that day i was working at mci (telephone company). they had tv's near the ceilings so we could watch news, while waiting for calls. all of the sudden, i get a call, and the guy asks me, what i thought of what was happening in ny. i didn't know, so looked up, and saw what he meant. around that same time, supervisors started handing out notices that we were not allowed to talk about it. fifteen minutes passed and the calls were coming in. they closed ny phone lines, and people were trying to connect to their loved ones. we were so overwhelmed, that shortly after they sent us home, where i watched the second plane hit.

      it was the beginning of my senior year of high school. sitting in my second period english class, the teacher from the classroom next door barged in, in a panic, saying a plane flew into the world trade center. i wouldn't fully understand the magnitude until i saw it, live on tv, in my next class. 
school was closed shortly after, and while i felt the horror of it all, i still had the guilt filled luxury of being in ohio, safe and far away from the chaos.  
fast forward to 2013, i find myself at marsh, and realizing the intense connection to 9/11 i have inherited. i didn't know anyone that was lost that day, but i do work with colleagues every day that have eerie stories about why they did not find themselves at work that day. the trauma and loss experienced since that day is unfathomable, but the resiliency of the marsh team is admired. thinking of all those lost, and the survivors, on each and every anniversary.

      a day and a terrible event that we will never forgot. 

the queen's message, read by the british ambassador to washington, sir christopher meyer, at the prayer service in st thomas church, new york in september 2001 defined how many of us in great britain were feeling at the time:-

you come together today in st thomas church in new york united in sorrow by the terrible events of last week. each and every one of us has been shocked and numbed by what we have witnessed in these recent days.

but none of us should doubt the resilience and determination of this great and much loved city and its people. men and women from many nations, from many faiths and from many backgrounds were working together in new york city when this unimaginable outrage overtook them all.

at your service today, we think especially of the british victims. for some of them, new york was simply a stopover on some busy travel schedule. for others it was a workplace of excitement and of opportunity. for many it was a familiar second home.

these are dark and harrowing times for families and friends of those who are missing or who suffered in the attack - many of you here today. my thoughts and my prayers are with you all now and in the difficult days ahead.

but nothing that can be said can begin to take away the anguish and the pain of these moments. grief is the price we pay for love.

      september 11th 2001 i'm not sure there is anybody who does not remember exactly where they were on this day. i was in a tower block in central london where with in 10 minutes of turning on the tv we were evacuated as a precaution. it was a sheer panic just to get home and out of the city. weeks later we were taken to the roof to be shown what to do if we needed to be rescued air it was utterly terrifying having to go through the training not knowing if you would ever had to put it into practice. nobody will ever forget that day and my heart goes out to all of our colleagues families and friends who were lost, but no forgotten. if you do get the chance visit the 9/11 museum and memorial its an utterly humbling experience. as you stand around the fountain you will notice how silent it is.

      i was working in america in 2001. as part of my university course i had the chance to come work in rhode island,  my nanna had passed away on the 31st aug and i found it hard to get a flight home to scotland.  i finally found one september 11th from boston.  a couple of days after i had booked i got a call from the airline to say they could get me on a flight on the 10th instead, so i said yes.

the flight home on the 10th september was hard, i had made some of the most amazing friends and i really didn't want to leave them.....  i landed back in scotland and remember walking past a tv, i glanced and saw the first plane crashing..... my heart sank i watched in total shock..... i thanked my lucky stars i got that earlier flight.  

i was at the top of the twins towers on september 9th 2001 by last trip to new york before coming home....  i'll never forget the man in the elevator, the new yorkers who were so friendly and the people i met x

      i was on a plane from london to glasgow that morning, and returned on 12th september to a very different world. such a terrible event but we respond with kindness, hope and determination and will always remember those that did not come home

      for friends, neighbors, mmc and marsh colleagues, my city and my country, so much was lost that day.  innocence and confidence never to be restored.  we pulled together with compassion and determination which served us well.  i will never forget.  i am always reminded, always moved to tears.

      as office head in washington, dc at the time, i vividly remember the picturesque sunrise of 9/11, finishing my routine morning run on the steps of the lincoln memorial thinking to myself "what a fabulous city and country i live in and what a wonderful life i have."  later that morning, my assistant passed me a note during a meeting saying "fyi, plane crashed into world trade center."  i came out to the lobby saw the image now burned into memory and ran to my office to call my colleague who insisted that he attend a conference at the trade center in my place that day.  he answered his cell on the ninth ring saying he had just gotten off the path train.  then the rest of the day unfolded as washington also came under attack and colleagues feared for their safety and those of their friends and families in ny and elsewhere.

i knew so many of our lost colleagues personally and wonder to this day how things may have been different for them if only the smallest things had gone differently for them, just as they did for me.  i'm torn with my own emotions of how that day represented the worst possible time for colleagues and yet one of the finest moments of leadership and selfless response of marshmclennan in the "moment that truly mattered most."

life is truly fragile and i've been given a gift of 20 more years than i might have had but for a seemingly insignificant decision.  since that day, and for every day to my last, i celebrate my life and live every day to the fullest.  may you all do the same and may we always remember those less fortunate.

      i was in my 2nd year at mercer and on the west coast, and was awakened by a call from my brother who just said turn on your tv.      i will never forget the horror of the jumpers, "the jumpers".   it's hard to even write that, but our colleagues who died lived that.   having witnessed it live broadcast, you cannot unsee that.    peace.  god bless us all.

      as we approach the 20th anniversary of that horrendous day, and i think back to my personal experiences of 9/11 and find myself going through the losses and fear all over again, in my thoughts. the friends and colleagues who perished continue to be mourned and missed as much or more than they were in 2001. i wear the label "9/11 survivor" with some reluctance, these days, until i think of them. than i remember that even though  i've lived through health issues, and all the other problems one goes through after such an experience, i've done it with the pride and determination my 295 coworkers were denied. i honor them. they are truly my heroes and forever in my heart.

      i remember how clear and crisp the day was. since then every time we have a cool fall or spring day with a beautiful clear sky i cannot help but think of that day.
once the planes hit our building most of our colleagues were glued to the south facing windows- trying to understand what they were seeing, when the second plane came in we understood.
i think everyone who was part of the marsh family at that time has the day etched in our minds.  we cannot forget our colleagues; our memories of their faces, smiles and laughter are forever part of our journey. we miss them all. god bless them.

      around the country, we pause to remember our marsh mclennan colleagues who lost their lives on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, vowing to ‚Äúnever forget.‚Äù 
to reflect is difficult for me, because i was there witnessing every moment of the attacks from a safe distance.  but, we will endure and we will overcome. may their souls continue to rest in eternal peace.

      as a 9/11 survivor, i will never forget that horrific morning 20 years ago when 295 marsh mclennan colleagues innocently went to work and lost their lives in the terrible attacks on the world trade center. 
these remarkable men and women were my coworkers and friends, parents of loved ones; and, above all, marsh mclennan family. i will miss their kind presence, reassuring voices, friendship, passion and support. as we reflect on the 20th anniversary of september 11th, i will continue to pray for them, and they will never be forgotten.

      through sheer terror and ambiguous loss, shattered lives and dreams, paralyzing fear and the darkest depths of grieving, shines the light of love, healing and community. somehow we move forward, together, rudderless at first, and never the same. yet with time our raw pain fades into memories that give us warmth, courage and inspire us. you guide us with the gentlest of hands, the most beautiful of memories and you give us hope. you are our light. 20 years later - we will never forget.
