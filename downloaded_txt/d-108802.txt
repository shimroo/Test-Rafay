hi, we're cvs caremark, and we manage your prescription plan. that means we make sure you have access to affordable medication when and where you need it.

you've probably heard of cvs pharmacy, minuteclinic, or cvs healthhub. the one thing we have in common is we're all part of the cvs health family, and we all work together to help you on your path to better health. let's take a minute to explore your new prescription plan and the digital tools you can use to find out if your medication is covered, what it will cost, and where to fill.
these helpful tools are waiting for you at caremark.com whenever you need them. to find out if your plan covers your medication, use the check drug cost and coverage tool. you'll also be able to see and compare any other options your plan covers, like a generic, and what they will cost.
we know that saving money is more important than ever. our drug savings opportunities tool can help you find savings options personalized just for you. we'll even send an email alert every time a new savings opportunity comes up.
where you get your medication depends on your plan, but you can decide the most convenient way to fill your prescriptions. if prescription delivery is part of your plan, our mail service pharmacy can deliver 90-day supplies of medications you take regularly, and there's no delivery fee. if you'd rather pick up your prescription, there are plenty of pharmacies to choose from. but to avoid overpaying, make sure you fill at a pharmacy in your plan's network. use the find a pharmacy tool to locate one near you.
the cvs caremark mobile app is ready to help you quickly refill a prescription, find a network pharmacy, check drug costs, and much more. we want to make sure you get the most out of your new plan. to learn more, visit caremark.com. we're cvs caremark, and we have your best health at heart.
