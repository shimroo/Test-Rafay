the atomic website will remain online to serve as an archive for the superb articles and breathtaking design of this award-winning magazine, published from 1999 to 2003.


 since we are no longer adding new content to the site, we encourage our readers and fans to visit our new affiliate, retroradar.com, created by former atomic editor leslie rosenberg and her husband, bandleader craig “big t” thompson of big t & the bada-bings. retroradar.com features daily news postings, articles, reviews, a calendar of cool happenings, and a monthly pin-up contest, in which visitors vote for their favorite “vector vixen.”

                                              atomic enewsletter will now also 

                                              be sent via retroradar.com, so you 

                                              can keep up with the latest news 

                                              and information about the fans, 

                                              entertainers and organizations that 

                                              keep the retro movement alive. in 

                                              addition, the atomic discussion 

                                              boards have moved to an exciting 

                                              forum called the 

                                              fedora lounge, so that members 

                                              of our online community can meet 

                                              and mingle with likeminded vintage 

                                              buffs. this swanky venue resembles 

                                              a 1940s men’s club, but ladies 

                                              are welcome, too. it's a place where 

                                              nobody tries to put the bite on 

                                              you. stop on in, pull up a chair, 

                                              order a drink and talk about the 

                                              finer things in life, from cars 

                                              to clothing, music, aircraft, wwii, 

                                              movies and more.

we want to thank all of atomic’s 

                                              readers and fans for your years 

                                              of incredible support and encouragement. 

                                              the hundreds of letters we received 

                                              and fantastic people we met during 

                                              our four years in print were truly 

                                              the best part of our publishing 

                                              venture. we are excited to connect 

                                              you with our new online partners 

                                              and hope you enjoy their sites.
