maui art by artist david miller
contemporary artist david c. miller both epitomizes and transcends his established genre. david is a talent whose approach to beach art is as fresh and airy as the scenes he paints. his brilliantly colored and masterfully composed underwater and seascape paintings are widely collected throughout the world and are highly regarded in fine art circles. his archival quality, hand embellished giclees reproduce his original paintings with breathtaking accuracy. many times, people have commented that they cannot tell the difference between an original and a reproduction.
with his introduction of the window to paradise collection, artist david miller created a genre all his own. this unique body of work depicts various seascape and beach views from the vantage point of looking through an open window. artist david millerâs window beach paintings appear 3-d when hung as a conventional painting. realistically angled shutters appear to create actual dimension within the room and away from the window frame. strategically placed shadows fall on the windowâs frame. shutters create the illusion of a true light source coming from inside the painting. the light and shadow combine to masterfully draw the viewer into the scene. beach and ocean views are represented with swaying palm trees casting shadows on the sand. these merge with the surf and glisten with hand highlights along the breakwater. as the waves withdraw into the ocean, sea foam leaves remnants of the wave's former glory floating atop the water, and obscuring the sand beneath. a tropical wave rises and curls across each painting. each with its distinctive edge glistening in the brilliant sunlight or saturated sunset. as each wave breaks, it mirrors the hues of the sunset. the distinctive horizon line brings definition and separation on the sky and water beneath. david's talent and eye for composition and complementary colors make each window to paradise beach painting a unique conversation piece. this fine art collection brings tropical beauty to any environment and will enhance any room.
