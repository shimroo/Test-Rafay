boat life





those who don’t have a boat won’t understand the amazing benefits a boat can offer. heading out on the water is unlike heading out on the open road. water can go in any direction; whereas, a road will only lead in two directions. water is liberating. there is vast life below the ocean, river and lake’s surface. it is out on the water that a person is truly free to explore and enjoy life. life on a boat offers many rewards. however, life on the boat only works if the boat remains waterproof. the slightest problem should be fixed. immediately seek fiberglass boat repair.





 there are endless ways to enjoy boats. for starters, a boat offers some of the best fishing. smaller fish hang out in grass, other vegetation and underneath piers. however, the larger fish are out in the open water. even though catching larger fish requires a lot of strength and endurance, waiting to catch a fish can be one of the most relaxing times. it’s half the fun. another fun activity to do on a boat is to have a barbeque or a picnic. food, drinks, sun, the breeze and blue all around makes for fun and exciting times. all that is needed is a small barbecue, a cooler and friends and family. lounging on a boat is possibly one of the best things to do in the world. the gentle waves of a river, lake or ocean brings on the most peaceful sleep. life was meant to be enjoyed. enjoy it on a boat.

evolve fishing partners with traditions media
















suffolk, ny - most innovative tackle is hatched from a simple plan to build a better bait. it usually starts on the water with the discovery of some connection between fish-feeding behavior and forage. then it's to the garage, basement or lab where sketches and carvings are made, followed by cad drawings, molds, and prototypes. on-the-water testing reveals further tweaks and, hopefully, in the end a new contender is born.

consider new york-based evolve fishing co., founded in early 2012 by derek carr; a smart, diehard angler who has been designing baits for his own use since he was kid, pond hopping small, bass-filled waters.

"from inception, evolve's goal has been to bring extremely high-quality baits to serious anglers. we're aiming for the level of craftsmanship and design in both our softbait lineup, and pending hardbait line, as you'd see in jdm (japanese domestic market) products. we also try and keep production of key product lines domestic, to maintain top quality standards and support our workforce," says carr.

evolve's dedication to originality and peak performance didn't go unnoticed, either. traditions media staffers were already throwing evolve soft plastics with tremendous success long before there were any business discussions.

"first and foremost, before we even consider representing a brand, the team has to be onboard from a product performance standpoint," says traditions media president noel vick. "the guys said we should talk to them, so we did. and let's just say the relationship quickly evolved."

although a newcomer to the tackle business, carr's evolve has already developed a cult following with discerning anglers across the globe. his first bait, the u.s. manufactured vibragrub, is a soft plastic that defies categorization. a razor thin tail undulates with the slowest retrieve, creating something that draws no comparison in the tackle world.

the best way to describe it is cuttlefish-like. suffice to say, the bait's action is unprecedented and transcends species, drawing strikes from bass to walleyes to redfish, panfish and trout. everywhere there are fish, it catches fish.

but evolve is no one-trick pony. they offer a full complement of soft plastic contenders, including the darkstar swimmer, kompak craw, mad mouse, fluid worm, as well as the nervous walker hollow-body frog.

the brand's evolutionary processes also translate into the soon-to-be-launched soul5 tackle labs subsidiary, which carr says "aims to bring a new level of hardbait design, engineering, and performance at a $7 price point." four models are schedule to launch this month, with more baits anticipated in late 2013 and early 2014.

about evolve fishing co.
evolve fishing co. inc is an independent manufacturer of high-quality soft plastic fishing tackle based in suffolk, ny. its subsidiary, soul5 tackle labs, manufactures and markets premium hard lures for the freshwater fishing market. evolve fishing co. has been serving the fishing tackle retail and wholesale trade since 2012. for more information, visit www.evolvebaits.com or www.soul5tackle.com.

keeping family & fishing in perspective





in the books “the doryman’s reflection” and “swimming in circles,” 
ex-commercial fisherman turned author paul molyneaux tells the sad story
 of the decline of small family owned and operated commercial fishing 
operations, as he experienced it.  in the old days, commercial fishing 
was the realm of small family operations and knowledge was passed down 
from generation to generation.  little by little, these traditional 
fishing businesses were forced out of business by huge operations dubbed
 “factory fishing.”  the traditional fishermen had great knowledge of the
 sea and the fish within.  they would always leave enough of a species, 
so its populations would replenish by the next season.  factory fishing, 
driven by wall street investment and ethics, as well as the need to show
 a quarterly profit, would maximize the number of fish taken without 
letting the population rebound.  small, family owner fishing operations 
declined.

it is reassuring to see that there are still some stores that sell all 
the marine hardware that traditional fishermen have always used.  they 
carry rope, chains, shackles, nets and traps.  you can find everything 
you need for a small shrimping or crabbing operation.  there is still a 
place in the world for small independent fishing operations.

bassmaster elite series pro clark reehm inks deal with evolve fishing





evolve fishing llc., manufacturer of cutting edge artificial lures, 
announces the addition of elite series angler clark reehm to their 2013 
pro staff. reehm will play the role of evolve's key product ambassador 
within the tournament and professional angling community, serving an 
essential function for the small manufacturer.

"we've known clark going on a few years now, and he's always impressed 
us with his passion for the sport and talents as an angler," noted derek
 carr, evolve fishing's president. "we're excited to have clark on 
board, he is an excellent representative of our young, aggressive brand,
 and his ability to put fish in the livewell using our product lines 
will certainly help move evolve forward."

evolve primarily manufactures quality soft plastics, and their 
vibragrub, darkstar swimmer, & madmouse product lines are already 
common tools in tackle bags across the usa. "i met the guys from evolve 
at the classic in shreveport last year when they were just getting 
going. along with some super soft frogs, i saw they were reintroducing 
one of my favorite swimjig trailers that had been discontinued- their 
vibragrub. they gave me a few packages and we've been talking ever 
since," said reehm.

icast 2012 saw several new product releases from evolve. reehm went on 
to comment, "at icast they hooked me up with some of their darkstar swimmers and their mad mouse. i played around with these baits a lot 
during the off-season, and can honestly say that they will be playing a 
role in 7 of the 11 elite series and central opens that i will be 
fishing this year. i look forward to working all of their baits, but 
that little buzzing rat just flat out catches them."

evolve fishing plans on working with clark on color introductions and consumer awareness platforms through the 2013 season.

rapala launches new scatter rap series





there were plenty of rumblings about a new bait coming from rapala as we led up to this year's bassmaster classic.

and this morning with a gusto, rapala released many press releases, videos and some stores have started taking pre-orders.  it appears that these baits will be ready to ship mid-to late march.

the concept of this hew series, are long time producing rapala bodies and profiles paired with a new concept lip design that is designed to make these baits hunt and search on their own.  basically giving you the effect of a bait deflecting off a piece cover without the need for cover.

here is a video of ott defoe reviewing the scatter rap shad, which is a shad rap body with new lip design.


of the 4 new baits:
scatter rap shad
scatter rap crank
scatter rap minnow
scatter rap countdowns

i think it will be interesting to see if mike "ike" iaconelli, brandon palanuik or ott defoe can leverage these into some kind of advantage during this classic, likely it would be the scatter rap shads of the four they are launching!

berkley quitely releases a bunch of new havoc baits





usually there is a lot more noise about when havoc baits hit the shelf, if i wasn't signed up for email newsletters, i would have not heard that about 5 brand new profiles have been released and some new sizes of old favorites.

new baits include: power bait chigger quad, power bait rib snake, havoc the jerk, havoc beat shad and havoc federale worm. new sizes with existing baits include: smaller 3.5" havoc devil spear and a bigger 5" havoc pit boss. give them a look.  



i think i am most interested in the 4" beat shad, rib snake & 5" pit boss, but there are plenty of other cool profiles beyond these that other anglers and bass will love.

interesting if any of these new baits will play a role at the 2013 bassmaster classic on grand lake....

what are the best colors for bass fishing jigs?





i posted about this on my other blog as well, but help me help all of you in determining most popular jig color for flipping jigs.

so please take this survey,
 if it takes more then 60 seconds you are probably over thinking it.  
also, consider emailing, sharing, this blog post and results with your 
fishing friends so we can gather as much data as possible.
 
check back here and on the bassin' blog for full results.  the data could help somebody make better decisions on buying new jigs.  they could either take the data as what is most productive or what most bass have seen and make their own conclusions.

great cross over jacket





finding a good jacket is a task in it self, but one that meets the needs across different facets of your busy lifestyle, that is a mountain of a challenge.  money and space is a premium for most of us, do i really want to buy and store a jacket for work, jacket for shoveling a jacket for cold weather fishing and hunting?  the short answer is no!

i had always admired carharrt's toughness, durability and quality, but for me some of the stylings and stiffness of material were not great for all around use or light enough for a long day in my boat.  but until recently had always passed on making an investment, until i found their new offerings from their quick duck line.  just buying picking this coat up off the rack you can instantly sense this is not your grandfather's carhartt jacket.

i have now had my black woodward traditional quick duck jacket for several weeks.  i have done everything from play in the snow with my kids, sub zero shoveling, to winter fishing to wearing it out to dinner with my wife.

the first few times i wore it outside, i over dressed with my under layers and was too warm while shoveling, i have adjusted to this and now no matter how cold, usually just wear a lightweight long sleeve shirt under my coat.  even the coat is lighter and more pliable then some other carhartts, it still kept 100% of the water and other elements on the outside, even rolling around in the snow and sledding for hours with my kids.

during fishing it was plenty flexible to impeded casting and general movements in the boat, no complaints there!  and when wearing to work or out with the wife, i got compliments on the styling of my coat.

not that i foresee wearing this thing out, but if i did or lost it, i'd be quick to replace it with another on the spot!  you should be able to find this at your normal carhartt dealers, i also noticed it on several websites:
amazon
dick's sporting goods
bass pro
gander mountain and many more

merry christmas!

crossing industries





i recently was doing some internet searching for different products for my boat and for fishing in general.  when i am bored, it is not out of the ordinary for me to just hop around the web on google and other search engines looking for fresh ideas and ways to get a better deal or an edge on my competition.

an angler needs lots of dependable and weather resistant gear, but i kind of got to thinking, so do other people.  what other industries could have some cross over gear that would be well built and serve the needs of anglers as well.  hunting is pretty well parallel to fishing, as many particpants do both sports.

one cool find was a website for tactical clothing and outdoor gear.  their focus is on serving the law enforcement and fire industry. a product range that covers clothing or 
tactical gear, such as 5.11 tactical, surefire flashlights, police 
equipment, benchmade knives, police gear and military gear they need and
 want.

for the most part fishing stuff is not cheap, but is not always as rugged as it could be for years or hard fishing, which makes me think that some of the clothing, flashlights, knives, tools and other gear could be a good fit for a bass anglers' boat. if it is good enough for law enforcement and military needs, it should be good enough to serve for years of dependable fishing.

so what other industries or sports do you borrow gear from for your bass fishing?

fishing in the wind, devil is in the details





before i head out fishing, i always check the marine wind forecast. 
 i do this for several reasons, first and foremost is safety, i do not 
want to get caught in a bad situation, but it also helps me plan my 
day.  often times on big water like mille lacs or winnebago fishing the 
calmer side is the only option.


but also, wind can really position fish and make them bite in 
certain areas and make them bite baits they normally don't chase as 
well.  when it blows, i love to throw crankbaits and spinnberbaits.  i 
am anxious to try several of the new custom ike's ink colors for the rapala dt series.


there are lots of options to find wind forecasts, but 
i've found predictwind.com for fishing weather forecasts seems to be the
 most 
accurate ( more info here --> 
http://www.predictwind.com/what-predictwind-forecast/fishing/ )

in the end, if you plan for the wind, you will be better prepared to catch more and bigger fish!

sneak peak new berkley havoc rocket craw







photo by tom leogrande

not yer for sale, but skeet reese caught most of his fish on a new berkley havoc bait, called the rocket craw.  you can see it here in this picture in skeet reese's hand.

almost looks like a longer, thinner version of the popular chigger craw.  i have not heard word on when it will be available, but i am sure we will know much more between now and icast which is in july.

regardless it does appear to be another fish catching profile from the new havoc line of baits.

what is your favorite havoc bait?

potent worm dye





jj's magic has been a somewhat tightly kept secret by many top  bass anglers, but now it is getting some mainstream steam.  i had heard good things about the product and then i got some custom poured baits that were dunked in their clear formula.  i was instantly impressed with how well the garlic smell stuck to the baits after fishing and being in storage for so long.so i had to get some clear and colored dips of my own.  the brightness and lack of fading compared to other dipping products is second to none.  although, caution: it sticks to your hands as well as soft plastics.  also, be careful not to get salt from your plastics on the closure and threads of bottle, can cause them to seep. if you like garlic on your baits and like customizing soft plastics, give jj's a whirl!  comes in 4 colors & clear.purchase at basstackledepot.com & lbf!
