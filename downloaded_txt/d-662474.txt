										1999 by norman healy, has evolved into a major business
										specialising in scarce books of irish interest.

										catalogues, beautifully illustrated in colour in early
										autumn and each issue contains between 1,200 and 1,500
										items containing numerous scarce and sought after
										rareities.

										works of yeats, heaney, joyce, wilde, beckett, kavanagh,
										flann o'brien and the 1916 heroes, pearse, mcdonagh,
										plunkett and casement. we are also major specialists in
										irish art catalogues, art reference books, including
										pilkington, strickland, crookshank, snoddy, pyle etc and
										books illustrated by jack b. yeats, william orpen, harry
										clarke, john doyle and richard doyle.

										mail order, existing customers are always welcome to our
										hospitable home, by appointment, at lioscarraig,

										libraries and rare individual items and we consistently pay
