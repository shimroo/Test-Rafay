		the industrial refrigeration consortium is a collaborative effort between the university of
		wisconsin-madison and corporations.
		our goal is to improve the safety, efficiency, and productivity of industrial refrigeration systems
		and technologies.
		we realize this goal by conducting applied research, delivering knowledge transfer, and providing
		technical assistance.
		although our efforts are focused on industrial refrigeration systems that utilize anhydrous ammonia,
		we also work with systems that use other refrigerants.
	

		the irc offers a unique combination of complementary resources that include academic qualifications,
		technical expertise, and practical experience. we provide objective information that is not biased
		by an affiliation with any particular organization.
