virtually invisible
architects and designers appreciate the elegant design of our access panels and grilles. concealed hardware and a barely visible seam maintain the aesthetics of the space while providing discreet and functional access. the bauco plus ii can be finished with the same materials as the wall or ceiling, allowing it to disappear into the surroundings, whether paint, wallpaper, tile, or millwork.



fully customizable
of the 60,000+ access panels bauco manufactured last year, more than half of them were customized. sometimes it’s a custom size to accommodate a non-standard framed opening. other times it’s an extra-small, extra-large, or unusually shaped access panel. bauco can provide custom inlays, unique hinging orientation, and hardware configurations, and our paint-ready option will save you time and money. if you have an access panel challenge, call or email to connect. we would love to discuss possible solutions.





factory-direct
as both manufacturer and distributor, bauco supports you and your project from beginning to end. purchase factory-direct for customized solutions, competitive pricing, quick turnarounds, and seamless delivery.
