ann coulter and the juvenile world that she must live in.
 


ann coulter and the juvenile world that she must live in.
 
by 
arick west
thebeatsf@gmail.com
 
it amazes me that ann coulter is still being listen to, and is treated as a person to even be listen to, after she has once again used the middle school tact of calling everyone gay.  she has slipped it to the juvenile act of basically statingâ�¦â��that is so gayâ��, when she feels that there is a need to put down a person of dissatisfaction to her.  her tact is to go to the fag and fagot â��jokeâ��.
 
i am 42 years old and have surpassed the middle school need to call everything and everyone that i donâ��t like gay.  i pride myself on letting people know that i think their action or politics are not in line with reality with out calling them names.  
 
what is her problem?  why are people still even listening to what she has say?  my 14 year old niece and 12 year old nephew know better then to use gay people as a put down you will never hear the â��thatâ��s so gayâ�� statement from them, and they argue when class mates have used that tact.  they know that there are so many better more eloquent whys of insulting people with out being base and vulgar. 
 
as it appears ms coulter must still only have that 6th grade vocabulary that only allows her to say gay, fag and fagot and use the innuendo of being gay a fagot or god forbid queer.
 
do not get me wrong, i am not saying that she does not have the first amendment right to state her point of view and have it listened to or written when she sees fit.  i just feel she needs to grow up and do so with out insulting a large section of the populist.  
 
as a gay mixed race american man i must say that it still amazes me that we tolerate her doing this with gay people, but if she made the same statement using black, asian or any other ethnic group of people, she would be figuratively strung up and not just the 5th article on the second page of the local news paper.
 
please voice your opinion and let the world know that this is not acceptable and the use of any group of people as a put down is just fostering predigest, hate and misnomers, no matter how funny you might think it is.

let's talk transgernder issue gay youth and making the change.
 


transgender is an overarching term applied to a variety of individuals, behaviors, and groups involving tendencies that diverge from the normative gender role (woman or man) commonly, but not always, assigned at birth, as well as the role traditionally held by society.
transgender is the state of one's "gender identity" (self-identification as male, female, both or neither) not matching one's "assigned gender" (identification by others as male or female based on physical/genetic sex).
definitions are set forth below, but the precise definition for transgender remains in flux.
"of, relating to, or designating a person whose identity does not conform unambiguously to conventional notions of male or female gender, but combines or moves between these" (oxford english dictionary, draft entry 2004) 
"people who were assigned a gender, usually at birth and based on their genitals, but who feel that this is a false or incomplete description of themselves." 
"non-identification with, or non-presentation as, the gender one was assigned at birth." 
a transgender individual may have characteristics that are associated with a particular gender, identify elsewhere on the gender continuum, or exist outside of it as "other " or "third gender."
the term transgender was coined in the 1970s by virginia prince in the usa, as a contrast with the term "transsexual," to refer to someone who does not desire surgical intervention to "change sex," and/or who believes that they fall "between" genders, not identifying fully, or strictly, as either male or female. [1](holly. 1991 “the transgender alternative.? tv/ts tapestry journal 59:31-33).
often in older writings (pre ~1990s), but more rarely today, the term transgender is used to refer to those who live as the gender opposite to their birth gender without medical or surgical intervention. in the netherlands, the term is often applied to this specific group.
this group is also sometimes known as "transgenderists" or "non-op transsexual people". (see "transsexual" below.)
more recently, this term has been used to describe anyone who does not strictly adhere to the gender norms of their peers, whether in terms of physiology or choice of fashion. this would include anyone, male or female, who chooses to wear clothing normally worn by the opposite sex.

lesbian teen dies in hate stabbinglesbian youth, in droves, turn out to mourn
by mick meenan
by late afternoon on tuesday, it is already dark under the scaffolded roofing on the corner of sidewalk where sakia gunn and four friends waited in the early morning hours sunday for the bus that the 15-year-old expected would bring her home to her grandmother. 
sakia never made it.
now, two days later, a large, makeshift shrine, constructed between two upright girders, stretches from the sidewalk clear up to the planks of wood above. the shrine is festooned with balloons, and emblazoned with ribbons of the rainbow colors, the insignia of gay and lesbian freedom, and scores of sakiaâ��s friends, classmates, and even passing strangers, most of them adolescent african american lesbians, have etched their names and their good-byes in the cramped spaces on the green oak tag paper taped to the wall.
 
a basketball, autographed by her friends, lies next to bunches of flowers and a ceramic crucifix. the phalanx of candles has been lit and tended to since shortly after hundreds of newarkâ��s lesbian and gay youth learned of the death of their schoolmate and lesbian sister, sakia gunn. 
for residents of hardscrabble neighborhoods, such memorials are ubiquitous. unlike most other memorials, however, this one has been constructed by lesbians, young african american women, nearly all of whom are high school students. some attend west side high school, where sakia was completing her sophomore year. they hail as well from bloomfield tech, columbia, weequahic, and barringer high schools.
valencia bailey, 15, one of sakiaâ��s friends and a fellow west side high school student, accompanied sakia into new york city on saturday night, then back to newark. she was waiting with sakia and her three other friends when a white vehicle with two men in it pulled up to the curb.
valencia described what next transpired.
yo, shorty, come here, one of them said. we told them, no, weâ��re, okay. weâ��re not like that. weâ��re gay.  they kept at it and one of the girls started to give him some lip. 
sakiaâ��s killer emerged from the car. 
shortly before, chantell woodridge,17, another lesbian among the group returning from new york, had just said goodnight to her friends and was walking down market street, when she heard a ruckus behind her.
she quickly returned to find her sister, kahmya, being choked by one of the men.
my sister was foaming at the mouth, chantell recalled. he had her by the neck. he told sakia, come here. she said, no, youâ��re not my father. me and valencia was fighting him. he grabbed sakia by the neck and put a knife there. she started fighting him and got away. she swung once at him. when she tried to swing again, he stabbed her.
sakiaâ��s killer jumped into the white vehicle and it sped away. 
valencia raced to a car that had stopped for a red light.
please, mister, please, i said as i was banging on his window. can you please take us to the hospital?
the young women were acutely aware that sakia was bleeding profusely.
the anonymous good samaritan took all five young women in his car to university hospital, a short distance away. however, sakiaâ��s massive blood loss spelled the impossible for doctors who tried to keep her alive.
she died in my arms in the emergency, said valencia. they rolled her into the back and tried to save her. but they couldnâ��t. 
on tuesday evening, a large contingent of young women congregated and reminisced, switching, as is their adolescent wont, from excited banter to heart-felt sobs, muffled against the shoulders of the young friends who consoled them.
the square of sidewalk concrete still stained by sakia;s blood has been converted into another shrine foot-high votive candles cordoning off the steps of pedestrians. in crayon and chalk, more messages are written.
we love you always, one says. r.i.p.

aa with out the drinks
 


(chicago, illinois)
chicago police are searching for vandals who set
fire to an lgbt book collection in a chicago
library.
about 100 volumes were
destroyed in the blaze at the chicago public library branch in the heavily gay east lakeview neighborhood.
the fire came just over ten
days before chicago
holds its lgbt pride parade and a week after the senate rejected a proposed
constitutional amendment to bar same-sex marriage. as well, this summer chicago will host the gay
games.
"we are disgusted by
this book burning but we are not surprised by it," said rick garcia,
public policy director of equality illinois.
"when the president of
the united states
uses his office to attack gay americans and our families and when anti-gay
extremists continue to spread hate toward gay and lesbian people is it any
wonder that there are attacks on us, our institutions or on books about
us?"
about 10 books in the
african american literature section were also destroyed.
wbbm radio reported that
the fire was set by someone using a cigarette lighter.
police are investigating
but say at this point they are not calling the fire a hate crime.
"this was not only an
attack on the gay community but an attack on every decent, fair-minded
chicagoan," said garcia.
"anti-gay activists
trade on lies about gay people and our families. books and information are the
first things they want to target."
 
(new york city) openly gay singer kevin
aviance was listed in stable condition sunday at new york's
beth israel
hospital following what police are calling
a vicious homophobic attack saturday in the east village.

four men were later
arrested on charges of assault as a hate crime. at least two others remain at
large. 
aviance, 38, whose songs
have topped the billboard dance chart, was attacked as he walked home from the phoenix where he had met
friends for a drink. 
police said that the
attackers yelled anti-gay slurs as they beat him.  
aviance managed to walk the
short distance to hospital.  he underwent surgery for a broken jaw on
saturday. his his publicist, len evans, said that aviance's jaw is wired shut
and he will not be able to perform in the upcoming gay-pride parade. 
evans said that while
aviance was being attacked people just passed by ignoring the bashing. aviance
performs in drag but evans said he was ''dressed like a boy'' when he was
attacked. 
aviance's song ''alive''
hit the top of the chart in 2002. other popular songs by the singer have
included ''give it up,'' released in 2004, and ''din da da,'' which topped the
billboard dance chart in 1997. 
police identified the four
men arrested as jarell sears and akino george, both 20; gregory archie, 18; and
gerard johnson, 16.
