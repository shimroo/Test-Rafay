  “i love how knowledgeable the faculty and staff are in what they do. i wanted a high-quality montessori education for my children. ‘montessori’ can be put on any door – casa di mir is a montessori school and our family is glad to have found it.”

  if you are looking for a great environment for your child, with small classes, super-low student to teacher ratio, highly qualified and credentialed teachers, and a proven hands-on, project-based teaching methodology, you simply cannot pick a better school in the south bay area (in my humble opinion).”

  “casa was like my second home and it definitely influenced me in a way that i have learned to love education and learning. it really prepared me for the rest of my life. it gave me communication skills, problem-solving skills, and a positive attitude, all of which are important for leadership.“

  “casa gave me such a great foundation i built off of. it taught me how to be accountable for my own work, time management, and a good work ethic. i wouldn’t be the same without the montessori education!”

in honor of the glorious second plane of development, a beautiful time when children aged 6-12 are learning about themselves and their universe, we thought it might be nice to take a deep dive into the montessori perspective.
