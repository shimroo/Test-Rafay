concrete: competitive on initial cost...
...and delivers environmental benefits, enhanced curb appeal and superior 
       	      long-term value!
concrete has stood the test of time better than any other leading building material. while its strengths are legendary, environmental concerns and recent dramatic asphalt price increases and supply concerns make concrete an even smarter choice.
 

 
by choosing a concrete parking area, you are selecting a more durable paving material that will require much less maintenance over the course of its lifetime—a considerably longer life than alternative pavements. through its strength, durability, custom appearance, green benefits, ease of construction and return on investment, concrete parking lots and pavements are the best choice for optimal value.
