making seniors feel loved and appreciated is at the heart of our glamourgals mission.

over 60% of seniors in care do not receive visitors.



our national network of teen-led chapters is changing that.




volunteers provide companionship, conversation, and our signature beauty experiences for seniors in care. our award-winning card-writing initiative my dear friend, has enabled us to expand our mission to reach over 200,000 isolated seniors.
