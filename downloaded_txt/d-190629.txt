understanding the earth system and its human relationships

                      explore our work
                  








 





 



the climate and global dynamics laboratory has a mission to discover the key processes in each component of the earth's climate system and the interactions among them; represent this understanding in models and thereby provide a basis for prediction of climate; and apply this understanding and these models to scientific problems of societal relevance.

our work

our research focuses to increase our understanding of atmospheric and climate variability and climate change through parallel development and analysis of observational, assimilated, model-generated and model-forcing dataset






 





datasets & resources



facilitates access to extensive collections of climate model output and observational datasets. these products are very popular with climate change researchers, both in the united states and internationally.







 





modeling



developing innovative earth system modeling capabilities, with the ultimate goal of providing accurate and computationally advanced representations of the fully coupled and integrated earth system.







 





visitor program



provides the opportunity for long-term scientific visits, along with investment in local support to ensure collaborators can make the most productive use of their time.












research integration

three key groups in integrating science and service to support and strengthen scientific research efforts with cgd and ncar.






 





cesm software engineering group



works on cseg code development efforts and project management issues on the cesm project







 





information systems group (isg)



provides computing technologies for the climate & global dynamics laboratory and its collaborators







 





administrative team



the cgd administrative team provides extensive knowledge, expertise and best practices in administration, information, and management functions.












research sections

our scientists pursue research as part of the national center for atmospheric research (ncar) and are broken up into focused sections.






 





atmospheric modeling & predictability section



research focuses on increasing understanding of the atmosphere and its role in the climate system, through modeling and observational studies, and to represent that understanding in improved atmospheric models.







 





climate analysis section (cas)



research focus is to increase understanding of the atmosphere through empirical studies and diagnostic analyses of the atmosphere and its interactions with the earth's surface and oceans on a wide range of time scales.







 





climate change research section



uses appropriate climate system models to study the response of the earth system to a variety of forcings, including changes in carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases and aerosols.







 





oceanography section



research is understanding the large-scale ocean circulation and the dynamics of climate through studies of the important processes in the ocean, in air-sea interaction, and in coupled systems







 





 paleo & polar climate section



enhance the understanding of the workings of the climate system through investigations of past climates and the role of polar regions in climate variability and change







 





terrestrial sciences section



studies land-atmosphere interactions, in particular, surface forcing of the atmosphere, through model development, application, and observational analyses
