our in lake waterpark ‘the splashzone’ is open from memorial day – labor day. dependent on the weather we may start the season sooner or remain open longer. this decision is made on a week by week basis outside of the regular season. we take such things into account as water temperature, outside temperature, hurricane season and any approaching storms.the swimming only area usually stays open much longer and is only dependent on water/ air temperature.
