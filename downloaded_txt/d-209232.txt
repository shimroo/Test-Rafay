welcome to the 1953 and 1954 chevrolet web site!



    the 1953 chevrolet automobile came in three basic body styles.  the 
    1500 and 2100 series continue from the previous years.  however, the 
    new bel air or 2400 series is new for the 1953 chevrolet models.  
    because the name, bel air,  now applies to a series instead of an 
    individual model, changes in the body style have been made.  the 
    hard-top coupe is now known as the sport coupe rather than the bel air 
    coupe, and the former sport coupe, the six-passenger, notchback coupe is 
    designated the club coupe.  in 1954 the trailing zero was dropped and 
    the models became the 150 and 210 models. 

    the four models in the 1953 chevrolet bel air series are set apart by a 
    luxurious appearance, numerous refinements of exterior beauty, and lavishly 
    appointed interiors. the series comprises: a four-door and two-door sedan, 
    sport coupe, and convertible.
