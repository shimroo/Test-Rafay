the johnson american bulldog is a breed of dog unlike any other; their sheer strength and courage coupled with their undying loyalty and devotion make them the ultimate breed of dog for the general public and serious canine enthusiast 
alike.  the modern american bulldog is believed to have descended from the colossus breeds of ancient history similar to other mastiff breeds.  the american bulldogs earliest history is virtually unknown and little if any recorded records 
exist.  the first documented history relating to the american bulldog was during the late 19th century.  dogs resembling todays american bulldogs were used in europe, specifically england, as "butcher dogs" and guardians.  these dogs were by no means pets, but rather utility dogs bred and raised for specific duties. these duties included baiting unruly cattle and swine along with guarding property against thievery.  these tasks required a dog that feared no man or beast alive, but was still loyal and obedient to their master and keeper.  these traits still exist with the johnson american bulldog.

since the early "butcher dogs" the american bulldog had nearly gone extinct and until recently experienced an evolutionary rebirth.  this rebirth is due in large part to two dedicated individuals; john d. johnson and mildred l. johnson. in the 
mid 1940s, john d., as he is known to friends, began collecting the best representations of bulldogs he remembered from his youth.  these bulldogs had grown scare in the northwest region of georgia, and john desired a dog with the same stamina and grit to protect his farm and livestock.  initially it was a small operation, but through the hard work of john and mildred it grew into a life long commitment.  at one time the johnsons had nearly 30 dogs involved in their breeding program. john d. was also instrumental in renaming the breed from american pit bulldog to american bulldog.  he was also the first breeder to have his dogs officially registered.  aside from these accomplishments it was john and mildreds breeding program that had the greatest impact in the preservation of the american bulldog.  john and mildred have literally supplied the world with 
their georgia bred bulldogs.  they were pivotal in creating the legendary bloodlines of dick the bruiser, big buck, rebel rouser, the machines and many more.  it was their female lines of collettes, sugar dolls and sugar tuffies that when bred produced the big boned pups that mature into the 100 lbs. "the real american bulldogs" johnson is known for.
