my christmas message to all on the political spectrum



i usually would never use a line from a modern movie to make a more profound point, but every once in a while there is a line in a move that strikes me. this happened when i was watching the movie, "2012." near the end, one of the main characters declares, "it is when we stop fighting for each other that we lose our humanity."which brings me to my christmas message. all of us here on the right or left, in this subculture of political obsession are, in the end, fighting for each other. no matter where we are on the political spectrum, we all want to make this world a better place. we all want what is best for the people who live on this planet.we all have different ideas on how to do that well. some of us are profoundly right, and some of us are profoundly wrong. it is only in the end, when we face the one who loves us best, that we will be able to see whether what we believed was indeed right.but until then, we continue on in this life, doing what we can to effect change. to lift one another up. to bring a better life for all.for all our differences, it would do us well to remember that at the heart of all of this, all this writing, all this watching, all this perspective, we are simply caring about the world around us and the decisions being made on our behalf.we are...... "fighting for each other."this really is at the heart of all great religions. it is certainly at the heart of my christian faith. christ said, "love one another as i have loved you." christ told us that it is in taking care of one another that we find god and purpose in life. when we stand for those less fortunate, we are fighting for each other. when we fight for freedom, we are fighting for each other.in this great nation our founding fathers believed that we were and are "endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights." they didn't believe that these rights were given to man by men. they did not believe that this nation was by accident. in order to form "a more perfect union" they understood that it was the "blessings of liberty" given to us by our creator, that would indeed be necessary to fight for. they did fight. they fought for us.and now, still...we are fighting for each other.i wish you all a blessed and happy christmas, but special blessings to those who stand at the gate and watch those who lead us. we watch and work to make sure that those who lead this great nation are being worthy of the work bestowed upon them, and that they are understanding the greatness of their service to us.so to bloggers, commenters, columnists, authors, radio hosts, political pundits, news anchors, and reporters, i say many blessings to you, and may you always keep fighting the good fight.for it is there where we truly do keep and treasure our humanity.

a party switch for health care



rep. parker griffith, a freshman democrat from alabama will announce today he is switching to the republican party.why?griffith is also a doctor. he is a radiation oncologist who founded a cancer treatment center. it is expected that he will emphasize the reason for his switch is this debacle of a health bill.remember what i said before. every senator who is a doctor is opposed to this bill. if anyone understands how these laws, mandates, and rationed care will affect us, it is the senate doctors.via politico update: his presser:

be careful what you wish for...



as i have mentioned before, i don't have much time to write this week, but charles krauthammer's take yesterday on fox news pretty much says all you need to know:and the process is really insane. this is a reform of one-sixth of our economy. the one thing democrats and republicans agree on is that this is the most important, transformative piece of legislation that's going to pass for years, and they haven't seen it as of today, and it has to be all done and approved or disapproved by midweek. no legislation of this importance has ever passed without bi-partisanship. ever. this one will pass on a purely partisan basis. is anyone paying attention? no. it's christmas. which is why reid is doing this now. i want all of you to think about this. right or left, do you really want a "transformative piece of legislation" passed that as of yesterday no one has even seen?? insane indeed.i need to add this. this is from an interview with sen. judd gregg (r., n.h.). keep in  mind that this is a republican that had enough of the respect of pres. obama to be asked to be in his cabinet (which gregg declined) this is how he sees what is happening in wasthington:“an ideological supermajority in congress, along with a government run by community organizers, has taken over.” “they’ve taken over the student-loan program, they’ve taken over the automobile system, and now they’re taking over the health-care system. there is no limit to their belief that people should be controlled by smart bureaucrats in washington,” says gregg. “they’re putting our country on a path that will reduce the quality of life for the next generation, undermine our nation’s wonderful exceptionalism, and europeanize our economy to curb its growth.”harry reid’s health-care bill “was purchased,” says gregg. “our system of checks and balances is gone. we now have a government that lurches with great speed even though our system is founded upon incremental change.” and don’t hope that the house stops the runaway train, he says. “i think the house is ideologically even further to the left than the senate. there are many people there who are committed to taking us down the road toward nationalization.”when you hear the tea party movement talk about losing our liberty. this is what we are talking about.

the grinch who stole liberty



oh my gosh. seriously. my oldest kids are home from college, my house if full children ages 12-22. i'm shopping, cleaning, cooking, wrapping, and going to christmas parties. i don't have time to blog. but here i am because this is so important.the democrats are trying to rush this health care bill through when everyone is busy just like i am. it's a travesty. the ironic thing about is that both the left and right are against this health care bill (although for very different reasons). but no matter, dem majority leader harry reid is determined to shove this down our throats. senators are still reading the bill, and yet they are going to be forced to vote on it within two days. this process is a travesty. they are voting on a bill they have not even read through about something that affects every person in america’s quality of life. all small businesses will be affected with taxes and mandates. it’s going to cut medicare and medicaid reimbursements to hospitals. this bill won't even take affect until 2014 (except for the taxes of course). there is no reason to rush this before christmas.  61% of americans are against this. just about everyone (excepts democrats in congress) wants to start over. it boggles the mind.  even though reid has payed off democrat senator nelson from nebraska big time for his vote, who was against the abortion part of the bill, the abortion language is still egregious (i believe this is what's called selling your soul to the devil). it would be the first time since 1977 that there would be federal funding for elective abortions. the catholic bishops have come out and said that this bill in it's present form is "morally unacceptable."one senator is saying that the bill sets up a constitutional challenge:sen. saxby chambliss (r-ga.) asserted that the compromise on abortion contained within the bill, which would seek to segregate federal funds from subsidizing health plans covering abortion, is unconstitutional.harry reid can be the grinch who stole liberty in health care this christmas, but this is far from over. the american people aren't going to stand for it this time.that, i can promise you.

climate change summit update



for those of you interested or keeping up, copenhagen's climate change summit has been a disaster. india and china had had enough. indian prime minister manmohan singh and china premier wen jiabao walked out of the summit along with their respective delegations as talks failed. russian president dmitry medvedev left the deadlocked un climate summit  today because of another scheduled event. obama's badly given speech didn't impress anyone (click the link to see how pathetic obama is without a teleprompter).a multilateral meeting between president obama, premier wen, prime minister singh, and president zuma secured "a meaningful agreement". it's said to not be "sufficient to combat the threat of climate change but its an important first step." it's a "legally non-binding" agreement to do all sorts of climate change stuff, but pretty much means no one has to do anything.all in all, a very good day for those of us who find the global warming alarmists silly at best, and dangerous at worst.and once again mother nature laughs and laughs as over a foot of snow is expected to greet obama as he flies from this global warming crisis back to washington d.c.
