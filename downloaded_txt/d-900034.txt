matilda joslyn gage center



“the public must be aroused to a full sense of the justice of our claims. beside the duty of educating our children, so as to make the path of right, easy to their feet, is that of discussion, newspaper articles, petitions: all great reforms are gradual. fear not any attempt to frown down the revolution already commenced; nothing is a more fertile aid of reform, than an attempt to check it; work on.”matilda joslyn gage - national woman’s rights convention in syracuse, ny 1852
