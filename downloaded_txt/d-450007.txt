border-crossings of many kinds in burn by patrick ness



feb 11, 2025




“the enforcers of law in canada and the united states sometimes coated their bullets in anti-coagulant. not for when they shot men. for when they shot dragons.”set in the pacific northwest, ness’s ya novel burn takes readers back and forth across the border between countries. but it also crosses the borders between worlds—parallel universes of possibilities playing out in the lives of the characters.

feb 4, 2025




you know you’ve heard this quip before: “this woman’s place is in the house — the house of representatives.” but do you know who said it? bella abzug (1920-1998) was a lawyer, politician, social activist, and pioneer in women’s rights. here’s abzuglutely: battling, bellowing bella abzug, a loving picture book portrait by sarah aronson, illustrated by andrea d’aquino. i asked sarah to tell me more about the making of this book.

vaunda micheaux nelson and tina athaide on historical verse novels



jan 28, 2025




i was privileged to read radiant by vaunda micheaux nelson poem by poem, as she wrote it. a few months earlier, i’d been delighted to read wings to soar by tina athaide.those two verse novels spoke to each other, with their musical threads, their self-aware young characters, and the histories unfurling in and around those characters’ families. so i knew i wanted these writers to talk to each other, and to me, about their books.

remembering dr. king today and often



jan 20, 2025




abraham lincoln warned of “crowned-kings, money-kings, and land-kings” opting instead to create a government of the people, for the people, by the people, a phrase so ordinary for us today that it no longer seems to call for quotation marks. yet those kings of the material world are in seats of extraordinary power today. their presence will be writ large in the extravagant and highly politicized presidential inauguration taking place in the united states. yet, purely by the chance arrangement of the gregorian calendar, that event, with all the hoopla surrounding it, happens to coincide with martin luther king, jr. day. that’s my focus today. another kind of king.

guest post: vaunda micheaux nelson on her verse novel, radiant



jan 7, 2025




vaunda micheaux nelson is part of the new mexico writing group that has given me support, critique, and loving friendship for some 26 years now. today, vaun has a new book out, radiant, a verse novel written in the viewpoint of its young protagonist, cooper. here’s an excerpt from the publisher’s promotional copy:as school begins in 1963, cooper dale wrestles with what it means to “shine” for a black girl in a predominantly white community near pittsburgh. set against the historic backdrop of the birmingham church bombing, the kennedy assassination, and beatlemania, radiant is a finely crafted novel in verse about race, class, faith, and finding your place in a loving family and a complicated world.

writing for the long haul: remarks for the phoenix award roundtable



dec 31, 2024




2024 brought a nice surprise to my email inbox. my first middle grade novel, naming maya, published in 2004, had been selected for the phoenix award, a little known but most unusual children’s literature award in the united states. unlike just about every other award, it’s not given to a newly edited, newly published book. rather it elevates and honors books that were published 20 years before the year of each award.

guest post: megan benedict on sea wolves: keepers of the rainforest



dec 17, 2024




soon after sea wolves: keepers of the rainforest by megan benedict and melanie crowder was published this past summer, i read it to my 3-year-old granddaughter. she listened to it all the way through, echoed a couple of lines, and then went through its pages and found all the wolves hiding in plain sight on every spread. she proceeded to spend some time that afternoon pretending to be a wolf, scratching on the sand (rug) and howling. to my mind, that's the ultimate validation of a picture book, when the youngest reader/listener can find something to take away and hold close.
