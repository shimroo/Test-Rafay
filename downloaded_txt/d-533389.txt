we do researchhuman beings are complex, multi-dimensional creatures. at every angle they reveal a piece of themselves — something intimate, or surprising, or even contradictory. our approach starts with the individual and understanding the human experience.

 











we study culture understanding existing and emerging cultural narratives is essential for viewing people’s stories about themselves and the world critically - as that which shapes culture and is, at the same time, shaped by it. as a method, cultural analysis considers the cultural “backdrop” of human truths: where in time this particular idea arises, and how it has changed over time, as well as what social, cultural, and economic events shaping people’s attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.
