 kids making a 

					difference!  kids and their rescued foster puppies are 

					ambassadors for homeless and all puppies, for other kids and 

					teach everyone how to properly care for, train and commit to 

					a dog.  by learning positive reward based training with 

					their foster puppies, these kids learn positive relationship 

					building, and many more values they will benefit from the 

					rest of their lives!
what a 

					perfect match: kids and dogs!

any 

					help that you can give is so appreciated!

a humane 

					education today, yields a more compassionate society 

					tomorrow


if we want to 

					stop the violence and give all kids a sense of compassion 

					for life and self worth , we must teach them that compassion 

					through positive activities.  in our program kids learn 

					compassion, responsibility, self esteem, confidence,  and 

					service through helping train and care for homeless 

					puppies.  they learn the benefits of positive praise and the 

					rewarding satisfaction of training a helpless puppy.  they 

					gain countless values that will help them in their lives.
