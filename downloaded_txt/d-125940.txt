why infax?





                                        the know-how
                                    




our methods are tried and true. from the busiest airports to the smallest courthouses, we have implemented systems in facilities of all sizes.







                                        turnkey solutions
                                    




 infax can deliver a project from design to deployment, software and hardware. at the end of the implementation process, we leave you with a system that is tested and reliable. we take pride in being able to provide a seamless and stress-free project for our clients.







                                        trusted team
                                    




infax is one of the few u.s.-based companies that is still family owned. weâre proud of that, and itâs something youâll see in the way we practice business.















what they say








                                " everyone at the court loves the new system. it has been extremely helpful with individuals coming to court proceedings and having the system direct them where to go. "
                            
-christina blakeslee, chief technology officer, 13th judicial circuit court of florida




                                " the system has been phenomenal. it lowers the stress levels of the litigants; itâs one less thing to worry them. and it serves as crowd control; rather than gather around elevators, people know exactly where they are going and can get there in a timely manner. "
                            
-john warren, dallas county clerk, dallas county court system




                                " we have deployed the bids, gids, fids and flight tracker throughout the terminal to provide passengers with the most current information available. we have been very pleased with the accuracy and timely manner in which the monitors are updated. the system is extremely easy for employees to update as well. "
                            
-buck taft, deputy director of airports, tri-cities airport




                                " infax was a great company to work with on the implementation of our digital signage. the staff is excellent and very responsive to our needs. i would highly recommend them to anyone interested in installing digital signage at their place of business. "
                            
-shelly bacon, deputy court administrator, yavapai superior court




                                " infax did an amazing job implementing our new fids system. in order to accommodate our contract schedules, infax really stepped up and was able to implement the whole process in about three weeks. even with a quick implementation the quality was still there. "
                            
-james rockholt, director of it & telecommunications, tulsa airport authority
