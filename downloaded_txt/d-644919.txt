what's new

gemstone 2.1 for windows or mac
    announcing gemstone 2.1, a significant free update for gemstone 2 users.  this version fixes
    bugs and adds new functionality, too.
    we've completely upgraded the user experience with friendly wizards, clean pages, and beautiful graphics.
    setting up objective, automated analysis is a breeze - you'll never want to go back to gating.
    cen-se' plots work hand in hand with gemstone's probability state modeling to identify and label cell types
    and subsets. find out more...


winlist 10.1 is now available
    the latest update for winlist, with enhancements to make your experience more productive.
    winlist 10.1 squishes every bug reported against 10.0, and adds enhancements for
    quantitation, auto-positioning regions, and high-dpi monitor support.
    these improvements are on top of winlist 10.0, which includes cen-se' dimensionality reduction to explore the populations in your samples.
    reports draw much faster and without interrupting your workflow. n-color™ compensation has been tuned-up for
    high-dimensional data files from standard bio, cytek, and bd. we've improved sticky regions and contour regions
    and beefed-up the ability to work with very large data files. 
    and as usual, we've kept our pricing well ahead of the competition! find out more...
