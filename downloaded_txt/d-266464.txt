 begins with an article  about standards and the foa 1-page 
standards that provide the interpretations you need to understand them. 
we also cover the developments in low-earth orbit (leo) satellites that 
are now challenging fiber and wireless for rural broadband.

in the news section, we begin with some 
photos from the california wildfires that shows another problem with 
aerial cables. we also continue our focus on submarine 
cables and the questions about cable breaks - accidental damage or 
sabotage? 

in the technical section, we discuss a problem 
with mpo array connectors, new photonic ics and an uppdate to an afl 
fusion splicer to permit splicing 16 fiber ribbons.
also in this month's newsletter: worth reading has
 links to more news articles worth reading and q&a looks at osp installation
 standards.

foa has reached an amazing milestone - 100,000 certified fiber optic technicians


that is a lot of fiber optic techs! 100,000 fiber optic techs just about equals today's us fiber optic technician workforce. 
and those 100,000 foa certified fiber techs hold over 130,000 foa 
certifications.



how did foa achieve this milestone? foa has been quietly working behind 
the scenes to achieve our original goal - developing a competent fiber 
optic workforce through education, certification and standards; a 
workforce capable of building the world's fiber optic communications 
networks. foa is the certifying body accepted worldwide and it is assisted by a worldwide 
network of foa approved training organizations and their foa certified 
fiber optic instructors. 

read the report in the december 2024 foa newsletter to see what the 
industry says about this foa milestone.

enhance your safety with the foa safety vest. 

  

it's well made and distinctive.


introducing the "foa badge in fiber optics" for professionals working in fiber optics
 
foa is best known as the certifying body for the nearly 100,000 foa-certified fiber optic technicians
 who build worldwide networks. foa has been asked many times about recognition for other 
professionals in fiber optics. foa now offers the foa badge in fiber optics,
 which recognizes professionals working in all areas of fiber optics; 
management, manufacturing, marketing/sales/distribution as well as 
managers/planners/supervisors for networks.  


new edition available 

foa has
published a new edition of our textbook on basic fiber optics, used in 
training for the cfot certification. the latest version of the foa reference guide to fiber optics is different 
enough we call it a new edition.  many of the updates are for new 
technologies which are reshaping the fiber optic industry like coherent 
transmission, bi fibers, etc. we've also added a section on the fiber 
optic workforce which has much relevance because this book is used to 
train those entering the workforce. 
we've also worked on making the book more readable, adding formatting that eases reading and a new comprehensive index. inflation was an issue, but the price only goes up $2 to $29.95 for the paperback and $12.95 for the kindle version.
  available on amazon and your local bookseller. 




the new bls "telecommunications technicians" web page  

created with the assistance of foa, the

 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics occupational outlook 
web pages offer job descriptions  for fiber optic and wireless 
techs and better 
job statistics that put some reality in discussions about how many more 
fiber techs the us needs. it also provides a reference for grants 
applications.

latest foa book: fiber broadband - popular with broadband planners

this book is not the typical foa technical textbook - it is written for 
anyone who wants to understand fiber broadband or fiber optics or the 
internet. it's also aimed at managers involved with broadband projects, teachers who want to include 
communications technology in their classes or anyone 
who just wonders how all this stuff works.

                    and it calculates the loss budget. it works on any device,

anyone who wants to understand fiber broadband, fiber optics or the

who just wonders how all this stuff works.
