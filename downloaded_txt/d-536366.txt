i have originally put together this web site back in 1996 telling you a little about myself. since then, it has outgrown so many "hosts" that it needed a final home as "sky-chaser"! this should be an easy name to remember for hurricane chasing, storm chasing, severe weather, extreme journalism, skydiving, photography, travel, computer graphics and video, computer programming, web design, and much more! i am a computer programmer / analyst, writer, skydiver (uspa c30317), amateur photographer, extreme storm journalist, and computer artist. i enjoy flying and aerobatics, boating and jet skis, surfing, ham radio, skydiving, and videography. i am also aÂ volunteer skywarn storm spotter (fl b036 / 5257) for the national weather service as well as a licensed ham radio operator (kg4pjn)."sky-chaser" consulting, as this site reflects from a business standpoint, mainly specializes in storm / hurricane chasing, and other documentation of extreme weather events for media, educational, charity / benefits, and public awareness goals. this site also contains my computer consulting services in pick (universe, unidata, and similar multivalue-db oriented) programming for many major business requirements. the "sky-chaser" site also has lots of information about my other sports, hobbies, and lifestyles besides storm journalism and computer consulting. i feel you should enjoy or even be able to utilize some of the areas on this web site for anything from education to entertainment ... and be sure check back often, because it is updated on a continuous basis!

happy new year 2025




wishing everyone a safe and happy new year 2025! 2024 was a challenging year for me, but more good things happened to be grateful for.


thanksgiving in 2024 and certainly thankful (and resilient)




hurricane season draws to a close on november 30, and the holidays are upon us. thanksgiving really had a meaning this year ... since i managed to beat cancer over the course of 2024. this was a very rare form of male breast cancer, called "invasive papillary carcinoma". i first noticed something was wrong after a bruise i got while skydiving in 2022 never quite healed - leaving a fluid-filled area under my left breast. this is what made me see a doctor, and eventually i found that the cancer was a "tiny speck" surrounded by the fluid-filled sac! this "alerted" me into catching it early and seeking treatment, preventing its spread, and saving my life and health. i put this video out there so people can get advice, and be aware of the insidious effects of such diseases. the video also shows my journey to being cured, and rather interesting aspects of my treatment (including radiation therapy).
be sure to check out the gallery section of my website (which has a video of my story - click here for the gallery). you can also click the image above, or the link here to jump directly past the gallery and to my video.

important information for media inquiries

you can review all production videos, dvd's, documentaries, and stock video on my offers page which can be viewed by clicking the link here. please not that you can request stock video through me directly, or through the conus archive, which is much easier!
