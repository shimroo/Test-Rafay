welcome to
napa valley’s oldest winery estate
in 1861, charles krug, the visionary father of napa valley winemaking, established the winery that started it all. the mondavi family purchased this already iconic estate in 1943, and for over 75 years and four generations they have been passionately perfecting an enduring legacy for those generations still to come.
