×why book with portfolio journeys



expert assistance
we’ll plan your complete itinerary, from booking accommodation to luxury rail travel, self-catering villas and apartments to transfers, car hire and day tours.



best price guaranteed
if you find the same itinerary cheaper elsewhere, we’ll beat it.



extensive local knowledge
we’re experts in all the destinations that we specialise in and will guide you on your journey.


×best price guarantee
booking with portfolio journeys is cheaper than going direct. we negotiate prices that suppliers don’t offer directly to the public. if you find the same itinerary cheaper elsewhere, we will better it.
×expert advice
we’ve slept in the beds, we’ve checked out the views and we’ve dined with the owners. what we recommend for you is what we’d want for ourselves. and we have been doing it for 37 years! did we mention that we also happen to live in africa?
×trusted & secure
we are a southern africa tourism services association (satsa) member, a sign of quality and commitment to service excellence. using a satsa member provides peace of mind – as members we are financially compliant and also abide by a strict satsa code of conduct.
× handpicked accommodation










at portfolio we feature only handpicked accommodation in southern africa. our members are carefully chosen because they are committed to creating unique travel memories with a personal touch.
