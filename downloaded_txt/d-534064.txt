systemic equality

 




        systemic equality      

since our nation’s founding, discriminatory policies and laws have created an unequal system in which black communities have had their civil rights and liberties denied and have been systemically locked out of opportunities in education, housing, employment, and more.
through our systemic equality agenda, we will use nationwide litigation, advocacy, and public education to advance laws and policies rooted in racial equity and end discriminatory policies, laws, and practices that have an outsized impact on black communities.
help us in our fight to ensure all people have equal access to housing, voting rights, education, and more by learning more, pledging your support, or donating. when we have full and equal access to education, jobs, housing, voting rights and more, better futures are possible.

in the courts






            for more than one hundred years, aclu lawyers have been at the center of one history-making court case after
            another, participating in more supreme court cases than any other private organization. with attorneys
            nationwide, we handle thousands of cases each year on behalf of clients whose rights have been violated.
          







fighting for reproductive freedom

                    people deserve the freedom to make their own  medical decisions — but extreme politicians want to take that power away and deny people essential healthcare like abortion and birth control. the aclu will never stop fighting to ensure that every person can maker their own decisions around pregnancy.

fighting trump






                                during the first trump administration, we took over
                                430 legal actions.
                            



fighting back against voter suppression in georgia
following record turnout in recent elections, georgia legislators passed a voter suppression law designed to make it harder for voters, especially voters of color, to cast a ballot. we’re suing.
defending student free speech
brandi levy was just blowing off steam off campus when she posted an expletive message on snapchat critical of her school and cheer team. she was suspended from her cheer team, but alongside the aclu she sued to defend student free speech. we took the case all the way to the supreme court – and won.
protecting abortion access in florida
on behalf of several abortion providers, we are fighting against florida's senseless and harmful law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy and threatens to imprison doctors who provide care beyond that point.










our history







1920
in its first year, the aclu challenged the palmer raids, protecting immigrants and trade union members.




1942
the aclu stood almost alone in denouncing the federal government’s internment of more than 110,000 japanese americans in concentration camps.




1967
the aclu represented an interracial couple in the landmark supreme court case, loving v. virginia. the court ruled that state bans on interracial marriage were unconstitutional.




1978
the aclu took a controversial stand for free speech by defending a nazi group that wanted to march through the chicago suburb of skokie—where many holocaust survivors lived.




2015
the aclu won a landmark supreme court ruling in obergefell v. hodges, affirming the constitutional right of same-sex couples to marry.




2018
in a victory for privacy, the supreme court ruled in an aclu case, carpenter v. united states, that people’s sensitive cell phone location data is protected by the fourth amendment, requiring the government get a warrant to access it.




today
we have over 1,700 staffers in every state, washington, d.c., and puerto rico fighting for people's constitutional rights.
