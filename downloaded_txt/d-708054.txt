overlook film festival
the overlook film festival is a 4-day celebration of all things horror held in america’s most haunted city, new orleans. each spring, genre fans and cinephiles from the world over convene in the heart of the french quarter, home to countless apparition sightings, voodoo legends, vampire curses and even some lore related to our namesake, horror fiction’s most frightening creation. the festival is produced in partnership with the prytania theatres.
