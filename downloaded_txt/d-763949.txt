we understand that it is the local church which is built upon and by jesus christ, that is his recognized “bride” for whom he will return for, and not this or any other religious organization. but we do believe that there is great value in local bodies of believers coming together to enhance and expand their mission and ministries






ministry & sermonwe offer studies in several areas from sunday school ministries and bible school to community ministries.
bringing churches togetheras more and more churches come together the greater we can provide for food pantries, clothes closets to outreach, new churches, and other areas of ministry.
expanding the kingdomwe bring local churches and faith-based organizations together to expand our knowledge and support to those in need
our mission statementbecome a part of the worldthen jesus came near and said to them, “all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe everything i have commanded you. and remember, i am with you always, to the end of the age. (hcsb)
matthew 28:18-20
but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come on you, and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem, in all judea and samaria, and to the ends of the earth. (hcsb)
