i don't know where to begin with how amazing crystal point is. it was single handedly the best day/night of our lives. i am going to try to mention everything that was wonderful but there was too much! first off, the venue itself is perfectly set up- interior is gorgeous, ceremony area outside is stunning, inside ceremony is also stunning if it rains. cocktail hour is unreal- sooo much food and so much variety. everyone raved to me about how it was the best cocktail hour they have ever experienced. reception dinner and dessert are also amazing . . .
