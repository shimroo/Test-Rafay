major changes to 🇺🇸u.s. local calling: 
	for many people in the u.s., 2021 saw the end of 7-digit 
	local phone calls. most of 🇨🇦canada already has 10-digit 
	local calls, but most of the holdouts changed over in 2023.

	(in 2021–2022): did you change 
	to 10-digit local calls? 
	(updated 2024-01-19)


	following suit from the united states, 🇨🇦 canada
ordered 
	implementation of the 9-8-8 
	suicide prevention number throughout canada on 
	2023-11-30. 
	one strange thing, though: the crtc ordered 
	10-digit local calling in 709 and 
	part of 867 
	(plus 506 already planning an overlay in 
	april 2023) 
	because of the existence of 988 as a prefix in those area codes. 
	however, they also inexplicably ordered 
	10-digit dialing in area code 807, 
	sparsely populated northwestern ontario, 
	despite the fact that there is 
	not an 
	807-988 prefix. read more about

site overview
this site contains information about the 

north american numbering plan, 
the telephone numbering scheme that serves the united states, canada, 
and several other countries and territories in the region. 
the nanp divides the participating countries into area codes, each of which 
is a three-digit number. within each area code, a telephone number is always 
7 digits, except for special codes like the 911 emergency number. 
in the late 1990s, the nanp added new area codes at a rate unprecedented in 
its 50-year history, with demand fueled primarily by the outdated system of 
allocating blocks of numbers to telephone companies. 
more efficient allocation methods, coupled with consolidation in the 
telecommunications industry, have slowed the flood of new area codes to 
barely a trickle, from 45 in 1997 to only 3 in 2007. 
notably, the introduction of new area codes has shifted decisively from 
traditional area code splits to overlays. the last area code split in 
the united states was in 2007, and canada hasn’t had one since 1999! 
this site contains information about the original area codes from 1947, 
their evolution to the current state, and future developments, including 
area code splits and area code overlays. 

the site underwent a major overhaul in early 2021. most of the 
changes are “under the hood” (full html5 compliance and much 
greater use of unicode instead of ascii &#x092d; escapes), 
but several of the graphics have been updated, particularly with 
an eye to making them more friendly to people with color vision 
deficiency (“color blindness”), and the logo has been refreshed. 
in october 2022, the site made another significant change: most 
pages now support “dark mode”: light-colored 
text against a dark background. there are still some graphics 
that need to be converted, and a few other tweaks here and there, 
but most of the changes are complete; a few laggards will be 
brought into the 21st century in the coming weeks. 

the unicode came in particularly handy for the 

	world.html 
and 
	world-rtl.html
pages, which now contain text in over 200 languages in three dozen 
character sets. i’m phasing in svg graphics to replace many of the 
older png/gif graphics, providing dramatically better quality at 
arbitrary scales. i continue to closely monitor us and canadian 
regulators’ websites for any updates, and keep my ear to the ground 
for any credible rumors from other sources. i also receive regular 
updates from the itu on international numbering. i hope you find 
the information here useful for all your telephony needs.
