  buy an ensign  



welcome to the ensign class association
the ensign is the largest class of full keel sailboats in north america, with over 2000 boats manufactured since 1962. designed by carl alberg, its sustained popularity is due to very solid and durable construction, and a design that lends itself equally and admirably to comfortable family cruising, enjoyable day sailing, and close, strategic, tactical racing. the ensign class is one of the strongest national organizations, with numerous local fleets from coast to coast. as a family day sailor, the ensign has a large, deep cockpit, with enough room to comfortably seat six to eight adults. its full keel provides a secure, stable ride, and its three-foot draft makes it perfect for the shallower waters of bays and lakes and for anchoring fairly close to a protected shore.

the ensign class association is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization. our federal tax id is 06-1203996
donations to the eca are tax deductible to the extent allowed by federal and state law.
