2024 year in review







































one foot on the campus,
one foot in the community.

since 1994, every nation missionaries and church planters have answered the call to bring the gospel to campuses and cities around the world. we plant churches that reach the campus because we firmly believe that if we change the campus, we will eventually change the family, the nation, and the world.

our mission







even in a world that says it’s far from jesus, we see the complete opposite. students are being radically changed and going on mission to see their campus won.
tom breckwoldt
campus pastor, lake mary, florida, usa






if we want to see the gospel reach the ends of the earth, we must trust god to plant more churches and more campus ministries in every nation.
ronald amanya
lead pastor, kampala, uganda










our hope is that as [students] go out to impact the world and to change the world, that they . . . would be god’s instrument to changing it.




jamie baek
campus missionary, boston, massachusetts, usa













church-based campus missionaries around the world evangelize and disciple students, advancing god’s kingdom on the university campus.
