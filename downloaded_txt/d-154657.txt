understand your abilities. find your strengths. chart your own path.
not every student knows their strengths or the level and pace at which they are ready to learn new content and skills. ctd can help. since its inception, ctd has utilized above-grade-level testing as one way to identify academic ability, measure growth, and connect academically advanced students with resources and educational opportunities, including gifted education services, advanced academic programs, and academic acceleration. ctd can provide:
grade-level assessment (age 4 - grade 3)
above-grade-level assessment (grades 3 - 9)
