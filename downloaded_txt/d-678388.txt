      description
      lemuria was an ancient civilization which existed prior to and during the
      time of atlantis. physically, it is believed that lemuria existed largely
      in the southern pacific, between north america and asia/australia. lemuria
      is also sometimes referred to as mu, or the motherland (of mu). at its
      peak of civilization, the lemurian people were both highly evolved and
      very spiritual. while concrete physical evidence of this ancient continent
      may be difficult to find, many people "know" that they have a strong
      connection to lemuria.
