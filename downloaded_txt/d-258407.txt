about kathy...
kathy chiavola is internationally renowned as one of the most respected vocalists in bluegrass and acoustic music.   she grew up playing guitar and singing folk, blues and rock in kansas city, mo and was awarded a scholarship to the oberlin conservatory of music where she earned her bachelorâs and masters degrees in voice.  she later studied in a doctoral program at indiana u. with metropolitan opera star eileen farrell and moved to nashville in 1980.  she worked with the doug dillard band, vassar clements, the country gazette,  jerry douglas, edgar meyer and mark oâconnor before forming her own group.
 
kathy has toured the us, uk, europe, japan extensively and was the first bluegrass artist to perform in the faroe islands.  "it was nothing less than a volcano of a concert,  a country and bluegrass victory, where the acoustic instruments and a big voice filled every corner." in the faroes to castleford, england "nothing short of incredible", to kenilworth, england "the audience - not all bluegrass fans, were captivated....awesome." 
  
kathy released her fourth album somehow, in may of 2007.  it is her first recording of all original songs and incorporates diverse influences; bluegrass, blues, jazz, latin, and country with an extraordinary cast of musicians including victor wooten, edgar meyer, darrell scott, stuart duncan, jeff coffin, joey misculin, rob ickes, and flamenco greats chuscales and yiyi. it received a five star cd of the month review in the august, 2007 issue of the uk's country music people magazine.
 
kathyâs third cd, "from where i stand, a personal tribute," is her last release. âthis doesnât fall under any genre--itâs emotion, raw and rare. itâs so beautiful i feel i may never hear anything so eloquent again. there are tunes kathy and randy cut before he left us; there are originals; thereâs one song i heard kathy and randy do on many occasions where we all laughed uproariously; but mostly, thereâs kathyâs voice and the feeling of loss......and unbearable beauty.â ginger boatwright, recording artist
 
kathyâs second cd, "the harvest" features her band, the late randy howard, the late roy huskey, and brent truitt with guests chet atkins, emmylou harris, tony rice, bela fleck, john cowan, bill monroe, and vince gill. the chicago tribune hailed it one of the top five bluegrass cdâs of â96. the songs span traditional bluegrass to the contemporary songs of peter rowan, marcus hummon, john hartford, bob lucas & two originals. her duet with bill monroe is believed to be his last vocal recording.

"only superlatives can describe this stunning album. wonderfully sung, superbly played, but, more importantly, constructed with care and not constrained within the bluegrass straitjacket. explodes another theory-no one sings a john hiatt song better than john hiatt. should be compulsory listening for anyone about to record an acoustic album."
~ john atkins, critics choice favourite albums of 1996, country music people

"time and time again her stunning performance raised the roof."
~ country music people
"i adore kathy's wonderful voice and so did this festival audience. she cast a musical spell over all of us that i will long cherish...an unforgettable performance.
~ international country music news and routes
"backed by just her own guitar and the hugely expressive fiddle work of world champion randy howard, she enthralled the audience with a vocal purity, pitch and control that was nothing short of beautiful..."
~ country musicpeople
"kathy, 'the voice', holds any audience spellbound when she sings, we sat there absolutely entranced as did other members of the audience. randy howard's fiddle playing has to be seen to be believed. what a combination these two artists make. absolute bliss."
~ north country music
