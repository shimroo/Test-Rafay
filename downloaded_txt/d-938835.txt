group picture 2025 "class photo"official pixel joint group picture 2025 collab starts now. this year's topic is class photo. we will be representing ourselves with portraits including upper bodies. any form of representation is allowed. it doesn't have to be a realistic portrait; it can be any style and any form.

the first sitting row is reserved for the mod team only, and all users will take their standing spots in subsequent rows above. on the day of launch, only the second row is open, but we will unlock new spots while your submissions are filling in.

rules:

1) the mandatory palette is fading 16 by copheemoth.

2) claim your spot on the pj forum the same way as iso collab tiles are claimed - the first comment takes the spot. the spots differ in size (64, 72 or 80 px wide), so choose the one you will need for your art. if you don't see your preferred size available, wait for another level to unlock. if you decide that you need a different size after the claim, you can change it by releasing one that you have and claiming another.

3) your avatar (if you are going for an anthropomorphic being) should be located in the middle of your spot, facing front, with the head in the middle. you should fit the elbows more or less above the heads of two characters from the level below you.

4) you have to present your wip in 3 days and then a finished picture in another 11 days (14 days total). if you currently do not have time, don't claim. others are waiting too. don't worry, the collab will last until the end of the year. any modifications to a finished submission are allowed only if moderators will accept them, but only in the inside of your work; the top outline, once sealed, cannot be changed.

5) if you manage to present your wip in 3 days, but fail to finish the whole thing in two weeks you will loose your spot claim. you are able to reclaim it only if someone already didn't claim it for themselves. if that happens you will have to claim a different available spot, and adapt the bottom of your wip to a new surroundings.

6) all top edges of the row need to be connected with a "white" border. the first person who finishes their claim decides on the shoulder height connection. if your neighbour is done before you, you have to connect yours to theirs. it is better to share wips with your neighbours and work in the spirit of collaboration to prevent difficult problems to solve later.

7) you cannot pass the white outline under your spot and draw on top of finished pieces from the previous row.

8) extending your character to your neighbour's spot is allowed if your neighbour agrees to it, and mods allow it (look at mirre's mermaid tail example). also, working together with your neighbour with things like holding hands or a two-headed monster is allowed.

9) your finished work has to be submitted with transparency above the white outline (around the head and shoulders), and if parts of your artwork do go overboard to your neighbour's spot, add transparency and your part only, without their part.
