our history






















nashville dance center was founded by terry tomlinson in 2002, who worked tirelessly to create a supportive environment, where a child may come to explore creativity through dance. along with her daughter, leah, she built the studio into the family that it is today.after 55 years in the dance industry, terry decided to officially hang up her dance shoes.  in july 2024, andrea greene, with her husband gary, bought the studio to continue ndcâ€™s rich legacy.  andrea worked at ndc for 10 years after performing for 6 years in the nashville ballet, amongst many other performing credits. she is beloved by her students for her compassion, positivity and love for all that walk through the door of ndc. all of our classes are taught by certified professional teachers and choreographers who are dedicated to teaching and sharing their love of dance and talents with our students.
