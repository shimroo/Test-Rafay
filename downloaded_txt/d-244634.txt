student opportunities

 





              connect with industry leaders
            

our industry practice leaders are resources to faculty and students, serving in a number of ways, including advising and mentoring on senior capstone projects, delivering guest lectures, and more.
 





              head off road with capstone projects
            

capstone projects can take students to unexpected places — like competing in a baja car race in the desert. 
 





              engineering design showcase
            

poster presentations for and by students are also attended by faculty, industry leaders and members of the community interested in networking with stem students.
 





              study abroad with seaver in germany
            

stem students can gain international experience with seaver's study abroad in bonn, germany. read more about the opportunities and connections a global campus can offer you.

“i particularly enjoy working with students year after year on research projects. you can see students develop a sense of direction as they mature in their studies. the questions they ask are more thought provoking and their methods of analyses are more in depth.”
- anna bargagliotti, professor of mathematics
