the hat that cowboys wear

atwood

est. 1996

see our hats







since 1996
“we put the x’s in the hat, not just the sweatband.”

atwood hat company was originally housed in a 12-by-16-foot portable building on dick and sharon atwood’s ranch. the company has since grown to become a leader in the western hat industry.​
today, atwood hat company has moved back to the ranch. located in a 12,000 square-foot warehouse and office complex, the company continues to grow, furnishing its customers with the finest cowboy hats possible.
atwood hats are built to work hard, last long, and look great. we don’t put the atwood name on any hat we make unless it passes stringent inspection. that way, we know you’re getting the very best quality cowboy hat.
