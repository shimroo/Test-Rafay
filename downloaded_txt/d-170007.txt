saint xavier’s core values stood out to me. the institution’s diversity and hospitality
                                          made me feel welcomed, and the faculty truly care about their students. i loved my
                                          education. i could not see myself at any other school, and i am grateful to have been
                                          part of sxu.

my experience at sxu was beyond anything i could have imagined. the community we have
                                          built is like no other – fun, inclusive, and fruitful. my courses aligned well with
                                          my career interests, and i participated in on-campus activities like paint jams. i
                                          also had the opportunity to design the 2024 senior thesis exhibition postcards.

the financial aid provided by the university further solidified my choice, making
                                          pursuing my degree financially sustainable. beyond academics, the welcoming and supportive
                                          campus culture at sxu resonated with my values, creating an environment where i felt
                                          empowered to thrive both academically and personally. sxu embodies everything i was
                                          seeking in a university, making it the perfect fit for my educational journey and
                                          professional aspirations.
