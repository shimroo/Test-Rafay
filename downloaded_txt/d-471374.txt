john j. mearsheimer
i am the r. wendell harrison distinguished service professor in the political science department at the university of chicago, where i have taught since 1982.
above all else, i am an international relations theorist. more specifically, i am a realist, which means that i believe that the great powers dominate the international system, and they constantly engage in security competition with each other, which sometimes leads to war.
although i have dedicated my life to scholarship, i have also engaged in the policy debates of the day. for example, i was one of the most outspoken opponents of the 2003 iraq war before it happened, and i have been deeply involved in the public discourse about the conflicts in gaza and ukraine. i firmly believe that social science theories are invaluable for making and analyzing foreign policy.
