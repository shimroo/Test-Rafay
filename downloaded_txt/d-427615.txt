mad poets society has been an integral part of the philadelphia writing community for many years. with more than 100 members in six states, and some members worldwide, we are an active organization of poets and writers who have joined together for camaraderie and critique with heart, to celebrate the creative soul and to promote the literary arts. the mad poets has coordinated well over 1500 readings since 1986; offering dozens of events each year, including master classes, informative workshops, informal critique circles, open mic nights, and poetry readings featuring talented and distinguished local, regional and national poets, musicians and writers.
