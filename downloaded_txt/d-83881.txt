everyone enjoys a good mystery...but not everyone gets to solve one!



since 1985, we’ve presented interactive comedy-mysteries for companies, theatres, and other groups.  these were so successful  and popular that we made our scripts available to theatres, schools, and other mystery-lovers. to date, over 1,000 groups around the world have used moushey scripts and production packages to produce their own mysteries.  whether you want to present a mystery fund-raiser, dinner theatre production, special event, or ‘regular’ performance, you’ve come to the right place for scripts and production help. 













what is a moushey mystery?mysteries by moushey are a combination game, party, and theatrical production.  each event is as much comedy as mystery!  it begins as the audience enters and the actors, in character, circulate, establish relationships, and stage improvisational scenes — all of which “set up” the mystery that will unfold and that the audience will solve!  it's mystery, mirth, and mayhem!

who produces mysteries? theatres (community and professional) and high schools and colleges and organizations can get in on the mystery-comedy act.   in fact, any group that wants to present a fun interactive event or stage an unusual fundraiser can produce.  it helps to have someone with minimal theatre experience on board, but we have had folks with varied experience do our shows.
