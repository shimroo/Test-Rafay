new the polly blog coming soon



this blog has felt a little left out from all the new oshkoshneighborhoods.com changes. so, very soon it will have a completely new look and a regular bi-weekly (if not more) posting.blogger has been a bit limiting so we are moving to a dynamic and creative location. check back early next week to see this roll out.thanks for all the visit during this year period with blogger.polly

social marketing



how do we develop relationships today? since bowling alone began the discussion, we appear to have become even more isolated from each other in person. yet, we also appear to be more connected than ever.i go to a conference in orlando while sitting on my couch, throwing questions up on the screen to the moderator, while comments fly from others doing the same thing around the country. then i click over to my tweetdeck to get 140 character live blogging synopsis of the presentations.while watching the packer game, i check on my facebook page and learn an old classmate of mine just got engaged. when i write on their wall another old friend pops up asking for friend status. i look away from the game for a minute and miss a really ugly injury to a vikings player. the commentators say it is so bad they won't show the video. i turn again to my tweetdeck and send out a request for an answer. within a minute comes a response from a guy in fond du lac that i have chatted with a couple of times with an answer.are any of these relationships? if not, why not?i write blog posts in several places. people comment, sometimes loudly, and i feel i know every one of them. even if i haven't broken bread or had a beer with them, i still have a connection. i would like some time to meet everyone i chat with on line, but for now, knowing i am talking with folks and sharing stories, to me is a relationship.

my first listing



i have my first listing, okay it is my house, but i think it counts (my broker said yes). as it is my first listing, i have been experimenting with many ways to market it. i have no preconceptions of what is good or bad when it comes to home marketing so i will try pretty much anything.of course i went with the few musts: realtor.com, balloonhomes.com, my site and the mls. to not do these would be malpractice. but what after that? the first sunday after i listed it, we held an open house. to drive folks to the listing i mailed out 160 invitations to the neighbors, friends and folks i thought would be great advocates. i also put an open house ad in the oshkosh northwestern's sunday homes addition. during the two hour open house 33 separate "buyers" attended. this does not include identifiable neighbors and friends. i think this was a pretty good attendance.the next week i expanded my reach and added a facebook page for the house. i also scheduled another open house for that sunday, but no invitations. on the facebook page i sent out invitations to all my oshkosh friends alerting to the open house event. another ad ran in the northwestern. a dear friend and colleague of mine, kris villars, hosted the open house this time. she reported 15 additional buyers came through, including one who saw the house on facebook.i also purchased a domain for the house and gave it its own website: http://www.1249merrittave.com. i added more pictures to realtor.com and twittered about the house. i sent out fliers to other real estate agents who had buyers looking for houses like mine. i got slapped for doing that. apparently an agent in oshkosh took offense and requested the mls board make me stop mailing new listing fliers. don't understand that one.so, how is it going? there is a lot of interest, phone calls, emails, showings, but no offers, yet. i am open to all ideas for further marketing options. i am going to post to craigslist and will continue to mail out fliers to targeted parties. when your first listing is your own house, you can learn a lot and try anything, your client won't mind.

near east on council agenda tonight



it may come down to tonight! will the promises made to the residents of the near east neighborhoods be kept or will the council again let down another neighborhood, another home owner, another family?two years ago the common council told the residents of this wonderful inner core community that if they invested in their properties, took care of each other and worked with city officials to help stabilize this neighborhood, the city in turn would crack down on crime, vacant landlords and others who degrade the area with neglect and disrespect. now the council is threatening to take away these protections and turn it into a political football, subject to the whims of each council member, none of which actually live in the neighborhood.at the last meeting it was obvious who was leaning on the council and bending their ear. it was not the home owners who have poured their life savings into their homes and properties, no it was landlords. one council member even parroted the landlord association talking points when explaining support for all the poor people who can't afford to live in a well kept up and safe neighborhood. i would like an explanation of how a "poor" person who puts $50,000 of their extremely hard earned money into buying a home is less worthy than the owners of a $500,000 home.if you care about this issue, if you care about our neighborhoods, if you care about your own neighborhood, if you are tired of absentee folks having more say about your neighborhood than you do, then please attend this meeting and say so.it also never hurts to call each council member ahead of the meeting. it is amazing how the last person/group to whisper in their ear gets their vote.

september oshkosh housing report - a little late



the average sold price for a home in the city of oshkosh in september was $140,613. it sold for 94.8% of its listed price and spent 179 days on the market. this was an increase of 47 days on the market from 132 days in august. in 2007 a house sold in oshkosh for an average price of $144,551, sold for 93.9 of its list price and spent 165 days on the market. the total number of residential sales in the city for september was 88, a drop of 12 houses sold from september of 2007. a monthly change from 117 homes sold in august.homes selling under $100,000 made up 34% of the homes sold in september, with homes selling between $100,000 and $200,000 making up 50%. homes selling over $200,000 made up 16% of all residential sold.of the 114 homes sold in september 42% had 3 bedrooms and 48% had 2 bathrooms.into october, the city of oshkosh had 1125 homes currently for sale. that number is down from the 1197 homes in inventory at the beginning of september and an inventory of 1227  homes listed at the beginning of october 2007.analysis:year over end oshkosh is holding its own. our home prices are only down .9% on average from september 2007, $140,613 vs. $144,551. days on market increased by 14 but the home sold for a higher percentage listing price.our inventory of homes for sale continues to drop significantly. the 102 fewer homes on the market from last year is making the options for home buyers smaller. a home seller might see this drop as a great opportunity to take advantage of less competition. still, the tight credit market is a primary concern for both sellers and buyers. there are great mortgage programs available for all price ranges. down payments still run the gamut as well. first time buyers can qualify for a 3.5% down programs, but you need pretty good credit to get a low interest rate.f.i.c.o. scores of 750 are now the norm for the best rates. this does not mean you can't get a loan, it just may cost a little more. when things get better, and frankly they have to sometime, you can refinance into a lower rate. life goes on and changes continue. if you need to buy a house because you need more space or less space is now better, don't try to game the housing market. if now is your time, go for it.
