holiday and satay bar



we are leaving for our holiday today, things have been pretty hectic and i have been hogging the computer for my thesis, so poor toby hasn't had a chance to blog at all lately.we probably won't be blogging much for the next couple of weeks while we are away, although we might be able to on our first stop to hong kong since we will be staying with toby's family and have internet access, but i can't promise anything because i expect to be stuffing myself silly with vegan yum cha and shopping til i drop. then we are off to london and berlin where i don't expect much internet time at all.  but i have some news:toby and i are going to start a new combined blog when we get back and i finally have a decent camera, which makes a pretty good change from my camera phone.anyway on to the food, when i worked in the city i used to frequent satay bar and toby is now a regular eater there. it's a small cafe, which tends to be quite busy at lunch time on weekdays but makes a awesome take away lunch option for city workers. we recently confirmed in writing that all of the veg options are vegan. you can choose from tofu skewers, spicy tofu skewers or vegetables skewers. for $8.40 you can get two skewers, satay sauce and two sides (rice/salad/krupak). the satay sauce is certainly the best tasting satay i've ever had. and the krupuk have the texture of vegi chips or prawn crackers but with a more natural flavour.toby being a big eater always get the larger pack with 3 skewers:satay barcorner of flinders lane & custom house lanemelbourne.phone 9629 1466mon - fri 10am - 7pm www

a bitch about doing a thesis



hi everyone, remember me? i'm not back but in need of a bitch about my thesis, so feel free to skip over this post and warning that it's long and pretty negative. i really really really hate working on a thesis. i am very close to finishing it and have to present soon which probably makes me hate it even more, so will be interesting to compare notes about how i feel once i have finished.i find doing a thesis to be pretty alienating, probably because no-one else i know is doing a thesis, well apart from those lucky ones who have scholarships and get to do them during regular work hours and get paid to do it. i love socialising and really hate missing out, lately it feels like everyone else is having fun except me, which i'm sure isn't entirely true but it certainly feels like it.also, i could slap the next person who makes a comment about how long it has taken me. yes it has taken me a while, but i am studying part time and for the most part have been working full time-ish hours and i work in a pretty draining  job so the last thing i want to do when i come home is any sort of work. also, i had one topic that fell apart (not my fault). anyway give me a break, ok! and no more questions about when i am going to finish, i'll finish when i finish, i don't know. i have been working all year on aiming to get it done before i got away, but that's not going to happen.one of my biggest hates about the thesis thought is guilt, when i do socialise, or go to a potluck or just have a day when i am not productive i get pretty pissed off at myself, i think it is made even worse by people who feel that they are helping by checking up on me with questions like 'did you work on your thesis?', 'how much did you get done today'. i have enough guilt myself, i don't need you giving me more! i think some people are born academics and love writing, but i really don't as you can probably tell for my disregard for grammar on this blog. it's not really my thing. i don't think i have disliked myself more than when doing a stupid thesis, there are certain conversations that i have with myself where i occasionally feel like i can't do it, like i'm not smart enough, that i'm lazy, that anyone could do it but me. it's not all the time but occasionally often when i hit a wall and am feeling stuck on one part. there does appear to be a bit of a cycle too where i feel so guilty and then hate myself a little more and then actually be less productive.there is such a major part of me that has wanted to just give up for quite a while, but i am now so close to finishing it, i'm sure if i did give up i would regret it forever. i also i would feel like i am letting the participants of the study down, which i don't think i could manage.i hate the stress and avoidance around supervision, almost every time i have a  appointment with my supervisor i think to myself, she is going to tell me off, she is going to say that what i have done is stupid, and i need to justify why i haven't done more etc. which is kind of crazy because my supervisor has been pretty awesome and i know i wouldn't have been able to get this far without her.i really really want to be planning our holidays destinations right now but don't have the time which i hate. i feel like i might have a crappy holiday because i am not planned anything and will have a thesis hanging over my head the whole time. so if you do have any sort of tips for must eats/visits in hong kong, london, or berlin please let me know.i could go on further but won't.thanks for the big whinge, it feel a tiny bit better to get that off my chest! and yes i know there are bigger much worse problems in the world.

a minor place and darth vader



just a few things before tonight's main event:1) light n i n g   bo lt: secret show (at) irene. \m/2) check out  photos of vegan fitness week melbourne.  (photos by noah)3) dean wareham, from my favourite band galaxie 500, blogged about his recent melbourne tour and the "memorable in-store at pure pop records in st. kilda".4)matt preston wrote about trippy taco.5) my heart is broken: bulmbers is not veg*n.  and guess what?  also most apple juice brands are not veg*n neither."it's not you, it's me."kristy and i rode our bikes to a minor place (103 albion street, brunswick) for breakfast last saturday.  the soy latte was pretty good.the pretty bonsoy spiral what did we eat?  henry's beans.  it is made of cannellini beans (kristy's favourite), garlic, rosemary (kristy's pet hate) topped with dukkah, and served with lemon.  they were not bad in my book.  *pointing mic to kristy* "what do you think about the beans, kristy?".  kristy: "i was reluctant to go just for one bean dish, but i was pleasantly surprised."this is pretty much the only vegan option.  they also stock crumb's vegan muffins.pip, the cooking god, tried to make it at home.  her version looks like the lost twin of henry's beans, but i haven't tried it though.i bought an all black keepcup.  it has saved quite a few paper cups since i bought it two weeks ago.  i call it darth vader.
