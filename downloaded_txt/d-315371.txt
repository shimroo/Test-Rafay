											what is natural remedy for arthritis pain?
									 	

turmeric helps with inflammation
take 1000 milligrams of turmeric daily if suffering with arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis pain. turmeric, the asian yellow-rich spice found in curry, is a natural anti-inflammatory substance that helps the arthritis sufferer deal with achy, inflammed joints. turmeric can be added to your diet. added to egg salad or rice, it gives the dish a rich hue and middle eastern flavor. place a couple of teaspoons in the soup pot for extra flavor and color.  turmeric can also be taken in a capsule form. find the capsule at most natural food stores. it is typically mixed with piperine or black pepper extract to aid absorption of the healthy effects of turmeric. you can also purchase the turmeric in bulk along with capsule shells and make your own supplement to take.  however you take turmeric, the anti-inflammatory benefits will be noticeable.

											is chocolate unhealthy?
									 	

will chocolate affect my arthritis?
there are different types of arthritis, with different causes and factors which can improve or worsen the condition. some persons believe that eating foods such as caffeine, chocolate, red wine, sugar, dairy products and red meats can make your arthritis worse.
according to arthritis magazine and about.com, as with any medical condition, certain foods, activities and medications affect each person differently.
some people have demonstrated a sensitivity to caffeine, chocolate and red wine, which adversely affects their arthritis, while others do not appear to have any trouble consuming these foods. studies cannot rule out the placebo effect - thinking that not eating the food will make you better, in fact, does make you better.
you may wish to try removing certain foods from your diet, one food at a time, to see if there is any change in your arthritis. then you can definitely decide whether or not chocolate is unhealthy for you and your type of arthritis.

											i take a medication that needs to be refrigerated daily.  i am planning a trip to europe and need to know what i can buy for keeping my medication cool throughout my stay.  there will be no refrigerator in the room.
									 	

keeping your medication cold
there are portable refrigeration devices that would meet your needs, and that could make the trip with you, due to their small size and portability. 
the one that i think would best meet your travelling refrigeration needs is the engel 15 portable freezer. it provides for both freezing and refrigeration options and runs on a 12-volt battery or 110 household current. it is used by ems/ambulance personnel and public health nurses to maintain proper temperatures for medications and cold packs, as well as for personal medications when camping, boating or travelling. 
the specs are as follows: 
model number mrfd-015d-a 
volume 14 qts - capacity 21 (12 oz) cans 
inside dims (inches) 13.75 x 7.5 x 7.5 
outside dims (inches) 17 x 11 x 14.5 
freezing ability from zero to 80 degrees 
variable temp control 
weight 23.5 lbs 
shoulder strap 
refrigerant gas type cfc free 134a 
power input dc12v - 3.9a 
power cord 9' detachable 
fuse 10a thermal 
warranty 1 year 
it is available through the dealer - engel - or through other distributors on the internet, such as the cellar store.

											would like to see more products for arthritis. please give me prices and products for arthritis.
									 	

finding arthritis products
there are a variety of different products that aid in the treatment of arthritis, including oral medications, topical treatments and adaptive equipment devices that assist with tasks of daily living, such as pulling on socks and managing buttons. 
the type of arthritis that you have - osteoarthritis, spondyloarthropathy or rheumatoid - will impact the type of treatments and products that you need, as these different types of arthritis have some different symptoms and management guidelines. 
pain management interventions can include: 
 - pain medication patches (fentanyl) 
 - nsaids (non-steroidal anti- 
 inflammatory medications - naprosyn) 
 - narcotics (morphine) 
 - steroids (prednisone) 
 - topical anesthetic patches 
 (lidoderm) 
 - heat packs or ice packs 
 - massage, pt or ot 
 - over the counter analgesics (tylenol) 
life management products can include: 
 - button aides 
 - sock aides 
 - velcro shoes 
 - splints or other positioning devices 
 for your hands 
 - kitchen utensils with oversized 
 handles 
 - electric can-openers and other 
 utility kitchen aides 
natural remedies can include: 
 - capsicum cream or patches 
 - herbal moist packs 
 - warm baths with mineral salts 
 (magnesium) 
i suggest seeing a rheumatologist who can help to determine the type of arthritis you have, and the best way to approach treatment.

											how can i make taking medicine safer?
									 	

medication labels
when taking over the counter medication, such as tylenol, aspirin, or any other medicine you can buy without a prescription you need to always read the label very carefully. it is important that you take the amount the label says and you should also make sure how many hours you should leave between dosages. if you know what the label says it more likely that you won't over drug yourself.

											should i check with my doctor before take new medications?
									 	

nonprescription medications
if you are taking prescription arthritis medication you should always check with your doctor before taking any nonprescription medications. there might be drug interactions you don't know about.
