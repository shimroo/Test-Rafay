    improving outcomes, transforming society


  our research















  home











 chemistry has significantly improved our quality of life in the past century. as we address today’s challenges — like utilizing sustainable energy sources, targeted medications, and quantum technologies — chemistry will be critical. yale chemistry is a community of ~400 people dedicated to research and teaching. our undergraduate majors, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers conduct world-leading research alongside faculty experts and subsequently pursue either graduate study in chemistry or careers in academia and industry.
