welcome to the salinas valley






salinas is the capital of the salinas valley, which has long been known as "the salad bowl of the world" for its fresh produce, and is also renowned for its flowers and vineyards. more recently, the region is emerging as a world hub of agricultural technology.  although agriculture is the foundation of the local economy, more than 100 manufacturing firms call salinas home.
