see why golfers love cranbury


                cranbury golf club, located in west windsor, new jersey, is a classic-style 18-hole golf course featuring small undulating greens that are well bunkered. built in 1964 by gary rhenn, but recently redesigned to include all new green-side bunkers, the course offers excellent playing conditions. unique to cranbury are the six par 3s.  from the par-3 fourth hole, which plays to a yardage of 225 yards over water, to the 12th hole, that, at 155 yards over the "bog" offers players some of the best three shot holes in the area. don't let the par 70 deceive you because the course still plays well over 6,200 yards.
