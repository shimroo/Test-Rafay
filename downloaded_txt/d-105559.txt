state taxes included on your invoice:
as a result of the supreme court ruling during 2018 affecting online sales taxesâ (both state and local taxes),â various states are requiring sales taxâ (both state and local taxes)â on any online sales; therefore, you may now start seeing a separate charge on your invoice for this sales tax. the prices at the conventions will be the same as those online. visit the national conference of state legislatures website for more information.

the creation difference
we pride ourselves on the âcreation difference," which is our strict policy not to "oversell" our conventions. in other words, every patron, no matter what bracket of ticket they purchase, will have a guaranteed seat in the main auditorium where the major guests appear and events take place. there's no worrying, extra waiting, or additional charges to see the celebrities and participate in the activities at our many amazing genre fan conventions. join us!
