				we have spent over 20 years listening to customer feedback and tweaking our apps to perfection. we have solutions that you can depend on for the future, and a history of excellence in customer satisfaction.
			












multi-platform
whenever possible, we develop mac, windows, and mobile versions of our apps. our desktop licenses will unlock the app across all desktop platforms, so there is never a need to buy different licenses depending on your operating system. mobile licenses are always sold separately.









modern & feature-packed
our apps are continually bug tested against the latest versions of software, and always take advantage of new exciting technologies as they become available.









guaranteed
we offer free lifetime customer support for all of our products. even if an older version of an app breaks on the most recent version of macos or windows, we'll give you a discount on the latest version.











practical
everything we design has a distinct mission: to make your life easier so that you can spend less time on the computer and more time living.









intuitive
manuals belong at the dawn of the technological era. we have put countless hours into ensuring that our apps just "make sense" and work the way a human, not computer, expects them to.









industrial strength
designed for the home, but powerful enough for the office, you can rely on our apps to provide unparalleled strength and reliability. enjoy the simplicity of apple-like design, without sacrificing the full spectrum of functionality.









flexible billing & licenses

				whether you use our software every day, or a few times per year, we offer three versatile types of billing options to match your budget.
			
always ensure you have access to the latest version of our apps with an active monthly subscription (billed annually) or a lifetime license. looking for a more affordable option while avoiding subscriptions? no problem! grab a single one-off versioned license. subscriptions are not required to use our apps!
for additional information on the various usage license options, please read our frequently asked questions.

user comments






the guy behind the software makes some great stuff and it's pretty amazing considering the number of apps he has out. i also own this [i bought a bundle of all his apps about a year ago] and i've used it a few times and it's pretty cool! my favourite in his collection is still the alarm clock pro app, though macpilot and swift share also are very cool products. he listens to his users, answers support questions and takes feedback seriously.

josh,you're always working !! best customer support i've ever seen.






dave cuddy








the developer is very responsive to bug reports, taking time to walk through the issues in detail by email. he produced a brand new release fixing a problem i was having in less than 24 hours.

i live in houston, and am a grad student in the medical center next to the astrodome where so many evacuees are housed. i volunteered there and can truly applaud your efforts in support of the red cross. but, i realize that i have never supported you by trying another software program, and that is what i am going to do today.

good luck and keep that personal, sincere touch that has made my business with you so much a pleasure.

btw, i have never written a letter in support of a company before. that says it all.






jeanette








excellent help file and fast support response from you- that's why i love koingo and keep raving about you guys to anyone that will listen.






james wills








thank you. you people are great!






frank

hello, koingosw! a recognition for your excellence in product/updates (fixes) and service.

password retriever, by koingo software, is the best shareware program i have ever purchased. founder, josh hill, does an awesome job of supporting his products. he posts regular updates when ever he makes changes. i emailed josh one night at 11pm and within minutes he emailed me back with the answer i needed to make the program work seamlessly.

password retriever is a great program to save passwords and other secure information. no more post it notes, scraps of paper or notepads with my important information on them. i use this program daily. josh emailed me simple directions so i can transfer my information from my cube to my ibook in 2 easy steps. now both machines are uniform and secure.

i would highly recommend password retriever, the support is worth every penny. josh hill puts his heart and soul into his products.
