about marc













what we do
the monroe association for remarcable citizens is a not for profit agency that provides wrap around life services for adult clients within monroe county who have developmental and intellectual disabilities including cerebral palsy, spina bifida, prader-willi syndrome, and traumatic brain injury sustained prior to age 18.



  

for over 50 years marc has considered ourselves a family in every sense of the word. we do not use this as a catch phrase for we deliver services based on each individual’s needs and life wishes just as you do in any family setting. we have a dedicated staff that strive to give support based on the fundamental belief in the self-worth of every person.​personal relationships and acceptance are two of the most important factors in allowing marc to serve the developmentally and intellectually disabled. such gestures convey recognition and appreciation for the person and their quiet support services. please know of our appreciation for your being a part of that circumstance.

 











our mission
to provide our clients with dignified, compassionate, professional care in a family environment for the duration of their needs.



 











our services
marc provides numerous services for our clients. these services are designed to insure that each client receives training and support that enhances his or her individual abilities to understand daily community routines and learn social, self-care, vocational skills. other services provide medical and therapeutic supervision and help to increase a client’s ability to develop friendships with non-disabled persons.
