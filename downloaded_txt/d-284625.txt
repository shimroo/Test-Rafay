where pets find people 











welcome to our pet rescue & rehoming centre 















 



dog & puppy rescuewe always have dogs that are looking for new homes, puppies obviously get rehomed very fast. older dogs sadly tend to stay with us a lot longer. 







 



small animal rescuerabbits & guinea pigs come in on a regular basis. birds and small rodents frequently arrive at the haven.  wildlife rescue and rehabilitation are also part of our services. 







 



cat & kitten rescuecats choose their owners obviously, so some stay a little longer so they can pick the best of us earthlings. kittens go very fast. 



























“our dedicated animal rescue team are always a pleasure to work with”
