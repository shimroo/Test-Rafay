s.p. kinney engineers, inc. is a family owned and operated engineering and manufacturing company that is located in pittsburgh, pa with a satellite manufacturing facility in richmond, va. selwyne perez kinney opened the company’s doors in 1941 in pittsburgh with a focus on manufacturing equipment for the american steel industry.
he was a graduate of the university of utah with degrees in metallurgy and chemical engineering. he was a member of many engineering associations, and through the years he was the recipient of many awards for his contributions to the iron and steel industries and his extensive experimental studies with the u.s. bureau of mines.
in 1976, his son rol frank kinney took over the company. by this time s.p. kinney was still heavily involved with the steel industry, but it was branching out into other industries with our water filtration lines. craig selwyne kinney took over the company in 2001, and he has been running it ever since.
today our focus is on making quality american-made blast furnace equipment for steel mills around the world and water filtration equipment for any and all industries incorporating raw water or recirculating water in their facilities.
