how does it work? 



cutting your hair using the flowbee system is easy and saves you money!  watch the video to see just how easy and fun it is to cut your own hair!  






 















						i've been using flowbee for many years to cut my own hair. not only is it more convenient and so much cheaper. i can easily do as well as any barber that i've met and better than many of them. personally, my favorite part of the system is that i never get any hair down my neck, which has always been the result of a barber's cut. i've also found that the flowbee makes trimming my mustache and beard quick and easy. an added bonus that i have more recently discovered is that i can provide great haircuts to my grandsons. this gets me more of their visits, which i love. last weekend i cut my 5-year-old grandson's hair. he was kinda tired and had trouble sitting still. i put one of his shows on the tv and let him lie down on the couch with his head on a pillow. it helped a great deal by removing the 'wigglies', as a moving 'target' is a challenge to any system. i let him turn the vacuum on and off and he even giggled a bit when the motion of the spacer tickled now and then. he thinks the cuts are really fun and looks forward to them when he visits. when i'm done, he runs off to check out the result in the bathroom and always comes back with a satisfied grin on his face. please don't ever stop making the flowbee system.

						hi, i just want to thank you for a wonderful product. i bought it in 2008 because after moving to florida, i had a difficult time finding someone to cut my hair. it was always a horrible haircut. i found one person who did a great job, but she moved back to michigan. i found out that the requirements for cutting hair in florida was nowhere near most other states. very easy and didn’t take much. anyone that i finally found wanted to charge $75. excellent hair stylist but too expensive. i found the flowbee, did the math and decided that i needed to use it x amount of times to pay for itself and if i didn’t like it, i would continue looking for somebody. it was very easy and i loved it. it’s paid for itself many times over. thank you for a great product

						when our two sons were very young, we discovered the flow-bee haircutting system.  we are on our third or fourth flow-bee now and still saving hundreds of dollars each year on haircuts.  we no longer have to cut our sons' hair for they are grown and out of the house, but we continue to cut our own.  we recommend the system to others several times each year because we are so grateful to have had it available to us.  thank you for continuing to provide parts and oil; we've just reordered.  thirty plus years and counting!
