stewart marinealuminum boat headquartersjack stewart (founder) has been in the aluminum boat business for over 40 years and has sold the vast majority of the boats presently on the n.y.c. reservoir system. he has fished these waters for over 70 years and has extensive knowledge and expertise on reservoir fishing for all species. for over 20 years he authored the popular southern new york fishing directory which is no longer printed due to health problems. we are presently expecting to make much of the contents from previous fishing directories available online for all to see. brendan vreeland, jack’s grandson, has since taken over the business. a fisherman himself, he spends his free time fishing the nyc reservoirs and hunting dep land. he has great knowledge on all boats, kayaks, canoes and trailers. he also has extensive knowledge on how the dep operates and can answer any questions you may have. brendan has over 15 years of experience in repairing boats and has brought wide width fishing kayaks into the business. stewart marine not only sells reservoir boats but both new and used semi-v's and jon boats. we also sell larger boat packages, trailers, dinghies, kayaks and canoes.free delivery to home or reservoir. trade-ins welcome.open monday - friday from 8-5 and saturday from 9-4.
