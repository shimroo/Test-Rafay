weekends: by appointmentfaqswhat are the benefits of trueheart-truemind?there are many benefits to this process: focused self-awareness, confidence, ability to self express, improved emotional awareness and expression, clarity of personal options, decision making development, clear articulation of what you want in life and an appreciation of your life process. this is an opportunity for personal transformation.what can i expect from my first session?the first session includes intake and mutual assessment. we’ll take the time to determine if working together will be a good match. you’ll learn the foundations of what i do and what you can expect if we continue forward. we begin by getting to know one another. many feel comfortable right away and begin personal dialogues that help illuminate why they have come in.how soon can i expect to see results?some people feel better about their situation after their first visit…it’s powerful to be heard without judgement or criticism. for others more time is required to feel comfortable expressing themselves. results are dependent on different factors: what your goals are, how comfortable you are being open and honest, if you’ve had previous experience in similar settings, etc. i encourage people to examine progress gradually. the trueheart-truemind process is an ongoing process determined by you, and facilitated by me.see all faqsblogchoose your wordsoctober 29, 20175 steps to transform conflictfebruary 27, 2016see all blog posts
