how do i get an account on this system?
actually, most people do not need a t10 account. the first time you click on a link to download a file, you will be 
asked for a little information and to agree that the incits notification on file access is acceptable (t10 does not 
share this information). a cookie is stored in your browser saying you have already agreed, so you don't have to fill out the 
form every time. click here for more details on t10 document access.
you also do not need an account to subscribe to the t10 email reflector. click here to subscribe.
you need an incits membership if you plan to vote on t10 letter ballots. you need an incits account or a t10 
account if you wish to upload proposals without administrator approval.
you can obtain an account by filling out the form at incits
or by contacting a t10 officer.









please visit the sta forum, a snia technology community at
https://www.snia.org/groups/sta-forum/
for more information about sas and scsi.
