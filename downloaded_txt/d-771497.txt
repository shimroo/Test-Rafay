what we do
a big thank you to those who attended our 50th anniversary celebration, october 18th, at chateau rive!

community frameworks, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and a neighborworks® america chartered member, is based in washington state, with offices in spokane and bremerton.
community frameworks’ organization grew out of expo 74’s environmental symposium series, which was based on the belief that it was critical for citizens to be involved in shaping the future of the institutions that affected their lives. early on, northwest regional facilitators, as it was called then, heard from neighborhood residents about the importance of housing, which ultimately became the cornerstone of our work. at the core of our work is the belief that when people have a place to call home that allows them to live within their means, they can focus on the other important aspects of their lives. when that happens, we all do better  as a community.
our mission is to create affordable housing as a catalyst to help communities thrive.
to accomplish this mission, we develop affordable multi-family and supportive housing, provide homeownership opportunities for hard working families, and teach and counsel families on budgeting, credit, and homeownership topics. we also work with other nonprofits, by providing technical assistance, financing, or by developing affordable housing for them.
news: the us dept. of housing & urban development  (hud) self-help homeownership opportunity program’s (shop) fy2023 awards have been announced, and community frameworks has received an award of $5,250,000! this will support our affiliates in washington, oregon, idaho, and montana in the development of 170 affordable homes.

our history
in 1974, citizens in spokane, washington created northwest regional foundation (nrf) to gain a citizen voice in the use of federal community development block grant money that had become available for the “betterment of communities.” with the name later modified to northwest regional facilitators, nrf dedicated its efforts to “helping individuals, groups and communities overcome obstacles and seize opportunities to create their preferred futures.
in the years that followed, nrf focused primarily on affordable housing initiatives, but in keeping with its broad mission, worked in a number of related community development arenas. by 2000, nrf’s work had divided into three major areas: affordable housing, family care resources and northwest nonprofit resources.
beginning in 2004, nrf decided to focus directly on its affordable housing strengths, and so spun off its related but separate elements into separate nonprofit organizations.
known today as community frameworks, the organization’s primary focus is on housing. community frameworks provides services that include affordable rental opportunities, homeownership education and development, affordable housing development services for other organizations, technical assistance to other community housing groups, and pass-through lending to homeownership production programs in the region.
