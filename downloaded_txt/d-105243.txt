square haven, the venerable final fantasy, kingdom hearts, and all things square enix resource























march 28, 1998 - march 28, 2008




				square haven has ceased updates indefinitely. this vestige will remain accessible, however, as a testament to those that 
				contributed so much to it over its lifespan. the work that began here more than a decade ago continues at 
				videogam.in.
			
   

				thanks so much to everyone who made square haven a great community over the years. your words and contributions have been a true gift 
				to us all, and we appreciate every minute you have given to enrich our experience here, all in the name of videogames.
