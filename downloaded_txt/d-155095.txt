bichons rescued























tammy preast & david campbell & lily & timbit





there’s no love like bichon love. small paws rescue has helped us fulfill that love by finding adult or senior bichons to join our little family….over the years we’ve adopted 6 bichons with small paws help.  as young as 3 and as old as 11…our current bichon kidlets were adopted at ages 6 and 9.  they turned 11 and 12 this year.  every day they make our world complete and fill our hearts with joy.  lily and timbit (and all those before them) have brought laughter and love to every person they meet.  our entire neighborhood knows & adores our bichons!!  our lovely boy, timbit, lost a leg to cancer this year, but it hasn’t slowed him down for a minute.  every day with a sp bichon is truly a gift providing you with a lifetime of happy memories in one little fluffy body.  we cannot thank robin and small paws rescue for sharing these precious souls with all of us lucky enough to welcome them into our lives.












peggy dercole & taylor





i just wanted to inform you i adopted taylor from you 12-1/2 years ago from a foster mom in oklahoma when she was 5 years old and her family gave her up because they were moving. i still believe otherwise that they were done with her past her breeding age. so sad for them but she has been the love of my life and she is now 17-1/2 years old and still acts younger than her years. right now she looks just like the bichon photo on the bottom of this page. small paws rescue is such a blessing for these beautiful fur babies! thank you for all you do. 












linda norris & jack, sugar bear, & bailey





i started with in texas in 2001 when my husband died.  i needed someone to take care of and discovered spr.  i am 76 and no longer physically able to do as much as i did, but continue to do as much as i can.  i have three senior boys that mean the world to me…jack – 17, sugar bear – 14, and bailey – 9.  the words in your letter to robin are such a wonderful and well deserved tribute to a superb organization.  i know of no place else that would look at little hobbit and see any kind of future for him.  i want to give you my appreciation and respect for all that you do.  it is the good lord’s grace and amazing and dedicated volunteers like you that make this all work.  thank you so very much for being there for the precious little fluffs that have been so misused.  my prayers and blessings go with you.












chris mummert & gracie





two years ago today i got my first dog from small paws—gracie aka phoebe. thanks for all you do to help these sweet dogs and give people like me the opportunity to love and care for them. you are appreciated!












kathy sullivan & colby





here is my sweet boy colby who just turned 15 yrs old 9/9. i adopted him 14 yrs ago from small paws and he flew to ri airport to start his new life! he has been the love of my life!












marge gottesman & abby





hi robin, in a few days it will be 3 years since small paws abby came into my life. she was a "griever puppy" who i adopted shortly after losing my bichon of 16 years. abby's mother, who said she was part bichon and you believed her, was rescued barefoot and pregnant, along with her male companion by small paws.  abby might not be a bichon, but she is a small pawser, and the sweetest, most loving, gentle dog i have ever known. attached is her picture modeling her favorite leopard coat. this is her "gotcha" day! 












sandy hamel & kelly





haven’t sent any pictures in awhile so here are a few and a brief update on my precious girl. 
she will be 11 this month as best i can guess since she arrived to me at 8 months old in july, 2008. we recently retired from pet therapy at oak park school for special needs kids. it was my choice after 10 years to retire (not kelly’s) due to a rotator cuff injury i suffered last year which was preventing me from lifting her so that the kids could hold her. she did win 1st place in the “dog days of summer” contest at heron club, an assisted living facility, where kelly still does pet therapy with the seniors there who just adore her. she always wears a different dress each time we go so she knows that she is “working”. 












sara rhodes & cruiser





cruiser came into my life when i needed him.  he was a blessing sent from small paws.  he is smart, funny and so loving ! he is my ❤️.
