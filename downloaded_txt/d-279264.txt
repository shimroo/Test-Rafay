story











"seeing is more than merely looking, it involves noticing things." - ned smith
 
nestled in the scenic susquehanna valley of central pennsylvania, the ned smith center serves as a leading institution in the region for the collection and sharing of art and natural history, especially when nature and the arts intersect and reinforce one another.
as a repository for the art, writings, and other work of renowned pennsylvania wildlife artist ned smith, we take our inspiration from his life, work, and interests.
we hope all who visit our facility or lands experience the center as a vibrant cornerstone of the cultural, economic, social, and environmental life of our community. we therefore seek to welcome and appeal to people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds across pennsylvania and beyond.
