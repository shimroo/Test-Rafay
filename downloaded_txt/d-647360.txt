michael andriolo



chris and his team helped us out with last minute wheelchair transportation arrangements. the entire team was accommodating and punctual. i would recommend alternative transportation for anyone’s transportation needs.




















maggie



great service! i take this van to and from my appointments twice a week over an hour each way!the drivers i’ve had are all very nice, some of them talk to you the entire time and some don’t say anything to you other than hello etc. they are very professional and have video cameras in the vehicle to monitor the ride.it’s very safe and comfortable. great for wheelchairs too, sometimes there are wheelchair clients that we drop off along my route home. would definitely recommend using this service. they come to your door when they arrive which is a nice bonus.




















joanne fagan



when my mom needed transportation in her wheelchair, i went searching for options.i had remembered seeing alternative transportation vans drive by often. i knew it had to be in the area.when i looked them up i saw they provide service all over. i booked a ride and we were very happy with the service.they arrived on time and provided safe and secure transportation. my mom loves to talk to the people she meets and the driver was friendly and patient. will definitely continue to use them!




















jeanie hackley



i have used them more than once. on time, very courteous and patient. my friend is not the easiest of people to get into a car and get settled, the driver took his time with us and never made us feel like we were holding him up. the car they had sent for us was very nice, clean and roomy. i have recommended them many time!




















jessica legrand



my father-in-law, a vietnam veteran, used this service for a knee operation at the va. he thoroughly enjoyed his timely ride. speaking with the driver was a highlight of the trip. the drivers really take the time to connect with the riders. he is looking forward to using this service again. thank you to all our veterans!




















barbara schuster



i have been extremely pleased with the service from ats. the first time i used then was during the height of the pandemic. needless to say, i was a bit apprehensive, but the pleasant and organized staff reassured me of the safety measures they had in place to keep everyone safe. (and we were!) i was amazed at all the work they did to clean the vehicle after each patient. i didn’t hesitate to call them back recently when i needed their assistance. this is one of the easiest, personable and down to earth organization to utilize. i have referred them to everyone that has needed their type of services. you cannot go wrong with ats.




















katherine cope



my mom was tranferred to ma after an accident in fl. alternative transport was kind, easy to work with, and right on time. our driver will was able to handle our luggage at the airport and get her secured into the transport van. it made the last leg of a long journey home very positive!
