"a very cute sewing shop! they keep a good selection of fabrics and accessories on hand. they specialize in bernina brand sewing machines. i decided to get my old machine out of the closet and start sewing again, but it was long overdue for some maintenance. i was able to get a 2-day turnaround, and now my machine works like new! the employees all enjoy sewing and love to chat with you about project ideas or tips. they also have an email newsletter and several sewing workshops. this place quickly inspires customer loyalty. i will be back!"- veronika r., 1/15/2016
