to the sincere followers of the great lenscrafter:due to certain work-related travels to the far-east that could not be postponed, the great alchemist of digital photography, herr lenscrafter,  has been unable to  post a new puzzle for us. i'm aware that he has several under preparation and he will soon resume posting.in the meantime, i have come across certain disturbing occurrences regarding photoshopping. as educated followers of lenscrafting, i thought you may have something to say about this. the best comments will be compiled into a new post for easier reading.adnan hajj, a formerly well-respected lebanese photo-journalist for reuters, has been caught red-handed by 'shopping enthusiasts like you!link to reuters article about withdrawal of hajj's work. check out the pictures inset.link to nytimes article about bloggers' detective work. needs subscription.link to the la-based bloggomunity that started the detective work.link for the illiterate from bbc's newsnight.peace,sisyphus
