my experience at scc taught me that just because one does not attend a four-year college does not mean that they will not get the right education. it is a great place that offers great opportunities.

apply for your 2025-2026 scholarship today! 
for the 2024-2025 academic year, over $200,000 was awarded through 100 different scholarships to over 100 deserving students. these scholarships help local students, many of whom do not qualify for federal student aid. this money allows students to pay for tuition and books—which in many cases means not having to work two jobs, having extra money for child care, or being able to finish their degree sooner. application will close on april 15, 2025.
