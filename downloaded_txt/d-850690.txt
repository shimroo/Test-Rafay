what we dothe ottawa rape crisis centre (orcc) offers support for people who have experienced sexual and/or gender-based violence in the ottawa region. we do this by offering individual and group trauma counselling, service navigation, psychoeducation, crisis support as well as advocacy for clients and broader systemic change.

land acknowledgementthe ottawa rape crisis centre is located on the unceded, unsurrendered territory of the anishinaabe algonquin nation whose presence here reaches back to time immemorial.  while we are guests on this land, we commit to never losing sight of how this land was stolen, or how ongoing colonialism impacts us all today.
