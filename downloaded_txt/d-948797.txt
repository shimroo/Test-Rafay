a brief look 












 




the hawaiians - reflecting spirit 



this feature documentary film offers important cultural insights into who the hawaiis are as a people, their origins, and their historical and current social challenges. 















 




unprescribed - prescription for addiction 



this film looks at the history, effects, and addiction epidemic of opioids and benzodiazepines and  fentanyl analogs—  and asks what took our nation so long to address this national health crisis.  








 




paniolo o hawaii - cowboys of the far west 



“what lee has done in irresistible fashion is a splendid example of the enduring power of the traditional documentary. the kind that brings alive an unfamiliar world in a straightforward manner that is as entertaining as it is informative.”
