it is time to renew!   
cruiser fleets please note.  some cruisers have removed initially reported equipment (dinghy motor on stern pulpit, dinghy, etc).  you need to report all removed equipment to get your certificate corrected.  also, if you fly a cruising spinnaker, the 4 sail measurements and jc and ic need to be reported in order to fly the sail in a race or be scored in a boty series.
all valid certificates expire on july 1, 2025. certificates that expire on 7/1/2024 or 7/1/2023 can be renewed on line at renewals & members log in.  if you certificate expired 7/1/2022 or earlier, click new application to access the new application.
the west florida performance handicap racing fleet (wfphrf), serves the florida west coast from crystal river to marco island, including all of the tampa bay area.  the objective of wfphrf is to establish and maintain an equitable system of handicapping the boats owned or chartered by its members.
wfphrf does not use measurers.  we rely on the honesty, sportsmanship, and corinthian spirit of the membership to ensure that accurate information about a boat’s configuration is made available to the rating committee for review when determining a boat’s ratings.
wfphrf rates vessels, not skippers or crew. it is assumed that a rated boat will be driven by the owner or his non-professional designee. wpfhrf acknowledges the benefit when professionals are involved in racing and encourages their participation. however, the utilization of professional drivers or paid crew for the purpose of trophy hunting violates the corinthian spirit and amateur nature of this fleet.
wfphrf ratings are performance handicaps, based on the speed potential and performance of a boat.  to the greatest extent possible, race results and observations of actual races provide the data used to determine and monitor ratings.  ratings are determined by members who serve voluntarily as handicappers on the rating committee.
