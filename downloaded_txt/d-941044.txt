what customers are saying...













we’re a small business with a limited number of people. every employee’s hour is valuable to us. so when we can shave hours off of the accounting process while also ensuring that we’re paying things timely and correctly, we can use the hours in our day more effectively in helping to grow the business. telpay helps us do that.

before, we struggled with a labour-intensive, costly cheque process, often facing supplier inquiries. telpay streamlined our ap process, with 90% now electronic, saving significant time and money on resources, and it's eco-friendly! the integration is versatile, and processing payable batches is seamless.

"our average bill run now takes less than an hour and can be done remotely,” says mcauley. “and across all of our clients, we have been able to save at least 20 hours a month. telpay has definitely helped us achieve the ‘wow’ that we’re known for.”

"setting my clients up for pre-authorized debit puts me in the driving seat. it eliminates the need to follow up, which saves costly administration time, we don’t have to deal with paper cheques, and most importantly we have the freedom to plan our cash flows.”

"it is very efficient for us to be able to have two signers who are able to sign remotely."

"there has never been an issue with payments not going through. payments are prepared through adagio and seamlessly integrates to telpay, which makes our accounts payable system simple."

"with telpay, there is less paper generated, shorter waiting time for approvals, easier bank reconciliations, lower audit risk. from the accounting system through to payment, the telpay process usually takes 3 to 4 minutes with experience. it’s fast and easy."

"there weren’t really any challenges with the transition to telpay, and we have saved the cost of express posting cheques to each store, and have eliminated the printing of each paycheque and the sorting and stuffing of envelopes. plus employees are pleased with receiving their pay on a defined day with no delays."

"when we had about 60% of our active vendors set up and the export in place, we started using the software right away, so the actual transition was essentially immediate. the feedback from vendors has been overwhelmingly positive. several of those for whom this is new have commented on how convenient it is."

"more and more companies are only dealing with direct deposit. cheques are fewer and fewer. telpay makes this process affordable and reliable for the small to medium businesses and helps to keep these companies moving along with this trend."
