a message from our senior pastor…



hi, pastor sean here, on behalf of our wonderful church family at the rock christian church, i would like to warmly invite you to join in worship with us. on sunday you can expect to find a vibrant and enthusiastic team leading our children in kids rock, we will lift our voices in joyful song worshipping our wonderful god, break bread together around the lord's table in communion and allow the holy spirit to gently speak to us as we open the scriptures together.here at the rock, we seek to make jesus number one in everything we do, we passionately value everybody and welcome all to join us as we seek to follow christ. after the service we share a rich time of fellowship and barista coffee together. i look forward to seeing you this sunday.
