what is postal history?

										there are any number of precise and 
										intimidating definitions of postal 
										history. while these are all technically 
										correct, in many ways they miss the wider 
										aspects of the hobby.

										in a word, postal history is about mail. 
										all over the world almost everyone 
										receives mail. this mail, where it is 
										from, where it is going, how it is paid, 
										how it got to its destination and 
										tribulations it faced in its journey is 
										postal history. it speaks of the time  
										and place it was mailed, the way it 
										traveled and the scars it picked up 
										along the way.

										since mail touches almost every person, 
										postal history touches almost every 
										interest. if your interest is in a 
										place, perhaps your home town, the 
										country of your ancestors or your 
										favorite vacation spot, postal history 
										will enhance that interest. if 
										transportation  is a passion, the 
										movement of mail encompassed most modes 
										of transport. mail was the first mover 
										in the development of some air travel 
										and significant in utilizing rail 
										network. most every significant event of 
										the last 250 years can be traced in the 
										mail. since every army provides mail for 
										its soldiers, if the military is 
										important to you, then postal history is 
										intertwined.

										mail is a window to the past and a 
										mirror of the present. postal history 
										opens that window wide and focuses the 
										mirror. it tells us about ourselves, our 
										ancestors, our nation and our world. the 
										simple journey of a letter can be the 
										start of a personal journey to wonders 
										of the world.
