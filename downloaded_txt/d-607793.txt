 "die welt ist klein geworden, so 
                winzig klein geworden,
                ein schöner ball mit dem du gerne spielst. 
                sie ist ganz dein geworden und allgemein geworden. 
                und wartet ab wohin du mit ihr zielst." 


now 
                    the world is small, so tiny and small
                    a beautiful ball you love to play with.
                    it is all yours, and for all of us.
                    just wait and see what you aim at. 
                     


"die 
                  welt ist weit geworden" - words and music by kurt (curt) 
                  bry - became famous through the performance by dora gerson (1899-1943).
                  you can witness the intense performance by another great artist, 
                  dora paulsen (1898-1970), on philips pl 12936 - 12" lp 
                  - for which curt bry rewrote part of the lyrics to reflect modern 
                  times.

warning:
                        thanks to hosting company arvixe, my pages on soundfountain.com 
                        are in disarray. arvixe moved the server from texas to 
                        provo, utah without warning and without providing the 
                        necessary codes, password and server address, while the 
                        yearly payment had been made and acknowledged by arvixe 
                        for the period until october 2023. we certainly hope that 
                        the inconvenience to you, the visitor, will gradually 
                        end as the pages are now hosted in the netherlands.



according 
                  to webster's new world dictionary second college edition (1970) 
                  the word sound has three meanings. 
                  sound of course is the vibration that can be sensed by the body 
                  and can be picked up by the ear. the myriad combinations of 
                  vibrations, the varying intensity and the changes in time make 
                  up music.
                  sound also means the mental and spiritual well being, and the 
                  well functioning of the body. 
                  there is a third meaning of the word and that is 'opinion'.
