ergonomic keyboards, arm rests, and more...





                comfort keyboard system is a global leader in the design,
                development, and manufacture of the best, most innovative
                adjustable, ergonomic, key-mappable, programmable and separable
                computer keyboards and foot switches in the world. the founders
                of comfort keyboard systems didn't just have a new idea for a
                keyboard to sell... our struggles with carpal tunnel, median
                nerve, and repetitive stress injuries were the impetus behind
                the flourishing ck line of keyboards and accessories we sell
                today.




  

we've developed a solutions set an ergonomic model line
                  that can permanently alleviate joint, tendon, and ligament
                  aches and injuries, whether you or your loved ones are
                  suffering from the onset of cps (carpal tunnel syndrome) or
                  rsi (repetitive stress injury) ¡ª or want to prevent typing
                  and computer-related injuries before they start!

  
          
                   
proactive, preventative management and
                maintenance of your posture, pressure points, wrists, and
                forearms. all that and a completely programmable
                keyboard where every key maps according to your wishes?
                



                  comfort keyboards come with macros, special function keys, and
                  every key can be programmed and mapped. our keyboards
                  are heavy, sectioned for your convenient placement of a part
                  here, a part there ¡ª and again, each key is completely
                  programmable. you can even add foot pedals or switches to
                  handle complex macro operations, perform repetitive tasks, or
                  to serve as "hot keys" you can activate without lifting a
                  finger!

  


once you've had a keyboard with three
                  sections you can bend, twist, and arrange at any angle
                  comfortable for you, whether at work or play... once
                  you start taking your keyboard home at night and leaving the
                  laptop at the office... then 
                    that's when we have achieved our mission. built for
                  life, built for you ¡ª comfort keyboard systems put the
                  control back where it belongs ¡ª in your hands.




                    ergorest arm support takes the pressure off your shoulder,
                    neck, it swivels back and forth, left & right




the ergo nav
                    is the most convenient adjustable mouse pad on the market
                    today. proper use of the ergo nav significantly
                    reduces the amount of postural stress that people experience
                    when using their mouse






                  a final note. our products work on any operating
                  system (ms dos, windows 95 / win 98 / win me / windows nt /
                  windows 2000 (and pro) / windows xp (and pro), 
                    windows vista, all apple (macintosh) operating systems
                  (os x, panther, sun type 6, and hp-hil) ¡ª and they work on all
                  computer hardware platforms (pc/mac/sun/hp-hil).

                  so read more about us as featured in the new york times and
