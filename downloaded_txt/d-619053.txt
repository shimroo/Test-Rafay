  "my first appt. at whd was good. i had a cleaning and x-rays. very nice and caring folks there. i needed some work done and when i had an appt. with amber, she explained the procedures so i understood. if she couldn't answer a question, she three times went and came back with an answer. you just didn't feel like just another patient. i like this place very much."-deb s.

"tiffany c is my hygienist and she is amazing! she takes care of me and my 10year old daughter and treats us as if we were her own family. she takes extreme care not to cause me extra pain with my migraine issues and takes extra time to work with my daughter and her issues focusing with her adhd.  despite being busy and having a full and hectic schedule, she always remembers the little details going on in our lives and shares our successes with us. i recommend giving her a visit if you need a teeth cleaning and a friendly face to help make the experience even better!"-chrystal h
