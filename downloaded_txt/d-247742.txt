the re-created 17th regiment of infantry was established in the early 2000’s with the mission is to provide for its members and the public the experiences of the common british soldier throughout the conflict, and more specifically at historic sites from the hudson river valley to virginia. the group works as a collective; researching, creating uniforms and equipment, providing living history displays and interpretation to vividly teach and engage with history. the re-created 17th strives for meaningful, research-based public interpretation of the perspectives of the british soldier in the american revolution, and engage with broader questions of what it meant to be “british” and “american” nearly 250 years ago.
