    garrya tongsai bay samui
  

secluded castaway paradise garrya tongsai bay samui is hidden amongst 28 acres of breathtaking natural beauty wrapped around a private bay with an exclusive beach front. enjoy your exclusive sanctuary of your very own suite – bath with a view concept or sea view villas with a private pool.

the tongsay bay story began in 1985 when the late akorn hoontrakul, then chairman of the imperial hotel group, saw tongsai bay from the sea and declared that it was “love at first sight”. seven days later akorn purchased the land. for three months he slept on the beach, dreaming of his ideal resort, and started to plan the layout and location of the rooms.

the resort opened its doors in july 1987 and became the first five-star luxury hotel on koh samui. in 1993 khun akorn sold the imperial hotel group whilst retaining the tongsai bay, because he wanted to live out the rest of his life there with his beloved wife chompunute.

since the year 2000 the resort was managed by khun thanakorn and saisiri who shared khun akorn’s passion for the environment and for providing the best of thai hospitality and service. the tongsai bay became a pioneer in preserving the natural environment, both in samui, thailand and internationally. in 2021 the owners of tongsai bay met with the founders of banyan group and identified that each held similar high ideals for sustainability, corporate governance, responsible tourism and community support. a new relationship was formed with the foundation of continuing the legacy and heritage of khun akorn for generations to come.
