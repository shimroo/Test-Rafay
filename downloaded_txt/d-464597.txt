welcome to the musee mecanique - the mechanical musuem









   














































welcome to the musee mecanique, one of 
			the world’s largest privately owned collections of mechanically 
			operated musical instruments and antique arcade machines.  we 
			will take you on a journey from turn of the century hand cranked 
			music boxes to modern video arcade games. this is a trip down memory 
			lane.  it is a chance to show your children or grandchildren what you 
			did for fun when you were their age.  before video games at home, perhaps 
			before television, perhaps what you remember sitting in your grandparent’s parlor.






















for those of you who grew up in the san francisco 
			bay area, it is a chance to remember playland at the beach, sutro 
			baths and the cliff house.  there is our own “laffing sal”, “susie 
			the can-can dancer” and the fascinating “carnival.”  other things have 
			been brought in from around the world for your amusement.  for years 
			the collection was housed in the lower level of the cliff house. due 
			to renovation in 2002 the collection moved to its new location 
			at pier 45 at fisherman’s wharf.
