           grief is love lost - audio series
    

the grief we feel when someone dies is in proportion to the love we felt for them when they were living.

the realization that someone precious to us is forever lost can be so overwhelming that we may think, “how can i go on?” or, “will i ever be the same?”

grief isn’t curable. but over time and with productive attention to our grief, we learn to manage it, and acquire the strength, vigilance and courage to embrace a goal of hope and happiness.
