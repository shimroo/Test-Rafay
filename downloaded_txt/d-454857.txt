     about us            mystery studio was a casual game development company founded in 2002 by gabriel gambetta and esteban guelvenzu, operating out of uruguay; we closed our doors in 2011.

over the years we developed several games, some of which went on to become hits, and we even created the time management genre with our pioneering game betty's beer bar back in 2003.
