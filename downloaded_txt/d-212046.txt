advocacy updatestate representative karl bohnak has introduced hb 4007 which would recognize the important role the upper peninsula’s reciprocating internal combustion engines (rice units) serve in ensuring the region has reliable energy generation. the bill would amend the 2023 energy law which did not include this type of power generation as an option toward renewable and clean energy goals. when the rice units came online, they reduced emissions by 86% compared to the previous coal-powered plant and added much needed reliability to our region’s electricity generation.the lscp and marquette county ambassadors have been advocating for this change since discussions were underway for the energy legislation in 2023. read the bill here: legislature.mi.gov/bills/bill?objectname=2025-hb-4007
