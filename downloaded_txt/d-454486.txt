bulletin: doing nothing is unhealthy





brothers and sisters,
 
our union is well aware and deeply concerned about the rising cost of healthcare and
more importantly, the slow deterioration of our health as compared to the average
american worker. as greyhound employees, most of our jobs do not avail us to live
relatively healthy lifestyles or to seek consistent preventive checkups for early
detection of the most debilitating, life-threatening illnesses. most of us do not find out
we are sick until we fail an annual dot examination.

get healthy – and save money – with the healthy hound program!





what is it?
the healthy hound program offers atu members (and their enrolled spouses) activities to help improve our health. when we complete a healthy activity (from october 1, 2016 through september 30, 2017), we can avoid the $300 individual surcharge (up to $600 per enrolled couple) in 2018. note: this surcharge is an increase from last year and is now an individual surcharge that applies to the member and to his or her spouse, if applicable.
