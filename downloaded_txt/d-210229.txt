     denise jackson - american idol 6
    


sixteen year old denise jackson was the first singer to make it through to hollywood on the american idol 6 premiere.  denise was from madison, wisconsin, and she revealed an inspiring background story.  denise said that she had been born a crack baby and was going to be sent to a foster home, but her grandmother came and rescued her. denise said, “knowing that i was born that way, i thank god, you know because many people have disabilities from these things, and there’s nothing wrong with me, i was actually born with a gift, you know a wonderful gift, i can sing.”   denise jackson sang billie holiday’s “you’re gonna love me.”  after her audition, paula abdul said “pretty powerful, pretty powerful, pretty adorable.”  simon cowell said “well, you did everything right.  you’ve got two minutes to audition, you came in, belted it out, proved at sixteen you can do that, good on you.  i think you’re a very good singer potentially.”  all four judges agreed on putting denise through to hollywood.sourcedenise jackson free american singles online

     perla meneses - american idol 6
    


ryan seacrest said that perla meneses was prepared to flirt her way to hollywood, and she told ryan that she was wondering if he had a girlfriend.  perla asked ryan if he liked spanish girls, and he said “yes.”  however, ryan took offense to perla saying they were both kind of short, and he responded that she was short and he was average.   perla meneses is originally from columbia, but she currently lives in margate, florida.  perla revealed that she came to this country when she was fifteen with two backpacks, her teddy bear, and her guitar.  perla also said that at one point during her life she was homeless and living out of her car.  perla insisted “it’s not a sob story, it’s a survival story.”    twenty-five year old perla meneses sang blondie’s “call me.”  after her first song, randy jackson requested that she sing shakira’s “hips don’t lie.”  randy jackson said “there’s something about you i like.  you’ve got this kind of spunky, kind of crazy, wild attitude.  i feel like you can jump out of your skin at any minute.  i like daredevils.  i kind of like you.”  jewel said “i think you’re cute and perky.  you have a cute personality.  i think your singing is a little bit in the middle as far as talent goes right now.  i do think the second song was a little bit better.”  paula abdul said “i much preferred you doing hips don’t lie.”  simon cowell said “you are great doing that shakira thing, the problem is that when you did the blondie song it’s so heavily accented it does sound a bit odd, so your choice of songs are going to be difficult for you.  ok, but you know that, you’re great fun.”  all four judges agreed on putting perla through to hollywood.sourceperla menesesfree american singles online
