							screw you blogger
						




after 5 and a half months of suffering through the blogger experience, i've decided to escape the oppression and end in george we trust. do not fret, i've registered a new blog over at beep.com entitled "baby bombers" (in case you need it in writing, the url is http://babybombers.beeplog.com/).much like the name implies, baby bombers is going to focus on what igwt has focused on: prospects. i'll have the same stuff there as i did here - the weekly poll, the phil hughes watch, down on the farm, etc.i'm still setting up the whole baby bomber template and all that fun stuff, so please be patient while i get things together. hopefully i'll be up and running at full capacity by friday, at which point i'll make up for the down week during the draft.all of those out there with your own blog who've added a link to igwt on a sidebar or something like that, i greatly appreciate the support and i ask you to please update your site and link to baby bombers instead. thanks a ton.thanks to all those who made igwt part of their daily rotation, i never imagined that i'd pull almost 20,000 hits in under 6 months.and finally, thanks for the hours of needless frustration blogger, you suck worse than terrence long.

i've had it with blogger. i spent god knows how much time last night putting together an analysis of yesterday's yankee draft picks, complete with scouting reports, video, photos, the works. i saved it last night, made some minor revisions this morning, added the down on the farm section and new poll question and went to publish it this morning. only it didn't publish. i got the "page cannot be displayed" message, and when i went back to my saved copy, i found out there was no saved copy. grrrr....yeah yeah yeah, i should have used word, but i didn't. i'm super pissed right now, so i'll get some draft stuff up later today or sometime.

							number 104
						




with their 3rd pick - number 104 overall - the yanks selected zach mcallister, rhp, illinois valley central high.(can't find a picture)scouting report: big kid (6'5", 230) with good stuff - low-to-mid 90s heat, slider and change. he's polished for a high schooler, and has grown 3 inches in the last year alone. owns a nice and easy delivery that he repeats well. he's got a chance to be a good one.my thoughts: another solid, safe pick. the yanks are doing a good job of building up their system, adding low-risk pitchers so far. he's got a commitment to nebraska, but the yanks should be able to change his mind and convice him to turn pro with the 6-figure bonus his draft position warrants.outlook: he'll likely head to the gcl yanks to start his pro career. his polish may allow to move fast a la phil hughes, but don't expect him to be the second coming of hughes.there's no more sandwich picks to worry about, so the yanks remaining selections come every 30 choices, so number 134 is next, followed by 164, etc. at the current pace, it'll be about 15 minutes between picks with a little less than 3 hours left in day 1 of the draft (it ends at 6 pm et).i'm off to meet the missus for lunch, and i'll recap all of today's yankee picks either tonight or tomorrow when blogger isn't being a bitch (hopefully). the yankee's 3 picks up to his point are all polished pitchers; hopefully they manage to snatch up the raw dellin betances and defensive whiz brian jeroloman before day's end. if they pull-off a minor miracle and land those 2 as well as georgie tech 3b wes hodges, i'd be very, very pleased with the yanks draft regardless of what happens tomorrow.

with their second pick - 41st overall - the yanks took joba chamberlain, rhp out of the university of nebraska.scouting report: owns a low 90s fastball, hard slider and good changeup that he can throw for strikes. intimidating presence on the mound (6'2", 230 lbs) that should enable him to be a 700 out a year workhorse. think jon papelbon, but chamberlain will certainly remain a starter.my thoughts: awesome pick. yankee fans will love this guy by the 2nd inning he throws in pinstripes. it's easy to see the yanks are trying to "quick fix" the farm system by taking advanced college arms early. just an awesome, awesome pick. way to go cash-money.outlook: he'll join kennedy in staten island later this month. he missed 2 starts this year with a triceps injury, but don't worry about that, it's behind him.the yanks next pick comes at 104 overall, so in 10-15 minutes or so. here's espn's draft index, which shows all the picks. blogger is giving me shit, reaffirming my belief that it's a worthless piece of shit.

with their first pick - 21st overall - the yanks took ian kennedy, rhp from usc.scouting report: has been on radars for a long time, being drafted in the 14th round back in 2003. he hasn't been bad in 2006, but it's been a far cry from his first two college seasons. he's lost some velocity on the fastball (sits at 89-91), though he still knows how to pitch with an aggressive style and hard curve. his ceiling is probably as a very good number 2 starter in the john lackey mold. go here for his scouting video.if you shelled out the $60 to subscribe to ba.com, go here for more scouting reports.my thoughts: solid pick, but very safe and conservative. he's not far away from the bronx. he's a bit undersized (6'0", 180) and he doesn't throw hard, but he's a winner and strikeout machine. more greg maddux than roger clemens. oh yeah, he's a scott boras client.outlook: chances are he'll head to staten island at the end of june and start 2007 in high-a. he won't finish there though.the yanks next pick comes in the supplemental first round at number 41 overall, at this pace that pick should be announced in 5-10 minutes or so. see you then.fyi - the mlb radio broadcast is lagging, the draft tracker is about 5 picks ahead of the broadcast.

							some last minute draft thoughts
						




jim callis of ba weighs in:though owner george steinbrenner won't give a major league contract to a draftee [that's why they passed on craig hansen], new york would select [unc's andrew]miller in the unlikely event he gets this far and sign him to the largest bonus in draft history. more realistically, the yankees could take huff, the second-best college lefty in the draft. they also could one-up the mets by taking beato, who turned down the mets as a draft-and-follow.projected pick: david huff, lhp, uclaso does john mayo of milb.com:new york yankees: max scherzer, rhp, university of missouriit appears as of now that there are two teams prepared to take scherzer with the health question mark: the diamondbacks at no. 11 and the yankees here. both teams, it seems, have gotten the medical clearance to take the missouri ace so he won't slide any further than this spot.previous projection: pedro beato.if miller fell to the yanks, you might be able to hear me screaming with joy all the way from socal. t-minus 20 minutes until the first pick is announced.update: although it's not yet official, ba founder allan simpson and the crew broadcasting on mlb radio have said the royals will take luke hochevar first overall. so much for hoping he fell to the yanks.

1,500 guys not much younger than me are going to have their lives change in the next 36 hours. some will be affected more than others, and some won't even know it until the fedex man shows up at the door with a certified letter next week. either way, 06-06-06 will be the best day in the life of many of these young men as they come one step closer to reaching their dream.da humber and his extremely under-rated baseball central blog unites the baseball blogging masses in a pre-draft bonanza. if you have any interest at all in today's draft, you do not want to miss this. plus i took part in it, so consider this a shameless self promotion.as i said yesterday, i'll be around for the next few hours updating you on the goings on of the draft (which starts in less than an hour), bringing you scouting reports and tons of other info on the yankees picks.daily poll: in a landslide win, 7 of the 11 votes in yesterday's poll said the yanks are best off going to pitching in the early rounds of today's draft. a successor for jorge posada finished second with 3 votes, followed by any type of talent close to big league ready. thanks for voting, the new question is up.down on the farm:triple-a columbus (12-8 loss to ottawa)andy cannizaro: 1 for 4, 1 r, 1 bb, 1 kruss johnson: 2 for 4, 1 r, 1 bbcarlos pena: 1 for 4, 2 r, 1 rbi, 1 bb, 1 k, 1 e (fielding)rob stratton: 1 for 5, 1 rbi, 4 knick green: 2 for 5, 1 r, 1 2b, 1 rbi, 1 e (throwing)danny garcia: 1 for 3, 1 r, 1 hr, 3 rbi, 1 bb, 1 kmark corey: 2 ip, 5 h, 4 r, 4 er, 2 bb, 3 k, 1 hb - closer started the game, and threw 72 pitches in 2 inningsmatt desalvo: 3 ip, 5 h, 8 r, 4 er, 4 bb, 5 k, 1 e (throwing) - say the 7.68 era isn't sotj beam: 2 ip, 0 h, 0 r, 0 er, 0 bb, 4 k - one step closer to the bronxdouble-a trenton scheduled off dayhigh-a tampa (4-3 win over fort myers)brett gardner: 2 for 3, 1 r, 1 2b, 2 bb, 1 kramiro pena: 2 for 5, 1 kcody ehlers: 0 for 5, 3 krudy guillen: 2 for 4, 1 r, 1 2b, 1 bb, 1 sbpj pilittere: 2 for 4, 1 r, 2 rbijeff marquez: 7 ip, 7 h, 2 r, 2 er, 3 bb, 6 k - 12-2 gb/fb ratio, the sinker's working nowphil thorp: 1 ip, 0 h, 0 r, 0 er, 0 bb, 0 k - 3-0 gb/fb ratio, 1.02 era in 17.2 ipgerardo casadiego: 2 ip, 3 h, 1 r, 1 er, 0 bb, 0 k - 3-3 gb/fb ratiolow-a charleston (11-8 win over greenville)austin jackson: 1 for 5, 1 r, 1 3b, 1 rbi, 2 k - threw a runner out at 3b from cfmarcos vechionacci: 3 for 5, 1 r, 1 2b, 2 rbi, 1 sbjose tabata: 1 for 5, 1 rcj henry: 0 for 5, 2 r, 1 rbi, 2 keduardo nunez: 3 for 4, 1 r, 1 rbi, 1 bbtim battle: 1 for 5, 2 r, 1 2b, 2 rbi, 1 k, 1 sb - threw a runner out at 3b from lfirwil rojas: 0 for 2, 1 r, 2 rbi, 1 sbzach kroenke: 5 ip, 6 h, 4 r, 4 er, 2 bb, 6 k, 1 wpcory stuart: 1 ip, 1 h, 3 r, 3 er, 2 bb, 1 k

							live draft
						




for the first time, you'll be able to listen to tomorrow's amateur draft live as the picks are announced:tune-in just before 1 p.m. et for a live update on who will be the first overall pick of the 2006 draft. then, for the first time, the entire first round of the draft will be announced live exclusively from mlb.com's new york city studios. jimmie lee solomon, the executive vice president of baseball operations for major league baseball, will do the honors live on mlb.com. no one -- except for the teams themselves -- will know who is taking who when before mlb.com does.that will kick off the live video coverage of the opening five rounds of the draft. casey stern, host of mlb.com midday, will handle the same duties for the program. he will be flanked by mlb.com draft insider jonathan mayo and allan simpson, the founding editor of baseball america who now brings his draft expertise to perfect game crosschecker (pgcrosschecker.com). the trio will give pick-by-pick analysis for the first three rounds -- 106 total picks -- of the draft....if that's not enough for you, just click on over to mlb radio. they've got audio coverage of every pick of every round for the two-day event. mlb radio's vinny micucci, host of baseball today, will be joined by pg crosschecker.com's david rawnsley for day one, which will stretch until the conclusion of the 18th round. mayo will slide over from the video studio to handle day two radio chores with rawnsley as they take you home for rounds 19-50.for the most part the mlb draft is rapid fire, one pick announced right after another with almost zero downtime. i dunno if this broadcast will slow it down any, but regardless, check in with igwt for info on each yank pick minutes after the pick is announced.

							all draft, all week
						




i heart the draft. if it was up to me, there would be separate drafts for college, junior college and high school kids just so we'd have 3 events to talk about instead of one. needless to say, this is going to be a great week at igwt even though i'm working at half capacity after separating my shoulder saturday morning on my way to volunteering at the local orphanage by reading to small children...okay fine, i fell out of bed in a semi-drunken stupor. there, you got it out of me, happy? it's cool, i've got a hot blonde and a fresh prescription of vicatin (yippee!) to nurse me back to health.back to baseball. if you're feeling lucky, you can take mlb.com's draft challenge for a chance to win 4 tickets to the 2007 all-star game. you can watch the pre-draft show here, and for more draft coverage than you can handle, head over to either mlb's draft central (loaded with video and audio clips) or ba's much more in-depth draft coverage (you do need a subscription to access most of the info however).as far as the yanks, there's talk of jeffrey maier:major league baseball's amateur draft starts tuesday, and maier said it would be a dream come true if he were tapped by the franchise.yankee officials wouldn't discuss his chances, although one evaluator not affiliated with the team said he's more likely to be an "organizational player" consigned to the minor leagues than a future major leaguer.but maier's got at least one big-name fan rooting for him."i hope he does get drafted," jeter said last night."it's the least they could do. pay him back finally. it would seem kind of ironic, wouldn't it?"agreed derek, 100%. there's also talk of 6'9" pitcher from brooklyn:brooklyn flamethrower dellin betances put on a show for the yankees yesterday, lighting up the radar gun in front of several of the team's top executives in a predraft workout at the stadium.betances, a 6-9 righthander from grand street campus, had pitched for his youth service team on monday but was still able to reach 94 mph in front of general manager brian cashman and scouting director damon oppenheimer, according to a scout who was on hand. "i thought it went really well," betances said. "i pitched just a few days ago and i was still able to hit 94, so i thought that was a positive."...betances is expected to be a first- or second-round selection in the amateur draft, which begins on tuesday. the yankees pick 21st (first round) and 41st (supplemental round) but don't have a second-round pick.a local kid that hit 94 on the gun as a teenager on short rest? sign'em up. what about donnie baseball's kid? he's a legit option too:in photographs, 18-year-old preston mattingly looks like a teen donnie baseball. however, on the field he might be more athletic than his father. preston was clocked at 6.5 seconds in the 60-yard dash, according to his coach at evansville central high, jason engelbrecht. one talent evaluator estimated that there are only about 20 players in the majors who would be clocked that fast every time."he can run, that's for sure," said mike radcliff, the twins' scouting director who has scouted preston mattingly. "he's very athletic, has a real nice frame (6-3, 195 pounds) and you can project him to be strong." every team but the a's has scouted preston, and the yankees are one of the most active clubs - scouting director damon oppenheimer watched preston two weeks ago.preston is "a throwback in this era of specialization for high school kids," engelbrecht said, because he played three sports. preston spent the last two summers playing aau basketball instead of baseball - he does live in indiana, after all - and even his dad says he's raw.still, he hit .478 with 23 extra-base hits and 21 stolen bases in 30 games this season. in addition to his abilities, he wowed scouts with his demeanor."he's been a treat," engelbrecht said. "he's got every reason to big-league his teammates - he comes from that family, he's good-looking, he's a great athlete, he's got money - but he doesn't. he really mirrors his dad." igwt is going to be loaded with scouting reports, pictures, video, links, projections, etc. all week, so get ready.weekly poll: the vast majority of you (more than 49%) think some big fa pitcher will take the ball for the yanks on opening day 2008, but an almost equally vast number of you (just under 44%) think phil hughes will be the man come 2008. you'd only need 1 hand to count the number of votes chien-ming wang and carl pavano combined to receive. i don't think hughes will get the ball on opening day so soon, even if he hits the majors this year (very unlikely), chances are the yanks still wouldn't burden him with that much pressure so soon (he'll only be 21 then). in honor of the draft, this week the weekly poll will become the daily poll, with a new draft-related question appearing each day. thanks for voting!down on the farm:triple-a columbus(friday: 7-3 loss to rochester)jason conti: 1 for 5, 1 k -

one of my new favorite sites to play around with is first inning, which has been posting top 12 prospect lists for each team over the past few weeks. they saved the best for last, releasing the bombers list today (i'm special, they emailed me the list yesterday):1. philip hughes, rhphughes struck out 93 batters while only walking 20 last year. and heâs still only 19 years old.grade: a-2. jose tabata, oftalented young slugger will participate in his first full season of professional baseball this year.grade: incomplete3. jeff marquez, rhpmarquez appears on track to become a useful starting pitcher in the big leagues.grade: b4. melky cabrera, ofcabrera probably wonât stay in center field, but he doesnât project to hit for the kind of power most teams expect from a corner outfielder.grade: b5. eric duncan, 1b/3bduncan is a patient hitter who probably swings and misses too often to be more than an average hitter in the major leagues.grade: b6. c.j. henry, ss2005 draftee is athletic enough to be the yankeesâ next starting shortstop many years from now, but he struggled to make contact at the plate in the gulf coastleague.grade: incomplete7. j. b. cox, rhpcox does not record as many strikeouts you might expect from a future closer. he couldaggressivelyvely promoted through the system because he throws strikes and isnât particularly hittable.grade: incomplete8. tyler clippard, rhpclippardâs strikeout totals are impressive, but he gives up a lot of fly balls and could experience problems with home runs in the upper minor leagues.grade: b-9. darrel rasner, rhphe keeps the ball on the ground and his control continues to improve.grade: b-10. christian garcia, rhpgarcia could fulfill his potential if he overcomes some injury troubles and inconsistent control.grade: incomplete11. austin jackson, ofanother athletic 2005 draftee; jackson needs to improve his power at the plate to contend for a major league job three or four years from now.grade: incomplete12. eduardo nunez, 2b/ssnunez held his own as one of the younger players in the new york-penn league last year.grade: incompletethe list is based on their projection system and not raw ability, which is why guys like jeff marquez and austin jackson are out of the regular pecking order. clicking on each player's name brings you that player's page, which features all sorts of stats, a game log, and off course, their brutally honest projection (check out the names listed under "similar players" for phil hughes). have fun!down on the farm:triple-a columbus (6-5 loss to rochester)kevin reese: 1 for 4, 1 2b, 1 rbi, 1 k, 1 hbpruss johnson: 1 for 3, 1 r, 2 bb, 1 kcarlos pena: 2 for 5, 1 r, 1 hr, 2 rbi, 1 krob stratton: 1 for 4, 1 r, 1 bb, 2 kandy cannizaro: 2 for 3, 1 r, 1 2b, 1 rbi, 2 bb, 1 ktommy phelps: 6.2 ip, 8 h, 4 r, 2 er, 1 bb, 4 k - 63 of 95 pitches were strikesmatt smith: 1.1 ip, 2 h, 2 r, 0 er, 0 bb, 1 kdouble-a trenton (10-5 loss to portland)gabe lopez: 3 for 5, 1 r, 2 2b, 1 kbronson sardinha: 1 for 3, 1 r, 1 rbi, 1 bb, 2 krandy ruiz: 1 for 4, 1 r, 1 k, 1 hbpshelley duncan: 1 for 4, 1 r, 1 rbi, 1 bbfelix escalona: 2 for 4, 1 2b, 2 rbi, 1 kkevin howard: 2 for 4, 1 2b, 1 rbi, 1 kphil hughes: 5 ip, 8 h, 6 r, 6 er, 2 bb, 6 k - patience is a virtue (he'll come around)jb cox: 1.1 ip, 3 h, 2 r, 2 er, 1 bb, 1 khigh-a tampa (14-8 win over st. lucie)brett gardner: 2 for 5, 1 r, 1 2b, 2 rbi, 1 kramiro pena: 4 for 5, 2 r, 2 rbi, 1 sbcody ehlers: 1 for 4, 1 r, 2 rbi, 2 kben davis: 1 for 3, 1 r, 1 2b, 1 rbi, 1 bb - remember when he bunted for a hit in the 8th inning to ruin schilling's no-hitter a few years ago?edwar gonzalez: 2 for 5, 1 r, 1 2b, 1 3b, 3 rbiben himes: 3 for 3, 2 r, 1 2b, 2 rbi, 1 hbp - threw a runner out a 3rd from rfhector made: 3 for 5, 2 r, 1 2b, 1 rbi, 1 kchris malec: 2 for 5, 2 r, 1 rbi, 2 e (both fielding)alan horne: 5 ip, 5 h, 3 r, 3 er, 1 bb, 5 k, 1 wpmike gardner: .2 ip, 4 h, 5 r, 2 er, 0 bb, 2 kjosh schmidt: 1.1 ip, 0 h, 0 r, 0 er, 0 bb, 2 klow-a charleston (9-3 win over columbus)austin jackson: 1 for 5, 1 r, 3 kmario holmann: 1 for 3, 2 r, 2 bb, 4 sbjose tabata: 3 for 4, 2 r, 1 hr, 3 rbi, 1 bb - threw a runner out at 2nd from rfbrett jones: 2 for 5, 1 r, 1 rbi, 1 kcj henry: 3 for 5, 2 r, 1 2b, 1 rbi, 2 k, 1 sb, 2 e (fielding, throwing)marcos vechionacci: 3 for 4, 1 r, 1 3b, 3 rbi, 1 e (fielding)garrett patterson: 4.2 ip, 4 h, 1 r, 1 er, 1 bb, 3 kjim conroy: 1.2 ip, 2 h, 0 r, 0 er, 2 bb, 1 keric wordekemper: 1 ip, 2 h, 2 r, 0 er, 0 bb, 0 k - 3-0 gb/fb ratioigwt won't be updated this weekend, partly because my girlfriend is coming home from her trip this afternoon and i figure we're going to spending a whole lotta time together after not seeing each for 2 weeks (she still has no idea i'm here), but mostly because i'm moving into my new apartment this afternoon, and the cable guy isn't coming until monday morning to hook up the cable and dsl.get ready for a draft motherload next week, there's gonna be a whole lot of interesting stuff to discuss.update: missed this yesterday, but the florida state league all-stars were announced. three yankee farmhands made the cut:the tampa trio includes right-hander gerardo casadiego (third in the league with 10 saves), infielder cody ehlers (second in rbis with 43 and fourth in homers with nine) and outfielder brett gardner, who is third in hitting at .333.

							farm system report: may
						




the month of may is usually a great barometer in the game of baseball, it separates the shelton's from the pujols', the arroyo's from the peavy's, and more often than not, the contenders from the pretenders.much like the month of may, the double-a level serves as a terrific talent evaluator. players that succeed in double-a usual go onto a major league career in some capacity. those that don't, well...basically you never hear from them again. the yanks double-a affiliate in trenton is home to arguably the organization's top 4 pitching prospects, and each one of them appears to be on his way to passing the test with flying colors.here's a wrap up of what the farm system gave us in the month of may (all stats, etc. are from may unless otherwise noted):triple-a columbus (22-29, 8.0 gb, 13-14 in may)top pitching performance:kris wilson (may 23): 9 ip, 6 h, 0 r, 0 er, 0 bb, 5 k - 75 of 113 pitches were strikes (66.4%), 14-7 gb/fb ratiotop hitting performance:rob stratton (may 27): 2 for 5, 1 r, 1 hr, 5 rbiinjuries at the major league level reeked havoc on the clippers roster, with call-ups and send-downs occurring almost daily. in a 10 day period, the clippers saw melky cabrera, mitch jones and kevin reese summoned to bigs, only to see bullpeners scott erickson, colter bean and matt smith join them days if not hours later. lefty matt smith appears to be entrenched on the columbus-bronx train this year, already being called to big league squad on 2 occasions in 2006.the clippers have also seen some new additions added to the mix, as former elite prospect carlos pena joined career journeymen jason conti and robert stratton to provide the clips with a new heart of the order. while conti has showed why he's been a journeyman, both pena and stratton have given the clips a nice shot in the arm, posting .872 and .814 ops's, respectively. stratton - in the midst of his 6th straight year at the triple-a level - has been especially impressive, providing 5 hr and 15 rbi from the cleanup spot in 16 may games.however, the biggest story surrounded the clippers this month has minor league free agent pick-up kris wilson going from roster-filler to potential call-up option. the 29 year old went 2-1 in may, giving up only 28 hits in 43 ip (good for a .185 baa) while posting a .81 whip, 33-7 k/bb ratio and 1.67 era. wilson pitched into the 8th inning in his last 5 may starts, having never allowed more baserunners than ip in any one of those starts.not to be outdone by wilson, waiver pickup and recently called-up darrell rasner has continued his 2006 excellence, going 3-0, 1.50 era, 46-18 gb/fb ratio during may. throw out a may 16th disaster in which rasner gave up 11 h and 4 er in 4.1 ip, and he put up a 0.35 era (not a typo), 1.01 whip and a 19-6 k/bb ratio during may. and this guy was on waivers...double-a trenton (27-26, 2.5 gb, 20-12 in may)top pitching performance:steve white (may 31): 7 ip, 3 h, 0 r, 0 er, 3 b, 4 ktop hitting performance:randy ruiz (may 17): 4 for 5, 2 r, 2 2b, 1 hr, 3 rbi, 1 kdominant. lights out. unhittable. slamming the door. nails in the coffin. all are fit to describe the thunder's bullpen duo of james brent cox and theodore beam junior, better known as jb cox and tj beam. the first name-initialed tandem seemed to be on a mission this pass month, combining to give up only 5 er in 47.1 ip, good for an era of 0.95. beam has been overpowering hitters with a fierce fastball-slider combo (21-8 k/bb, .209 baa), while cox has been equally adept at getting outs on his own (13-5 k/bb) as well as on the ground(35-14 gb/fb). the yankee braintrust has done an excellent job of getting cox and beam experience, having each throw multiple innings each time out. joined by the unheralded relief corps of charlie manning, francisco butto and justin pope, the trenton bullpen went 22 innings between giving up runs at one point in may.of course, what kind of farm system report would this be without mention of phil hughes. the 19 year old southern californian made the jump to double-a to start the month, and he seems to have turned the corner after a somewhat inauspicious start at the level. after having his trademark control desert him to the tune of 8 bb in his first 24 may ip, hughes has issued only 3 free passes in 12.1 ip over his last 2 starts. there is one disturbing trend however, as hughes' whip has steady increased with each may start (.83-.86-.91-.94-.99). on the bright side, hughes has been racking up k's with more regularity each start, putting up a 3-5-5-5-7 strikeout trend for the month. for the most part it seems like he's starting to round back into form, and it's only a matter of time before he unleashes a 7 ip, 2 h, double-digit k masterpiece again.high-a tampa (25-26, 5.5 gb, 15-12 in may)top pitching performance:alan horne, chase wright, gerardo casadiego (may 5): combined 9 ip, 1 h, 0 r, 0 er, 5 bb, 8 ktop hitting performance:brett gardner (may 25): 2 for 5, 1 r, 1 3b, 3 rbi, 1 sbexit phil hughes, enter alan horne. with the yanks prized arm heading north to trenton, horne - the former gator and one-time first round pick - seems to have taken over the spotlight down in west florida. here's horne's numbers from may: .197 baa, 11.63 kper9, 15 hits allowed in 21.2 ip. so what's the problem? control. horne has allowed 5.40 bbper9 in may, ballooning his obpa to .340 (remember he held hitters to a .197 baa) and limiting himself to short outings due to high pitch counts. horne does possess a remarkable k rate, striking batters out at least a 10.7 kper9 rate in each start this year. he's got the farnsworth-esque enigma cloud around him; when he's on, he's flat out nasty, but when he's off, it's real ugly (like yo momma, ooooooooh. just kiddin').cody ehlers continues to be a man amongst boys in the florida state league as he places in the league top 10 in hr (9), rbi (43), tb (95), and slg (.514). ehler's sidekick brett gardner has cooled down after an ungodly start, but he's still 2nd in the league in r (37), 7th in h (59), 2nd in bb (37), 1st in sb (22), 1st in obp (.451), 3rd in ba (.333) and 7th in ops (.886). the over/under on both finishing the year in tampa is at about 5%.news out of tampa in may reported a carl pavano sighting, but still no word yet on christian garcia's eta from an oblique strain.low-a charleston (26-27, 10.0 gb, 12-18 in may)top pitching performance:bryan villalona (may 5): 5 ip, 0 h, 0 r, 0 er, 2 bb, 4 ktop hitting performances:jose tabata (may 5): 3 for 4, 1 r, 1 hr, 3 rbi, 1 sbreegie corona (may 20): 6 for 7, 1 r, 2 rbi, 1 bbwhen you talk about the yanks low-a affiliate in charleston, you'll inevitably skip right past the fact that they're on a 9 game losing streak and have lost 11 of 13, and bring up the tremendously talented teenage trio (say that 3 times fast) of austin jackson, jose tabata and cj henry. throw in recent demotees marcos vechionacci, eduardo nunez and tim battle, and you'll be hard pressed to find another team in the minors with 6 players possessing this much raw ability still on the un-fun side of their 21st birthday (all 6 of those guys were in the yanks top 12 prospects according to ba). both jackson and tabata continued to do what they do best last month: drive in runs (28 combined rbis), rack up xbhs (16 combined xbhs) and create havoc on the basepaths (14 combined sbs). apparently the mets inferiority complex kicked in (again), because they picked up a tabata of their own.after coming off the dl on may 8th, cj henry performed like a man (kid) possessed. in his first 9 games back, he went .406-.457-.750-1.207 with 8 xbh, 5 rbi, and 7 runs scored while raising his ba 123 points in just over a week. since then? he's gone .104-.232-.125-.357 with 17 k's in 13 games. and that's not even the worst of it. the 20 year old has committed 14 errors in 31 games this season, with 9 of those e's coming in may. lots of people have said they see a position change in henry's future, and it's not hard to see why based on the kid's defense, or lack thereof.when it comes to the riverdogs pitching crew, there's really only 1 name worth mentioning: abel gomez. the 21 year old dominican held batters to a .127 baa in 18.1 ip in april, only to follow that up by allowing 47 baserunners in 22.0 may innings. the scary thing is that 23 of those baserunners reached base via the free pass, meaning gomez is the proud owner of a 9.41 bbper9 for the month of may. oy vay, someone should tell the kid he doesn't need to try to throw the ball through a brick wall with each pitch.in-season top 10 prospects (based on 2006 performance)darrell rasner: no his upside isn't as monumental as hughes', but don't argue with me, argue with the numbers.austin jackson: there's no up-and-downs with this kid, it's been nothing but consistent production game after game after game.jose tabata: about 2 weeks ago he seemed like a lock for this month's top spot, then he hit the dl with a hand injury.phil hughes: struggles in double-a keep a top 3 prospect spot away. (sorry, that was pathetic, it'll never happen again)jb cox: his success is even sweeter knowing craig hansen has allowed 38 baserunners in 30.2 ip this year.steven white: pitched into the 7th in each may start, and only once gave up more than 2 er. oh yeah, he only gave up only 8 line drives in 32 ip (mets lovechild mike pelfrey gave up 21 liners in 21.2 ip).tj beam: would it be the worst thing in the world to call him up to the bigs right now to give scott proctor a breather once in a while?brett gardner: slowed down a bit after a hot start, but he's still 4th in the organization with a .333 ba and 7th with a .884 ops.tyler clippard: he still scares the crap out of me (6'3", 170 lbs - did he ever hear of a ring ding???), but when you strikeout 25 and give up only 21 hits in a month, you're doing something right.cj henry: it's not all about k's and e's, his obp was almost 100 points higher than his ba in may.both short-season staten island and the gulf coast league yankees kick off their seasons on the 20th of june, less than 3 weeks away. the gcl team is always fun to check up on, because it's usually chock full of very young, very talented players just plucked from the draft or the international market.

							bullpen report
						




via buster olney:new york yankeesmariano rivera: 21 games, 27.1 inningson track for: 71 games, 89 inningsscott proctor: 25 games, 34 inningson track for: 81 games, 110 inningskyle farnsworth: 25 games, 24 inningson track for: 81 games, 78 inningsthoughts: joe torre earned a whole lot of praise for the way he handles players emotionally, finding ways to take pressure off them; he was a hugely important figure during the yankees' dynasty. his handling of the bullpen the last five years has been a problem, and it's a problem again this year. he effectively overworked paul quantrill, tom gordon and tanyon sturtze, and he's doing it again with proctor this year. he simply doesn't trust enough relievers, relies on too few, and by august and september, the workhorses are exhausted. rivera pitched three innings tuesday, which is the kind of thing that feels right in may and can really hurt a team later in the summerquestion over here mr. torre (raising hand). why did you let mo throw a third inning when you had a 5 run lead, ron villone sitting in the pen (only 27 pitches the night before), and no off day for another 12 days, effectively putting him on the bench for the next 2 games against the best team in baseball?down on the farm:triple-a columbus (3-2 win over buffalo)kevin thompson: 0 for 3, 1 r, 1 bb, 1 k, 1 sbcarlos pena: 1 for 3, 1 k, 1 hbprob stratton: 1 for 3, 1 r, 1 hr, 1 rbi, 1 bb, 2 kjason conti: 1 for 3, 1 r, 1 hr, 1 rbi, 1 kwil nieves: 1 for 3ramiro mendoza: 6 ip, 2 h, 0 r, 0 er, 2 bb, 4 k - 56 of 84 pitches were strikes (66.7%)matt childers: 2 ip, 2 h, 1 r, 1 er, 1 bb, 2 kdouble-a trenton (7-5 win over portland)gabe lopez: 2 for 5, 1 2b, 2 rbi, 1 krandy ruiz: 2 for 4, 2 r, 1 2b, 1 hr, 1 rbi, 1 bb, 1 kshelley duncan: 1 for 5, 1 r, 2 k - hovering just over the mendoza line at .214felix escalona: 2 for 5, 1 r, 1 hr, 3 rbijustin christian: 1 for 4, 1 r - threw a runner out at home from cfjeff karstens: 6.2 ip, 8 h, 3 r, 3 er, 2 bb, 4 k, 1 wptj beam: 1.1 ip, 2 h, 2 r, 2 er, 0 bb, 1 k - first time all season he allowed more than 1 rhigh-a tampa (7-6 win over lakeland in 12 innings thanks to 8 lakeland errors)brett gardner: 0 for 5, 1 r, 1 bb, 3 k, 1 sb - 1 hit in last 14 abs, threw a runner out a second from cfrudy guillen: 1 for 5, 2 r, 1 hr, 1 rbi, 1 bb, 1 kcody ehlers: 2 for 5, 1 rbiedwar gonzalez: 1 for 5, 3 r, 1 hr, 2 rbi, 1 bb, 2 sbben himes: 1 for 6, 2 rbibrett ssmith: 8 ip, 5 h, 2 r, 2 er, 2 bb, 6 k - 12-5 gb/fb ratiochase wright: .2 ip, 3 , 4 r, 4 er, 1 bb, 1 kelvys quezada: 1.2 ip, 1 h, 0 r, 0 er, 0 bb, 3 klow-a charleston (6-5 loss to savannah)austin jackson: 1 for 5, 1 r, 1 k, 1 sb - threw a runner out a home from cfmarcos vechionacci: 0 for 4, 1 kjose tabata: 0 for 3, 1 rbi, 1 bbcj henry: 0 for 3, 1 r, 1 bb, 2 k, 1 e (throwing)eduardo nunez: 1 for 3, 1 r, 1 bb, 1 k, 1 sb, 1 e (fielding)tim battle: 1 for 4, 1 rbi, 1 k, 2 e (both fielding)zach kroenke: 4.1 ip, 4 h, 3 r, 1 er, 2 bb, 2 k, 1 wpwilkins arias: 3 ip, 6 h, 3 r, 3 er, 0 bb, 4 k
