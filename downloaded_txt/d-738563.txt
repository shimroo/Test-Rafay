holly’s mix
this is a wonderful blend of seeds that exhibits a high germination rate. the flavor is very fresh crispy with no bitterness. i definitely recommend this mix to anyone but especially to newcomers to sprouting such as myself.

veggie queen
i just love veggie queen mix. i have been using this for a few years now. i just use 2 tablespoons in a quart jar and in 3 days i have healthy delicious tasting sprouts to add to my salads. also the shipping is very fast. thank you sprout house for great service.

alfalfa
i just bought these seeds last week, and i already have sprouts! it was so easy to do with the sprouting lids that are sold on this site. every single time i order from this website it is always top quality, and this time was no exception.
