 the monaco grand prix is one of the world's greatest and most challenging motor-racing events; the monaco grand prix is at present, the last 'street course' remaining in the formula one calendar.
 
                      the monaco grand prix is staged around the narrow, winding streets of monte carlo. the main attraction of the monaco grand prix is the proximity of the speeding formula one cars to the race spectators. the twisting 77-lap circuit offers incalculable opportunities for spectators to witness the thrill of screaming engines, smoking tyres and the genius of the drivers over the 263-kilometre race on a course that allows no margin for error.
 
                      the first monaco grand prix was held on the 14th of april 1929. since then, the fastest average race speed has risen from 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour to 142 kilometres (88 miles) per hour.
 
                      this year, the monaco grand prix is the sixth in the formula one racing calendar. the 66th monaco grand prix on the 24 may 2008 sees kimi raikkonen in his ferrari going into the race as favourite. leading the championship standings from his ferrari team-mate felipe massa.
