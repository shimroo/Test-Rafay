get to know us






here at silver canoe, we are like family, literally.
our roots in the delaware are strong, our story starts in 1977 with the march family and 12 canoes. as silver canoe grew over the years, as did the march family. after years of hard work and dedication to silver canoe, jack and diane march made the decision to shift their focus onto their family and to pass on silver canoe to grow into it's next chapter .
the crouthamel family bought silver canoe in 2017 from the march's, keeping their family values, adventure, and fun in mind. now with a new property and over 300 pieces of river equipment, silver canoe is as strong as ever. allen and danielle crouthamel are focused on continuing to grow silver canoe with their family and all the families that work alongside them.
