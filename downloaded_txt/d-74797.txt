school of media and communication
from political campaigns and international affairs to popular culture and social networking, communication and the media are at the centre of everyday life. we cannot fully understand modern societies without understanding media and communication.
you’ll critically examine how people share knowledge, values and beliefs through television, journalism, film, online media, and beyond. our degrees emphasise choice and opportunity, allowing you to tailor your degree to your own strengths and interests.
the school of media and communication is actively working to build a diverse and inclusive school community that supports all staff and students. visit the faculty of arts, humanities and cultures’ equality and inclusion page to find out how to contact our school edi lead and access news, student resources and further information on edi initiatives.
