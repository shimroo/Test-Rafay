set the moodthe colors you choose help define the space, reflect your personality and set the mood of the room. keep in mind how you will use the room and what mood you’d like to create. how do you want to feel in the room?
 
color makes a strong visual impact on a space and can also have a psychological effect on those occupying the room. after you've chosen what mood you want in a room, choose your color scheme.
 
white can be a great choice if you are looking for a softer feel and a clean look. if you’re going for a warm earthy feel, shades of brown work well. blue and green are cool colors for a feeling of calmness, relaxation or serenity. red is the color of passion and energy.
