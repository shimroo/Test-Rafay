2025 ncds  and fortuna  garden club daffodil show schedules
“schedules” are related to where to enter your daffodils into a show.  these are not dates but are an organised list of groups that help people enter their daffodils with daffodils from other people so they are competing with the similar class of flowers. daffodils vary by size, color, shape of the bloom, and other unique features.  the schedules are a practical way for you  to place your daffodil entry in a show in a similar group.  this gives you a way to be recognized for your entry which may be considered better than others in the same scheduled group.
when you bring daffodils to enter a show, other more experienced people will help you enter them in the correct scheduled group.
show schedules have not changed much in past years for “local” shows.  national shows have more variations.
please use these past schedules as examples of the show classes and rules:
this was the 2022 ncds single show schedule which still has valid show entry classes and rules for horticulture.
this was the  2023 fortuna garden club show schedule with show entry classes and rules for two sections, horticulture and artistic design.
