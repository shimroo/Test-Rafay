background information
11/2024 bpd update




























my name is jonbenét ramsey and i was six years old when i was murdered on december 25, 1996. my murderer is an unknown individual, but an individual who left behind the clues and potential dna evidence to solving my case.
somebody out there knows something about my death. perhaps you don’t even know it. did somebody say something to you? the smallest detail could have a thousand meanings. do you know who killed me?
for 28 years, her murder has remained unsolved, but there is renewed hope. each year dna technology is evolving and becoming more sophisticated to the point cold cases from long past that had zero hope of being solved, justice is finally being found.
in 2023, advances in dna technology sparked a renewed drive to identify the killer of this child. the identity of the killer is out there. research the evidence, read the entire case history with an unbiased mind. to the person who perpetrated this crime, it’s not a matter of “if” you will be found, it’s now a calculated and scientific “when” you will be found.
if you have any information that could help solve this case, please reach out to us at the email below, the boulder police department, boulder district attorney, or submit an anonymous tip.
