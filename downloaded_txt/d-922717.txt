index

welcome to my page!





i am taking down the site, possibly for good as i feel it has outlived its purposes.i apologise if had not put up your emails/comments up, although i had promised to.a lot of things have happened since i first started this website & i feel it is time to move on.thank you to all those who have viewed, read and gleaned some form of useful information out of my website. most importantly i would like to thank those of you who have actively participated in making the visual guide what it used to become. your comments, emails, criticisms & encouragement have made all the effort worthwhile. i'd like to say a very big thank you to you all.its been fun while it lasted, ladies and gentlemen.thank you once again.see you space cowboy (& -gal) ...yrs sincerely,raymond 13 october 2010
