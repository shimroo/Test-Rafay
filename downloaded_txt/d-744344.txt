teacup stingray



this post is dedicated to my reader, tracy. thanks for dropping an email about this blog. :)     data sheet         scientific name:  potamotrygon reticulata    other names:   reticulated stingray, teacup stingray    origin: amazon basin, south america    adult size: 30-35cm (15 inches) disc, not including length of tail     social: good, but will eat smaller fishes     lifespan: ?     tank level:     bottom dweller        minimum tank size: 125 gallons     diet:  carnivourous. eats shrimps, or any fish small enough to fit in   it’s mouth. accepts worms and krills.      breeding: tough - in aquarium      care: medium - difficult      ideal ph:   around 6-7 is usually optimal     temperature:   78-82 degrees f     tank setup:      ideally with thick sand substrate for it to hide itself        sexing:  a male has 2 so called claspers on the bottom side of the disk.                      description:  the teacup stingray is olive color with dark markings resembling a   net. they have a white underbody. the tail is about half to three quarters the  length of   the body. teacup stingrays can be distinguished from other freshwater stingray species   based on its unusually long, pointed tail, flatter body shape, and smaller eyes.   their color pattern usually consists of numerous small, indistinct,   light-colored blotches on a darker base color. as they grow older, the web   pattern seems to diminish. at full maturity, these   stingrays reach up to about fourteen inches in diameter, obviously not including   the length of the tail. habitat/care: a minimum aquarium of 125 gallons is required, although larger tanks are preferred. i do recommend anything smaller than this. teacup stingrays are great for aquariums with other fish as long   as they are too large for the stingray to consume. they are very peaceful and   spend most of their time ignoring other fish. however, males may be a bit   aggressive toward other rays occasionally, especially during mating.   ensure that  extremely aggressive fish are not housed in a community tank with your stingray   or they may attack your ray, causing it severe harm or even death. moreover,   with their preference being the bottom of the tank, you will rarely see these   rays venturing to the surface. also,   some plecos have been known to suck off the stingray’s mucus coating on their   disk and they will eventually succumb to disease and die. therefore, i do not recommend having other plecos in the same tank.  teacup stingrays prefer water that has a ph around six or seven with a   temperature being near the upper seventies or lower eighties (fahrenheit). even   though they are relatively hardy, these stingrays are not recommended for those   that are not familiar with caring for more than your average aquarium fish. one   reason is due to their diet. these rays tend to eat worms (earth worms, black   worms, blood worms) as well as small live fish that are within the aquarium.  diet:  teacup stingrays are  carnivorous and their diet usually consists of benthic invertebrates such as   crustaceans and worms, and a limited amount of vegetable matter. in an aquarium,   they will accept live worms, bloodworms, cut shrimp, krill, crayfish, cut white   fish such as pollock or smelt, and other meaty items.some literature noted that it is   difficult to wean teacup stingrays  off of live blackworms and earthworms   once they are large enough to eat other foods.it is essential  to understand that the teacup   stingray, like all freshwater stingrays, is capable of stinging and have venom   within its tail. although this venom is not fatal it is very painful and   requires medical assistance for proper treatment. if stung make sure you   immediately apply pressure but avoid placing a bandage on the affected area.   submerse the stung limb or area within hot (but tolerable) water. be sure to   disinfect the area after following the procedure above. again, make sure you   seek medical attention to ensure that the venom is extracted from the area.    breeding: teacup stingray  is one of the several species of freshwater   stingray that has been known to breed in captivity.as in all species of freshwater stingray, fertilization is internal. during mating, the male will grab hold of the female's disc with his mouth and attempt to roll underneath her, where he will subsequently insert one of his claspers into her cloaca and deposit sperm.freshwater stingrays are matrotrophically viviparous, giving birth to one to seven live young at a time after a gestation period of several months (dependent on species).the uterus is formed from the expansion of the oviduct. the embryos obtain nourishment from their yolk sacs early in their development. during the later stages of pregnancy, small, filamentous appendages called trophonemata develop within the uterus and penetrate the spiracle of the embryo, supplying it with a nutrient-rich fluid called histotrophe that feeds it until it is born.gender differences: males display elongated, rolled copulatory organs called claspers on the insides of their pelvic fins. females lack claspers and are generally larger than the males.disease   teacup stingrays are highly vulnerable to argulus - commonly called fish lice. the small parasites   attach themselves to the stingray’s disk and extract nourishment by piercing the   flesh with a pointed organ called a style. the wound can cause bacterial or   fungal infections. although one or two may not cause a serious problem, a   serious infestation can be fatal. to remove the argulus, one can carefully   remove it with tweezers.got a photo? contact me           references cited:1. teacup stringray, [online], accessed on 12 june 2008 [available]http://www.interestinganimals.net/teacup_stingray/teacup_stingray.html 2. potamotrygon reticulata, teacup stingray, [ online ], accessed on 12 nov 2009 [available] http://aquaticpredators.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=26168 if you know of any good source of books or online sites, please do let me know.

clownfish



    data sheet   semi picasso clownfish      scientific name:  pomacentridae amphiprioninae     other names:   anemonefish      origin: asia -pacific coral reef     adult size: 2-5 inches, depending on species     social: very good. peaceful fish, but may get territorial    lifespan: 3-5 years      tank level:   bottom, coral    tomato clownfish       minimum tank size: 20 gallons (but bigger recommended)      diet:  omnivore       breeding: easy      care: medium     ideal ph:   7.0     temperature:   75° f. to 82° f.    tank setup:   with corals, etc      sexing: females are the largest.            two banded clownfish    maroon clownfish     goldbanded clownfish     sabae clownfish    tomato clownfish    two banded clownfish    amphiprion clarkii      saddleback anemonefish     allards clownfish      yellow clownfish      percula clownfish    black ocellaris   description:  clown fish are a speices of very beautiful fish that comes in various colors from yellow orange to red, and usually have white strips on their bodies.  it   grows to be about 8 cm in length.  habitat/care: saltwater fishes requires more space and care than freshwater fish. they are not recommended as beginner fishes as a result. for more information on requirements for saltwater fishes, please see the saltwater tank setup. in the wild they all form symbiotic relationships with sea anemones.clownfish and certain damselfish are the only species of fishes that can avoid the potent poison of a sea anemonewhen a sea anemone is not available in an aquarium, they may settle in some   varieties of soft corals, or large polyp stony corals. if the   fish settles in a coral, it could agitate the fish's skin, and, in some cases,   may kill the coral. once an anemone or coral has been adopted, the clownfish   will defend it. as there is less pressure to forage for food in an aquarium, it   is common for clownfish to remain within 2-4 inches of their host for an entire   lifetime.clownfish that are far removed from their parents through captive breeding   may not have the same instinctual behavior to live in an anemone. they may have   to be coaxed into finding the anemone by the home aquarist. even then, there is   no guarantee that the anemone will host the clownfish.diet: most clownfish are omnivores. they should be fed a diet of brine shrimp,   or chopped shrimp, squid or clams. they will also eat plant matter and can eat   flake food, although the majority of their diet should consist of animal   protein. they will also nip at algae and plant matter that grows in the aquarium   and benefit from live rock growth. breeding: since these fish live in a warm water environment they can reproduce all year   long. each group of fish consists of a breeding pair and 0-4 non-breeders.   within each group there is a size-based hierarchy: the female is largest, the   breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively   smaller as the hierarchy descends. if the female dies, the male changes sex,   becomes the breeding female and the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding   male. the fish apparently form lifetime pairs, exhibit courting behavior, and   depending on the size of the female spawn about 400-1500 eggs per cyclethe fish lay their eggs in a safe spot close to the anemone from where they are   easily protected, and the parents can retreat to the safety of the anemone if   danger threatens. anemonefish usually lay their nests in the evening after a few   days of carefully cleaning and examining the chosen site. preferred egg sites   are flat or slightly curved rocks or some other item the fish have dragged near   their nest for the purpose. (in captivity, clay pots and saucers are an   attractive choice.) first the female deposits some eggs with her ovipositor (a whitish tube   descending from her belly), making a wiggling pass over the surface, then the   male follows behind her fertilizing the eggs. after many passes, the nest is   complete and will hatch in 6-8 days shortly after sunset, usually on a very dark   night. in the meantime, the male is very protective of the nest and ceaselessly   fans the eggs to provide proper oxygen circulation, and checks them for any bad   eggs, which he eats before they can rot and damage more eggs. females may or may   not help the male tend the nest. at hatching, the larvae burst free and swim up   toward the moonlight and the open ocean to ride the currents and eat plankton   for about a week, before the still tiny metamorphosed clowns return to the reef   and look for an anemone to settle into.species:amphiprion   ephippium clownfish looks very similar to the tomato and   cinnamon clownfish in body shape, but it lacks the single white stripe behind   the eye in the adults.  a white stripe may appear in juveniles and a very small   white stripe in sub-adults.amphiprion   frenatus  is usually bright red as juveniles, older females will   often be mostly dark red or black on the body.  juveniles can often be seen with   2 or 3 white stripes, but it will only have one stripe behind the eye as an   adult.amphiprion   melanopus (cinnamon)  normally has a red face and dorsal fin and a   predominantly black body, pelvic and anal fins, and a pail yellow tail.  most   have a white stripe behind the eye, but in some fish in some populations the   white stripe can be absent. amphiprion   ocellaris (ocellaris/false percula or nemo) is the most common   clownfish in the hobby.  this fish is nearly identical to the percula clownfish (amphiprion percula) in appearance.  the general differences   between the two species is the thicker black border surrounding the white   stripes on the percula, and the amount of dorsal spines, ocellaris having   normally 11 and percula having normally 10.  the thickness of the black border   can vary on ocellaris, on some fish it is very thin while on others it can be a   couple millimeters wide.   the color of ocellaris is variable, from light   yellow, orange, brown, and in rare specimens black (reported to come from   darwin, australia). amphiprion percula the color on this   fish is variable from light orange to red, and often with such thick black   borders around the white bands that they often connect the white bands.amphiprion   perideraion (pink skunk)  is normally a pink color with a white stripe down the back and a white   stripe down the operculum (gill plate).amphiprion polymnus (saddleback) is  variable colored, ranging from light brown, black, and orange   and black.  this clownfish has 2 or 3 broad white bands with the middle band   starting mid body and extending into the to back of the dorsal fin.  the middle   stripe often resembles a horse saddle.  the black color form of this clownfish   is often misidentified as a black percula, of which is also a misidentification   of the black ocellaris.amphiprion   sandaracinos (orange skunk) is very similar to the skunk clownfish in color,   except that the overall color of the fish is orange, and the white stripe down   the back extends all the way to the top of the upper lip.premnas biaculeatus (maroon) is the largest   clownfish with females some times reaching as much as 7 inches (16.25 cm).    females of this species   are usually a dark maroon red or brown in color while the males are more bright   red.  this clownfish most often has 3 white or yellow bands.   it is often difficult to pair this clownfish.  large   females will some times if not often kill a potential mate when introduced to an   aquarium together.    got a photo? contact me       references cited:seaview aquarium, keeping clown fish caresheet, [online][available], http://www.seaviewaquariums.com.au/images/caresheets/caresheet-clown.pdf ;peto, clownfish care sheet http://www.petco.com/caresheets/fish/clownfish.pdfwikipedia, clownfish, [online], [available], http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amphiprion_percula the aquarium wiki, amphiprion percula, [online], [available], http://www.liveaquaria.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=15+2124+755&pcatid=755 live aquaria, ocellaris clownfish, [online] [available], http://www.liveaquaria.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=15+2124+755&pcatid=755 aquaworld aquarium, clownfish and their host anemone, [online], [available] http://www.aquaworldaquarium.com/clownfish_and_their_host_anemone.htm john h. tullock, clownfish and sea anemones:   everything about purchase, care, nutrition, maintenance, and setting up an   aquarium
