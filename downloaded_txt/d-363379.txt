call before you dig!


safe digging starts when you call georgia 811.
 
by law, everyone, including homeowners, must contact georgia 811 by visiting georgia811.com, calling  811 or 1-800-282-7411 at least 48 hours before beginning any mechanized digging on your property.
 
if you are unsure as to whether you should notify georgia 811 before you break ground, remember, even if your digging project is small, it’s always best to call!
