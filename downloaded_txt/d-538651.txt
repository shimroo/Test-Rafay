                                 a word about the jazz house



                                 the jazz house has lost its lease.


                                 we were displaced when our landlord sold the 
                      building. 
                      we continue our fundraising drive in an effort to breathe 
                      life back into our organization. 
 
                              

                    
                                    there are a lot of empty buildings out 
                                 there...we simply need the funding to obtain 
                                 one.  we need your help.  all 
                                 donations are tax-deductible.  if 
                                 interested in making a contribution to the jazz

the jazz house is a non-profit performance and education space
                              promoting jazz and experimental music in the bay area community.  we are a smoke and
                              alcohol-free environment where lovers of music come together to really enjoy music.  



                                 strong advocates of arts education, we host student events,
                                 including concerts and recitals, and often have student performers as opening-acts.
                              



                                 students of all ages are encouraged to attend all events at
                                 the jazz house.  students (elementary through high school) are always admitted free
                                 with a paid admission - half price without.
