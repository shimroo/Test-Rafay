hazard mitigation plan



the pine county office of emergency management is working with u-spatial at the university of minnesota duluth to update the county’s hazard mitigation plan (hmp). the plan assesses the natural hazards that pose risk to the county, such as tornadoes, straight line winds, ice storms, blizzards, wildfire, flooding, and extreme temperatures and identifies ways to minimize the damage of future events. as the county works to update the plan, it wants to hear from the public.
public input is an essential part of the plan update. as part of the planning process, pine county is seeking feedback from residents and businesses to incorporate into the plan. your input will be recorded and incorporated into the planning process. 
please review attached document and submit your answers to denise.anderson@co.pine.mn.us
