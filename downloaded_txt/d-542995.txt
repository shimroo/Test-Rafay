 remembering a legend
 his legacy lives on…
 his voice will
never be silenced 















 "robert goulet, there ain't nobody like him, anywhere. goulet is a burst, or rather one long blast, of unbridled singing power that bears the punch of several freight trains moving down the track at full throttle.” 
miami herald 1966
 

“what a reed! he’s got a voice as wide as sophie tucker’s ass.” frank sinatra
