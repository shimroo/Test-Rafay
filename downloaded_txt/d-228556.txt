anaheim colony
of the city’s four historic districts, the anaheim colony is the largest and first to be adopted in 1997. wonder why it’s called the colony? it’s boundaries match that of the original german colony founded in 1857. with over 1,000 qualified structures located inside the 1.8-square miles, the concentration is higher than the other districts. the four anaheim colony monuments mark the entry points to the district.















five points
adopted by the city in october of 2004, the five points historic district preserves the concentration of architecturally unique and significant homes from roughly the same era as those in the anaheim colony district. five points gets its’ name from the five points street intersections where the historical five points commercial building originally stood.















hoskins
situated inside of anaheim colony, the hoskins historic district is a small neighborhood that became it’s own independent district in december of 2008. in this neighborhood you will find a collection of interesting homes built during the 1940s and 50s that showcase the rise in popularity of the ranch style home following world war ii.















historic palm
named after palm street which is now harbor blvd., the historic palm district was adopted by the city in october of 2006. the architectural styles of this district are mostly french, english, and spanish. the addition of this district’s 180 qualified historic structures filled the gap between north street and la palma.
