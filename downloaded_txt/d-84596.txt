focused on health.


 

earth weave carpet mill’s commitment to crafting 100% natural fiber carpets and area rugs is unsurpassed in the industry. our commitment lies not in recycling petrochemical products, but rather in taking advantage of the ultimate manufacturer - mother nature and her renewable natural resources. our products use either raw natural colored wool or organosoftcolor™ dyes (organic). we apply absolutely no toxic stain or fire retardant treatments or mothproofing chemicals, period. we only produce 100% natural wool floor coverings that are  innovative and high quality used for both residential and light commercial applications.
