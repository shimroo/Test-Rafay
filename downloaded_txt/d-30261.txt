life in our region

set in an outdoor-lover’s paradise, etsu’s main campus is located in beautiful and
                                    vibrant johnson city, tennessee. it is a short drive to numerous thriving mountain towns including bristol, kingsport, and historic jonesborough, as well as
                                    asheville in bordering north carolina. 
and with gorgeous lakes, rivers, and hiking and biking trails nearby — including more
                                    than 100 miles of the appalachian trail — there is always something new to explore.
