educate. organize. take action.
bcaction was founded 30+ years ago in san francisco during two public health crises-the aids outbreak and the breast cancer epidemic-and that helped shape its mission and fuel its activism. early members apprenticed themselves to the aids group, act up, and shared many of that group’s tactics, turning their anger into action to push for better treatments, true prevention, and investment in public health.
our founders saw their disease not as a personal tragedy, but as a larger social justice and public health crisis. they knew that individual changes in behavior weren’t the answer, and pushed for sweeping systemic change instead.
