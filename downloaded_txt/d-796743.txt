food for thought





the first compendium of gi values of non-western foods evaluating
 the quality of carbohydrate in the diet could be considered more 
important than ever.  markers of quality such as wholegrains, fibre 
content and sugars are routinely included on food labels and in national
 food composition tables. but another marker of carbohydrate quality, 
the glycemic index (gi), is rarely available from these sources. 
instead, informed consumers, researchers and health professionals must 
rely on multiple sources including papers published in the scientific 
literature, online databases and books such as the shoppers guide to gi 
values.  in the lucky country (australia!) and new zealand, gi claims 
are permitted on the labels of healthier foods, and a not-for-profit 
food endorsement charity, the gi foundation, also promotes healthy low 
gi foods at the point of sale. the first gi values of 62 common 
foods using a standardized methodology were published 4 decades ago by 
david jenkins, tom wolever and others at the university of toronto.  
since then, the university of sydney has played an important role of 
compiling and updating reliable, international tables of gi values. the 
tables have been instrumental in improving the quality of research 
examining the relation between dietary glycemic potential and health.  
indeed, they are among the most cited papers in the field. in 1995, 
there were 565 entries in the edition published in the american journal 
of clinical nutrition. by 2002 there were 750 foods, and by 2008 there 
were 2487 in the third edition published in diabetes care.  and i am 
pleased to say that after a long gestation, the 2021 edition with 
international authorship and over 4000 foods, is currently under 
review.  in
 the meantime, our colleagues in singapore, led by professor jeya henry 
have published the first compendium of 940 non-western foods, citing 
over 150 papers. the table includes data from malaysia, thailand, 
indonesia, philippines, japan, korea, china, taiwan, hong kong, india, 
sri lanka, emirates, oman, saudi arabia, lebanon, as well as singapore. 
this is an important milestone because the vast majority of published gi
 values are of western origin, notably european, australian and north 
american.  we know that gi values are altered by the degree of cooking 
and processing and this will vary from country-to-country. moreover, in 
asian countries, carbohydrate foods provide a much greater proportion of
 dietary energy – around 60%. hence, the potential to reduce 
postprandial glycaemia by substituting high gi foods for lower gi 
counterparts is also magnified.  singapore has the distinction of being 
the only country with two gi testing services using the iso methodology.
 and recently, the china national research institute of food and 
fermentation industries has offered a commercial gi testing service 
after extensive training at the university of sydney.  in collaboration 
with sydney, cnriffi has also translated the online 2008 international 
tables of gi and glycemic load into chinese.  we hope these wonderful 
developments will translate into healthier carbohydrate food offerings 
throughout asia, the middle east and beyond. read more: the shoppers guide to gi values sydney university’s searchable on-line gi database henry and colleagues. a glycaemic index compendium of non-western foods.

what’s new?





low glycemic index diets improve health of south indians with diabetes traditional
 indian diets are rich in dietary fibre and wholegrains, which generally
 have a lower gi than more refined grains. however, similar to many 
other countries, there has been a transition to more refined grains over
 the last few decades. this may be one factor contributing to the 
increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the indian population.  with
 this in mind, researchers from the amrita institute of medical sciences
 and research centre in india have recently published two papers 
exploring the role of glycemic index in south indian diets, showing 
several benefits of choosing low gi foods. in the first paper published in nutrients,
 they reported on the findings of a randomised controlled trial 
investigating the effect of a low gi diet on blood glucose levels and 
body composition in people with type 2 diabetes in south india.  a total
 of 40 people aged 35-65 years were recruited and randomised to follow 
either a low gi diet plan or their usual diet (the control group) for 6 
months. dietary advice was reinforced by the study dietitian throughout 
the study period.  compared to the control group, people in the low gi 
diet group had significantly greater reductions in weight, body mass 
index (bmi) and body fat levels, including abdominal fat.  they also had
 significantly greater reductions in hba1c (a measure of average blood 
glucose levels over the past 2-3 months). the second paper published in the international journal of environmental research and public health
 reported on the findings from 80 subjects from the same study, this 
time looking at cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) risk factors. 
again, the researchers found greater reductions in weight and hba1c 
levels in the low gi diet group compared to the control group.  they 
also found greater reductions in insulin levels, insulin resistance, 
triglycerides (blood fats), c-reactive protein (crp) and apolipoprotein b
 (apob). apob is the main protein found in ldl-cholesterol and high 
levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.  crp is a
 marker of inflammation in the body and is also associated with heart 
disease risk as it can indicate inflammation in the blood vessels to the
 heart. taken together, the findings of these two studies suggest
 that switching to a low gi diet can help with weight loss, improve 
blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity and improve cardiovascular 
risk factors in south indian people with type 2 diabetes. the low
 gi diet in these studies included foods with a low gi that are 
traditionally used in south indian cuisine.  these included red rice, 
barley and whole wheat flour puttu, rolled or steel-cut oats, rose matta
 rice, broken wheat, green gram, and wholewheat flour roti. read more: pavithran and colleagues. the

diabetes care





diabetes in south-east asia in 2019, there were an 
estimated 88 million people in south-east asia living with diabetes and 
the number of people with diabetes is projected to increase to 153 
million by 2045 unless successful preventative measures are implemented.
 there is mounting evidence that asians have higher postprandial 
(after-meal) blood glucose levels and poorer insulin sensitivity than 
caucasians for the same foods, which puts them at increased risk of 
developing type 2 diabetes. improved prevention and management of 
diabetes are therefore now public health priorities in south-east asian 
countries such as india, malaysia, singapore and thailand.  south-east
 asians consume approximately 60% of their total energy intake from 
carbohydrates compared with 42% for caucasians living in the region. 
rice and noodles are the main carbohydrate staples in the south-east 
asian diet, and studies have shown that consumption of rice and noodles 
has been linked to hyperglycemia and risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
 in addition to rice and noodles, the traditional asian diet is heavily 
represented by foods derived from cereals, flours, and other starches 
such as rice porridge, steamed buns (bao), and glutinous rice cakes 
(kuehs). the challenge many people living in south-east asia face
 with regard to managing their carbohydrate consumption is that 
high-carbohydrate foods are not just sustenance, but are an important 
part of south-east asian culture. foods such as rice are part of the 
region’s cultural identity, meal, and habits, and individuals may choose
 to compromise health over food. therefore, an effective approach toward
 managing diabetes in south-east asia would be to improve carbohydrate 
quality in addition to reducing carbohydrate quantity. in other words, 
reducing the glycemic load of the south-east asian diet. glycemic
 load can be reduced by substituting lower gi options for regular high 
gi varieties. from a food perspective, it is possible to modify the food
 composition and structure through ingredients and processing to reduce 
the amount of carbohydrate, limit the rate of digestion by controlling 
enzymatic activity/accessibility, or slow down the rate of glucose 
absorption. specific examples of what can be done are discussed next in 
perspectives. read more: idf diabetes atlas ninth edition 2019

perspectives: dr alan barclay





lowering the glyemic impact of south-east asian diets food
 is not merely a collection of nutrients, and neither is it medicine – 
it’s so much more than that. from the day we are born to the day we die,
 food not only nourishes us, but it provides pleasure, social 
interaction and anchors us to our family, community, culture and point 
in time. food should not only be good for us — it should also be 
enjoyable, affordable and environmentally sustainable.  rather
 than trying to change the cultural food identity of people living in 
south-east asia, by reducing the amount of carbohydrate they 
traditionally eat down to western levels of consumption, we can work 
with both individuals and the food industry to improve the regions 
eating habits, and the food supply, to help reduce the risk of 
developing type 2 diabetes. there are a wide range of 
opportunities and strategies available to reduce the glycemic impact of 
carbohydrates, whether eaten as a food or in the context of a meal, for 
both food manufacturers and consumers. singaporean researchers may wee 
and jeya henry recently published a comprehensive set of 
recommendations, which include: using alternative ingredients rice
 - the common recommendation for a lower gi alternative to white rice 
(average gi = 78) is brown rice (average gi = 65). there are also white 
rice varieties that have a lower gi such as basmati rice (gi = 50). 
alternatively, grains with a lower gi than white rice can be used 
instead, like barley (gi= 29), buckwheat (gi=50), oat (gi= 58), and 
sorghum (gi=54). flour - a large variety of asian foods, snacks, 
and desserts are made from rice, glutinous rice, and wheat flours, and 
have a high gi. one strategy to reduce the glycemic impact of these 
traditional flour-based products is to use alternative flours extracted 
from seeds, grains, nuts, fruits, or tubers of other plants that have a 
lower gi. for example, buckwheat flour is commonly used in japan and 
korea to make buckwheat noodles (soba; gi = 56). using functional ingredients dietary
 fibres – using viscous dietary fibres like agar, alginate, β-glucan, 
guar gum, konjac, psyllium and xanthan gum will lower the glycemic 
impact of foods. they can be relatively easily added to foods by food 
industry. psyllium can be purchased in supermarkets and some specialty 
stores and can be added to foods by consumers. changing processing methods and parameters for the food without
 using alternative ingredients or adding functional ingredients, it is 
possible to manipulate the structure of the starch-containing food and 
its subsequent digestibility via processing methods and conditions. the
 main parameters that affect the gi of starchy carbohydrates are cooking
 temperature/time, amount of water, and cooling temperature/time 
(storage conditions). all of these can be modified to influence their 
digestibility and therefore the gi. for example: do not overcook grain’s – serve them when they are al dente, like pasta; par boil rice and other grains in a minimal amount of water; cook then cool higher gi starchy foods like rice and potatoes before eating. serve either cold or reheat. these simple changes will result in lower postprandial (after meal) blood glucose. of
 course, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. ultimately, the 
effectiveness of the strategy will depend on how well the new textural 
and sensorial qualities of the food are accepted by people, whether 
glycemic impact can be covertly reduced for minimal dietary habit 
change, how compatible the strategy is with an existing food product, 
and how economically or technologically feasible it is to apply the 
strategy. read more: wee and henry. reducing

good carbs food facts




when
 i first saw a dosa being brought to a neighbouring table at an indian 
restaurant, i was both surprised and intrigued by its appearance and how
 it would be eaten. it is certainly a spectacular food, but it’s also 
fun to eat. you simply break pieces off and use it to scoop up mouthfuls
 of chutney.  dosa
 originated from southern india and is a crepe-style very thin pancake 
made with a fermented batter usually made from rice and lentils (dal), 
although a variety of grains and legumes may be used including millet 
and chickpeas. whole rice and lentils are mixed with water and pureed in
 a blender/food processor before allowing them to ferment for a day or 
so in a warm place to grow the natural yeasts and develop the flavour. 
some recipes call for fenugreek seeds that add flavour but are also 
thought to improve digestion. cheat recipes call for pre-ground rice and
 lentil flour, even wholewheat flour, and adding lemon juice instead of 
fermenting the batter. crispness is the name of the game when it 
comes to cooking dosa, because crispness makes for a stronger scoop. the
 batter is cooked in an oiled, heavy-based flat pan on moderate heat 
allowing the dosa to cook and brown gradually. they can then be shaped 
while still warm and will retain this shape when cool, such as long tube
 rolls, or like a lampshade (lifted up and fanned out from the middle). 
however, there is variation in the texture also. restaurants serve 
‘paper dosa’ (like the ones i saw) that are stiff, whereas home cooks 
generally produce a spongier, softer version. traditionally they 
are consumed as a breakfast dish, although the rise of indian street 
food around the world has blurred the timing and it is consumed at any 
time of day. the nutritional content depends on the ingredients 
of the batter, and this varies across india and throughout the indian 
diaspora. incorporating legumes with the grains ramps up the overall 
nutritional value, and using wholegrains increases the fibre content. 
the ingredients also impact the glycemic index (gi). a new publication has
 revealed gi values for may traditional non-western foods, finding gi 
ratings for dosa are high, moderate or low depending on the ingredients.
 there may be additional gut health benefits of dosa from the probiotic effect of the fermented batter. there’s
 an art to making dosa at home and practice makes perfect. if you’re not
 lucky enough to have a dosa expert in your family, do what i do and 
order it in an indian restaurant. in fact, there are entire restaurants 
devoted to this specialty dish. while we can’t travel freely right now, 
we can support our local restaurants and take a culinary journey 
instead.
