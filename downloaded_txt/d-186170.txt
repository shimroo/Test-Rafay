mdroads.com is a guide to 
maryland's highway system, past and present. information is organized by type of highway (interstate, us or 
state) and route number. this site is, and will probably always be, a work in 
progress; as time permits, i'll add maps, exit guides, and highway photos. 
in the meantime, here's the canonical list of 
maryland highways, the text file from which sprang this entire site.


so what's here, you ask?  check out the links below:




maryland's interstates
information on all interstate highways in maryland, including mileages, exits, and historical info.
maryland's us highways
all maryland us highways, current and those no longer around. route 66 isn't the only extinct us highway; maryland 
too has its fair share.
state routes
many of your favorites, or maybe not so favorites as the case may be, plus some others you may have never heard of.
 also many unmarked routes and numbers which disappeared long ago. you may find you live along an unmarked or decommissioned
  route that carries a number or once did.  there's also a list of unassigned numbers.

you can also jump straight to route pages using the pulldown menus to the left. each interstates
 and us highway has a page to itself. state pages are grouped with roughly twenty 
 routes per page. see the legend page for more information.
road pics
roadside photos from all over maryland, arranged by county.
