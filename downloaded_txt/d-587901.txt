                 why play placer  jr. hillmen?
children play tackle football because it is fun, challenging and exciting. most kids love being part of a team. tackle football teaches cooperation and teamwork, helps develop positive social skills and teaches respect for others. it helps build self-confidence, a positive self-image and self-worth. it enables a child to improve upon and develop a broad range of motor skills like throwing, catching, running, kicking, balance, agility and coordination. because a large variety of skills and physical abilities are required on a tackle football team, there is a position for every child to play. no matter your size, speed or ability, tackle football has a position you can play and excel at.
