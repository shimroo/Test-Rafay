customer rides"all, following up from a phone conversation with dan; just wanted to thank all of you for all your help in completing my 70 super bee. the 18 spline a833 is without doubt the best money i spent on the entire build. i have close to 3000 hrs in this car with 11 months of that on a rotisserie and the 4 speed is what brings it all together. it shifts like butter and every gear is perfect, i can't thank you enough and the service and expertise is second to none. i highly recommend brewer's performance for anyone building a 4 speed mopar."– scott via email –
