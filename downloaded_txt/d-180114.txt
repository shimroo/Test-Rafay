welcome to victory junction!
free from the confines of disease, illness or disability, children discover that they can just be kids! how does this happen? victory junction is a medically safe, yet exhilarating camp, that challenges children who have a serious medical condition to try things they never imagined possible. as they conquer activities like zip lining and archery or experience bowling, fishing or swimming, children build confidence that will shape how they view the rest of their lives.
the magic happens on our lush 84 acres in the rolling hills of randleman, north carolina near greensboro. once children pass through our gates, the boundaries and limitations they live with on a daily basis disappear and they simply concentrate on having fun! that’s when they shine!
