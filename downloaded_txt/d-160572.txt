inhaled medications and veterinarian information
tens of thousands of cats are successfully using inhaled medication 
                                        daily to manage their asthma. we've made available a complete resource for
		      inhaled medications
		      for cats including dr. philip padrid's
		      protocol,
		      still photos
		      and videos of symptoms & treatment.
		      
newly diagnosed?
if you are unfamiliar with asthma in cats and
		      seeking general information, we recommend you
		      study the asthma
		      overview and treatment areas
		      of this site first.
ongoing care
no two cats are the same so read about medication choices.
		      share your cat's story and gain personal support with
		      online resources.
		      to read the whole site, follow the continue
		      reading links at the bottom of each page.

dedication










this 
		  site is dedicated to raja and animals lovers everywhere. 
		  raja's disappearance in 2001 led us to fritz, abandoned at 
                  a shelter. we have learned 
		  from the teaching of fritz, other asthmatic cats, caregivers, 
		  product developers and veterinarians the world 
		  over. best of health to all, sincerely, james, kathryn 
		  and fritz the brave.
