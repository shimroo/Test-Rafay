 luxury house on wheels 
the most luxurious luxury motor-home designed in austria. the largest, one of the highest and most importantly, the most functional motor-home. it has literally everything that the soul of a traveler may wish.
strictly speaking, this luxurious trailer will give head start over many not so cheap apartments! underfloor heating, dynamic climate control, exclusive interior are only a small part of what this van indulges with. this car costs 3 million dollars.

 the fastest jet-ski 
competition modifications are adapted for comfortable riding at high speeds and performing extreme tricks. such models have aggressive design, high performance, lightweight hull, one seat or its complete absence.
powerful jet-ski among all presented models of the company sea-doo. fans of extreme riding will love the rapid acceleration to 100 km/h in 3.8 seconds.

 the first motor-home 
its creators are bristol carriage company, and dr. william gordon stabels, whom you may know as the famous science-fiction writer, got the bizarre curiosity. the house with the name “the wanderer” was specially commissioned.
