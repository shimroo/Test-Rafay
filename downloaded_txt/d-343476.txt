			an article written by melvin mccallum about our site founder, mike king, and submitted on 1/25/2020
			
			donât know where to begin
            
            iâll begin at permian high school in 1959, when it first opened as a new school in odessa, texas.
            we had attended odessa high school for our sophomore year and or junior year for the now
            seniors and the first graduating class of 1960. i was supposed to be in the class of 1961, but i
            had friends in a lot of different classes. by it being a brand new school and all of us being what
            we were, wild and crazy kids, mostly, we didnât always abide by the rules. iâve written about the
            first school bonfire and you know how that turned out!
            sure, they had printed a new student handbook with all the rules and regulations in it but most
            of us just wanted to continue having fun and get out of school as soon as we could. there were
            several outstanding students with knowledge and proper etiquette running out of their ears, so
            to speak, but i was not one of those performers. i worked after school and was helping my
            parents put me through school as best as i could. i had an old car, and it took a lot of time and
            money to keep it in shape. several people became friends over the course of the next several
            years and one in particular, mike king.
            mike was class of 1962 but he paled around with us some because he was interested in cars and
            anyone interested in cars were called âgearheadsâ. all of us gearheads were mostly poor and
            just had what we could afford or either ran around with someone who had a car or pickup.
            mikeâs father was a roughneck working in the oil patch and driving a 1958 chevy four door
            hardtop belaire with the new air suspension and that brings me to my first low rider of sorts.
            every once in a while, mike would get to drive his fatherâs crew car and he would let all the air
            out of the suspension, consequently making it a low rider. of course, it didnât jump up and down
            like a true low rider but in 1961, we didnât know about low riders, except that crew car riding on
            the axles with no suspension whatsoever!
            when mike was able to have the crew car, and he let all the air out of the suspension, the car
            rode like a wagon and about four inches off the ground! he avoided any low places otherwise it
            would drag bottom. it was definitely fun to ride in because it was so unique, even though it rode
            like a wagon with no springs!
            mikeâs school car was an old white 1955 ford two door, probably the cheapest model produced
            that year. one day at lunch hour at permian, mike pulled into the parking lot in front of the
            school with a mannequins leg covered with a nylon stocking sticking out of the back of the trunk.
            as you can well imagine, two motorcycle cops were right behind him with their flashing lights
            and motioning for him to pull over. he pulled into a parking space and got out and by that time, a
            bunch of us had run down there to see what was going on. mike was grinning at us but as he

            turned to confront the cops, his demeanor changed to complete surprise as he asked, âwhat are
            yâall pulling me over for?â
            one of the cops was a well known young officer, named leroy brown and he was very simpatico
            to most of us poor kids. he laughed and asked mike to please open the trunk, to which mike
            replied stoically, âwhy would i want to open my trunk, officers?â by that time, leroy had
            walked up to the car and was standing by the trunk, looking at the mannequinâs leg and shaking
            his head. you can imagine what they first thought when they saw that leg sticking out of the
            trunk but upon closer examination saw exactly what it was. the other office was motioning for
            us to stay back as we had been edging closer and closer to the car.
            mike walked around a nd saw the leg sticking out of his trunk and with great surprise said, ânow
            how in the world did that get in there?â well, we all knew how it had gotten in there but we
            just allowed him to go on with his fun and no one said a word. mike opened the trunk by untying
            a short piece of rope he had tied the trunk lid down and the lid sprang up revealing the rest of
            the mannequin! leroy, reached in and pushed the mannequin leg so it wasnât sticking out and told
            mike to shut the trunk lid and go on to class. mike told leroy, âi donât know how that got into
            my trunk. you reckon someoneâs playing a trick on me?â leroy just smiled and got back on his
            motorcycle and he and the other office rode away.
            mike told us, âi swear i donât how that mannequin got into my trunk.â smiling all the time!
            after mike got out of high school and was working in odessa, he was riding a motorcycle one
            bright summer day, following too close behind a fast moving car, when the car slammed on the
            brakes and mike hit it with such force that he was thrown off the motorcycle and his body was
            propelled through the back window of the car! it cut him up pretty bad and he was taken to the
            hospital and had some surgery and was back on the motorcycle before too long.
            i lost tract of mike until about 1995. he started a website www.permian.net initially listing all
            the graduating classes and a few personal websites for his good friends. he also had a memorial
            page for each year. he worked on that a lot during his life in california. he had spent some time
            in the slammer but even that didnât slow him down. when i asked for a picture of him, he sent
            me a picture in an email and the picture image started out with his high school picture then
            gradually progressed until it was showing him currently. he was a genius with a computer! we
            corresponded until about two days before he died. he told me he was dying and there wasnât
            anything he could do about it. we said our goodbyes and that was the last i heard from him.
            mike was a great guy in my opinion and a lot of fun as a kid growing up in odessa.
