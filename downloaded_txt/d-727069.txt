a series of 10 novels by ken kirk


annis is the 19 year old queen of the west highlands of scotland. still grieving for her murdered mother & haunted by self doubt, she worships her hero from the distant past, 'kiffan the defiant', who fought a brave & daring war of resistance against the invading vikings. king james of scotland has inherited the throne of england and gone south to london. meanwhile, the highland clans are at each other's throats. can annis be the warrior queen who, legend has it, will unite her people? the powerful & influential laird of the mcdonalds throws his all behind this reluctant hero in a desperate bid to save the scottish highlands from self destruction.



greesha is a dreamer. she dreams of the future and of the past. her dreams, however, are incredibly vivid and astonishingly real. slowly, the shocking truth dawns on her: the dreams she has feel like reality because they truly are reality. when she starts to hear voices, she tries to ignore them, but the speaker will not be quiet. when, finally, she replies, she embarks on an astonishing adventure that will take her to places she had no idea existed.
greesha was born on the island of ellan vannin in the irish sea (which will, one day, become known as the isle of man). she begins life as another hungry mouth to feed in a desperately poor family. as she grows, she develops gifts that risk her being accused of being a witch. there is only one consequence of such an accusation: that is death by burning.
 in a moment of carelessness, while dreaming, greesha accidentally saves someoneâs life and, in doing so, fundamentally changes the history of scotland. can she make things right or will she be drawn, ever deeper, into a web of strange events? her intervention means that, when king james of scotland becomes king james of england in 1603, there will still be a queen of the scottish west highlands and she will be a strong rallying point for the clans who live there.
