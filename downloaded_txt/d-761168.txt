welcome

message





i welcome all visitors to this website, and may i share with you a few remarks about the national university of lesotho. our university is old and yet new; we are small yet big; we are national, yet international; and we are conservative yet dynamic. let me explain.having been established since 1945, we are one of the oldest universities in africa, with a credible record of huge alumni who have made enviable waves both in the south african sub-region, and the world over in all fields of human endeavor. yet, we are new because our programmes have been fitted for the attraction of contemporary youths and the need to get them ready for entrepreneurship and great exploits in national and global labour markets.
