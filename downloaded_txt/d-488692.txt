billings logan international airportthe gateway to the big sky and beyond.convenient flight options available both year round and seasonally through multiple hubs.attention.  don’t be late!   here are a couple of quick and simple tips to improve your travel experience.   *before arriving, be sure to check the contents of your carry-on and checked baggage to make sure they do not contain items that are not allowed and will delay the screening process.  *especially important is to arrive at least two hours before your flight is scheduled to depart to allow time to park your vehicle, check baggage and proceed through tsa passenger screening.   *relax and enjoy some refreshments at the new facilities located in the great room on the concourse before you board your flight.  thank you for traveling with us!  follow us @flybillingsfacebook instagram x
