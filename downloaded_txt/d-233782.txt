step viii: charting your path
the eight step of inductive bible study is, "write it down!" 

a book chart will help you greatly! this is the step where you keep track of what you learn. by writing it down in an organized fashion, god's word will become more clear and crisp. we are able to record what god says to us, this way we will be able to take more ownership and then greater transformation. then can look back and see god at work in our lives and this will be a great encouragement in times of struggle, and in times of joy. plus, now you have notes to refer back to and even teach from!

schaeffer on baptism
our confession of faith, chapter 28, section 5, makes it very clear that our subordinate standards do not teach baptismal regeneration: "although it be a great sin to condemn or neglect this ordinance, yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as that no person can be regenerated or saved without it, or that all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated."

are you headed for burnout?

pastoral ministry and church leadership is a tiring task. it is filled with all kinds of responsibility and unexpected crises. it produces far more stress than perhaps any other period of church history.
