harleys were a lot more fun when they were exclusively ridden by angry, violent, intoxicated, anti-social, poorly groomed, sexually deviant, heavily tattooed maniacs !


















on march 7th, 1968 the hessians motorcycle club was founded in southern california and expanded throughout the west coast. we have endured over five decades of biker wars, law enforcement & everyday dangers of the lifestyle on the road. to this day we are still respected and have great friendships among other clubs across the united states. we ride below the radar and believe in quality not quantity. we respect those who respect us.
