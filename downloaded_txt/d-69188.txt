nonprofit loan financing

cultivate local innovation

too often, promising ideas fail to take root because the task of setting up and managing administrative systems is time-consuming and difficult. in the 1990s, we created the partner project program to allow nonprofit leaders to focus their energy and resources on providing their services and programs and on fundraising. the fund currently has over 80 partner projects which provide vital services and programs across the country. 
 



partner projects













supporting the nonprofit & public sectors
we build long-term relationships between nonprofit and government partners through our fiscal sponsorship and nonprofit loan financing. 





fiscal sponsorship

the partner project program provides start-up projects and established nonprofit organizations with:

financial management services
human resources services
comprehensive insurance coverage
access to a team of financial & operational experts

nonprofit loan financing

the cash flow loan program provides interest-free loans to nonprofits with:  

capital to continue operations and programming while waiting on committed funds.

"the fund has been instrumental in getting our project to where it is today.  allowing us to focus on fundraising and building the program. the fund is a godsend to nonprofit management.”
