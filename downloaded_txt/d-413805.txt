for almost 30 years, innisfree has 
been one of the finest irish pub bands in southern california. they have played 
for weddings, anniversaries, wakes, concerts, in hospitals, state prisons, and 
countless irish pubs, fairs and festivals.  although their roots are 
planted firmly in the irish pub tradition, the band incorporates plenty of rock, 
country, folk and american traditions into their shows.
