summary of a summary





i haven't really set foot in the old savage road studio in a while. summarizing something that i know nothing about? precious. 

i have been working in the neutral ground productions studios(tm a subsidary of ngrp). i am continuing to write, record, mix and edit the epics that gush forth from my mind. they are so popular, that other songwriters keep trying to take credit for them. they are that good, if i do say so myself!

the famous hungarians, aka al jones and the famous hungarians has been recording a massive collection of demos, some of which recently went on offer here. see the links in posts below. 


we are still looking for someone who would like to collaborate on some music videos with us! our music, your vision, a star is (re)born. contact us through this site.

hello, and welcome back. i am well, and how are you? 

i am exploring ways to release this new album digitally. i don't care to wait six months for itunes to approve me, nor to pay $60 a month to have my site hosted. i wonder what you might sugggest?

i do have the digital files available through google docs, and if you would like to purchase either the first, second or third(outakes) famous hungarians album, i could share you the link from here.

i still have to polish the project up, including artwork and album covers, and all, but the music is available now.
