more about us





the support from melco’s online tutorials and all of their videos have helped us expand our product base of what we can do. since starting this journey, this has helped us become more financially stable and able to have a solid income for a side business. not sure where we would be if we hadn’t bought our first melco machine. 
kalee and lane ikerd, otter creek embroidery


i researched which machine to buy for a year, and melco stood out to me over all the rest! i own 2 emt16s and a bravo. 
yvette shipley, ibettink llc


melco has played a key role in growing my business, and i plan to add a new machine as the market continues to expand and customers are increasingly enjoying our offerings. 
xylon funes, ingravi llc


my melco story started 5 years ago when i purchased my first machine, i did a very small amount of work with it and was so scared to use it! i cannot believe the amount of embroidery requests i continue to get once people see what i can do. the work that these machines put out is phenomenal and it’s helping me grow my business! i’m so incredibly thankful i chose melco and i couldn’t be happier with their service and assistance they provide whenever it’s needed! 
amanda siegelmelco customer


have tried other machines in the past however nothing comparison to melco machines. started with one and now have another. business is great. 
keith pelowski,melco customer


melco has been a great company to work with over the years. my first machine was purchased in 1991 and the support was great and in 2009, my third melco and new software were a huge step up for design capabilities and machine functioning features mpacted my business by allowing me to offer a wider range of embroidery offering in our small town. i love the live talks and video library, thank you for supporting your customers!
