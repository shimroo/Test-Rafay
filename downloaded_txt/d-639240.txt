 find the horse of your dreams











as a child, i often dreamed of having that horse.  i had visions of galloping bareback across rolling pastures, the wind blowing through my hair.  not a care in the world.  i grew up in the city, but eventually found a neighbor that let me ride.  i fell off.  a lot... boy, did i get an early education.  i finally purchased my first of several, horses.  over the years, my protégés went on to win many championships in the western and english show arenas.in my ever-evolving horsemanship journey,  i have learned one key thing.  color and looks are nice, but a good mind is the most valuable asset.  a good minded horse is a pleasure to have... anytime, anywhere. on the trail, in the ring, out on the ranch or with your family, we all seek a good minded horse.  .i have found that there is a great need for a trail horse that also has the finesse and finish of a well-versed arena horse.  one that is soft in the bridle, moves off your leg and is easy to rate with your seat and energy.  we have a hard time keeping ahead of the demand, as there is a big void in this area. horses are either show trained or basic trail horses. it is difficult to find a horse that possesses a combination of both these characteristics. our ultimate trail horse program is designed and structured to fill the void. we will offer 6 horses a year that will go through our extensive training program. we are also able to tailor the program for each horse so as to accommodate the personal needs of the buyer.  for more information on the ultimate trail horse training program, click here.we will also offer a few, select, outside sales horses. as always, these horses must go through our 30-day evaluation process before they reach the website. we work with valued and trusted breeders who share the same respect and passion as we do and provide us with great horses that have the qualities that our customers demand   scroll below to see a selection of our current offerings.
