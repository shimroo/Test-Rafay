tigerhawk
tigerhawk (ti*ger*hawk): n. 1. the title of this blog and the nom de plume of its founding blogger; 2. a deep bow to the princeton tigers and the iowa hawkeyes; 3. the nickname for iowa's hawkeye logo. posts include thoughts of the day on international affairs, politics, things that strike us as hilarious and personal observations. the opinions we express are our own, and not those of each other, our employers, our relatives, our dead ancestors, or unrelated people of similar ethnicity.

a new blog you might enjoyÂ 

by tigerhawk at 4/27/2016 07:12:00 pm 


written in a style  eerily similar to tigerhawk, the austin blog blueberry town might well appeal to my long lost readers. (the reference, for those of you who are not students of texas politics, is to texas governor rick perry's observation that austin is "the blueberry in the tomato soup of texas".)
the editor of blueberry town tells me he'd love to see you over there!
