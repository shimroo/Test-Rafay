we worked on this project with south saskatchewan river watershed stewards inc. and dr. markus brinkmann from the school of environment and sustainability at the university of saskatchewan.sampling for possible microplastic occurrences in the south saskatchewan river watershedto date, there have been no studies on microplastics in the south saskatchewan river watershed. the south saskatchewan river watershed stewards inc. (ssrwsi) received funding through the city of saskatoon and the fish and wildlife development fund to determine the presence or absence of microplastics in the water source, as well as their type(s) and quantities.collaborating on this project are dr. markus brinkmann, assistant professor at the school of environment and sustainability at the university of saskatchewan, and the safe drinking water foundation (sdwf). dr. brinkmann, one of his students and the ssrwsi technician are undertaking the fieldwork and sdwf will be supplying additional communications and educational materials.a plankton net will be used to sample the water column at several sample sites along the south saskatchewan river within saskatchewan (see picture 1 below), including three sites within the city of saskatoon and at beaver creek. sites funded by the city of saskatoon will be sampled monthly may through august while sites along the river funded by the fish and wildlife development fund will be sampled in may and possibly also in june.on may 20, 2020, the first sampling occurred in saskatoon at the northeast swale, aspen ridge forebay, evergreen stormwater pond (see picture 2 below), and beaver creek. thank you to the meewasin valley authority for helping with access at several sites. the following day, samples were taken upstream and downstream of outlook (see picture 3 below) and at the fred heal canoe launch near saskatoon. on may 28, 2020 and may 29, 2020, the first month of sampling was completed with sampling upstream and downstream of cabri, at the clarkboro ferry crossing, and downstream of st. louis.this project will provide baseline data on microplastics in the south saskatchewan river watershed, which will help inform future work and projects.

the sdwf has developed problem-based learning sets for operation water drop, operation water pollution, operation water biology, operation water health, and operation water flowthese sets are comprised of inquiry learning activities for the students. the teacher takes on the role of a facilitator of learning and lets the students teach themselves through research and critical thinking.
