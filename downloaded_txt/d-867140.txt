achieving your project’s goals through creative design solutions
















quality, award-winning,
innovative projects.
we are recognized as a national leader in historic preservation (qualified per the us secretary of the interiors’ guidelines), adaptive reuse, and unique retrofits.
we pride ourselves for receiving smart growth awards even for new structures. sustainable design is an integral part of our process and an inherent result of our projects.




our work






































traditional & digital design tools.
we enjoy involving you in the design process, using traditional and electronic tools, to communicate wide-ranging design possibilities. our practice constantly evolves by adopting the latest technical tools available. we were early adopters of computer-aided design and building information modeling (bim). we continue to utilize cloud-based technology to transform our design ideas into 3-dimensional images, welcoming clients into our collaborative design process.
