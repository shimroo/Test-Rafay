the retreat at seabranch


bordering a wildlife populated state park, and at the end of a lush, wide and winding boulevard, the retreat at seabranch is aptly named. a divosta-built community, our homes are nestled amid numerous lakes and wetlands.
since we are surrounded by wildlife, it is important to know that feeding wildlife is generally discouraged and, in some cases, illegal.
in florida, it is illegal to feed manatees, sandhill cranes, bears, raccoons, foxes and alligators.  intentionally placing food or garbage, allowing the placement of food or garbage, or offering food or garbage in such a manner that it attracts black bears, foxes, raccoons, or sandhill cranes and thereby creates a public nuisance is prohibited.

homeowners are members in the retreat at seabranch homeowners association, managed by a five-person board of directors. the directors are: john curren, phil rossow,  tom hartnett, and bob demoustes.  our property management is through advantage property management. we retain outside professional legal, financial and engineering consultants. prudent oversight has resulted in a position of strong financial reserves and stable hoa fees.
our non-gated community is considered to be one of the most desirable in martin county. residents are actively involved with:

various committees
the retreat women's club
our relay for life team
the retreat assistance network (ran)
social groups, game days, and activities
