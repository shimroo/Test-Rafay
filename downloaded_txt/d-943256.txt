the universal peace pagoda, new jersey 

tradition of establishment of pagodas
building the pagoda is a buddhist tradition in burma. therefore, a thousand pagodas are found almost everywhere in the country which is known as the land of pagodas. burmese people perform various wholesome deeds to accumulate merits and they take delight in merit-making by constructing pagodas.
king asoka
in b.c. 232, king asoka, an emperor of india established eighty-four thousand stupas or cetiyas in his empire to commemorate and pay homage to the buddha and to promote and propagate buddha's teachings. they asoka's act has inspired buddhists all over the world to build the more and more cetiyas or pagodas through the ages. 
on one occasion, while the buddha and his followers were on a journey to baranasi, they came to a field where there was a spirit shrine. not far from the shrine, a brahmin was ploughing the field. seeing the brahmin the buddha sent for him. when he arrived, the brahmin made obeisance to the shrine but not to the buddha. 
the buddha said to him, âbrahmin, by paying respect to the shrine you are doing a meritorious deed.â that made the brahmin happy. after thus putting him in a favourable frame of mind, the buddha, by his supernormal power, brought forth the golden pagoda of kassapa buddha and let it remain visible in the sky. the buddha then explained to the brahmin and the bhikkhus that the golden pagoda of kassapa buddha and let it remain visible in the sky. the buddha then explained to the brahmin and the bhikkhus that there were four classes of persons worthy of establishing a stupa. they are: the buddhas (tathagatas) who are homage-worthy and perfectly selfenlightened, the pacceka buddhas, the ariya disciples, and the universal monarchs. he also
told them about the three types of stupas erected in honor of these four classes of persons. the
pagoda (cetiya) where corporeal relics are enshrined are known as sariradhatu cetiya. the stupas and figures made in the likeness of the above four revered personages are known as uddissa
cetiya. the cetiya where personal effects like robes, bowls, etc. of those revered personages are
enshrined are known as paribhoga cetiya. the bodhi tree is also considered a paribhoga
cetiya. the buddha then stressed the importance of paying homage to those who are worthy of
veneration. 


	the buddha spoke in verse as follow:
	

195. he pays homage to those who are worthy of

 veneration, whether they are the
 buddhas or their disciples who have over
 come obstacles (to insight development)
 and have rid themselves of sorrow and
 lamentation.


196. the merit gained by such a person who pays

 homage to those who have been
 freed from moral defilements and have
 nothing to fear, cannot be measured by
 anyone, as this much or that much.





	at the end of the discourse the brahmin attained sotapatti fruition enlightenment. the stupa of
kassapa buddha remained visible for seven more days and people kept on coming to the stupa
to pay homage and obeisance. at the end of the seven days, as willed by the buddha, the stupa
disappeared, and in the place of the previous shrine erected to the spirits, there appeared miraculously, a big stone stupa. 


	(the dhammapada)


	"having established the same faith on both living buddhas and the buddhas in the past, one
gets the same benefits. beings go to the world of happiness through their established mind." 


	(vimanavatthu)

while on a trading journey, two merchant brothers, taphussa and bhallika, met the buddha
who gave them eight sacred strands of his hair. the brothers later enshrined the sacred hairs in
the shwedagon pagoda in burma â one of the most venerated buddhist cetiyas in the world.

the lokachantha universal peace pagoda

	the lokachantha peace pagoda of new jersey is modeled on the great shwedagon pagoda of
burma and highlights burmese architecture and culture. since it was organized in 1982, the
america burma buddhist association of new york (abba) had planned to establish a pagoda and meditation center in a suitable place somewhere in the tri-state area. on january
16, 1995, abba purchased approximately 5 acres of land at 63 gordons corner road in manalapan, nj 07726. on may 5, 2005, the pagoda and meditation center projects were finally
approved at the manalapan township zoning board meeting. it took 10 years of struggling with
financial difficulties, finding the right architect and engineer, and pursuing township permission to build. on june 16, 2005, k&r site work contractor was hired by abba to prepare the 
land of the site work. k&r began the site work on june 30, 2005 and it was completed 6
months later. the pagoda construction began on march 16, 2006 and was completed 10 years
later in 2016. it took a long time to complete the pagoda due to difficulty with finding the right
builder. the main structure of the pagoda was built by k&r site work contractor and the
outer layer was built by ko a khin or ko lay. the decorative art works on the pagoda were
made by volunteers and two resident monks.

meditation dormitory

				construction of the meditation center dormitory building started on november 3, 2010, when
the pagoda project was largely finished. the dormitory building is designed to provide a
friendly and tranquil environment in which to promote the teachings of lord buddha and the
practice of insight meditation (vipassana). the building was finished in 2016. it has 16 dormitory rooms (8 for men and 8 for women) on the second level and a dining room, kitchen, and
meditation hall on the first level. the grand opening ceremony of the pagoda and meditation
center was successfully and happily celebrated on may 28, 2017 by the community of buddhist
monks and its followers.

relaxation, self control, calmness, contentment, optimism, compassion, loving-kindness, happiness, insight, and inner peace.
