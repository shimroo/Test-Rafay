 equestrian themed whimsical wearables our comic t shirts play into the lighthearted side of our horses. we poke fun at the truthful, exasperating, and sometimes downright silly side of equine life, training, and riding! we aim to offer you a wide range of options, colors, disciplines, and laughs.of course, you’ll have your favorites. maybe you are a “coffee, horses, wine,” or a “weekend forecast: riding with a chance of drinking rider?” perhaps you “like long romantic walks to the barn” or “aren’t single you have a horse.” maybe your “indian name is falls off horses,” or you are “one ride away from a good mood.” whatever the case, one thing is for sure: once a horse lover, you are an “equestrian 4 life” and a regular member of the “manure movers of america” club!
