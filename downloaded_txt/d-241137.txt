dry creek  heritage vines zinfandel  2021 





beautiful crystalline ruby hue with aromas of sophisticated rich, red berry and plum, hints of wood, nutmeg, and more perky black raspberry fruit.palate--very nice first impression with a textured palate, balanced fruit and structure, and modest with what is there. this is 80% zinfandel with an obvious adornment of petite sirah. dry creek makes lovely wines which are beyond the ubiquitous $10 price point wines i feature. but i had a gift certificate for this wine so i grabbed it.  at $28 it is more than what i normally buy but it is a very well made zinfandel. i will be pairing it with mine and my wife's favorite bacon, and onion topped french tart with cottage cheese and sour cream baked on a pizza stone. if you can handle it, try dry creek! they just do wine, all their wines, really well!  raise a glass!

jp. chenet   rosé dry  





 very pale yellow/orange hue with aromas of gentle musk melon, baby powder, and relaxed subtle citrus notes.palate--pin prick bubbles in ample supply with an off dry sweetness mid-palate with gentle fruit, finishing quickly.this is a value wine for which i do not remember i paid for it, but knowing me, i didn't pay over $10.  i paired it with a spicy zatarain's black bean creation my wife made with left over baked chicken. it worked really well!  so if you find this for under $10 i would say "raise a glass" and be bold in your pairing options!

hook or crook    cabernet sauvignon (lodi)  2022





opaqueish garnet hue with aromas of berry and slight yeast note, jellied-cranberry sauce, and spice.palate--perky first impression, with minerally front, a bit watery mouth feel but much bigger fruit presence than expected. finish lingers a bit and pushes you to take another sip. found this on close out for $7 which is crazy and i will grab a few more if i have the chance so raise a glass.

añares  gran reserva  rioja  2015





 opaqueish magenta with slight bricking at the rim with aromas of milk chocolate covered cherries, licorice, caraway and fennel.    palate--integrated, full bodied with acidic foundation, spiced cherries, lip smacking tannins, and a fleeting finish but with some residual of everything on the palate.this tempranillo is at its peak and should be drunk immediately. it will drink well for another year but will be changing along the way. this is going to be a great pairing with my charcoal grilled valentine's day, ny bone in, strip steak for the love of my life who has celebrated 52 of these corny pseudo holidays with me.i paid only $17 for this as the store was dumping the usual $35 price tag probably because of the age of the wine. it is a nice wine especially for what i paid for it.  if you see one for the lower end price grab it and enjoy it as it is a nice treat.  raise a glass!

j. lohr  riverstone   (arroyo seco monterey) chardonnay  2022





lovely crystalline lemon juice hue with aromas of sweet lemonade with a powdery perfumy quality about it. lemon curd rounds out the fragrance!palate--a burst of acidity at eh first impression with lively structure that will cut the grease off your tongue if having a fatty, buttery sauce. mid palate is lemony with a touch of bitters which is quite nice. more fruit over every part of the mouth and tongue with a zippy tart green apple finish with mouth feel and a lingering lemony finish.this is extraordinary for the price i paid. it is really well made, different, structured, clean and honestly the best chardonnay i have had in a long while at this price point.  if you see this for under $20 (it tends to run around $15) grab it and see how delicious and interesting-- even inexpensive-- chardonnay can be.  raise a glass!

porta 6  2023





 deep purple with a cherry colored middle with aromas of pleasant boysenberry, blackberry, and pomegranate.palate--first impression is fairly balanced, with finessed structure for a wine at this price point, nad flavors of slightly tart berries galore with a lip smacking structure and a finish that is rather non-existent.the label of this wine is eye-catching and a paucity of verbiage on the label. this portuguese wine is made to be fun, simple and tasty to go with a variety of casual, comfort foods and cheeses. i am making a pasta dish with pastrami parmesan and it will be quite nice.  atrader joe's offering at $7 so how can you pass it up?  raise a glass.

alverdi  barbera  2022





purple hue with aromas of steely fruit with ash, grapey plum, and cherry berry.palate--lazy first impression with acidic line, watery texture, okay cherry berry flavor finishing quickly and awkwardly.i bought this for $8 at a favorite liquor store but this is clunky, confused, and marginal. not a repeat!

the stump jump  shiraz  2020





magenta with bricking at the edges.  aromas of plum, closed stuffy berry fruit with gentle savory spice at the rim.palate--watery texture, flavors are confused, some savory spice with oaged dark berry fruit.  this 5 year old shiraz from the storied region of mclaren vale, d'arenberg australia, is fading quickly.  it is over the hill which in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing but in this case it is a definite pass.

member's mark merlot  2022    (columbia valley) 





 dark purple hue with aromas of remarkable plum, blackberry, a suggestion of roe petal in the bowl, with slightly sweet spice at the edge.    palate-slightly tart, with a specious texture, loads of spice mid palate, with plummy, dark berry fruit finishing with some blackberry pie.this is a sam's club  "member's mark" merlot made for them by the great winery of ste. michelle of patterson, washington.  i lived between seattle and tacoma in the early 80's well before the silicon valley migration north. ste. michelle was/is an accomplished washington state winery with a history predating most of the wineries proliferating the superior ava's all over the columbia valley and beyond.at $8 for this merlot, it is drinkable, well made for what it is, and we all benefit from the mega-corp of sam walton and his marketing genius.  for the money, give it a try, it's an economical way to party if nbothing else. lol  raise a glass!

dancing crow vineyards  zinfandel  (north coast)  2023





 grapey purple hue with aromas of ash, somewhat unique fruit bouquet of perky red berry with an edge.  palate--confusing first impression with solid fruit foundation.  mid palate there is a pleasant "bitterness" but needs some air time.this is my first exposure to this winery and while i was having a not so great day, my wife of 51 years came home with this for me. :) i think my wife probably paid around $20 for it.  it is a different style which is always a nice treat but not sure it should be in the $20 price range.  pairing it with my homemade venison chile and it will rock.
