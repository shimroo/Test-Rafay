featured



tone ranger guitars grew from luthier jeff mark leavitt's love of the west: the culture, the environment, the music, and the history of the western american deserts and forests. he set out to create an instrument that is a part of the west itself, allowing himself and players of his guitars to be stewards of the land. lovingly hand-crafted in his one-man shop in la with the finest components and pickups, tone ranger guitars are made entirely from sustainable, local, urban trees from los angeles and her surrounding counties with a unique sonic brilliance all their own. these trees lined our city streets, shaded our parks, and grew in our backyards, but are felled due to storms, disease, or normal senescence. in the past, these trees would’ve been chipped on site and sent to landfills, but they are now rescued by arborists who choose to repurpose these beautiful trees and give them a second life. these trees aren’t factory-farmed, nor do they contribute to deforestation. this guilt-free wood grew in local neighborhoods and communities, and is a beloved part of their history. you’re a part of that history now as this wood continues its life as your creative partner wherever the trail may take you.

the benefit of buying from lightning joe’s
















one of the primary benefits of buying an instrument from lightning joe's is the free lifetime setup service that we offer. after you purchase a new guitar, bass or folk instrument from us, we will continue to provide setups for as long as you own it, even if that's a lifetime. this service includes, but is not limited to, neck adjustments, saddle shaping, nut shaping, intonation and bridge adjustments. when a customer requests any of these services for their personal instruments, the cost can range anywhere from $20-$50 for individual services and $50-$100 for setups. but if you purchased your instrument from us, it's free every time you need an adjustment! *this free lifetime service is non-transferable and only applies to instruments purchased when brand new. certain exclusions apply. please inquire for more details.



























…and we carry many more! come on in and check out our wide selection of brands and products. and if you don’t see something you want or need, ask us! we likely can order it for you. we have a wish list submission, too, for anything you may be wishing for.
