the quest for overunity

dear new explorers and experimenters,

you are welcome in the jln labs web site dedicated to the
search of free-energy solutions and new generation of
space-propulsion systems. 
good exploration,

jean-louis naudin ( france )






 "....if we could produce
electric effects of the required quality, this whole planet and
the conditions of existence on it could be transformed. the sun
raises the water of the oceans and winds drive it to distant
regions where it remains in state of most delicate balance. if it
were in our power to upset it when and wherever desired, this
mighty life-sustaining stream could be at will controlled. we
could irrigate arid deserts, create lakes and rivers and provide
motive power in unlimited amount. this would be the most
efficient way of harnesing the sun to the uses of man......"
( nikola tesla, june 1919 )

perfection et à l'amour est au fond de nous...
regarde avec ton esprit, prends conscience de ce qui est en toi
depuis toujours, fais usage de ta science, enseigne la,
fais la partager et tu trouveras la voie de l'envol...."
