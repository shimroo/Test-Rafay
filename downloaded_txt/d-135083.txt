how does this unilateral  act promote public trust and reduce corruption at the highest levels of government operations in the declared partisan effort to “make america great again” when,  as a prime example, the office of government ethics (oge) becomes in due course of time, “modified” and transmogrified by unilateral executive fiat; that is to say, by autocratic breakthrough initiatives ( let us consider “project 25” as a specific example), at the behest of the ego of selected government officials (ego), by summarily placing duly appointed bipartisan key government officials, commissioners and frontline staffers on the firing line; a case of ‘dismissal-with leverage,’  without the benefit of due counsel, and without the  advise and consent of the united states senate?
