happy customers

















i bought a used boat from jason at sundance in blaine. after owning it for about a week i was stranded out on lake whatcom. a part had failed that could not have been known about without disassembling the engine and out drive. jason and paul both stepped up and helped me get it fixed. very good experience.

absolutely the best buying experience i've ever had. chris mueller and the stall at sundance went above and beyond expectations. they took the time to make my wife and i very happy they fixed every problem and answered every question we had and made everything right. i would recommend them to anyone looking for a boat. they will be my first stop if i'm ever in need of another . thanks again chris and the sundance staff for making it an enjoyable purchase

just took delivery of my jeanneau 795 complete with a thorough and informative sea trial conducted by aaron from service and chris from sales. i absolutely would recommend sundance for your next boat.
- bob s. view on google









chris was great to deal with, answered all our questions, and delivered everything he promised. he spent hours with us on the boat so we could understand the boat's features and we had an informative sea trial. he is knowledgeable and friendly - no high pressure sales pitch. he has been very responsive with all our followup questions after we received the boat. and he arranged for speedy delivery of the boat to our hometown. overall, an excellent buying experience.

what a great experience! we purchased a 2019 jeanneau nc895 through sundance yachts. while we’ve had a number of smaller boats, this was our first fully contained cruiser and the first time we would have a boat on the columbia river. our salesman, ken, was awesome! first, he found the best boat for us; one that we could trailer to other locations and spend a weekend or longer camping in the puget sound. he spent hours with us, after the sale, helping us become familiar with the boat. he walked through all the systems several times to ensure we knew how to operate them. he gave us on the water instruction for docking and anchoring. he even went shopping with us to help us outfit the boat! the most important of all, however, is that ken always answers his phone. every time i’ve had a question and reached out, he’s either answered right away or called me back within a few minutes. if he doesn’t know the answer to my question, he immediately contacts one of the other great staff at sundance and gets right back. thank you, ken and the rest of the sundance staff, for a great boat-buying experience!
