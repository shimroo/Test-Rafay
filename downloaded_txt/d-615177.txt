a lakefront inn nestled in the heart of north hero village on the vermont shores of lake champlain




































































































































































































































colchester causeway now under state ownership“on day one this became one of or maybe the most highly visited state park in our entire system,” one state official said.

the north hero house just became greener - in addition to the living pier bar roof, we are now powered by 50,000 kwh of solar power!















we love it here, and so do our guests















“super friendly inn on a very unique island. comfortable rooms, good food, and a cozy bar. the staff are all local, and very kind. right on the water.” 
karsten marshall-otto











“we spent 2 nights at the inn (sept. 23-24), and we thoroughly enjoyed it! our room was on the 2nd floor overlooking the pier bar and the lake, with a huge screened porch. what a great view of the green mountains! dinner was very good, and the family style breakfast was excellent! we also enjoyed the food (nachos) and cocktails at the pier bar, where sean served up friendly conversation and recommendations about the area. what a great bartender! we will definitely be back!” 
jack qualey











“the north hero inn left a lasting impression with me and my wife. everything from the location, to the room, to the restaurant and staff exceeded our expectations. we had never been to vermont before and although, we were there for business, it made the trip so memorable. we intend on taking a trip back solely because of our stay here.” 
matthew jablonsky











“this was the most gorgeous location you can imagine! we had a private screened porch overlooking lake champlain. the decor was gorgeous, in an understated, tasteful way. staff is outstanding. the breakfast was delicious and even better than we expected. we also had dinner there and it too was exquisite. we can't wait to go back and stay longer!”
