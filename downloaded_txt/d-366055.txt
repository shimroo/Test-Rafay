forsyth county infant
help our babies
mortality reduction coalition








purpose, mission, and vision
infant deaths are a community-wide problem influenced by a variety of social, economical, and medical issues. the forsyth county infant mortality reduction coalition works to bring resources together, provide direction to citizen action and education efforts, and move our community towards the changes that will allow us to save babies’ lives. our vision is that all babies born in forsyth county will be healthy and thrive.
our mission is to reduce infant mortality by educating the community about how to prevent infant death and advocating for systems and policy changes that support healthy birth outcomes.
core values





01



prevention is the key. 
working to help women be healthy before they become pregnant is the best way to save babies’ lives and improve the health of our community.






02



system and policy changes are needed.
individuals actions in their own lives can prevent many infant deaths. however, the big-picture of policies and systems influence and sometimes limit the choices individuals have.






03



no one group can solve this problem alone.
the coalition brings together the many groups, organizations, and individuals who are trying to prevent infant deaths in our community.






04



racism is only one underlying factor.
social and economic injustice that result from racism impacts the options people have available. the economic situation of many families in our community is influenced by this broad social problem. related stress impacts pregnant women.
