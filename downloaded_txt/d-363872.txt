duckfat in two different experiences



duckfat has been serving cones of hot, golden, crispy duck fat-fried belgian frites (fries) downtown portland, maine since 2005. the original duckfat on middle street is a cozy space with casual indoor and outdoor dining. the newer duckfat frites shack on washington ave is a take out window with outdoor and indoor seating shared with oxbow blending & bottling. the frites shack is an excellent place to come with larger groups of people. duckfat frites can be enjoyed at both locations. both locations have varying menus, and are first come, first served. they are a 15 minute walk from each other.
