a message from revd martyn taylorst george’s church, stamford is a thriving evangelical church nestled in the heart of the town of stamford. we have a mission to proclaim the gospel to everyone locally, but also have a role to play in the revitalisation of the church across lincolnshire. we are a church where jesus is at the centre, the bible is our guide, and people matter. learn more about our vision and values here. we hope this website gives you a flavour of the events, people, beliefs, and foundations of our church. please take a look around, enjoy, and do not hesitate to get in touch and come and see us for yourself. our services on sunday take place both in church and online at 9:15am, 11.00am & 6.30pm.
