	 elvis had interest in mormon religion/ inspires spiritual biopic "tears of a king"
	 
    


there's a whole lotta shakin' goin' on in utah.rob diamond, a salt lake-based actor/writer/director, is currently filming the movie "tears of a king" that centers around elvis presley the night before his death in 1977, looking back over his life and the choices he had made.the inspiration came after diamon discovered presley read a lot on spiritual topics and was given the copy of the book of mormon by a fan named cricket who had joined the lds church. after the musician's death, the book was returned to the woman who later gave it to musician/celebrity alan osmond who passed it on to an lds official who placed it in the church archives. "whether you're mormon or not, you're going to want to see it. it's a man's spiritual quest and the mistakes he made," diamond said."tears of a king" is scheduled to be released sometime in 2007, the 30th anniversary of presley's death. diamond plans to show the film at several film festivals prior to its theatrical release.more information and multimedia about the film will be at www.tearsofaking.com within the next few weeks.source

	 sold: presley's california estate
	 
    


priscilla presley has sold one of her california estates, reportedly for some $2.5 million.  the los angeles times said presley, the actress and ex-wife of late rock legend elvis presley, described the canterbury, calif., home as “a country english farmhouse on a grand scale.”  the paper said the spread includes a seven-bedroom house, three-tiered theater and other amenities on five lakeside acres. but the times said presley owns several homes and rarely used the place.  presley, 61, still oversees many of her late ex-husband’s businesses. she also starred in 1991’s “the naked gun” and two of its sequels.source: boston herald

	 lisa's big mac
	 
    


by samantha critchell, ap fashion writer wed sep 6, 1:27 pm et new york -        lisa marie presley, debbie harry, eve and dita von teese are the newest crop of unlikely makeup models in mac cosmetics' viva glam ad campaign.  it's not just the spokesmodels who are unusual, it's also the product they promote: 100 percent of the sales of viva glam lipsticks and lip glosses are donated tohiv and aids programs, including treatment, education and daily necessities.presley said she agreed to participate in the campaign because of its fundraising efforts."mac is actually, honestly, really true blue about its charity," the 38-year-old singer — and daughter of        elvis presley — told the associated press in a recent phone interview."you can see it making headway. they've raised $70 million that's been used incredibly well. it's not a campaign full of fluff, and i'm not a fluff person."presley said she's known harry for several years and has crossed paths with von teese, but hadn't met eve until the photo shoot a few weeks ago.even though she doesn't consider herself to be either a beauty expert or a model, she tried to put her best face on for the campaign, presley said, because of the cause and the interesting and admirable group of women she was working with."i think we're all reaching out in a different direction — whoever can reach a certain segment of the audience," she said.so, who's her audience?"that's a complex question. based on my fan base, it's 80 percent gay, young girls, bikers, women my age and then some occasional elvis fans. it's an eclectic potpourri," she said with a laugh. "if i go to a signing or show, it's a rainbow."previous spokesmodels for the ad campaign, which debuted 12 years ago, include: christina aguilera, missy elliott, pamela anderson and boy george.john demsey, global president of mac and chairman of the mac aids fund, said this year's models were chosen for their personal commitment to the fight against aids."we want to rattle some cages. we want to grab people's attention and not let them turn away. and most importantly, we want to reach even more people. our viva glam vi spokespeople cut through the clutter. they are all incredibly talented and have strong and distinct points of view and unique perspectives on this crisis," he said in a statement.source: yahoo news

	 elvis: $3 million bounty
	 
    


a reward of $3 million has been offered to anyone who finds elvis presley alive.the bounty has been stumped up by a us filmmaker who is currently putting together a documentary to coincide with next year's 30th anniversary of the king's death.adam muskiewicz says he will pay-out the enormous reward if anyone gets concrete evidence to back up the conspiracy theories that suggest elvis is still alive.muskiewicz has set-up a website to support the investigation, which has seen him interview around 200 people who knew the original rock'n'roll star.he claims that around 25 per cent of the people interviewed so far believe elvis is still alive, a theory backed-up by confusion surrounding his apparent death and subsequent funeral. "you don't have to be an expert to see there were procedural questions - why was the funeral so fast? things were sealed and people went quiet," muskiewicz told reuters.for more information, go to elivswanted.com. source: yahoo news uk

	 gellar sues over ebay breach
	 
    


memphis, tenn. - celebrity psychic uri geller and two partners claim in a federal lawsuit that the former owners of elvis presley's first house breached an ebay contract to sell the home. geller, who gained notoriety in the 1970s for seeming to bend spoons through telekinesis, and his partners are seeking to rescind the sale of the property to nashville record producer mike curb.their $905,100 offer was the high bid in the may 14 internet auction. but after the auction, they made changes to the real estate contract that gave owners cindy hazen and mike freeman 60 days to move from the property."if we had signed the contract, they could have taken possession immediately. we couldn't do that," freeman said.hazen and freeman then decided to sell the house to curb for $1 million, a move geller and his partners claim broke their contract.for hazen and freeman, now divorced, the sale of the audubon property resulted in the reopening of a bankruptcy case in which they had been excused of $43,000 in debt. with profits from the sale of the home, hazen said, more than $43,000 was placed in escrow to cover the debts owed to their creditors.in a court hearing thursday, hazen and freeman agreed to repay the money. "we wanted to fulfill that obligation," she said.a former lieutenant governor of california, curb is chairman of curb records and head of the mike curb family foundation, which describes itself as a "philanthropic organization dedicated to preserving music history and promoting music business education."a curb spokeswoman said in june that the foundation was negotiating with a memphis college to operate a music education center at the former presley home. she declined to name the college.presley bought the four-bedroom, ranch-style memphis house in 1956 with his early song royalties. the singer, his parents and grandmother lived there for 13 months before moving to a two-story colonial house already known as graceland.

	 schiling shares elvis memories in new book
	 
    


beth rucker, appublished: monday, august 21, 2006  when he was 12, jerry schilling couldn't believe the voice he heard on the radio singing "that's all right" belonged to a teenager from his own north memphis neighborhood. a few days after hearing the song, he was playing a pickup football game, and the quarterback on his team was the same kid from the neighborhood, 19-year-old elvis presley. "we went into a huddle, and i said, 'wow, that's the guy with a song on the radio!'" schilling told the associated press. schilling has written a new memoir about his 23-year friendship with presley, but he didn't use the book to convince anyone that his childhood friend was a great performer or a rock 'n' roll legend. instead, "me and a guy named elvis," written with chuck crisafulli, shows presley's more human side, the intelligent and passionate man who struggled with drug abuse and was frustrated with his mediocre hollywood movies. after presley's death in 1977, schilling, who still lives in the hollywood hills, calif., home that elvis bought for him, worked for elvis presley enterprises and produced documentaries and tv specials about the performer. but schilling had always said he wasn't interested in writing an elvis book, as other members of the inner circle had done. he changed his mind only when schilling's wife, cindy, urged him to tell the story. schilling worked with crisafulli, an entertainment journalist who has written several books. publisher gotham, an imprint of the penguin group, said that the pair wrote the book side by side over the course of three years, and it was a very successful collaboration. there are about 30,000 copies in print of the book, which already has been sent back for a second printing since its aug. 17 release. "it's a fun, complicated book about a simple friendship in a complicated world," schilling said in a recent interview while in town to promote his new book. "(his death) was the biggest loss of my life, ever. i still miss him." peter guralnick, author of the two-volume biography of presley, "last train to memphis" and "careless love," said schilling's memoir is a balanced treatment of presley and offers insights into the characters that surrounded the musician. the book is "a personal memoir that, while it places its narrator squarely in the midst of historic events, never claims credit for those events in the way that so many self-serving memoirs are inclined to do," guralnick wrote in the book's foreword. the memoir also received the blessing of presley's wife priscilla and his daughter lisa marie. davis-kidd bookseller in memphis sold more than 80 copies of the book during a preview weekend — a good showing for a topic that has tired most folks in memphis, said katherine whitfield, marketing manager for the store. "me and a guy named elvis" stands out from other presley-themed books because it's clear he's not just trying to make a buck off his famous friend, whitfield said. "i think a lot of care was put into it," she said. "he talks about elvis sort of like an older brother. i've seen a lot of people tell a lot of stories; it's hard to fake that sincerity." publisher's weekly agreed, saying the memoir's "heartfelt narrative makes this more than just another piece of elvis product." schilling started working for presley in 1964, doing whatever was needed as elvis moved from concerts to movie sets to the studio. those who worked for presley — the so-called memphis mafia — became his friends and confidants. presley even allowed schilling and the others to live in his memphis home at graceland. schilling recalled a time while he lived at graceland when presley asked him to go for a drive with him. after a quiet ride, they pulled into the cemetery where the entertainer's mother, gladys, was buried. "seeing him before that monument, it came to me that, perhaps for the very first time, i could see my friend as a small, fragile human — just like any other," he writes. even when presley started seeing priscilla, the memphis mafia was always around. presley's manager, "colonel" tom parker, shut his buddies out of their 1967 wedding in las vegas, but presley managed to invite them along on the honeymoon. "when he carried priscilla across the threshold of their new palm springs home — the so-called honeymoon house — the first thing priscilla saw on the other side was us," schilling writes. presley wanted his buddies around, but he wanted them to keep their distance from priscilla, schilling said, even though they were all living under the same roof. schilling once saw priscilla in the kitchen of graceland looking flushed and asked her if she was feeling ok — not realizing she and elvis had been arguing. priscilla later told elvis that schilling cared about her feelings, and it drove elvis crazy. schilling said presley stormed into a room where his friends were watching tv and announced, "i don't need anybody else taking care of priscilla and checking how she is." schilling said he didn't talk to priscilla again for almost a full year. even though the couple argued and eventually divorced, they remained close through the rest of singer's life. but the person who made him the happiest was his daughter, lisa marie. "elvis and lisa were just magic together," schilling said, adding that presley wanted more time with his family just before his death. drugs have long been the suspected cause of presley's death, and schilling said he took pills to escape the disappointment he felt about the direction of his career. elvis wanted to produce his own film about karate, but parker refused to allow it. elvis tried to make the movie himself with schilling's help, but it was shelved as elvis spent more time in the hospital to combat fatigue and drug usage. he was also excited about the chance to appear alongside barbra streisand in the movie, "a star is born." he thought the role — which eventually went to kris kristofferson — would prove he could do more than be the good-looking nice guy he played in most of his movies. parker ended presley's participation in "a star is born" with demands of twice the salary that elvis was being offered and that he be billed before streisand, who not only starred in the film, but also co-produced it. "it was the creative disappointment that killed elvis," schilling said. "the drugs were just a band-aid." © ap 2006source:  associated press

in the sea of elvis memorabilia on the market, one company has set itself apart with two documentary-style dvds that capture little-seen footage of the king, in a new, high-quality format.bud glass, an avid collector of elvis memorabilia, was frustrated at the lack of the quality of the elvis footage that was circulating collectors circles. there was plenty of super 8 mm footage being passed around, but as copies were made, the quality deteriorated.glass dreamed of creating a high-quality, affordable dvd of all of the accumulated footage. out of this desire, along with praytome publishing, he created 'elvis: behind the image' volumes 1 and 2.the dvds feature original footage replicated directly from the film reels with cutting-edge laser technology into dvd format. content-wise, they combine historic coverage with never-before-heard insights on the life of the king, from first-hand experiences of those who surrounded him.to find out more about these dvds, visit heresource:  insider.tv.yahoo.com

mabel before:mabel after:direct from yahoo news:london (afp) - elvis presley's cherished teddy bear mabel was reportedly all shook up after being mauled by an apparently jealous guard dog hired to protect her at a british museum.  the rare toy, made in 1909 by german manufacturer steiff and valued at 40,000 pounds (75,000 dollars, 59,000 euros), was to have formed the centrepiece of a valuable collection on display at wookey hole caves, in somerset, southwest england.but for some reason barney, the dobermann pinscher charged with protecting the precious cuddly toy and the other fluffy exhibits, took against them, going on the rampage in a frenzied after-hours attack.mabel was disembowled of her soft stuffing and had her head severed. the damage is believed to be irreperable."barney has been a model guard dog for more than six years. i still can't believe what happened," security guard greg west was quoted as saying after the attack on tuesday night."either there was a rogue scent of some kind on mabel, which switched on barney's deepest instincts, or it could have been jealousy. i was just stroking mabel and saying what a nice bear she was."mabel was bought by local aristocrat sir benjamin slade at an auction in memphis, tennessee, and was on a work surface while a glass case was being built for her.wookey hall general manager daniel medley was quoted as saying he had spoken to sir benjamin."he is not very pleased at all," he added.

	 the andrea doria has a connection to elvis
	 
    


sunken oceanliner still claiming lives staff and agencies24 july, 2006by richard pyle, associated press writer new york - on a foggy july night in 1956, the italian luxury liner andrea doria was speeding toward new york on the last leg of a trans-atlantic crossing when it collided with a passenger ship and sank, killing 51 people. at least 14 people have died while exploring the wreck. the latest fatality came july 8, when researcher david bright suffered decompression sickness after making his 120th trip to the andrea doria ahead of an anniversary dive there. "it‘s called the mount everest of diving. it‘s such a dangerous depth, but it attracts a lot of interest," said capt. robert meurn, professor emeritus at the u.s. merchant marine academy on long island and, like his friend bright, an expert on maritime history and the andrea doria in particular. it was at the u.s. coast guard u.s. coast guard station across long island that first word of the disaster was received in a crackling radio message at 11:22 p.m.: the message was from the sleek, white stockholm, a swedish passenger ship that had left new york a few hours earlier. in the swirling fog, the stockholm‘s bow, reinforced for northern icefields, had ripped into the starboard side of the 29,000-ton andrea doria, the erstwhile flagship of the italian line. fortunately, at least 15 ships were close enough to respond. in all, about 1,660 people on the andrea doria were saved. on the andrea doria, 46 people died. five were lost on the stockholm. other survivors included film star ruth roman and songwriter mike stoller, who on landing in new york was told by his partner, jerry lieber, that their song "hound dog" had just been recorded by "some white kid named elvis presley." stoller, who had been away four months, asked, "elvis who?" each ship blamed the other, but the case was settled out of court, leaving the issue of responsibility unresolved. the stockholm suddenly looming out of the fog spurred the doria‘s captain, piero calamai, to order "hard a-port!" — a sharp left turn — but also too late to avoid the collision. the fact that calamai did not immediately sound an abandon ship alarm became one of several controversies after the sinking. the collision led to changes that make a similar event today unlikely — the defining of shipping lanes, improved radar and bridge-to-bridge vhf communication between ships. andrea doria and stockholm could communicate only through their radio rooms. while improvements in technology have made the once-unreachable doria popular with divers, simpson — only 9 at the time of the wreck — quotes bright as calling it "a very hazardous adventure ... one of the most difficult dives in the world." © 2006 the associated press. all rights reserved.

	 houndog:  a disturbing movie is in the works
	 
    


from all headline news http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7004316240  :dakota fanning filmed in scenes with violent sexual contentjuly 24, 2006 6:00 p.m. estmary k. brunskill - all headline news staff writernew york, ny (ahn) - twelve-year-old actress dakota fanning is currently involved in a movie in which her character is subjected to a violent sex act. the screenplay for the film, which is called "houndog," contains one scene in which fanning's character is raped and several other scenes in which the character appears naked or wearing only "underpants." the movie is was being filmed in north carolina, and fanning's rape scene had already been completed when production was shut down due to lack of funds. potential investors were turned off by the shocking material and didn't want to be involved with the independent movie, which had a budget of under $5 million. a source close to the situation told the new york daily news, "the two taboos in hollywood are child abuse and the killing of animals. in this movie, both things happen." after production was halted, producer jen gatien located emergency investors and was able to resume filming. the shooting was scheduled to be completed at the end of last weekend. "houndog" is set in the rural south and deals with abuse, violence and elvis presley infatuation. robin wright penn is the executive producer and stars in the film along with david morse and piper laurie. new york entertainment entrepreneur lawrence robins said, "the subject matter is very tough, but i was attracted to it because in the end it's a story about human understanding, about a little girl who's dealt a very bad deck of cards, but finds solace in the music of elvis and survives."

	 sonny west inks book deal with triumph/random house
	 
    


sonny west, elvis presley’s longtime bodyguard and charter member of the memphis mafia, has signed a publishing deal with triumph/random house for his upcoming book, “elvis: still taking care of business.”the deal was inked on june 1, 2006, and is set for a 2007 release to coincide with the 30th anniversary of presley’s death.west, who was presley’s bodyguard from 1960 to 1976, said he’s extremely happy his long-awaited book has the backing of one of the world’s largest and best-known publishers.“i’m extremely appreciative that triumph/random house sees the value of this work and i look forward to working with them,” west said. “i hope the fans will respond in kind, because my book is a tribute to elvis.”west’s co-author, marshall terrill, said triumph/random house’s involvement will give “elvis: still taking care of business” a much bigger promotional push than most other presley books.“the publisher has very high hopes and they’re going to make every possible effort to promote our book,” terrill said. “even though i’m biased, i feel it’s the best and most objective look at elvis presley in many years. i believe most elvis fans will come away with a deeper understanding of the man and his life because of sonny’s insights.”the collaboration, which started in 2002, is follow-up to the 1977 book, “elvis: what happened?” in which sonny west co-authored with red west and dave hebler.the book will cover west's 16 years with elvis presley from 1960 to 1976, the aftermath of “elvis: what happened?” to his thoughts today on elvis, priscilla and lisa marie presley.the book will include photos from west’s personal collection as well as photos donated from the russ howe collection. the book also includes two appendices – “all the king’s men” and “myths, facts and frequently asked questions”. the former is a section on former memphis mafia members while the latter is a list of questions west answers directly from presley followers.in addition to combing through hundreds of documents, the two had several presley experts read the manuscript to ensure its accuracy.“it was my privilege and pleasure to help edit the book because i was able to relive a lot of the memories,” said author and longtime presley fan sandi pichon. “i also learned quite a bit about elvis through many untold stories. sonny’s book will make a welcome addition to any elvis presley library.”chicago-based triumph books was acquired by random house in may and will now exist as an independently-run imprint of the random house publishing group.source: marshall terrill**thanks cory!

that depeche mode's personal jesus was inspired by priscilla presley's book elvis & me?   it was.according to wilkenpedia:"the song itself was inspired by the book "elvis and me" by priscilla presley. according to songwriter martin gore, "it's a song about being a jesus for somebody else, someone to give you hope and care. it's about how elvis was her man and her mentor and how often that happens in love relationships; how everybody's heart is like a god in some way, and that's not a very balanced view of someone, is it?".
