inspiring all girls to be strong, smart  & bold.











our story



the mission of girls inc. of metro denver is to inspire all girls to be strong, smart and bold.
in partnership with schools, community organizations and at our center in west colfax, we focus on the development of the whole girl. she learns to value herself, take risks, and discover and develop her inherent strengths. the combination of long-lasting mentoring relationships, a pro-girl environment, and research-based programming equips girls to navigate gender, economic, and social barriers, and grow up healthy, educated, and independent. informed by girls and their families, we also advocate for legislation and policies to increase opportunities and rights for all girls.
