trust us, he's harmless

some call it reckless.  we just call it life.








come join the insanity.  more fun than a bag of cats.

the laser project





winter power update



the laser project




i haven’t been spending as much time on the laser project as i once did.  life, it turns out, often has other priorities. still, i’ve furthered my understanding a bit.

spring power problem update



the laser project




it’s spring 2024 and the laser work marches slowly on.

the laser project




a quick update and demonstration of how critical keeping the ktp a constant temperature is.

revisiting poor performance



the laser project




so i built a laser last year. it worked but didn’t perform great. let’s find out why.

rendering math with mathjax



geek




i’m going to start digging more in to the physics part of my laser project and for this i will want to be able to render some math.

cole took beginning film last quarter and had to create a short film. it’s with great pleasure that we give you “peeled”.

the laser project





let's cover it up



the laser project




it’s time to build a chassis and case for the laser.

the z-fold edition



the laser project




now that i have proof i can make the laser work, it’s time to tackle getting the z-fold cavity to lase.

the laser project




getting my homemade laser to lase.

intro to laser physics



the laser project




so far i’ve had a lot of posts describing the electronics if this project, but the real meat of the thing is the physics and optics. it’s time to start digging in.

control / display board



the laser project




i’ve finished the control board for the laser project. this is a small avr-based microcontroller board with a simple oled screen and a rotary encoder for making selections.

the laser project





final? power board



the laser project




i needed to revise the power board i’m using for driving the pump laser diodes. the current power board is still a little noisy — it doesn’t work at all if you don’t have an emi filter on the data bus, and it will stop working if you turn the current up too high. also, since i designed it i changed how the bus interface connector is going to work. time for another revision!

finished tec board



the laser project




the final tec board is done and appears to work great.

tec controller prototype 2 is alive



the laser project




my second prototype tec controller was a bit of a failure but the same circuit on a real board fares much better.

the laser project





tec controller prototype 2



the laser project




i redesigned my tec controller to use the ltc1923 chip so i can use higher powers on the outputs.

the next board to design is a tec controller board to control temperatures of the laser.

power supply redux



the laser project




a lot has happened since i “finished” the power supply i plan to use for the laser project. it turns out i wasn’t as done as i thought.

the laser project




i’m going to start a series of posts chronicling my attempt to build a laser…mostly from scratch.

laser power meter

in the next series of “stuff i have to build so i can build a laser” is a meter for measuring the output power of lasers.

there's a problem that's been nagging me since apple got rid of aperture and iphoto and merged them into the mess that is photos.
