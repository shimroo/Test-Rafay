a
few words about the rockland pc users group and project pc renew

 

about rpcug

since
1985 the rockland pc users
group, a 501(c)3 non profit, has been offering programs that educate
its
members and the public about computers and digital technology. we are
an
educational and charitable resource for thousands of people and non
profits in
the hudson valley region. 

we offer workshops for the novice,
intermediate and
advanced user on many subjects from operating systems, browsers,
commonly used
software, digital photography, graphics, email and more. our members can repair their
computer’s under the
guidance of our expert volunteer technicians at our workshop in new
city on
monday and wednesday evenings.
attend
our monthly general meeting where your questions
are answered and a presentation or webinar is given by some of the best
experts
around the country on many timely subjects.

 

about
project pc renew


through our 100% volunteer run
project pc renew, we
have refurbished and given away almost 4,500 computers in the last 11
years to
families and students in need that were referred to us by other
non-profits.
this has allowed people to train for jobs, gain employment to better
their own
lives and go from low to liveable income. people with disabilities and
veterans
have also benefited from our free donations. we work with many of
rockland
county’s non-profits to identify those in true need on a confidential
basis and
are constantly looking for new areas to promote this program and
increase our
community involvement.
our rpcug general meeting is
held the
2nd
tuesday of each month at 7:15 pm, rasso
meeting room 4th floor, palisades
center mall, west
nyack, ny
