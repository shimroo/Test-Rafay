featured artist















the 2wild collaboration is fueled by  the passion of  siblings barak and miri rozenvain to reinvent timeless narratives through innovative and unique combinations of contemporary media.integral to the artists’ identities is their shared adoration for nature, wildlife, sport, and pop culture.  the artists are equally inspired by natural and cultural landscapes as they combine the impressive north american wilderness with narratives from television, film, and advertisement. 2wild blends traditional and contemporary art elements into seamless reflections of joy and happiness. rich wall assemblages, media collage, and cheerful symbols of butterflies fill the work with emotion, tell tales of wonder and excitement, and further 2wild’s mission to preserve nature’s legacy.
