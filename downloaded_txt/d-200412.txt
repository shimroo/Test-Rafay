            "these 
            interior french doors are incredible. i am a fussy california contractor and i 
            debated with myself many hours before ordering 4 doors and have them 
            delivered clear across the country from complete strangers. my hunch 
            paid off. the quality is incredible and the price is really really 
            right.  top quality, top service and very good prices. this is 
            an unsolicited thank you from the heart. "
