testimonials nothing influences people more than a recommendation from a trusted source.





"i just wanted to take a moment to write a few words from me, the physicians and the staff at greater hartford orthopedic group, p.c. to thank you both for your wonderful work on our website.

as you know, from the beginning, we were not technically inclined; in fact, âit-challengedâ would be more accurate. we are medical professionals, not "techiesâ. your expertise in the area of website development was ever present and always supportive. you worked closely with my assistant, britt, to create a website that is attractive, sophisticated, informative, and easy to navigate through.

we have had an infinite amount of compliments on every aspect of our new website. we could not be happier with your work and your professionalism. please feel free to use us as a reference in the future.

abgraphic is a pleasure to work with. their work ethic, design insight, and creativity have been an asset to myself and my company for more than 5 years. abgraphic consistently strives to learn more and adds to their many abilities which i find hard to find when searching for employees and other companies in today's marketplace. i would highly recommend abgraphic for any task that they are interested in pursuing and feel comfortable that they would succeed, as they have already proven to me. 




tom fullen
owner, printworks











let this stand as a letter of reference and recommendation to those who choose to do business with abgraphic.net. 

abgraphic.net produced our latest web site to our great satisfaction. we are not web savvy, the abgraphic.net team was helpful in fulfilling our requests time after time.

also, our board was very impressed with the design and the final âlookâ of the website. they were highly complimentary when we unveiled it to them.

i would highly recommend abgraphic for your businesses' web page design.
