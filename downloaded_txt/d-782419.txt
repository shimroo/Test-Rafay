customer testimonials















“the advancements in icfs has helped builders conduct our projects with ease and almost all of our commercial and residential projects in the past four years have been icf! as an expert in icf construction, my architectural firm has seen high demand of our services and the nudura network is always available to assist us and the general contractors. i am a big proponent of icf!.”
- leigh overland - leigh overland architect




"the nudura product is light and the forms can be installed by one person. they are light and safer for the trades to work with than installing traditional methods in the industry. the secondary containment properties of the icf forms on either side of the concrete repels the saltwater in the oil field application."
- david urbanovsky - advanced construction (academy at nola dunn project)




"in the conceptual phase, i was looking for a better option than wood stick construction. i wanted durability, longevity, thermal insulation, sound insulation, insect resistance, and the ability to withstand storm damage. icf construction provided the robust performance i was looking for. when compared to all of the other available construction methods. the value proposition of the icf wins hands down – i can’t say enough positive things about it.“
- pat mcdowell – owner




“we are proud of the image of this structure and how it has performed to our expectations."
- cliff holden - burleson school district (academy at nola dunn project)
