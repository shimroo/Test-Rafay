nurturing creativity









 






 

would you like to add more enjoyment to your day… feel better… calm your mind… or smile a bit more? if you're looking for any of the above, try a creative break.




“practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven’s sake. sing in the shower. dance to the radio. tell stories. write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. do it as well as you possibly can. you will get an enormous reward. you will have created something.”

—    kurt vonnegut



the projects below can help you begin… more ideas in the menu at the top. 

 



art journal inspiration

when choosing a creative project, art journaling is full of possibilities…. take a look!





mixed media collage

a variety of mixed media collage, including square collages created for a challenge.





gelli plate prints

gelli prints: monoprinting without a press, using paint, ink, stencils, drawing, and natural materials.





nature print gallery

a gallery of nature prints using leaves & flowers on fabric, paper & wood.





atcs

what are artist trading cards? atcs are small artworks (2.5” x 3.5”) designed for trading with friends.





365 project 2018

a 365 project: creating one small piece of art to represent every day of the year.





100 stitch meditations

stitch meditations utilize simple sewing. it's a calming, meditative practice. i began with one stitch meditation and kept going until i had created 100!



— simple steps to jump start a creative break —grab a piece of paper or index cards, a blank journal or a notebook. choose a few pens, markers or a pencil and start drawing, making marks or doodling, just for fun. a creative prompt can help you start. you’ll find many prompts on one of my favorite websites, daisy yellow art. you could make a collage with a variety of papers, images or magazine clippings, old maps, brochures, tickets or a handwritten note you saved. take those papers and place one or two of them on a larger piece of paper or journal page. move them around. add more papers, take some away. when you like how it looks, glue everything down. a glue stick works (apply liberally) or use tacky glue or gel medium. add words from a magazine or print favorite words/quotes with a printer. add paint, markers or rubber stamps to complete your collage.do you enjoy taking photos? photography is a great way to add creativity to your day. take your camera with you and look for something that grabs your attention. photo sharing websites that encourage you to post a daily photo can make this a habit. blipfoto: the daily photo journal is free to join. add one photo a day to your online journal and write something about it, or not!
