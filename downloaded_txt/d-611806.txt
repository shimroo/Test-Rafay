playing on my deepest fear


aug. 22nd, 2016 at 3:06 pm



 


rhionnachi'm at home recovering from having my radius bone broken in my right arm and my c2 vertebra broken in a car crash in which i had to have the roof cut off the car in order to extract me.  i have been very lucky that the c2 break turned out to be stable and didn't require surgery.i'm (impatiently) waiting for the days to go past so that i can get the neck collar off and the plaster off my arm so that i get begin to return to normality. i'm unable to go out without someone making sure i can get down the stairs safely due to the fact i cannot look down. the bannister is also on my right hand side so i am unable to grasp it to get down unsupervised. i am looking forward to freedom!here's the thing. all my life i have had a fear of immobility, of being held down and not able to move. i have no idea where it came from but it even shows in my dislike of tight clothing and of being held too strongly and especially of being tucked into a bed with very taut covers. if i am in a hotel which does just that then all sheets have to get pulled out before i can go to sleep.when i worked for a disabled charity i came face to face with people who had experienced first hand suddenly being made immobile through spinal injuries. i heard their stories and i found them scary. some of them were very active sportspeople, others had simply tripped over the cat, but all had sudden life changing injuries. i knew that their situation was my fear and i hoped it would not happen to me.so how did i feel when i was told i had fractured my c2 vertebra? the hospital did not immediately discuss the possibilities with me, possibly thinking i didn't know what the implications were, but i did know. the fact that my reflexes all checked out was a good sign. i swallowed my fear and faced up to dealing with the situation at hand. after x-rays, mri and ct scans and much discussion among the doctors it was decided my break was stable. i have been extremely lucky.  i cannot begin to emphasise how lucky i have been. of all the injuries to get, it would have to be the one which played on my deepest fear.

rhionnacha few days ago i accidentally got into a bit of an exchange of views online. nothing new about that, say most people, but i guess certain things said in the exchange have been preying on my mind. that, and the fact that i will be going to an event where i might happen to encounter my ex. not that he will say anything to me as he has decided to treat my presence as if i am invisible. no, his tactic, if any, is to say things to others and let them fight his battles.i guess that is why i got into the online exchange as the person i was arguing with was very much on his side and unwilling to listen to mine. the person i was disagreeing with finished off by saying “i find your attitude to be dismissive of not just the ex’s mental health at the time of the split but of mental health in general".i simply replied by saying that this showed they know nothing about me and nothing about the truth of the situation. but it stirred up old demons, old feelings of guilt. did i really misinterpret the situation at the time? was the reason my ex behaved the way he did due to a fragile state of mind? am i actually a terrible person who rode roughshod over him and who should have known better, given that i used to work in psychiatric social work? or should i have allowed him to continue doing things behind my back,  running up huge phone bills, spending money on stuff even although i had asked him to be careful with the limited finances we had? should i have understood that my giving him a hard time for deciding he was polyamourous instead of just accepting it was upsetting to him? was my perception that he was faking his mental (and physical) symptoms wrong? this person i argued with knows nothing of the terrible struggles i had before and after the split. they know nothing of the fact i have had counselling over the circumstances i have found myself in. in addition to the split with the ex i then had to deal with family deaths and a “carer” persuading my mother to rewrite her will, cutting me out entirely as if i never existed? (forgive me if i sound bitter but when his parents died he ended up with the inheritance due to him without anyone trying to take it off him.)i do question myself on a regular basis as to whether or not i could have or should have handled it all differently. i’ve since discovered the subject of narcissistic abuse which has far too many similarities to his behaviour. but then again, i also ask myself am i actually the narcissist looking for redemption? after all, he accused me of abusing him. and i do question myself over that as well.

rhionnachtoday was one of those days which didn't quite work out as planned. due to not getting where i should have been at the time i should have been there at i found myself with time on my hands. so i went off to currys to look at washing machines and then, as i was in the white goods section and i have a somewhat misbehaving fridge, i ended up looking at fridges as well. it was while i was looking at some fridge freezers that i was approached by a strange woman i had spotted earlier and who had drawn my attention as she was talking to herself. she wore a light brown cardigan and had very thin, very messy hair.she spotted me looking at the fridge freezer and began by saying "oh they're all in here buying fridges today". that would probably be because we were in that particular section of currys, but i didn't point that out. then she started asking me if i was buying a new fridge, i said i was looking at them. so she then asked me if my fridge had broken down and went on to try to ask why i was buying a new one, was it just because i wanted a new one? i didn't really feel the need to explain or even justify why i was doing what i was doing to some random stranger so i just ignored her and walked off. i later saw her sitting on a chair she had found somewhere and which she had placed in the middle of the aisle.of course, earlier on i had managed to set off an alarm when i was looking at a kindle paperwhite. i stood there waiting to explain to the member of staff i expected would arrive shortly that i had simply touched the damn thing but everyone ignored the alarm. i ended up shuffling off rather sheepishly and it was after that i met fridge freezer woman.

all in my imagination


may. 25th, 2015 at 11:42 am



 


rhionnachi think i am going to have to arrange a trip to the doctor at some point. i was trying to avoid having to do so but having been wakened up twice during the night with my left arm both numb and in pain (an interesting combination) i think i will have to see what they do this time around. when i was 15 i managed to fall off a horse and injured the whole shoulder (plus ribs). as i got back up on the horse shortly afterwards everyone assumed i was not badly injured. in fact i had a few bones broken and the joint capsule injured as well. when i went to the local idiot doctor with it the local idiot doctor behaved like the idiot he was and did not do a lot. gave me painkillers and a rub for my muscles. i preserved the movement in the shoulder by my own devices by continuing to swim etc after the soreness wore off a bit. i do, however, have an extra joint in my collarbone close to where it joins the sternum and much crunchiness throughout the shoulder joint. i also get swollen veins every so often when the joint decides to pinch the circulation. i've gone to assorted doctors off and on but they all kept fobbing me off, saying the swelling was due to my wearing a watch on that arm or it was all my imagination. yeah, like i imagined falling off the imaginary horse.there's certain things i've done on my own to improve it , like seeking out some physiotherapists who believed me and didn't tell me it was my imagination. this latest bout of problems seems to have come about possibly due to me carrying my rucksack with viking kit in it yesterday. something has shifted and is acting up. being wakened up with the nerves numbing up and doing pins and needles was very disconcerting. the muscles were radiating what i can only describe as black pain* as if they were trying to explode from the inside out. a shift of position onto my back sorted it but i can't be guaranteed to sleep on my back or my right side as i do tend to move around in my sleep.so it looks like i will have to take myself off to the local doctor and hope that they do not treat me like an idiot who doesn't know her own body.*yes, the pain had a colour. interesting.

fellowship? you keep using that word.  i do not think it means what you think it means.


apr. 24th, 2015 at 8:06 pm



 


rhionnachrecently a new networking group for pagans in scotland was set up. i thought this was interesting and decided to join their facebook group to see what they were about. as i'm one of the admins of the glasgow pagans facebook group and was a member of the equinox moot committee until i stood down recently i welcomed the idea of a new network open to all pagans. i thought that they would be interested in hearing about the other groups and activities that were going on and that they could incorporate this information into the network. after all, their own website states "whichever path you follow, we value your membership, input and ideas."unfortunately i made the grave error of thinking they would be interested in hearing about the alba pagan network which recently held its first group meeting and also the equinox moot in glasgow. i thought it odd when the first post i made about the alba pagan network disappeared but put it down to a glitch. so i posted it again. it disappeared again. i messaged them about the missing posts and they claimed that no posts had been removed and then that there had been an it problem. they said they were getting in touch with their it support (on facebook?).so i tried a third time. that was then held for approval as the admins had suddenly decided that all posts had to be approved by an admin before being allowed on the group. they eventually came back and asked if i could tell them more about the alba group as they had not been contacted by them. i did wonder at that as all they had to do was look at the link i had posted and the explanation of what the group was about would have been clear. i told them i was merely passing on information about other groups. i had also posted about the equinox moot but that post was also held up for approval.i asked them if there was a problem. i asked them why they had removed the posts and then denied all knowledge of them. i asked them why they were being suspicious. in reply, they claimed there was no "problem", they were looking into it and they would get back to me. in the end my posts were not posted. when i asked if posts were still required to be approved by an admin in a thread which mentioned the "lack of censorship" on the group the group suddenly disappeared. i asked the two admins where the group went and if there was a problem. their response seems to have been to block me. so we seem to have a networking group which doesn't seem to want to actually network with anyone. very weird.

rhionnachan email popped into my inbox last night which surprised me. it was asking about the yggdrasil moot which used to meet on the last thursday of the month in glasgow. it's not met for several years due to falling numbers. i consider it in hibernation rather than having finished as it could easily be revived if interest picked up from the local heathen population. however, i was under the impression that the word had got out to the relevant places that advertise local moots so when an inquiry came in saying that they had read about the moot in spin, the magazine of the scottish pagan federation, i was surprised and more than a bit annoyed. i was unaware that spin was still listing it as i have not seen a copy of it in many years as i am not a member of the spf. the reason i am not a member of the spf is due to their insistence that anyone asking to join sign to say that they accept the 3 principles or 3ps. this is not something that is demanded of members of the pagan federation england & wales and so i am a member of that organisation. the reason i do not accept the 3ps is that i do not feel they adequately represent my beliefs as a heathen and i cannot simply sign up to something which i believe conflicts with that. i'm a member of the pf england & wales. i'm a member of that organisation because i feel that it is important to have an organisation which can serve as a point of contact for those seeking a pagan path and which can represent the needs of pagans to government bodies and the like. the spf has done quite a bit for scottish pagans in that respect, getting the recognition to conduct legal pagan marriages for example. however, it seems that certain elements of the spf only want those pagans who do not question what the powers that be decide upon and who do not question what is going on with the organisation which claims to represent them. disagree with them at your peril.i have got to the point with the spf that i no longer care what they think. they have disenfranchised me and so many other scottish pagans with their closed shop mentality. i know as soon as i say anything that they don't like that they will just roll their eyes, stick their fingers in their ears and go "la la la". i commented last night on the glasgow pagans group about the inquiry i received and how i felt unable to contact the spf due to certain barriers which i feel have been put in my way by some. no doubt this will have been seen by some as just me trying to stir things again as their opinion of me is that i am simply a stirrer. but they would do better to ask themselves why i am "stirring it". why do i not simply walk away and not bother myself trying to get a response from the spf? could it be because i do, in fact, see it as an important organisation which has turned its back on an awful lot of the people it is supposed to be representing? could it be i am trying to get them to take their fingers out of their ears, stop saying "la la la" and listen?

a redshirt no more.


jun. 3rd, 2014 at 7:19 pm



 


rhionnachthe idea behind john scalzi's "redshirts" is that the characters become aware that their fate is decided upon by the script-writers and so they go in search of them to change the plot and stop further redshirts being killed. i have a similar feeling.a soap opera, along with every other story, has a beginning, a middle, and an end. i hope i have now reached the end of the soap opera i appear to have been written into. i feel an ending has been reached.i have now found out that the evil bitch who wormed her way into my mother's trust was made bankrupt last year. this is what lay behind the events of two years ago. it was an attempt by the evil bitch to acquire funds, by any means, fair or foul, to avoid this happening. she didn't give a damn if she came between my mother and myself, she didn't give a damn that she made the last year of an old lady's life more unpleasant than it needed to have been. an old lady who had already lost her husband and her younger daughter. she didn't give a damn that the memory of my last year with my mother would be tainted with the situation brought about by the evil bitch. i have had too much time to rehash that time, to go over things to see if there was something i could have done better, to see if i really was deserving of being cut out of the will as if i had never existed. never mind the house, the car etc, i have lost the majority of the bits and pieces that make up the memories of my family. i am glad i managed to rescue the photos and a few other things but there were things that belonged to my grandparents, my sister, my uncle that i do not have. all because of the evil bitch. so i am pleased to see that she was made bankrupt. i am not going to feel sorry for her. she deserves it. i just didn't need to be written into some soap opera, a genre i have no tolerance for. let this be the ending of the book. i want a new story, one that i like.

not so sunny saltcoats by the sea


may. 5th, 2014 at 5:40 pm



 


rhionnachi went to saltcoats today. i hired a car via city car club (http://www.citycarclub.co.uk/) as that would enable me to go there and back again via asda for some shopping and still give me time to do other stuff. it's coming up on the 2nd anniversary of my mother's death and therefore i wanted to go down to the cemetery with flowers. i also wanted to see the house once more, although i wasn't sure if this was a good idea or not.i left glasgow with the main aim being visiting the cemetery but i had been thinking about seeing how i would cope with seeing the former family home, especially given all the shit i have had to deal with. to recap, said shit being that a "carer" persuaded my mother to change her will, cutting me out of it, and leaving it all to said "carer" or evil bitch as i prefer to call her. the evil bitch didn't get it all her own way, money was left to 2 charities and after trying to get legal aid to challenge the will i claimed my rights under scottish law. evil bitch got a big bill and zero else.i was in two minds about going to the house, but i soon found myself on the way there. i parked across the road. the house looked much the same as it did, although it's now rented out apparently, after having been sold at auction. (evil bitch didn't get the house, although i think that was part of her plans)  my plan was to walk about, go along the cycle path behind the house and take a look at the sycamore in the garden. i spent long hours as a child climbing up into this tree and sitting among its branches. it was a pirate ship, a space ship, a refuge, a place just to be. however, the first person i saw when i got out of the car was the next door neighbour. i hadn't seen her since not long after the funeral at which the evil bitch had shouted at me in the street, calling me names after she had discovered i had changed the locks and didn't want her accompanying me in the funeral car. once the evil bitch regained access to the house i didn't go near anymore. so i was able to tell her what had happened with me. she told me how the evil bitch and her son would come down to the house after 9.00 am when they thought no one would be about to see them loading their car up with stuff from the house. this stuff was supposedly going to "charity" but both of us severely doubt it and that the only charity to benefit was the evil bitch charity.this was stuff that belonged to my family, to my parents, my sister, my grandparents and the evil bitch made off with it. if i had thought that things would go the way they did i could have loaded up my parents big suitcases and taken stuff away myself. but i was trying to be honest and thought that i ought to leave things in place until the legal stuff was sorted. i also naively thought that the evil bitch wasn't such an evil bitch that she wouldn't give me the opportunity to get personal items. so it's just as well that i did rescue as many photographs as i could find and that i did take some small things with me. but everything else has gone.after talking to the neighbour i went along the cycle path and managed to see the sycamore and the bluebells around the base. i walked about a bit and then returned to the car, went into central saltcoats for a wander and then went into stevenston. i went to the charity shop the evil bitch had some involvement with just to see if there was anything there i would recognise. what i would do if i bumped into the evil bitch i wasn't sure. however, i saw nothing and there were no unfortunate incidents.i then went on to the cemetery and eventually returned home. i'm glad i plucked up the courage to go back to the house, i'm glad i bumped into the neighbour. now that i've got over this difficulty it means i can go back to saltcoats again. i last walked on the beach on the day i had my last conversation with my mother, before she slipped into that liminal place between life and death. perhaps i'll be able to walk on the beach once more.

satellite 4


apr. 22nd, 2014 at 7:33 pm



 


rhionnachi had a really good time at satellite 4, this year's eastercon which was held in glasgow. i met up with people i hadn't seen for a while, attended panels and programme items, took part in panels and programme items, and was entertained by a swing band and the scottish falsetto sock puppets. i also drank a lot of real ale and forgot to have lunch on occasion and sat talking till late. i'm looking forward to loncon 3, this year's worldcon which is taking place in london in august. i also volunteered to work in ops. i did several shifts in ops over the weekend. this was in spite of unexpected opposition from my ex of seven years who suddenly decided to raise an objection to my doing so. why he did so after seven years of us being apart i do not know but i did not allow it to put me off doing what i had said i would do. this will not deter me from continuing to work in ops at worldcon. and if he doesn't like it, then that's just too bad. the world does not revolve around him. stupid, childish behavior aside, it was a really good weekend, really enjoyable and just the break i needed to recharge my batteries. i'm looking forward to worldcon.
