chicagoland corvair enthusiasts
about us

		  from its introduction in 1960, the corvair has enjoyed the distinction of being 
		  an enthusiast's automobile. in 1968 a group began meeting regularly in a 
		  corvair owner's oak park living room. as the group grew, monthly meetings 
		  were organized at a local bar. as the club reached a membership of 100 in 
		  the mid 1970's the general motors training center in hinsdale became the venue 
		  for years of fun and informative meetings. today the club has grown to over 
		  200 members.

		  meetings are held at the vfw hall in villa park, illinois at 7:30 pm on 
		  the third wednesday of every month. club business is presented and discussed 
		  during the first half of the meetings. the latter portion of the meetings 
		  are devoted to corvair related entertainment ranging from movie nights to 
		  tech sessions and an annual corvair parts auction. above all the meetings 
		  are a chance for everyone to be with their fellow members and friends.

		  our monthly newsletter, the airhorn, is second to none. the tireless efforts
		  of the editor and the contributions of material and stories from members 
		  make the airhorn one of the finest newsletters produced by a collector car
		  club.

		  cce is also active in organizing events throughout the course of the year. spring 
		  and fall tours are a fun way to see many of the interesting sites in illinois 
		  and its adjoining states. the tours are well organized and are always enjoyed 
		  by everyone who participates. there is nothing more fun than seeing the 
		  reaction of the people along the way as a "cor-a-van" of gleaming 
		  corvairs pass through their town.

		  the chicagoland corvair enthusiasts is a diverse club that offers the opportunity 
		  for members to enjoy their cars and the company of others who share their 
		  love of chevrolet corvair cars and trucks.
