since 1992, orlando fringe has provided a space and opportunity for artists to emerge and showcase their talents and craft. the orlando fringe produces the orlando international fringe theatre festival, the longest-running fringe in the united states, which strives to be unjuried, uncensored, accessible for artists and audiences alike, with 100% of ticket sales given back to the artists. fringe artspace creates and fosters a year-round inclusive and collaborative environment that promotes participation and openly recruits diverse stories and performances. we provide opportunities for underrepresented artists and communities through inclusive shows, art, and experiences and by facilitating opportunities for coaching, mentorship, and scholarships and offering guidance that might help artists and companies on their artistic journey.
