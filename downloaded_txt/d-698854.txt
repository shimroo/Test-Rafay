today, libraries are more important than everlibraries provide a safe space for the spread of ideas and information. these days unfortunately, our libraries are under attack due for supporting and affirming lgbtqia+ lives and identities. our library is the largest collection of its type in new york, with over 11,000 items including periodicals, fiction, non-fiction, films, and rare materials.
