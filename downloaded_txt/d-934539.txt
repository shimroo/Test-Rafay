this site mainly serves as an archive of my travel diaries and thoughts between the ages of 18 and my early 20s, before the word 'blog' was even a thing.

my yearbook company
16 december 2008
allyearbooks, my thriving yearbook business, has grown an awful lot since my last post about it here. this summer we took on our first staff (jamey, nic and david) and we moved to an office about lloyds tsb on mill road here in cambridge. i’m loving the fact that now that we have staff i can concentrate on coding cool new features into the site. anyway, if you’re looking for a great yearbook company you know where to go!
