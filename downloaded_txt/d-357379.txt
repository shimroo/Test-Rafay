 about us
committed to community & agriculture


we have more than 25 years of experience in integrated pest management (ipm) and reducing pesticide use and risks. anticipating a growing demand for sustainability programs that go beyond a focus on ipm, our focus expanded over the years to encompass a broad range of agricultural sustainability issues. our work grew to include partnerships and projects with food and agricultural companies along the supply chain, from growers to packers and processors to retailers.
our work includes a range of projects to increase practices that improve working conditions, reduce greenhouse gases, improve air quality, water quality and soil health and reduce risks to health and the environment from pesticide and nutrient use in agriculture and communities.

 learn more





integrated pest management (ipm) is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical and chemical tools to identify, manage and reduce risk from pests and pest management tools and strategies in a way that minimizes overall economic, health and environmental risks.
agricultural ipm and community ipm differ in many ways but share the same basic principles of prevention, monitoring, careful analysis of risk and risk-reduction.
