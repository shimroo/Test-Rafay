welcome
welcome! located in guilford county, northwest of greensboro, oak ridge is home to 7,474 residents. we incorporated in 1998, but original settlers were here in the 1700s. we’re proud of our rural and historic roots, natural beauty, and small-town charm. 









light up the night
this annual holiday event features visits with santa, activities for all, and the lighting of our town tree and over 1,400 luminaries that remain on display throughout the season. 









municipal water


oak ridge seeks to build a modest municipal water system built around community wells in new developments, with eventual connections available to other residents. a related effort seeks to improve access to water for our local fire department.











traffic & intersection plans


 updated information from nc dot regarding the nc 150 / nc 68 intersection improvements project.
 

 
 











core initiative


designed to help preserve open space and historic structures in oak ridge, the core initiative educates property owners about what’s involved in placing an easement on their property and can provide grant funding to offset the costs involved.











strategic plan
in 2018, town council developed the town’s first strategic plan by focusing on issues that will define oak ridge over the next 10 years. the resulting plan balances growth and preservation with planning for the future.









canine capers
canine capers is an annual animal rescue and oak ridge bark park fundraiser held in oak ridge town park. the event features an array of fun contests and useful training clinics for pets and owners alike. prizes, raffle drawings, food and treat vendors as well as craft vendors will be a part of the show. proceeds from the event benefit participating local rescue organizations. 









music in the park
music in the park is held on the second saturday of the month, beginning in april and ending in october, at oak ridge town park’s amphitheater. these events are free, family-friendly events which feature a different popular band each month. food trucks, sweet treats, wine and craft beer will all be offered so bring a lawn chair or blanket and join us for a fun evening of fabulous music! 









planning & zoning
we handle planning and zoning issues within the town and in the extra-territorial jurisdiction (etj) on our western border. a citizen board, appointed by town council, makes recommendations on rezoning and approves site/subdivision plans.









village core guidebook
to increase the village feeling in our town core and strengthen connections with the historic district, oak ridge is developing a handbook to direct the design of future commercial development.
