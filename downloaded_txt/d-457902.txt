this web site is dedicated to 1947 and 1948 chevy cars,
although 1942 and 1946 chevy's are similar this web site will concentrate on 1947 and 1948 chevy's only.



this is not the official web site for 1947 and 1948 chevrolet's by any means. this web site was
created with information i have collected over the years while restoring my 1947 and 1948 chevy's.
