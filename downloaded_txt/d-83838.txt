            community for people of african descent and others interested in







          the african and african american christian experience. at blackandchristian.com,







          we are your one stop resource for inspiration and information, as we

          as always, keep 







            looking up !









 the spirit of the lord is upon me, because 







                    he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath 







                    sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to 







                    the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set 







                    at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable 







                    year of the lord.
luke 4:18--19
