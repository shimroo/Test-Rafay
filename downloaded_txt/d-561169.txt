our impact
our efforts improve each step of the agricultural value chain.  we introduce farmers to new methods and technology, improve export marketing techniques, and create strategies for ramping up food exports to lucrative overseas markets.as a result, we have helped export nearly 160,000 metric tons of fruits, nuts, and spices valued at more than $491 million to international markets, impacting more than 1 million farmers and families.  we have planted over 7 million fruit trees worldwide.

    pilot project report
  

 











agricultural marketing program (amp) in afghanistan 
since 2002, roots of peace worked with farmers and traders in afghanistan supported by usaid—we are the longest standing ngo working consecutively in afghanistan.in 2010, many afghan farmers were lacking viable fruit saplings and basic vineyard technology. by the end of the project, the improved yields of those farms appeared on supermarket shelves around the world.amp expanded the number of regional and international markets where afghan high-value food products are sold—particularly europe, china, and the middle east.  additionally, it introduced new afghan food products to these markets.
