okay, so i have been slack. but it hard to tear yourself away from the beach, to sit in front of a laptop to send mails and post blogs. but here goes.finally made it to nyc. after a 10hour flight from ct to dubai, 1 4 hour layover, and a 14hour flight from dubai to ny. although i was on the abslolutely incredible a380-800 airbus, i had possibly the most badly behaved 2 year old next to me whos mother didn't give a frikking hoot about her childs bad behavior. thus, sleep was not going as well as planned! did have two rather attractive aussie hostesses to keep me company though. :)arrived late in the evening on friday after a transfer with a taxi driver that made south african taxi drivers look as tame as a frikking daschund. but made it out alive.went out for cheap, yet awesome curry a few blocks from adam and claire's apartment. okay, cheap is a relative term here. nothing in new york is cheap.went for drinks at 230 on fifth rooftop bar which was styling. unfortunately i was a little buggered, so crashed realaitively early.spent the satursday cruising down broadway and in soho. had the greatest breakfast bagel at murray's bagels. did some window shopping, bought cheap sunglasses, had coffee at the grey dog, possibly the most unique coffee shop i have ever been to and headed home.ad and i set off to play rugby for stern bussiness school against the wharton warthogs (u penn bussiness school). rather tight game, but the south african influence made the difference and we won 7-0. went to a small pub under below the apartment for drinks and found local. barteneder ended up giving us a bunch of free drinks and what was going to be one quite one turned into a few.sunday i flew to charlotte to see paul, sandy, felix and jordan. arrived sunday lunch and chilled out with the family, taking it easy. dave, dee, teegan, and cameron came round for a drink.monday took it easy with the family, did some planning, and packed my backpack for my journey. went for a drink with george and abi to the rusty rudder. had deep fried pickles (gerkhins). can you phathim that? anyhooo, they had flat tire so i was a happy guy. had a good catch up with them and got to drive george's old, yet awesome, landcruiser home.tuesday is paulus's day off, so got to hang out with him. went for an epic mtb ride in the afternoon on his new gary fischer. what a joll. sandy and dee had bookclub that evening, so paul, dave and i took the kids for dinner to cheeeburgers in paradise (a jimmy buffet franchise). had a cheesburger..what do you expect?wednesday i flew to la to meet katie and duce.
