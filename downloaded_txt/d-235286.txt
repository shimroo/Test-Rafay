years before our doors opened in july of 1996, tim mccune and his original business partner, pete truxaw, dreamed of creating a neighborhood restaurant tailored to their community. they envisioned an upscale yet casual american-themed grille, where friends and family would come to relax and savor a unique dining experience. it was from that dream that salt creek grille was born.
our culinary approach follows the time-honored tradition of grilling meats over hot, mesquite embers. with a dedication to sourcing responsibly, our food is crafted with the freshest meats, poultry, fish, and produce available. our menu may be paired with unique wines from boutique vineyards and well-known cellars, catering to both the connoisseur and casual taster.
we invite you to experience the salt creek grille way.
