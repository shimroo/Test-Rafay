what our customers are saying










i have used salem for many items over the past 20 years. recently, due to covid, our long-standing supplier for sanding discs and belts were unable to supply us with our product. i spoke to my salem sales representative and he set me up with part numbers and prices to keep us supplied. all of my experiences with salem have been positive and i value our relationship.
– tim conklin, president — wholesale glass distributors, inc.






these bits are the best i have seen and used in my 12 plus years of glass fabrication. all our machines are now equipped, in all diameters, with the thunder cut bits. we have continued success with increased work feed, quantity and quality of the holes.
– chad, operations manager — splendor shower door






in the simplest explanation of chemwest and its counter parts [stm990 coolant and stmsettle19 flocculant], it is a must have! after having and maintaining floor settling tanks and then a centrifuge, there is no comparison in the ease and care of owning a chemwest system. benefits: 1) much cleaner coolant, 2) cleaner machinery, 3) time spent in maintaining the system is a large savings, #4 working with 1 or 2 pumps instead of multiple pumps attached to many pieces of machinery-that is a big savings alone, and 5) most all controls are air operated with very simple operation. if for any reason you are hesitant - do not be! it will make your life easy and your machine operators happy. simply put, it’s a winner!
— scott brion, maintenance supervisor — martell sales & service






i’ve known and worked with salem and, specifically, daniel jessup for over 18 years. no matter who my assigned rep was before, i called daniel! daniel’s industry knowledge is excellent! he does everything from product sales and service to machine troubleshooting—everything! he follows through, goes the extra mile and is very trust worthy. he has saved us money with machinery through a salem pre-owned beveler purchase and a new glass washer that was half the price of the competitor. the same goes with supply products. daniel has saved us a bundle on cerium with their salem 22, versus our previous supplier, and will now save us more with the re-truing of wheels for our double edger. i am a pleased customer!
— lloyd brigman, director of operations — virginia glass & mirror
