catholics united for life is a nationwide organization with branches in  
a number of cities.  we come together to pray and give witness for the  
protection of all preborn humans. members of our southeast michigan branch meet weekly  
in front of several abortion clinics and pray the rosary for the sake of the  
unborn babies and their mothers. we also meet monthly in church for adoration and prayer for the end  
to abortion.  



the perpetual web rosary  
this is an ongoing rosary in which everyone on the web can participate. say as many prayers as you wish.  
the place where you stop is saved so that the next person can continue from that point. the prayers are 
presented in english or latin, your choice.
