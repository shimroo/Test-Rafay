 learning to walk and wink: terrestrial fish inspired design
feb. 18, 2025
~ 375 million years ago, early tetrapods began transitioning from life in the water to life on land. to understand how they achieved this major transition, we study the fossil record and the diversity of living fishes.
 forcing atoms into chaotic, uncomfortable – but extraordinary places
feb. 18, 2025
the search for new phases of matter is one of the most thrilling challenges in materials science. why? because discovering and designing new materials unlocks groundbreaking technologies—from faster electronics to cleaner energy solutions.

mri's culture of interdisciplinary research

penn state’s investment in its interdisciplinary research institutes, including the materials research institute (mri), has created a culture of strong collaborations across disciplines. at penn state, many researchers have the support of both their academic departments and the university-wide institutes, such as mri. by encouraging crosscutting research, mri and its sister institutes open up traditional silos of knowledge to the stimulus of other viewpoints and new ideas. this mingling of disciplines, often called “convergence,” brings together the physical and life sciences with engineering and computation to solve the most complex problems facing society today and in the future.
