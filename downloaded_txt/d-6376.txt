the university of calgary, located in the heart of southern alberta, both acknowledges and pays tribute
            to the traditional territories of the peoples of treaty 7, which include the blackfoot confederacy
            (comprised of the siksika, the piikani, and the kainai first nations), the tsuut’ina first nation,
            and the stoney nakoda (including chiniki, bearspaw, and goodstoney first nations). the city of calgary
            is also home to the métis nation of alberta (districts 5 and 6).
the university of calgary is situated on land northwest of where the bow river meets the elbow river,
            a site traditionally known as moh’kins’tsis to the blackfoot, wîchîspa to the stoney nakoda, and
            guts’ists’i to the tsuut’ina. on this land and in this place we strive to learn together, walk
            together, and grow together “in a good way.”
