about
the dancing dragon was started as a partnership in 1985 between chris pavelchik and james phillips and has been going strong ever since. the fort campbell strip between clarksville, tennessee and hopkinsville, kentucky has been home to many "old school" tattooists like colonel todd, sailor jack, and earl brown to name a few. the dancing dragon has been in business longer than any studio within 150 miles in any direction. chris and james are both members of the "national tattoo association" and have been since the early '80's. they are also long standing members of the "tattoo club of japan".






100 years of combined tattoo experience

              great reviews, standing behind our work, treating our customers right, and dedication to this art form is why we've been successful all these years...  these core values are what we are about...
            

              dancing dragon tattoo studio has been in business here in oak grove, kentucky, for 30 years now...  we opened our doors in february, 1986, and have been going strong ever since.  we've seen a lot of shops come and go, people opening up shops with no formal training, then "apprenticing" people under them, thus creating a "regional gene pool" of tattoo mediocrity, where 'wannabees" and "posers" abound...  actually, in the tattooing realm, this has become a national epidemic,

chris pavelchik
unfortunately, we lost chris on 12/16/2022. he will be missed as a father, tattooist, and all around good person. he started his tattooing apprenticeship in 1983 after serving with the army's 101st air assault infantry.  chris had also been down range as a private security contractor in 2004-2005 as part of personal security overseas.
                  he has won numerous regional awards at various events over the years. he has tattooed in germany, italy, sweden, and the czech republic, doing the european circuit with other well known tattooists.  chris was most influenced by don ed hardy, bill liberty, and the late greg irons

choose your artist carefully
 choose your tattooist carefully folks, amateur hour in this business is unacceptable. hanging out in art galleries, or having a pool table in your shop doesn't make you a good tattooist. select your tattooist carefully, because not all shops are equal.  a few are great, alot are mediocre, and a whole lot just plain suck..

tattoo faqs
here at the dragon we understand that a lot of you have questions regarding tattooing. we've compiled the most frequently asked to help you on your tattoo journey.




how much can i expect to pay?

pricing has much to do with what you are getting done.
smaller tattoos are priced up front based upon the amount of work done.
large custom work is priced by the hour.
our shop minimum is $60.00.






medication and tattooing

we recommend speaking to your doctor before getting tattooed if you are taking any medication.
if you are on blood pressure medication, or are at risk for such things associated with heart problems, please talk to your doctor
it is not a good idea to get tattooed while taking oral antibiotics. this is due to the anti-biotics working overtime trying to expel any foreign bodies that are introduced.







can i bring my own design?

we can work with any reference material that you bring us.
the internet, library, greeting cards, t-shirts, fabric and wallpaper patterns are all good places to look.
or give us a sketch (no matter how sketchy), talk to us about size, area, style, budget, and turn us loose.
the most important thing is that you get what you want. you're gonna have to wear it.
