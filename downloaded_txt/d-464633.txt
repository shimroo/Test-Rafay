"just a note to thank you for the positive buying experience i've enjoyed from mcs. a good company recognises that its greatest strength is the quality of the staff who work for them. all the staff involved in my purchase have been excellent and have all gone the extra mile to ensure a happy outcome to today. greg for his open honesty in directing me toward a bike that would suit my needs, irregardless of its manufacturer…(xsr900 definitely needs an old mans comfort seat on the options list). he's answered every question i had with the right answer and a smile. alun for whizzing us through the deal finalisation and delivery process swiftly and seamlessly. and last but not least stevie for servicing and test riding the bike on a saturday. all in all i'd class mcs as above and beyond on all fronts, i will unreservedly recommend all of you to anyone who asks me about motorcycle purchase. frankly, you all feel more like friends i've made recently than folks i've bought a bike and clothing from."neil  july 2024   
 "greg is the legend we all need!  and no he didn't pay me for this review! so…. i seen a bike that was exactly what i'd spent countless hours of my life over the span of months searching for. 1 challenge.. it was in scotland and i'm in dorset. so somewhat of a drive to pick up a bike and get it back to more warmer (softer) climates.  i contacted mcs scotland for more details and an idea on delivery information.greg was quick to call me back and email me with all the detail i needed.people moaned at me for taking a risk with nearly £7k on my first big girl bike that i hadn't seen or rode…but hey we live once and i just had to have that bike. no other would do. and greg made me feel pretty confident he wasn't running to his private yacht with my money.  the bike was picked up and delivered right on the time and date that greg had arranged for me, along with a cheeky discount on the delivery charge.and it was it a wreck.. had i been mugged off with a lemon??  nope!  she was even better than the photos.  i was jumping around like a kid at christmas as it was wheeled off the van.  and of course she was seated immediately and was a beaut to ride.  i couldn't have been happier with the service and the bike.i would absolutely recommend greg and mcs scotland. even if you are located a near 8hr drive away."samantha     march 2024   
"excellent service. friendly helpful staff in all depts couldn't be happier with our purchase.highly recommend, good selection of new and used motorcycles at competitive prices"kerry  june 2024
