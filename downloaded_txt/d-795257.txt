this remedy has been revised as of july 23, 2019




emerson tool co. (etc) is providing $50 to owners of craftsman® 8-inch, 8¼-inch, 9-inch, and 10-inch radial arm saws, who follow a four-step process described on this website to properly disable their radial arm saw and document such steps.
sears sold the craftsman® 8-inch, 9-inch, and 10-inch saws from 1958 through 1992. the craftsman® 8¼-inch saws were sold from 1990 through 1995.
craftsman® 12-inch saws are not eligible for this recall.
historically, these eligible saws were sold without a guard that covers the entire blade. some consumers have contacted the blade or have been hit by wood kicked back by the saws, resulting in amputations, fractures and lacerations.
