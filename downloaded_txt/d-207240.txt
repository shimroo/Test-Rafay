alive and well..





she came first, i came last--roll the grasscrack for christmas is coming, but for now we in clover g land--houston is mine.get your 3rd bass game up. make sure to check the pics and grab that yo mtv rap episode in the downloads section.go peep youtube for the do-it-yourself video uploads. whether its the sean kemp/reignman tribute (copped off kamoji) or the juelz/jeezy/weezy video where chris dudley clinton sparks plays his himself, literally.notorious b.i.g ft clipse-"just a memory"ok, this is the final piece to the final chapter of the post-mortum big albums. ( i hope) i knew scram dropped a beat on the album, but didn't know which one. this one lifts the vocals off "you're nobody until somebody kills you" and scram jumps behind the wheels for the hook. pusha and malice rep b.i.g's legacy correctly, and clearly putting the label situation out there for the world. the "label-limbo" can't get phase either one of these dudes-i mean p still "plays in the snow like santa" and malice, mr. i-was-pushing-keys-in-a-v-with-no-roof. coke rap. gotta love it.ll cool j ft juelz-"its ll & santana"ll's back for his 12th album--ok so this is the first leak record or maybe its the first single, does it even matter anymore? well just blaze gets biz on the track, and uncle juju defintiely brings is a! game on the record, but i can't take uncle ll to serious anymore, i mean the juvie and birdman shoutout? the screwed up sample? make it more obvious you are trying to attach to current rap rather than sticking to the script. yeahhh..gimme the instrumental,and im good. ill forget about this joint within a week.2 for 5'sscarface-"never snitch"notorious b.i.g ft akon, scarface, big gee-hustler's story5 subway readsdef jam, inc.where you're attwelvea million little piecesthe tipping point5 more i need to readexecutioner's songlunar parktwelve bar bluescommodify your dissentsoul on ice

sunshine plays a major part in the daytimeposse cuts***redman ft. ludacris, icarus, ghostface-"future thugs"bun b ft. slim thug, chamillionaire, mike jones, paul wall, lil flip, z-ro, aztek*** someone with some writing skills needs to do an in-depth on the impact of the posse cut and the current state of hip-hop. cut me my 20% after its done.334 mo.b.b..do the knowledge334 mo.b.b-"check me out (take a picture)"dirty harry does it again! this time dude comes back and lebron's the game and adds another classic to the collection--the first installment of 'living legends' features nas, and is flawless. mixunit quotes it as, "possibly the best nas mixtape ever!?!"--i'm not mad at yall...go feed your ears.murcielago..lets go halves!holding down nyc's public access tv for years--mad ciphas has finally brought mnn's best kept secret to the internet. the first mixtape television show of its kind, the 30 minute show features performances of your favorite artist's favorite artist spitting for the camera. its definitely originally and capture a ton of talent. in any episode you might catch jae millz rhyming with his throwback-rocking, oversize fitted sporting wanna blow crew in cipha's basement or cipha's could even run up on chingo bling, and catch him spitting a flow for the camera in the streets. the show aims to match a face to the many mc's you may hear on the radio, or a mixtape but don't have that no-video-budget-money.. check it out every sunday night at 10:30 on mnn, if you're stuck watching bcat way out in mill basin, mnn holds you down with a weekly stream at the same time...hear it, see itthe smoking section..light up!mattsoreal, the mayor of houston music, getting major over  at houstonsoreal has dedicated the entire month of october to bun b--im hoping for some pre-album exclusives, and maybe even that dizee/bun b collabo. i will forever hold dude down for bringing devin to nyc on my birthday--nothing better than listening to 'doobi ashtray' with a pocketfull of sour deisel. while your there grab that rapid ric joint..here's one of my favorite bun verses, off the scarface 'last of the dying breed' album.scarface feat. ugk-"down with us"..knocking motherfuckas out is a must
