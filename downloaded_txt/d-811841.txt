baltimore ballet is 
					celebrating 24 years in baltimore, 
					continuing our tradition of outstanding instruction for all 
					ages and professional performances (our annual sold-out 
					the nutcracker and spring productions) featuring world renowned 
					dancers, aspiring pre-professionals, and children who love 
					to dance.

                    conveniently located off of york road in cockeysville, our 
					4,500 square foot state of the art facilities offer 3 large, 
					bright studios with high ceilings, true sprung wood floors 
					and harlequin marley surfaces, observation windows into all 
					studios, a large waiting room, and plenty of free parking. 
                    classes are small in size, and are offered for all ages and 
					levels of children, teens, and adults.  the faculty are 
					professional dancers with degrees in dance who emphasize 
					technique and artistry.  the curriculum includes ballet, 
					modern, jazz, character, and tap. 
                    our dancers are graceful, confident, and happy!
