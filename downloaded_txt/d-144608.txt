frequently asked questions


how do the online training & certification programs work? 
our online courses follow instructional design requirements, meaning the course is broken into multiple lessons. each lesson has a 'lesson goals' page showing the two or three key points to learn from that lesson. it then provides training - in english, not legalese - with lots of tips, examples, and procedural recommendations, then concludes with "end of lesson quizzes" that are multiple-choice question that state a potential situation that you, as the administrator, must handle.


do i have to attend a seminar in person? 
our seminars are available in both in-person and virtual options. both options contain the same training; the only difference is that you attend the virtual sessions from the comfort of your home or office.

what is the difference between an hr generalist and an hr specialist? 
these titles are interchangeable. bottom line, the job entitles working with any number of hr functions, including benefits, payroll, compensation, workers' comp, compliance, and more.

what does your investigation class cover? 
while many people think investigations primarily cover fraud or theft, in reality the majority of workplace investigations are based upon employee and management behavior, and handling these situations correctly can mean a happy workforce or a lawsuit. for instance, how would your organization respond to claims of bullying, negligence, or retaliation? how does it identify whether there is a complaint that should he handled by a supervisor or actually investigated? does your organization have a process for interviewing witnesses or writing reports? the key here is to get trained on how to do an investigation before you actually have to do one! [view course agenda]

do your courses provide updates whenever the laws change? 
absolutely - and we do it for free! in essence, we notify you with both an overview of any changes and directions as to where and what changed in your courseware.

what is the difference between hrcertification.com courses and hrci or shrm courses? 
while hrci and shrm provide "soft skills" training and theory for the hr department in general, hrcertification.com provides "hard skills" training for actually administrating the government-required rules for fmla, ada, cobra, payroll, etc.
