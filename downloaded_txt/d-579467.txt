 or, 
                  finally, if you are interested in poetry, have a look at our poetry 
                  pages. initially, they 
                  are some of my favourite australian "bush ballads". later i 
                  will add some others 
                  from other sources; and, of course, any that you care to send me that 
                  i may find 
                  interesting. the poetry pages have only been started in early february 
            2003. 
         my 
                  last "favourite" poem was added on july 
                  the 28th, 
          2003.
