kind words from biotab patients 










						“i use my pump from biotab every day because it has helped my legs a lot and feels great. my legs are now, after using the pump for 2 months, back to the size they normally are, and i have not been back in to the hospital for cellulitis since."					


d. funkausercouncil bluffs, ia 






						“i am very glad that the va hospital ordered me a pump from biotab. i tried a pump from another company, but the garments multiple velcro straps required me having help. with biotab’s garments, i slide them on and press start on the pump. it’s really easy and it works.”					


c. blanksioux falls, sd 






						“i have a history of severe swelling in my feet and sensitive ulcers that are difficult to heal. i refused to use pumps in the past because it was too painful. but with biotab’s pump, they were able to make me feel comfortable. the biotab specialist came to my house, set up my equipment, and customized treatment by reducing pressure by my ulcers. quality product and excellent customer service!”
