connect with the natural world




 




the spl difference
every decision we make is born out of one of our three themes: to connect our students and guests with each other and the natural world, to build respect for nature and for each others’ differences, and to carry what we learn here out into the world to create a positive ripple effect in our communities.

ever since our first visit together to spl, we both agreed it is, without exaggeration ‘the most beautiful spot in the world’! …. friendly, well trained staff and an excellent management team go above and beyond to make sure we enjoy every day spent at this beautiful spot. we will be back, hopefully every year!
