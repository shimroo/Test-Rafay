a letter from a customer:

 

good morning, angela.
we received the table pads, newly fixed with magnets and are so pleased.
thank you for doing such a great job and for finding a way to have them stay together in place once again.
a table is a place of gathering, enjoying a special meal, of celebrating, connecting and playing a game, studying or learning, a place where we pile life stuff as we sort through it.
so i wanted you to know how much i appreciate you and your company, provincial table pads…
most companies don’t last the test of time. they don’t stand by their products. and though i understand that peopled are often just doing the best they can, it’s so refreshing to have connected with a company so long ago, 20 year in fact, that gets it. that has integrity. that goes the extra mile.
thank you for that.
i wanted you to know that what you do and how you do it is important.
it makes people feel good. it made me feel good.
it reassured me that there there are like-minded people out there who care about what they do and say; and who follow through even when they might not feel like it. even when 20 years have passed.
sometimes a promise is a promise. still.
we’ll enjoy using our dining room table protected with your tried-and-true newly repaired table pads to our heart’s content and will enjoy having the pads stay put like they did when we first purchased them years ago.
something so little and simple but something so big to me.
thank you so much.
wishing you a great day.
with gratitude.
