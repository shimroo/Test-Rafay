	question of the week   
  
christine asked this question about the afina specialty collection single door frameless recessed mounted medicine cabinet arch top



q: when a medicine cabinet says right or left, is it referring to the hinge placement?
 
a: yes, when a medicine cabinet indicates "right" or "left," it is referring to the hinge placement. this specifies which side you prefer the hinge to be installed on for the model af-sd2430-arc-bv. please let us know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!
