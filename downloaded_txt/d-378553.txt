our story
the forest county potawatomi (fcp) have lived in forest county, wisconsin, since the late 1800s. around 1880, groups settled in areas near blackwell and wabeno and have lived in that area since, as well as in the carter and crandon (or stone lake) areas.
today, life on the reservation is very different than it was for the elders. they have done much for the younger generation, and it is because of the elders that the younger generations are who they are today.
by pursuing a diverse set of business models, the forest county potawatomi of today are the largest employer in forest county. with revenues from various tribal enterprises, the potawatomi have invested in the health, wellness, education, environment and future of its people.
the fcp have also worked hard to preserve its culture and honor its past. the cultural center, library and museum provide an important link to the past and serves to facilitate important ceremonies.
we invite you to discover the modern forest county potawatomi. you will find a thriving native american culture that is proud of its past and eager for the future.



cultural center, library & museum
services  offered to the community include language and cultural class  instruction, historical photograph reproduction and repair, native  american dvd rental and gift shop sales, 4000 library books on the  history and culture of the great lakes indians, tribal newspapers of  wisconsin tribes and potawatomi bands.
