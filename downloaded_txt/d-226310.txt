britannia's fist by peter g. tsouras is an outstanding work of alternate history



i've finished reading britannia's fist by peter g. tsouras.  i've been trying to find an email address for the author so that i could tell him how awesome it is, but to no avail.tsouras was an army intelligence officer and a military historian, and it shows.  the back of the novel is actually a full set of endnotes for his sources, both real and fictitious.  it was a nice touch.the story, in which britain enters the american civil war after the laird rams controversy gets ugly, is meticulously researched and quite realistic.  i await, with trembling pleasure, the sequel.grade: a+

top 10 mothers in science fiction and fantasy



tomorrow, call your mother because it's mother's day, and you'll (be made to) regret it if you don't.  but until tomorrow, you may want to look at matt blum of geek dad's list of the ten greatest mothers in science fiction and fantasy:8. martha kent - you think it’s tough to deal with your kids’ temper tantrums? imagine having to worry they’ll register on the richter scale! and imagine his birthday parties: “ok, clark, blow out the candles… carefully!” it’s a miracle she had any hair, gray or not, left by the time she was getting old.7. padme amidala - yes, we know, she never actually had the opportunity to be a mother to luke and leia. and she did spend most of episode iii sitting at home being pregnant and spouting mind-numbingly bad dialogue. but she was pretty badass in episodes i and ii, and she did produce her twins, who did eventually help bring about the downfall of the empire.who would you add to the list?

new harry turtledove short story



harry turtledove, master of alternate history, has penned a short story about life on earth, decades after it has been partially conquered by aliens.the president of the united states looked out of an oval office window at grand junction, colorado. the oval office was square, but the president’s workplace kept its traditional name. harris moffatt iii sighed and bent to his paperwork again. even in grand junction, that never disappeared.washington, d.c., remained the de jure capital of the united states. harris moffatt iii had never been there. neither had his father, president harris moffatt ii. his grandfather, president harris moffatt i, got out of washington one jump ahead of the krolp. that the usa was still any kind of going concern came from his ever-so-narrow escape.harris moffatt iii was also prime minister of canada, or of that small and mountainous chunk of canada the krolp didn’t control. the two countries had amalgamated early on, the better to resist the invading aliens. that, of course, was before they realized how far out of their weight they were fighting.

10 things you may not know about firefly



zach oat of television without pity has a list of ten things that you might not know about the space western firefly.  a sample:9. a firefly musical episode was not implausibleno, whedon wasn't planning one or anything like that, but the musically inclined showrunner apparently likes to sing on set, and during one break in shooting he started singing the theme from oklahoma! immediately, nathan fillion, fillion's stand-in and a half-dozen others joined in, and they sang the whole song through before returning to work. we're imagining a hallucinatory coolant leak on board the serenity, with feelings expressed through song and, in river's case, interpretive dance.via io9

britannia's fist: from civil war to world war  by peter g. tsouras



i am currently reading the first book in an alternate history trilogy by peter g. tsouras.  britannia's fist imagines a british entry into the american civil war, specifically against the union.tsouras is a retired us army intelligence officer.  although i've heard of his name before, i have yet to read his work.  so far, several pages in, it is clear that tsouras is trying to create a historically plausible scenario.  this is the most important task in the writing of alternate history fiction.harry harrison wrote a similar trilogy, beginning with the stars and stripes forever.  i would describe it as wildly optimistic because every lucky break goes america's way.  nonetheless, it is fairly plausible and worth reading.

terry pratchett: doctor who isn't science fiction



sir terry pratchett, author of the discworld series, says that doctor who can't be classed as science fiction:it’s no good, i’ll go with the doctor, even if those ood look as if they should have been confronted by tom baker. after all, when you’ve had your moan you have to admit that it is very, very entertaining, with its heart in the right place, even if its head is often in orbit around jupiter. i just wish that it was not classified as science fiction. much has been written about the plausibility or otherwise of the star trek universe, but it is possible to imagine at least some of the concepts becoming real. but the sonic screwdriver? i don’t think so. doctor who’s science is pixel thin. i’m sorry about this, but i just don’t think that you can instantly transport a whole hospital onto the moon without all of the windows blowing out. oh! you use a force field, do you?! and there’s the trouble; one sentence makes it all okay. but it’s fun and occasionally wonderful, as in the episodes “blink”, “human nature” and “the family of blood”. via boingboing

leonard nimoy gets career advice from john f. kennedy



(youtube link)in this video, nimoy talks about his early years as an actor.  in 1956, he was working as a cab driver and senator john f. kennedy hired his services.  at the 2:50 mark in the video, nimoy spoke of this encounter.  here's a selection:it was only about a 10-minute ride. he said, "what are you doing out here?"i said, "i'm an actor."so he said, "a lot of competition in your business."i said, "yeah."he said, "just like mine."and we kicked it around a little bit, and then he said, "just keep in mind, there's always room for one more good one."that was very helpful.via sci fi wire

the stoners' twilight



twi-lit is apparently a parody of twilight from antarctic press:when the vampires on campus would rather bake in their weed than drink blood, life is pretty mellow. well, except for the occasional scraps with the werewolves, but as long as they vacuum up afterward, the vamps are cool with it.what's worse is the furry fan down the hall who's convinced he's a werewolf, but isn't. if the vampires didn't need him to handle the uv lights for growing their stash (vaporized limbs are a real downer), they'd drain his blood like that...if they weren't out getting more snack cakes for the munchies.via comics alliance

the firefly/fraggle rock theory



caleb goeller speculates that firefly is actually a subtle parody of fraggle rock:now, i'm not saying alan tudyk has a huge foamy nose or a tail, but hoban "wash" washburne certainly shares a few superficial characteristics with the famous eye-rolling fraggle. from his full-bodied blonde mane to a shared fashion sense, the fictional man and muppet have enough in common to merit some kind of (all-ages) fan fiction.
