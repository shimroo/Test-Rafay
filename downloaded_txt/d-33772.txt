hope



every piece of furniture donated has a story to tell…and a family who has been positively impacted by it.
































we have accomplished many things together in 2024, but the “hope” furnished means the most!




we added over 275 new social workers, case managers and family advocates to our service network - now furnishing hope by partnering with over 996 partners across more than 435 locations.

















set a new record of service impacting the lives of thousands of individuals (an estimated 7,148 households) throughout northern illinois - helping more than 9,700 children through our onsite, direct to agency, and our on-the-road service programs. 

















veteran, homeless transitioning and abuse/domestic violence accounted for 55% of all households impacted, followed by categories that include crib/pregnancy, extreme poverty, disasters, human trafficking and asylum services.

















furnished hope to individuals throughout 113 cities spanning 11 counties. - dupage county accounting for 73% of all households impacted through on-site services.

















distributed over $5,328,545 in estimated value of new and donated goods - directly benefiting  individuals and families in crisis.

















more than 3,216 babies, children and adults were moved from the floor and placed in a new crib or mattress set - providing them a safe place to sleep.
