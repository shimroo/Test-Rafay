legal math update 2023after more than 30 years, legal math is no longer available as a desktop application.  bill redak, the creator, passed away in february 2023. the features of legal math are now available as a web-based service being provided by math4law.  this new service, which is based on legal math, is named interest calculator, and it allows you to use your favorite modern browser, on pcs, apple, and android devices, to do the same tasks performed by the desktop version of legal math.  details can be found at www.math4law.com flatirons ridge software is not linked to legal math, nor can we provide support for it. there is no option to transfer your old legal math files to math4law. we use a different technology and file format, and cannot convert a legal math file to a math4law file. if you can no longer use legal math, we unfortunately cannot provide any assistance. if you want to consider math4law instead, please click the link below.
