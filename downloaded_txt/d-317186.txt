birthday
                      candle balloons can climb over two thousand
                    feet high, sail for over a mile, shine like big
                    orange stars and then finally burnout. it's like
                    having your very own rocket launch program. like
                    nasa or spacex. except cheaper, more fun and not so
                    time-consuming.

                      since it is pretty simple anyway. main rule being
                      that if the engine gets too heavy then just add

notice: all
                          balloonists are warned that they build and fly
                          fire balloons completely at their own risk,
                          and that they are completely responsible for
                          determining all risks, and for any
                          consequences that result! sky lanterns have
                          been flying for almost 2000 years. people can
                          reasonably claim - "flown by the billions" -
                          since you can only imagine the extravaganzas
                          the various emporers sponsored over the years.
                          plus the everyday sky lanterns for regular
                          holidays, important events and remembrances.
                          plus all the wishes that people have flown for
                          too. for fun or serious. where sky lanterns
                          symbolized a link between earth and heaven.
                          with the sky as the cathedral.
 remember,











                      you are completely responsible for every balloon
                      you fly!

launch ideas

-- check weather
                      - for ambient temperature - wind speed & wind
                      direction - google nyc zip code - 10106

































                        weather hour by hour note - wind direction
                      is where the wind comes from. north by north-west
                      is written nnw. balloons











                      travel in the exact opposite direction - south by
                      south-east - sse.
-- large friendly crowd
                      is always good. lighted utility candles might help
                      camouflage launch and provide good visual effect.
                      always remember to act super-friendly with any
                      higher ups. to help give the balloons time to
                      escape.
-- for faster lighting
                      & heating - high-temperature blowtorch-type
                      lighter might help speed up the lighting of the
                      fuel cell. faster the better.
-- buy cheap torch
                      lighter from smoke store - $5 - to pre-heat
                      lantern, a birthday candle "torch" might work too.
                      who knows? wrap 24+ birthday candles in
                      rubberband. then drip layers of wax onto the
                      candles to hold them together. build out the sides
                      real thick to slow down the sides from melting
                      away. can make the torch double or even triple
                      high to last longer. can also make a special torch
                      holder out of cardboard and masking tape.
-- to pre-heat lantern,
                      a can of sterno might work okay. plus possibly to
                      help light fuel cell too. can wear glove and tape
                      masking tape all around can so it does not get too
                      hot to handle.
-- heat funnel sterno
                      battery can be made with corrugated box. plus
                      sterno for heating. shape the flaps at the top
                      into a pyramid. tape top together with masking
                      tape to make heat funnel. guess a six inch opening
                      is reasonable. cut or tear air vents at bottom to
                      let air in. heat with four to six can sterno
                      battery. 

notes - sterno is the
                      only reasonably safe way i have ever been able to
                      think of to make a heat funnel sterno battery. to
                      pre-heat serious balloons. sterno is very
                      expensive. most importantly it heats with a
                      separate low flame for each can. which is good.
                      most of the other ideas are not very good.
                      especially bad is either a high flame or that
                      enable the flames to combine into a super-flame.
                      flammable liquids are also mostly bad. even close
                      to 100% isopropyl alcohol. because the flame tends
                      to get too big. plus the flame is close to
                      invisible. other possible ideas include charcoal
                      or some type of super-candle. or some formula for
                      diy sterno. also... camping stoves are generally
                      somewhat weak sources of heat. imho. but might
                      work ok. don't know. also, if you insist on
                      alcohol, 100% only. no water. lol. plus some type
                      of splash pan might work ok. guessing. like a
                      super-sized large piece of aluminum foil. reason
                      why is if the latent alcohol quickly disappears.
                      otherwise you invite yourself a fireball. or
                      thunderball. seriously. remember dumb ideas are
                      bad.

                      let's worship balloons instead. 

the french revolution
                      period from 1789 to napoleon's final defeat in
                      1815 was a time of big ideas. some good. some
                      horrible. as expressed by percy shelley, who flew
                      protest balloons over london town in around 1812.
                      he wanted the brits out of ireland. so he flew
                      fire balloons to protest. meanwhile lots of other
                      people were flying fire balloons too. with their
                      own pseudo-ideas and declarations. "this
                      balloon..."

sonnet - to a balloon,
                      laden with knowledge
                      by percy bysshe shelley - (1812)
  bright ball of
                      flame that thro the gloom of even
                      silently takest thine etherial way
                      and with surpassing glory dimmst each ray
                      twinkling amid the dark blue depths of heaven
                      unlike the fire thou bearest, soon shall thou
                      fade like a meteor in surrounding gloom
                      whilst that unquencheable is doomed to glow
                      a watch light by the patriots lonely tomb
                      a ray of courage to the opprest & poor,
                      a spark tho' gleaming on the hovel's hearth
                      which thro the tyrants gilded domes shall roar
                      a beacon in the darkness of the earth
                      a sun which oer the renovated scene
                      shall dart like truth where falshood yet has been
                       
                      there are several other documented practical uses
                      for the fire balloons in political and military
                      history. first with the original chinese inventors
                      and others for military communications. including
                      the conquest of taiwan. to communicate between
                      paramilitary in mountainous terrain. now a
                      national symbol and festival. second to signal the
                      start the failed nagpur revolt. though the
                      balloons never flew. because the ringleaders got
                      caught. third was by the french resistance. who
                      reportedly flew fire balloons against enemy
                      troops. which the enemy might have tried to shoot
                      down. followed up by cat and mouse - ditch the

rise & fall of
                        the original montgolfier paper balloons

- paper fire
                      balloons remained popular in the west throughout
                      the 19th century until around the great
                      depression. or even past wwii in some places in
                      the us. also known as fourth of july balloons. but
                      they didn't last. and got replaced in the popular
                      imagination by the

































                        airplane - also think they might have been
                      popular in bohemian circles. and that people in
                      paris liked them a lot. especially to cap off the
                      evening.

as described by julie
                      white in peoria il - the first forty years - "the automobile
                        displaces the horse and buggy, while in the sky
                        fourth-of-july fire balloons floating over the
                        city give way to airplanes."

some old people still
                      remember them. though mostly likely only as a
                      vignette. since they would have been so young back
                      then. and have not likely thought much about it
                      since then. until something reminds them. ask
                      them! but also the tradition has been kept alive
                      throughout latin america and in various places in
                      italy and greece and elsewhere. so some travelers
                      would become familiar about them through original
                      experience. 

ray bradbury wrote the
                      "martian chronicles" in 1948. apparently fire
                      balloons are scheduled to fly on mars in 2033. to
                      communicate with the last living martians.
                      otherwise bradbury describes "the

































                        fire balloons" from 1925.

"you rarely see them
                      these days, though in some countries i hear they
                      are still made and filled with warm breath from a
                      small straw fire hung beneath. but in 1925
                      illinois we still had them, and one of the last
                      memories i have of my grandfather is the last hour
                      of a fourth of july night 48 years ago when
                      grandpa and i walked out on the lawn, lit a small
                      fire and filled the pear-shaped red-white-and-blue
                      striped paper balloon full with hot air, and held
                      the flickering bright angel presence in our hands
                      - a final moment in front of a porch lined with
                      uncles and aunts and cousins and mothers and
                      fathers - and then very softly let the thing that
                      was life and light and mystery go out of our
                      fingers up on the summer air and away over the

                      paper fire balloons or montgolfiers (in italian)
                    - have been flying ever since the invention of the
                    manned hot air balloon, by the montgolfier brothers,
                    in 1783. in the united states they were known as fourth

                      lighter fluid. here
                      is a first-person account of one of those early
                      ufo balloons. meanwhile enterprising young
                      inventors invented the birthday candle balloon
                      too. and inventors are still inventing the
                      birthday candle balloon today.

fire balloons! materials,
                          construction and design
                       
                     classic dry cleaner bag balloons are
                    made with thin half-mil "dress bags," 4 1/2
                    feet tall, weighing 6/10th of an ounce. taller
                    half-mil bags also work, but are hard to find.
                    nowdays most dry cleaner bags are 3/4 mil thickness,
                    and weigh too much to fly. sometimes hobbyists tape
                    two dry cleaner bags together to make a larger bag.
                    in warm weather, dry cleaner bag balloons tend to
                    hover at first, with very little net lift. at high
                    elevations, dry cleaner bag balloons may not fly at
                    all.  
"large envelopes," in different sizes and
                      shapes, can be made with thin plastic sheeting.
                      look for 1/3 mil (8 micron) high-density
                        plastic sheeting. welds are made with a heated

                        is amazing how well this system works!
                      scotch tape repairs any weak spots. 

important - to stabilize the balloons, the bags
                      are tapered, and small ventilation holes are made.
                      this provides "negative draft," which helps
                      to reduce the de-stabilizing effects of "billowing."

"h-frames" are made by tying three balsa
                      wood sticks together with string. the "h-frame"
                      and balsa wood design is more advanced than the
                      traditional x-frame. since the two sides help keep
                      the bag away from the frame. but the h-frame does
                      not adapt very well to drinking straws. 

"x-frames" are ideally suited to drinking
                      straws. they can be made by sticking drinking
                      straws into each other, and pinning two sets
                      together with a shirt pin. 
engines are made by melting birthday
                      candles together with a heated fork.
                      alternately, dripped wax can melt the candles
                      together. the most efficient engines are single-file.
                      they get maximum oxygen and cooling area. to
                      conserve space, engines can also be made double-file.
                      here two single-files are melted together. melted
                      wax holds the engine to the frame.

note: for any type of experimental fire balloon,
                      it is not a good idea to rely too much on an
                      outside heat source. otherwise a too-heavy balloon
                      might climb up at first, then land, risking a
                      crash and burn.

fire balloons! warnings and
                          cautions:   
once a fire balloon
                        gets launched it becomes completely
                        uncontrollable. it can't be recalled. fire...
                        flying through the sky. you had better hope it
                        has a successful flight. if it crashes and
                        starts a fire and the police get involved then
                        it is important to confess. since it can only
                        get worse if the police have to track you down.
                        but balloons that crash in trees that go out?
                        forget about it. also to remember that the sky
                        does not catch on fire. so hope the balloons go
                        up really really high. then burn out. then they
                        are safe. since nothing happened.
                          


                    people under eighteen years old should have parental
                    permission to fly powered model hot air balloons.
                    remember that fire balloons might be considered to
                    be fireworks, and potential fire hazards. do not use
                    any fuel that does not easily blow out.  
 do not fly fire balloons in any fire danger
                      areas, especially if they are hilly or
                      mountainous, or if it is windy or gusting. do not
                      fly any faulty or damaged fire balloons. avoid
                        crash and burns. balloonists are obligated
                      not to cause any fire danger. also, fire balloons
                      should not be made too large, in case they land
                      directly in automobile traffic. 
 the faa prohibits operating any "unmanned
free

































                        balloon" in a hazardous manner, per faa-dot

































                        101.7 - the faa also prohibits including any
                      significant amounts of metal, on devices
                      that fly to altitudes where there may be aircraft.
                      do not fly wire frame fire balloons. they can be
                      dangerous to turbine engine aircraft. they can
                      also short-circuit electrical power lines.  
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                  

do not fly fire balloons near airports.
                      especially avoid active takeoff and landing
                      patterns. avoid flying fire balloons near any
                      other prohibited or restricted areas without
                      permission, as appropriate, unless it is very late
                      at night -- and doesn't matter.
build flightworthy balloons, according to the
                      conditions. avoid flying fire balloons in winds
                      above ten miles per hour, especially if gusting.
                      avoid damaging balloons or crashing them into
                      obstacles. avoid antagonizing the police or
                      neighbors. monitor the complete flight of every
                      balloon. be responsible, and use good judgement. try












                        to make every flight a success!. 
as long as candle powered fire balloons don't
                      crash and burn, there is not a big fire danger.
                      the plastic bag does not appear likely to become a
                      serious hazard either, as long it isn't very large
                      and it doesn't land directly in automobile traffic
                      -------------------------------------. 
                    fire balloons launch best at sea level, in cool
                    weather, with very little wind and no strong gusts.
                    for local wind speed, visit yahoo weather.
                    the calmest weather is generally early evening, late
                    evening and dawn. at sunset and dawn, the red of the
                    sun can make the balloons shimmer. for group
                    launches try three balloons. "best of sights, overflight."

                    shelley was also famous as a great poet. previously
                    he flew fire balloons over london town. this was in
                    around 1812, when he was 20 years old. to protest
                    english colonial rule over ireland. apparently he
                    also attached sheets of his own writing. some might
                    have been banned. shelley apparently also enclosed
                    sheets of writing in bottles. then presumably
                    floated them away or left them in places where they
                    were likely to be found by friendlies. this was a
                    common method of protest at the time.

                     at the time europe was recovering from the
                    after-effects of the 1789 french revolution. which
                    caused chaos, class warfare and civil war for
                    several years. this lead to napoleon. who conquered
                    most of northern europe at one time or another.
                    until he was finally beaten for good in 1815. one
                    year prior. this 25 year disruption largely ended
                    feudalism in europe. which was characterized by most
                    of the people living as peasants or serfs. people
                    were henceforth emancipated. and were free to live
                    their lives as they chose. this was also the start
                    of the industrial revolution. people visualized new
                    societies and wondered what they would look like and
                    how they would be created. it can be said to be the
                    beginning of the modern age. which was characterized
                    by the rise of both industry and the nation-state.
                    most notably the independence of the nations of
                    germany and italy in around 1870.

                      bysshe shelley - (1792-1822) -- a poet is a
                    nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to cheer
                    its own solitude with sweet sounds. -- love is free.
                    to promise for ever to love the same woman is not
                    less absurd than to promise to believe the same
                    creed. such a vow in both cases excludes us from all
                    inquiry.

                     -- a man, to be greatly good, must imagine
                    intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself
                    in the place of another and of many others; the
                    pains and pleasures of his species must become his
                    own.

                     -- when my cats aren't happy, i'm not happy.
                    not because i care about their mood but because i
                    know they're just sitting there thinking up ways to
                    get even. -- first our pleasures die - and then our
                    hopes, and then our fears - and when these are dead,
                    the debt is due - dust claims dust - and we die too.
                    -- only nature knows how to justly proportion to the
                    fault the punishment it deserves.

                    a daring villain would have rendered him useful in
                    society, had that society been well organized.

                     -- how dangerous is the acquirement of
                    knowledge and how much happier that man is who
                    believes his native town to be the world, than he

                    allow.

                     -- if our impulses were confined to hunger,
                    thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now
                    we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance

                    -------------------------------------- 

                    summary - when riding a motorcycle too fast into a
                    hairpin turn there are basically two strategies
                    about what to do to avoid possible injury and death
                    and destruction.

                     risky strategy - go over the top - speed up
                    and drop down into the turn and hope you don't hit
                    sand or gravel or the rail or fence or curb or
                    ditch. if the bike crashes it will typically flip
                    over in the opposite direction and fling the rider
                    high into the air at high speed. it is a very
                    dangerous strategy. but does sometimes avoid
                    crashes. by the amazing ability of the expert rider
                    to manouver a high speed turn. but the crashes are
                    very spectacular and deadly too. typically both the
                    bike and rider get completely destroyed. this is
                    what the obamian
                    administration is doing right now.

                     conservative strategy - prepare to drop the
                    bike - slow down for the crash as much as possible
                    while still trying to make the turn and find an
                    opportunity. then do everything possible to defend
                    against the crash. typical move is to lay down the
                    bike in towards the turn and then try to ride the
                    bike like a sled for as long as possible. then to
                    try to treat getting thrown off the bike like it is
                    some kind of great leap forward. and live to fight
                    another day. possibly with a reasonably undamaged
                    bike too. this is what the republicans and tea party
                    is proposing to do. for america to survive. it is
                    also the less dicey strategy of the two. and with
                    greater promise for long-term success.

                    of all.

                    educating people, whereas the secret of tyranny is
                    in keeping them ignorant. 

                    -- napoleon bonaparte -- when small men attempt
                    great enterprises, they always end by reducing them
                    to the level of their mediocrity.

                    ward of the european madhouse, and quite possibly it
                    will prove to be the ward for particularly violent
                    cases.

                    dissatisfaction and discontent ... he must create a
                    mechanism that can drain off the underlying guilt
                    for having accepted the previous situation for so
                    long a time. out of this mechanism, a new community
                    organization arises ... the job then is getting the
                    people to move, to act, to participate; in short, to
                    develop and harness the necessary power to
                    effectively conflict with the prevailing patterns
                    and change them.

                     beyond the shadow of the ship
                    i watched the water-snakes
                    they moved in tracks of shining white
                    and when they reared, the elfish light
                    fell off in hoary flakes.
                     within the shadow of the ship
                    i watched their rich attire:
                    blue, glossy green, and velvet black,
                    they coiled and swam; and every track
                    was a flash of golden fire.
                     o happy living things! no tongue
                    their beauty might declare
                    a spring of love gushed from my heart,
                    and i blessed them unaware
                    sure my kind saint took pity on me,
                    and i blessed them unaware.
                     the selfsame moment i could pray;
                    and from my neck so free
                    the albatross fell off, and sank
                    like lead into the sea.
