introduction to the cavalier king charles
the cavalier king charles   spaniel is a delightfully affectionate, intelligent  little dog that repays his owner's care and attention with loving   devotion. as a breed, their temperament is gentle, they   are happy,   outgoing dogs who want to love you and be loved, to run and play in a safe and secure home.
the cavalier king spaniel is a direct decendant  of the many spaniels seen in many of the toy spaniel paintings of the 16, 17 & 18th century most predominantly associated with king charles ii or otherwise known as the spaniel gentile a popular breed of the time. 
however, due to breeding for fashion with smaller nosed breeds, such as the pug during the late victorian age, the cavaliers dropped in numbers . it wasn't until the early 19th century when a few enthusiasts such as the american gentleman    mr roswell eldridge, attempted to bring back the longer nosed spaniels. he endeavoured to renew interest  in the breed, by  offering a prize for the crufts   show   in 1926 for the best dog and the best   bitch  in a class for blenheim spaniels of the old type, as shown in the   pictures  of charles ii time.  
since the 19th century this little breed has grown in popularity continually until today and is one of the most popular toy breeds in the united kingdom.
