past me 
the name is junior, with the 'r' behind. 
i love my daily smokes and booze! :d
wkends are usually spent at parties getting my liver intoxicated.
i don't believe in friendships as they don't last long; maybe as long as my marlboro menthols.
i know clearly what i want & when i want it.
sex, drugs, rock & roll!
