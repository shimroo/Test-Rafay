central ontario region

we believe that if a group or a region is successful, all within are successful. for central ontario the catalyst that binds the region are tourists wanting to visit, people that leave other areas to settle here, real estate that meets and exceeds expectations along with great unique tourist attractions.


view the map and you can see that the trent severn waterway (ttsw) is the backbone of the region. it weaves and touches towns and villages that prosper and are in demand by people wishing to settle. many other attractions are available as well. farmer's markets, parks, first nations, festivals and the list can go on. 


what is the reason you ask for the agents ads at the top of the pages. simply, you want a local agent to address your real estate needs. they understand the value of properties in their respective areas plus all the pros and cons. for example does an agent from toronto understand the unique markets in the outlying counties? probably not as well as local. 



just like the ttsw (ttsw.ca) binds the regions we want central ontario and it's group of websites to bind the real estate market into a unique experience for seller and buyer alike. when it comes to web sites we will use the following to assist centralontario.com. thetrentsevernwaterway.com,  kawartha.com, ontariocottages.com, cottagecountryontario.com and canadianexposure.com to give it a broader view.
