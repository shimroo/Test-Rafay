alpine lumber : employee owned & operated since 1963
employee ownership makes our attention to detail and provision of quality products and services unparalleled.  from our 17 uniquely tailored lumberyards, to the detailed nuances of our millwork and truss operations, we pride ourselves on building relationships through integrity, timeliness, efficiency, and quality.  our 100% employee-owned company lives and thrives on this.
we supply.  you build.
we’ve been around a while.  in fact, we’ve been supporting builders and their communities since 1963.  founded in englewood, colorado by the kurtz family, our company was created on the simple goal of providing unparalleled service to colorado’s professional building community.  and, as a 100% employee-owned company, that couldn’t ring more true today. each one of us avidly works to support your needs, because as employee-owners, we genuinely care.  from your specifications to our on-time, in-full delivery of superior products, our goal is to ensure your needs are met. 
that guiding philosophy has allowed aipine to successfully expand throughout colorado, and into northern new mexico. including colorado and new mexico lumber yards , we currently operate sixteen builder-oriented yards, three aipine truss shops, three aipine millwork operations (prehung doors, windows, hardware, and trim), a pre-built stair shop, fastframe™ engineered wood center, and rocky mountain reload (rail-serviced material handling).

what people say about us
jeffrey qualterialpine lumber has been a great supplier of d.r. horton colorado for over 20 years. d.r. horton values alpine as a supplier for many reasons including alpine’s quick response time, attention to detail, and overall “can do” attitude, which is why alpine supplies lumber, trusses and interior trim material to d.r. horton colorado. having reliable vendors like alpine has been key to d.r. horton colorado’s success as a homebuilder.jeffrey qualteriv.p. operations, d.r. hortondave paganoone of the key components in any business is getting everyone to buy into how your team operates. no system is ever perfect, but if you can work together to achieve the goals that you set out to do, then you can have a successful business. working with alpine lumber has proven to be a successful partnership from the day troy k. showed up at our job site on newton st. they helped us with getting our lumber and framing systems in order and have been a true partner ever since. it’s great to have someone that requests your input on how they can better help us be successful, as well as what they can be improving on. being able to reflect on what is and is not working on a regular basis and following through on those commitments is what makes everyone more successful. many thanks to alpine lumber for being a true partner in the success of our business! dave paganog.j. gardner homesron beatyi deal with alpine lumber in farmington on a regular, almost daily basis. i find all of their staff, from mike in the yard, tina in sales, dave in truss design and roger as manager to be extremely professional and helpful, willing to go the extra mile not only for my construction needs, but those of my customers also. i would recommend them highly for your construction needs as well.ron beaty president, mastercraft buildersjohn kurowskialpine lumber door and trim has been our go-to supplier for quite a few years. it all started with the outside sales person, randy cross, who is the best door and trim representative we have had in our 40 years in our home building business. we are very thankful randy called us. but we understand a supplier must have a fine team to build and keep a strong relationship. so we would like to thank those on your team that we do not get to meet and know. so here is a big thanks to your staff in accounting, purchasing, administrative, warehouse, drivers, delivery, shop technicians, management, and special thanks to randy for making us a happy customer for so many years. you are the best.john kurowskikurowski custom homes & remodelingbenjamin somrakalpine lumber has been a major key success factor to our company’s rapid growth and success. to have such a knowledgeable and professional source for all things building right in our backyard is a spoil i don’t take for granted. they provide me with all of my lumber and building products from foundation to finish, and to top it off, their pricing is competitive and fair. now our company is at a point where they are our go-to vendor and we don’t even bother looking elsewhere – a special bond that we do not have with other vendors. to say that i would be where i am without alpine would be a lie. benjamin somrakpresident and founder, somrak concept and structure, inc.

when achieving excellence, every minute counts. our entirely employee-owned business depends on this to exist and prosper. our 16 specially designed yards, as well as the intricate details of our millwork and truss operations, are just a few examples of how we take great pleasure in our honesty, punctuality, efficiency, and quality.
we have existed for a while. in reality, since 1963, we have helped local builders and their communities. the kurtz family established our business in englewood, colorado, with the straightforward mission of offering the state’s professional building community unmatched service. and it couldn’t be more true now that our firm is owned entirely by our employees.
