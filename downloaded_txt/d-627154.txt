proven customer satisfaction
"i just had to say something about jas. i bought a ring mounting and my stone online. jas examined both
                with no problems. i then went to a place recommended by a friend to have the stone set. when i brought
                the ring back to jas to have it examined, they told me that there were some new chips in the side of the
                stones. so i brought the diamond back to the person who set it and they denied causing or seeing any
                chips. jas went all out for me. they called the place where i had the ring set and told them what had
                happened. the person who set the stone ended up replacing the chipped side stones for free. then jas
                examined the finished product with approval." - rachel
