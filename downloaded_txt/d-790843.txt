a personal tribute to david kiltie



david kiltie, mbe, aka
		
		mr. maybole, was an extraordinary community servant. he was born in 
		maybole and lived there faithfully serving the community all his life as 
		attested by his many civic minded colleagues and their many accolades.
david was my good friend and partner in creating 
		this website for maybole. in the early days of the internet there were 
		few scottish towns with a website. i was interested in finding out more 
		about my scottish family history and david wanted the world to know 
		about the vibrant community life and rich history of maybole. over many 
		years david and i exchanged messages and images to document all that was 
		maybole, past and present. i live in the us and made several wonderful 
		trips to my ancestral town with my family, where david, his family and 
		friends greeted and treated us with the legendary scottish hospitality.
		
words cannot express my gratitude for the years of 
		friendship and collaboration that i enjoyed with this notable of 
		notables, david kiltie, m.b.e, jp.
