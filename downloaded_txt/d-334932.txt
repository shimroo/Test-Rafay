    zen aquatic's custom ponds & water features
 zen aquatics is a full service pond and water features company, with an emphasis on artful pond design and installation, pond renovations and pond maintenance. your pond design is going to dictate not only how your pond will look, but how much work you will need to do in order to maintain it. the design of the pond will also significantly affect the health of any fish in the pond. high quality pond design pays much greater dividends in the larger picture of property value. while a greater investment is likely required for the best pond designers, that investment will pay for itself in two ways: reduced pond construction expense and much greater property value for very natural and beautiful ponds. an average pond is a common commodity with a worth roughly equal to its replacement cost. an exceptional pond is a rare feature that is difficult to duplicate; thus there is a demand which raises property value well beyond the cost of pond construction.call us today at (760) 568-6133 to get started on your beautiful new pond or water feature! 
 koi, fish supplies, & pond plants
   we have domestic and import koi available. we have all kinds of pond supplies to keep your pond running smoothly and well-maintained. we have a variety of pond plants available during season.
