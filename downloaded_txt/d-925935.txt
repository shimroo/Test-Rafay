for as long as there have been hay bales,
there have been people tasked with bucking them onto a truck or into a barn. but there’s a better, easier, far more profitable way to never touch a bale again: our extensive line of bale accumulators and handlers for small square bales, large square bales and everything in-between. each is virtually indestructible. and each can eliminate 100% of hand labor. not 80%. not 90%. 100%. no wonder our products have become the industry gold standard over the past 40 years.

quotes






















virtually trouble-free.
“i own two steffen systems accumulators and absolutely love them. they’re virtually trouble-free and work great. i’ve tried everything else before purchasing them and would happily talk to anyone who’s even thinking of buying something else. nothing runs like a steffen!”
– jeremy floyd, ky






going strong since '97.
"i bought my steffen model 950 in 1997 and have had virtually no issues with it. ever."


– kenneth cox, tx






rita was no match.
"when hurricane rita hit back in 2005, my whole farm was under six-feet of water — including my steffen accumulator. but when the water receded and it dried out, it went right back to work like nothing ever happened and has been going strong ever since. i process around 20,000 bales a year, so i wish i could say that about the rest of my equipment."
- dan poole, la






never going back.
“my steffen systems hay accumulator and grapple are easy-to-use, well-built and save us a tremendous amount of labor. i’d hate to think what it would mean if we had to go back to the old original way of handling hay.”
– nathan newkirk, in






finally, the right equipment.
“over the years, i experimented with different ways of putting up square hay bales and was never completely satisfied with any of them. in fact, i was about to roll all of my hay when i saw a steffen accumulator perform and was impressed. after buying one, i can say i finally have haying equipment that really works for me.”
– john craigmyle, ky




  









back in 1969, as he worked his hay fields in oregon’s often-rainy willamette valley, farmer stan steffen was growing frustrated. the inferior quality and performance delivered by his haying equipment meant he lost more and more of his crop to rain. in order to get his hay properly baled and stored, he needed a better, more reliable, more efficient bale handling system.
so he built his own — based on strong christian values. that was the beginning of steffen systems. and what started as a welder in stan’s hands has since grown into a company that leads the world in automated, high quality hay handling equipment. 
stan continues to operate his own family’s hay farm and exports more than 15,000 tons of hay products to asia each year. as for the manufacturing side of the business, stan’s son, david, took the reins years back and has continued to innovate and expand the company’s product line while retaining the same values and commitment to hard work.
today, steffen systems has equipment operating in all fifty states, eight canadian provinces and countries all over the globe including: england, ireland, spain, portugal, france, italy, norway, sweden, russia, moldova, romania, greece, egypt, puerto rico, mexico, chile, argentina, ethiopia, new zealand, australia, pakistan, korea, japan, taiwan, china, saudi arabia, and the united arab emirates.
