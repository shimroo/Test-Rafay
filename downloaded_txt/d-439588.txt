creativity training





creativity isn't a nice-to-have, it's an essential for business survival. we can help with books, self-run courses and in-house workshops.



















       books and ebooks
    





	the most cost effective way to give your staff the tools to solve problems and generate new ideas, books and ebooks can provide an instant hit to enhance creative capabilities.

       self-run courses
    




haven’t got the budget for a training course? we now have one our most popular bite-sized courses, the creativity kickstart on dvd or as a self-run course with powerpoint. without an introduction, using creativity techniques can seem strange and unnatural. this 1 hour dvd is the perfect introduction to familiarise yourself with business creativity, to be able to make practical use of creativity techniques.

       bite-sized courses
    





	time for training is increasingly tight. it takes real dedication to take a whole day off work. these sessions, lasting one to two hours, are designed to fit around the working day as breakfast or lunchtime events, or to take up a manageably small chunk of working time. we have been running these bite size events since 1995 and they continue to be amongst our most popular (and cost effective) sessions. most can run with any size audience.

       full day courses
    





	sometimes you need to become immersed in a subject. our full day sessions are aimed at those who will benefit most from the expertise, or who will act as ambassadors to spread the word. most run with 10 to 20 people – that’s still as little as £100 each for a day’s training.
