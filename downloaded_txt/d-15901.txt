yes, in answer to all those of you who have asked if linda has retired - yes she has 'semi-retired'...although she is still very much in the background - offering advice, information, and help to 'linda's little helpers' who are still beavering away in various countries -  trying to help you with recommendations and advice.    as before, we are here to help and provide advice for you regarding dentistry,
cosmetic surgery, stem cell treatment, gastric surgery, orthopaedic surgery, and 
other treatments.  after all those years of hard work providing her unbeatable professional advice (a true 'legend' in her field!) she has more than earned the right to start enjoying life - and she most certainly now  is!  although she is still in the background she is no longer available to speak to former and new patients - but we definitely are!
many of
you will either know someone, or have someone in the family with hearing problems/difficulties.  we can now offer a solution at an excellent privately owned
 english speaking hearing clinic in budapest,  that provides a very personal individual  and efficient service  providing hearing tests and state of the
art hearing aids tailored to each patients specific needs.  the prices are much lower
than in the uk for the same first-class and proven aids, and those who have  already visited the clinic are delighted with the
outcome.    if you would like further details and prices, please contact us at:  carolyn@lindabriggs.net.
also, if thinking of gastric surgery, do look on the website - this hospital in latvia provides not only truly professional and great expertise - but takes superb care of its patients before, during and after surgery, and for their professionalism and knowledge it is superb value for money!   patients who made the decision to go there (instead of a very popular and cheap country) are very glad they chose this hospital instead! also available in latvia, organised again by the wonderful ilva, is orthopaedic surgery with a superb rehabilitation package - again many delighted patients! why wait years for the nhs or pay huge costs privately in the uk when this option at an affordable price (and in a beautiful country) is available?
