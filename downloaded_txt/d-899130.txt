update regarding unpaid fpo mail boxes

								as of 10 feb a  number of fpo boxes have gone unpaid for cy 25. as of that date those boxes have been closed. rao will no longer accept delivery of mail to those boxes. should the owners of those boxes wish to renew, the annual renewal is p5100, +p100 for jan and p100 for feb. this is a particularly bad time to allow your box to expire as we are receiving proof of life letters from both ssa and va. failure to respond to their letters may result in suspension of benefits. also have begun to see 1099r tax forms for cy24. it is advisable to take action now!

whatâs happening at rao

								we are happy to announce that veterans can now come to rao to seek assistance in registering for the i d me application. there are some very strict rules which must be followed. during the recent outreach we asked the va rep to tutor 2 of our staff on the procedures. they did so well they assisted va at the outreach in getting a big number of vets registered. now we can do it here in the office. we will begin this offering tomorrow 5 feb from 11:00 to 14:00, also will be doing it on 6 feb. and each wed and thursday until the deadline for registration is reached. a recent change to the deadline was extended to 4 march 2025.

dear veterans and outreach partners

								we regret to inform you that representatives from the veterans benefits administration (vba) will not be able to join the subic outreach scheduled for tomorrow, january 29, 2025, due to unforeseen administrative orders. we sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and for any disruption this may cause to your plans.

								we understand the importance of having vba representation during this outreach and deeply regret this abrupt change. in the meantime, representatives from the va manila outpatient clinic will be present at the event as planned. they will be available to assist with your healthcare-related and administrative concerns to include inquiries on my healthevet and id.me account.

								thank you for your understanding and patience as we navigate these adjustments. if you have any questions or require additional assistance, please feel free to reach out to us.

great news!
								its official, as of today 16 august 2018, ace/baypointe is authorized to accept tricare patients under the preferred provider category. you will have to check with the hmo office to ensure your dr. is also on the preferred provider list. there are currently 31 dr's who are, but check to be sure or you will have to pay the dr's fees. 
								and oh by the way, please resist the urge to repeat the bad news bears (you know the ones who have their names stenciled on the back of their bar stool) who are spreading rumors about ace baypointe and medical city clark suspending fmp due to non payment. it didnt happen! medical city ortigas did due to non payment by fmp. come to find out they gave fmp the wrong mailing address to which fmp mailed the payments. all is fixed now and they have withdrawn the suspension.ã 
								old saying better to be quiet and be thought a fool, than opening mouth and leave no doubt. 
								i have taken the opportunity to compile a list of what drs, and specialties at ace baypointe, to the best of my knowledge are also certified as preferred providers. the hospital is in the process of adding to this list. as you all are aware this list changes without notice, so before getting treatment it would be to your benefit to check with the hospital hmo office to ensure the dr you will receive treatment from is in fact still certified as preferred. the hmo can be reached at 047-250-6070 ext 283 or 507.

fmp/tricare
we continue to see vets who are receiving eob's and checks for treatment at medical city and baypointe (ace). please be aware you should not cash these checks. they should be given to the hospitals. should you cash the check a few things can happen, 1st fmp or tricare may demand repayment, if you don't they can notify the irs and either a garnishment or 1099 will be received and they get their money in the end possibly including interest. it can also be placed on your credit report. secondly, you may be refused future treatment at the hospitals as you have an outstanding balance. worst of all we may lose the hospitals as providers for fmp or tricare. sure wouldn't want to be the guy who causes all your fellow vets to lose that, they might be a little pissed when they find out it was you! you know how quickly word spreads around here!

videos
just want to draw your attention to some very useful videos being offered for free through va by psycharmor. view their catalog at psychoarmor institute.

urgent update: reimbursment checks:
it appears there is a malfunction with both tricare and fmp regarding reimbursement checks. they incorrectly recently have been sending the checks to the veteran vice the provider. both have been notified this is the incorrect way to handle these checks! if you receive a check for a claim that was filed by the hospital, please do not cash it. the hospitals participation was negotiated so that the hospital would receive payment. if they do not we will lose their services. the payment must be taken to the hospital and signed over to them to be encashed.





special thank you to police station 6 barrio baretto for notification of recently deceased american citizen! their handling of situation was extremely professional, thanks spo de leon.
