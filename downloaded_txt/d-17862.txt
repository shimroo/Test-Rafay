an entelechy is that which realizes or makes actual, what is otherwise merely potential.  this entelechy is ragged because no process is ever complete.  there is always a further unfolding.

quotation of the moment:"terror is as much a part of the concept of truthas runniness is of
the concept of jam.we wouldn't like jam if it didn't, by its very nature, ooze.we wouldn't like truth if it wasn't sticky,if, from
time to time, it didn't ooze blood."—jean baudrillard

journal fragments
from no particular time or place -- just lifted from my journals...



an essay: "dark currents in the main stream"
do you read tacky mass-market horror paperbacks with embossed black-and-red covers, or are you above all that?  whether you read horror fiction or not, you may be interested in the question of whether genre horror is substantively different from mainstream literature with horrific themes.


fear and loathing
section devoted to horror literature (with some stuff on horror films and true crime): short essays & reviews , reading lists, mail-order info, horrific art, dialogues, etc.


true crime is ugly (but fun to read about)
a section devoted to true crime books


a patti smith babelogue
"i am an american artist, and i have no guilt."  the punk priestess who first 
hit the scene in the 70's is back again with four recent albums, a book of prose poetry, a complete collection of her lyrics, and rock-n-roll energy to spare. come into patti's world...


shark mania
sharks are another obsession of mine.  they are beautiful, elegant 
animals, and they are desperately in need of protection from overfishing.  this 
site has lots of pictures, and is a good jumping-off point for exploring shark
pages on the web.


a tribute to clark ashton smith
clark ashton smith was a poet, fantasist, and artist who is best known for
the hundred-and-some weird tales he wrote in the '30s.  he was the last american member of the décadent movement (e.g., baudelaire, verlaine, rimbaud, machen, vernon lee, beardsley), and a close friend and collaborator of h. p. lovecraft.
