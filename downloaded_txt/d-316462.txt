why mcelroy deutsch?
most often, people engage an attorney, not a law firm. so we hire and nurture attorneys who are smart, experienced, responsive, and who share our firm's values.
in turn, our attorneys and clients all benefit from the longstanding trust, respect and success that mcelroy deutsch has earned as a firm.
we think those are two great reasons why you should work with us.
our values



“the law is evolving from a profession, to a business. so we work to keep professionalism and collegiality at the highest level, and not to be driven by dollars.”

edward b. deutsch
