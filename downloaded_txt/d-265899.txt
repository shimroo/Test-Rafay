advancing sustainable development research and practice at harvard kennedy school and beyond, while tackling challenges that affect our planet to ensure everyone has a chance at a better future.











what is sustainable development?development is sustainable when it enhances people’s well-being in the here and now without diminishing the capacity of people elsewhere or in the future to improve their own lives. learn more about the evolution of thinking about sustainability in this essay by ssp program scholars.















what is sustainability science?“sustainability science” is one term for many contributions by the research community to the pursuit of sustainable development. the field is defined by the problems it tackles, not the methods it uses.  sustainability science draws on work from across the arts and sciences, law, engineering and medicine.learn more about the field of sustainability science in this review by ssp program scholars.  sustainability science program at harvard kennedy schoolthe sustainability science program began in 2006 to support research on how interactions between society and nature affect human well-being. based at harvard kennedy school’s mossavar-rahmani center for business and government, it promotes university-wide, collaborative research projects that aim to meet our needs for water, energy, food, and health while also protecting the planet.

      academic opportunities and degree programs in sustainability
      



programs at harvardif you’re interested in sustainability, we encourage you to explore programs within harvard. harvard kennedy school offers several graduate degrees. undergrads can consider a concentration in environmental sciences and public policy. harvard extension school offers a sustainability masters degree program. hks students and faculty study a range of topics that focus on environmental and development concerns:doctoral dissertationshks master in public administration: international development papershks master in public policy: policy analysis exercisesfind courses related to climate and sustainability on the hks climate course guide and the salata institute for climate and sustainability website.finding degree programs in sustainability the number of programs offering degrees in (or closely related to) sustainable development has ballooned over the past decade.  the association for the advancement of sustainability in higher education offers resources for students pursuing sustainability in their studies and is a great place to start the search for relevant programs. networking to link researchers and practitionersthere are a growing number of networks for linking researchers and practitioners. here are two to consider: the international conference on sustainable development (icsd) provides a forum for academia, government, civil society, un agencies, and the private sector to come together to share practical solutions to achieve the sustainable development goals (sdgs).the national sustainability society (us) seeks to build an organization for shared, integrated, and globally flourishing professional practice and research for sustainability. it is guided and inspired by the vision of a future where all people and nature can thrive with dignity.









      sustainability science literature 
      



sustainability science spans many disciplines, interests, and organizations, making it challenging to stay updated on research. in 2020, scholars in the sustainability science program analyzed the field, identifying top research programs and journals, and creating keyword searches to find relevant studies efficiently. this analysis serves as a starting point for anyone wanting to keep up with the field, though maintaining a complete list of literature is difficult due to its wide scope and rapid growth.for a “big picture” view of the existing literature, we suggest:start with the comprehensive review of the relevant literature by sustainability science program scholars (mentioned above) that was originally published in 2020.continue by scanning abstracts of the review articles published each year in the open access journal annual review of environment and resources, which has become a review of sustainable development.
