why hire us vs. self-managing




you’ll make more money – and spend less time maintaining your investment.
									some people assume that property management is expensive - but that’s not the case at all. you will
									actually make more money in the long run due to better quality tenants that stay longer and less
									damage or repairs to deal with.
								

eliminate the constant run around!
									it can feel like a full time job dealing with repairs, complaints, collecting rent and coordinating
									vendors – and a constant state of stress. transferring these responsibilities to a good property
									manager allows you to enjoy the benefits without spending all your free time working.
								

better screening process = better tenants!
									because of our application tools and extensive resources, we can screen more tenants, and with more
									filters. we often have a waiting list of potential renters.

paul l.






portland property management services

					“my wife and i rented through jim mcneely for the last four years and just had our lease canceled due to landlord selling the house. we had a good experience with the management company. they were usually quite prompt with any service requests and sent very good companies when service was needed. jessica kailiuli and her kai group, our property manager, was always great to work with, professional and honest. we took very good care of the house and left it in better condition than when we moved in. jessica noticed and appreciated that and sent us a full refund of our security deposit a week earlier than expected.”
