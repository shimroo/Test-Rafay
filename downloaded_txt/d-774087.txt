tom davis has tapped into the heart of god with his passion for healing. both his music and his understanding of scripture are sure to help release the people of god into an inheritance, for healing is the birthright of every believer. i highly recommend “the healing” to all who hunger for more! bill johnsonsenior pastor of bethel church

    overcome your enemy today


 november 24, 2021

be sober [well balanced and self-disciplined], be alert and cautious at all times. that enemy of yours, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion [fiercely hungry], seeking someone to devour. 1 peter 5:8 amp                                                                                                            these days there is so much teaching about how powerful the enemy is that people are giving in to the fear and throwing in towel! that can change today!                                                                                                            many years ago i spoke with a person who had hunted for lion in africa. the professional hunter, who was the guide, explained to this person how lions often hunt.                                                                                                            he said, a lion will locate a vulnerable looking victim and while remaining out of sight begin to walk in circles around and around the potential meal. while doing so the lion will roar as it wags its head back and forth to make his roar sound bigger and as though there are several lions roaring.                                                                                                            as the prey hears the sound of the overwhelming roar coming from what seems like everywhere, it finally gives up and lays down consumed with paralyzing fear. the lion then walks in and you know the rest…                                                                                                                         now read                                              1 peter 5:8                                               again with this in mind. he is like a roaring lion. it doesn’t say he is!                                              he attacks the victim after fear has replaced faith in the believer.                                                                                                            2 timothy 1:7 says                                               ; for god did not give us a spirit of timidity or cowardice or fear, but [he has given us a spirit] of                                              power and of love                                               and of sound judgment and personal discipline [abilities that result in a calm, well-balanced mind and self-control].                                                                                                                        let god’s truth fill your heart today with power, love and a sound mind!                                                                                                            much love,                                                                                                            tom davis

 november 24, 2021

you have made me spiritually alive together with christ (for by his grace—his undeserved favor and mercy—i have been saved from god’s judgment)and in him i have been made complete [achieving spiritual stature through christ],for the law of the spirit of life [which is] in christ jesus [the law of our new being] has set me free from the law of sin and of death.                                  i will be far from [even the thought of] oppression, for i will not fear,                                                                   ﻿                                                                  for christ purchased my freedom and redeemed me from the curse of the law and its condemnation by becoming a curse for me—for it is written, “cursed is everyone who hangs [crucified] on a tree (cross)                                                                                     he (jesus) who was born of god [carefully] keeps and protects me, and the evil one does not touch me. i have the mind of christ [to be guided by his thoughts and purposes].                                                                                     and the peace of god [that peace which reassures the heart, that peace] which transcends all understanding, [that peace which] stands guard over my heart and my mind in christ jesus is mine.                                                                                     these signs will accompany me as i have believed: in jesus’ name i will cast out demons, i will speak in new tongues;i will pick up serpents, and if i drink anything deadly, it will not hurt me; i will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.”                                                                                     as i give, and it will be given to me. they will pour into my lap a good measure—pressed down, shaken together, and running over [with no space left for more].                                                                                     for i have overcome and conquered the enemy because of the blood of the lamb and because of the word of my testimony…                                                                                     i am a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, a [special] people for god’s own possession, so that i may proclaim the excellencies [the wonderful deeds and virtues and perfections] of him who called me out of darkness into his marvelous light.                                                                                     amen!                                                                                     much love,                                                                                                            tom davis

 




   

    my prayer for you


 november 24, 2021

my father in heaven, holy is your name. your kingdom come, your will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.                                    i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made;                                    where can i go from your spirit? where can i flee from your presence? if i go up to the heavens, you are there; if i make my bed in the depths, you are there…even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.                                    how precious to me are your thoughts, god! how vast is the sum of them! were i to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand – when i awake, i am still with you.                                    i pray that you would bless me and enlarge my border, and that your hand might be with me, and you would keep me from evil so it might not hurt me!                                                                                     that you will grant me a spirit of wisdom and revelation [of insight into mysteries and secrets] in the [deep and intimate] knowledge of you,                                                                                                            by having the eyes of my heart flooded with light, so that i can know and understand the hope to which you have called me, and how rich is his glorious inheritance in the saints (your set-apart ones),                                                                                                            for i know the plans you have for me, lord. they are plans for good and not for disaster, to give me a future and a hope.                                                                                                            i will not be afraid [there is nothing to fear], for you are with me; i will not look around in terror and be dismayed, for you are my god. you will strengthen and harden me to difficulties, yes, you will help me; yes, you will hold me up and retain me with your [victorious] right hand of rightness and justice.                                                                                                            and this is the promise that you have promised me—eternal life. for you will contend with him who contends with me, and you will save my children. no good thing will you withhold from those who walk along your paths.                                                                                                            and you, my god shall supply all my needs according to your riches in glory by christ jesus.”                                    you will keep me in perfect peace, because my mind is stayed on you, because i trust in you.”                                    i love you, for the lord my god is with me wherever i go.                                                                                     much love,                                                                                     tom
