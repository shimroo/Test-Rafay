					the roger thayer stone center for latin american studies

				























 













a comprehensive program with faculty in almost every region and discipline essential to understanding latin americathe stone center administers interdisciplinary b.a., m.a, and ph.d. programs in which students may put together curricular selected from several departments or professional schools. many students have found that such a program gives them flexibility and better access to the full resources of the university than can be had within the confines of a single department. the center hosts a wide range of conferences, symposia, film series, and other activities. it also coordinates a number of the university's many research and study programs in latin america.

2025 summer programs






the stone center is committed to promoting international experiences for students to gain understanding, acquire knowledge, and develop skills for living in a globally interdependent and culturally diverse world. we administer a portfolio of faculty-led summer programs designed to bring participants closer to the region’s languages, peoples, and histories through intensive class work and stimulating explorations. our 2025 programs take students to cuba, brazil, guatemala for immersion in spanish, portuguese, and mayan languages, communities, and cultures. non-tulane students are welcome to apply to all our programs; grades and credits are transferable according to each school’s policies. to find out more about these opportunities, click the links below.
