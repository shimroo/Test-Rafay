 welcome to the
 warbird information xchange
 



the warbird information xchange, or wix for short,  was started in 2001. a part of the warbirds resource group, the warbird information xchange is a place for warbird enthusiasts to get together and share experiences, stories, pictures and to develope friendships.
 after 10 years we have grown into a wonderful community that has access to nearly any bit of information about warbirds you can imagine. individually we know alot, together we know everything.
 the rules are relatively few and easy to follow. in general just be nice and civil. so please, come inside and join our community.

come on in!
