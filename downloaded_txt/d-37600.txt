3 june 2021: dear cobra country: tell curt to mark my backdraft racing cobra (bdr#664) sold. it wasn’t “gone in sixty seconds,” but it was “snatched up in about sixty hours.” gone to a new home way up in the keystone state (pennsyvania), sight-unseen except for my pictures. curt advised me that my good photos would likely result in a prompt sale. he was wrong. took almost 3 days. with best regards and thanks for a cobra marketing/ showcasing job well done, rod macon
