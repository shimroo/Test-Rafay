tradition runs deep here

		not only throughout decades of jesuit education, or across generations of philadelphians, but also deeply rooted in simply how we do things. the prep is a special place, with a family, a faculty, and an ignatian identity unlike any other in the philadelphia region. there’s a reason students have flocked here for nearly 170 years, and thrived for countless more.
