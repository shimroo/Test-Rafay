the image above is a coat of arms from
the book "die wappen der alten bauerfamilien in der holsteinischen
elbmarschen" published in 1920. in that book, the kreys are described as a
well-to-do family from the wilster-marsh. a specific mention is made regarding a
nikolaus kreye living at roskop in 1448. in some holstein dialects, the word
"crow" is pronounced like krey, which explains the bird in the coat of
arms.
