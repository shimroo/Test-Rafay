hear what western new yorkers are saying!







we had a great experience with amherst alarm's technician, dan.  he adjusted our camera system and did a check on our alarm system.  dan spent a lot of time to thoroughly explain everything to us.  we appreciate his professionalism, and would highly recommend him and his company to anyone looking for alarm services.

i have been a client of amherst alarm for almost 25 years. they installed my original system and a few upgrades over the years. they are always respectful of my needs and don't try to sell me things i don't need. technicians are knowledgeable and tidy about their work. i live on the border of two towns and the city, and it is a comfort to know they are local, and can appropriately dispatch the correct services when needed. do not hesitate to engage their services, after all this time i still think they are the best at what they do!

the alarm at my business was going off and no one knew why. i called amherst alarm up and they told me my battery was low. they then took the time out to teach me how to replace the battery and set aside a new battery to be ready for me to pick up. the woman working at the front desk was so kind, and she knew exactly what i was talking about as soon as i walked in. had everything replaced within an hour of calling them up! such a fantastic experience!
