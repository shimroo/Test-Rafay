beeswax candle works is located in cottage grove, oregon. all of our candles are hand made in our shop. we offer the largest selection available anywhere of usa produced 100% beeswax candles. our offering includes hand-dipped tapers, votives, tealights, birthday candles, havdalah, emergency tins, solid pillars, figurines, hanukkah and honeycomb candles.
our beeswax is sourced from local usa beekeepers and is unbleached so it is naturally a golden yellow to amber honey color. for our votives and tea lights, we lightly filter the beeswax. the beeswax for all of our other candles is unfiltered but strained to remove particles from the raw beeswax.
our candles are paraffin free. we don’t buy imported beeswax nor do we use paraffin or any other types of wax in our candle shop so please be assured that all of our candles are 100% pure beeswax. paraffin is a by-product of the petroleum industry and a candle can be called “pure beeswax” if it is 51% beeswax and 49% paraffin. our candles are strictly 100% pure beeswax.
we do not add fragrances to our candles. pure beeswax has it’s own natural sweet scent. our wicks are cotton - we never use lead wicks in our beeswax candles.
experience the wonderful warm light that is produced by our 100% pure usa beeswax candles!
