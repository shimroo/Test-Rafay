welcome to the home of all you need to know about fresh new zealand grown vegetables.
vegetables.co.nz has partnered with eatucation to provide young new zealanders with the skills they need to value and eat vegetables throughout their lives. 
if you are involved in education - from early childhood to secondary school - go to the eatucation website to get involved and get access to ready-made resources that build students’ food literacy at every stage of their education journey.
vegetables.co.nz is behind the add one more vegetable initiative, which was put in place to try and reverse new zealand's falling vegetable consumption because of the negative impact this trend is having on people's health and wellbeing.  
vegetables.co.nz also provides teachers with resources through the food skills for life programme. we also have a wide range of resources available for order, for use by health and education professionals. 
our healthy living section provides lots of great tips for healthy eating and detailed information on nutrition.
