      recurly & stock options 
      
        19 august 2020
      


i’m a week late with it, but i did want to comment on the news that recurly was purchased by accel-kkr, a private equity group, earlier this month. the gossip iâd heard was that with recurly doing so well in the corona environment, the investors felt it was a good time to sell and free up some money for their other investments.

the giving tree- alternate ending:

“look, i was fine with giving you the apples
to help you get on your feet.
theyâll grow back next season anyway.
but no, iâm not giving you a house.
you know, iâve seen boys like you
pull this nonsense
with other trees in the forest.”

      links: the disaster continues 
      
        03 august 2020
      


i guess as a disclaimer for this first story iâll mention i took a
position at amazon. we’ll see how much it reduces the number of links to
matt stoller and
scott galloway.

      a week of links 
      
        17 july 2020
      


after 7 years, it was sad to leave recurly last week. one of the things i’ll
miss the most was sharing links with the folks who hung out in the #andrew-morton-barde
slack channel. i’ve decided to start doing the weekly blog posts again so i have
a new outlet for the links i would have shared there.

        11 february 2020
      


i’ve used tcsh as my terminal shell since i’d started using freebsd back in 2001. i tried switching to bash a few times but found it pretty irritating.

      run code on specific jenkins hosts 
      
        20 june 2017
      


i needed to update some code in a github repo that’s checked out as part of a
jenkins pipeline. i could have just run the job over and over until it had run
on all the hosts, but with 15 hosts, that sounded like a pain in the ass.

      the wisdom of richard hamming 
      
        07 june 2017
      


yesterday jason kottke posted a link
to a transcript of a talk that richard hamming gave at bellcore in 1986. the
talk, titled you and your research,
is an hour long summary of his philosophy on how to do nobel-prize level
research. i’d recommend reading the entire thing but i wanted to pull out some
longer passages that really resonated with me.

      validate swagger docs in jenkins 
      
        23 march 2017
      


here’s a quick hack i worked out to validate swagger documentation as part of a
jenkins pull request check. it uses curl to send the json off to the swagger validator badge.
if there are any validation errors it will display them and then fail the build.

        07 january 2016
      


today marks my third anniversary working at recurly. it’s
been a pretty crazy journey so far. when i started there were only 15 people
in the san francisco office, now there are that many just in the boulder office
and over 100 people world wide.

        13 august 2015
      


back in early april recurly announced that we were opening a new office in boulder. since then we’ve hired nine people, five of whom are developers. i’ve gotten hands on experience with many aspects of recruiting: from passing out business cards at meetups, to phone screens, and technical interviews.

a simple tool for trying xpath queries it in javascript:

        27 october 2014
      


the best part of the day was hearing my wife tell ryland to “go give this to
daddy”, then seeing him wandering around the house carrying a birthday card for
me.

      this week 
      
        28 september 2014
      



the other great way to figure out where to eat in a new city is to provoke
  nerd fury online. go to a number of foodie websites with discussion boards.
  let’s say you’re going to kuala lumpur â just post on the malaysia board that
  you recently returned and had the best rendang in the universe, and give the
  name of a place, and all these annoying foodies will bombard you with angry
  replies about how the place is bullshit, and give you a better place to go.

      weekly links 
      
        21 september 2014
      



deana discovers music is a musical journey that i have started. inspired by
the birth of my son, i have had the pleasure of watching him experience the
sights and sounds of this world for the first time. like many new parents,
iâve enjoyed exposing him to albums iâve adored throughout the years. my goal
is to open my mind and listen to one new song a day and write a corresponding
review. a year from now, i hope to have 365 reviews for 365 songs.
