faith & service

 
campus ministry is an integral component of the school’s mission to educate the heart as well as the mind. the objective of campus ministry is to provide opportunities for self-reflection and to encourage growth in relationships with god and others. all members of our community, regardless of faith tradition, are invited to participate in the spiritual life of the school. our catholic ministry recognizes and honors the diversity that exists in our faith community. this flows from our grounding in the catholic tradition inspired by the charism and spirituality of the congregation of the holy cross.
