harlem hellfighters 
tv-14



                    the harlem hellfighters documents the hard fighting regiment of black soldiers, who battled shocking racism at home and abroad while fighting the germans in world war i. the hellfighters, who saw more time on the frontlines than any other american regiment, were initially heralded upon their return only to quickly be discarded by the army and country they served so valiantly. this one-hour documentary tells the important story of this courageous group, who included bandleader james reese europe and purple heart winner henry johnson. their extreme bravery earned them the french regimental croix de guerre a century before the u.s. finally recognized their contributions to the war effort with a congressional gold medal.

color of war, the: battleground 
tv-pg



                    world war two was truly a global conflict. allied soldiers fought in all theaters of war, exposing them to an extraordinary diversity of terrain and climate--from the arctic circle to desert sands and fetid jungles. an infantryman was engaged in combat for an hour each day on average, but he fought the environment around the clock. the war comes alive through a moving tapestry of letters, diaries, and color film and photographs unearthed from archives and personal collections. peter coyote narrates.

the higgins landing craft 
tv-pg



                    in the early morning of june 6, 1944, history's largest amphibious invasion force amassed off the normandy coast. hundreds of 36-foot shoebox-shaped boats, known as lcvps, or higgins boats, bob in the waves. these landing craft, which deliver soldiers to the beach, are designed and built largely through the efforts of one man--andrew jackson higgins. we examine higgins' life and study the boat that could land a platoon of 36 men with equipment, or a jeep and 12 men. by 4 am on june 6, 1944, the first wave of higgins boats is loaded with troops for the 12-mile journey to the omaha and utah beaches. the first wave of landings is close to disastrous, but as wave after wave of higgins boats unload, the tide begins to turn.

                    swedish diplomat raoul wallenberg worked in budapest at the height of hitler's "final solution", and saw jews being loaded onto trains destined for nazi concentration camps. but wallenberg, unlike many others, refused to sit by idly, but rather, saved many earmarked for death by issuing swedish immunity passes. before disappearing in 1945, he's thought to have rescued 100,000 people. we follow the trail uncovered by his family and researchers in their hunt for the truth as to his fate.

                    it's been said that war is 90% boredom mixed with 10% sheer terror. the allied servicemen of wwii spent a majority of their time in what normally would be called "everyday" activities. eating, sleeping, reading and writing letters--trying to snatch a few moments of enjoyment in the midst of the titanic conflict. veterans describe how they spent those brief interludes that became treasured wartime memories. with vivid color film unearthed from archives and personal collections. peter coyote narrates.
