cork guide 






welcome to cork guide
county cork is situated in the south west of ireland, it is the largest of all the irish counties and in many ways the most varied. rich farmlands and river valleys contrast with the wild sandstone hills of the west, and above all there is the magnificent wild atlantic way coast, scooped and fretted by the atlantic into great bays and secret coves, strewn with rocky headlands and long soft golden sands. visit blarney and kiss the blarney stone or the beautiful maritime towns of kinsale, bantry  & youghal.
