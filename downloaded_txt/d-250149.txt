to all our fans and supporters:
we regret to announce that in 2008, and after 36 consecutive years, the sfbf has discontinued its annual three-day festival due to budgetary conditions.
 the sfbf, however, will continue on in other capacities. please continue to check our website for information and updates. you can help support the sfbf by purchasing past posters and other items listed on our website. our posters are ideal for collectors, blues clubs and organizations.
thank you very much.
