riverview golf course az 

























desert rule
many courses in arizona 
								and nevada have this rule. where desert areas are 
								considered as water hazards. take a one stroke penalty 
								and drop within two club lengths from point of ball 
								entry. for those that get their ball caught in a 
								sahuaro - it's best to just instagram it for all 
								your buddies to see...pro.
