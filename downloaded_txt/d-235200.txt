ell yeah! it’s liokaiser - next #haslab revealed - another from japanese original series #transformersvictory

the ~6-member team, originally called “breastforce” now in a little more kid friendly “chest force” is comprised of leozak (leozack), gaihawk (guyhawk), ellbat (hellbat), jaruga (jallguar), drillhorn, killbison - well, i guess 7-member if you count the teir-1 deathrobra, he can form either the left arm subbing in for ellbat or, transform into a shoulder cannon.

6 - maybe, hopefully 7-member team for $299 on hasbro pulse.  who’s backing and whatdya think????

erik, toyrobot magazine, with a random post before bedtime.

i got bored while watching internet videos before bed and thought "you know...i bet i could make a 1-10 rarity scale using just the bots in my office.". so, here's my personal attempts and thoughts on a 1-10 rarity scale. i'll break it down as i go. feel free to chime in with your own 1-10 versions. 

remember, this isn't about value, but about how easy it is to get a certain figure. if i wanted to, i could have made a rare of the rare pic involving tens of thousands of dollars worth of figures over just ten toys, but that's not the goal.

#1 a figure anyone can find without any issues and can easily afford. i decided to use this blokees ratchet as an example; an alternative would be a g1 jumpstarter.

#2 this is still a very easy-to-find and common figure but may be a bit older and no longer available. many toys from people's childhood would fit into this category. a large portion of the g1 toys would fall in line here and into category #3.

#3 here figures will begin to see a bit of a price hike and be a bit harder to find. values can vary greatly, but you're not going to see these all the time. the dinobots are a great example, easy to find, but high demand and value. another example would be most modern chase figures. you'll find them if you look, but you'll have to pay a bit more for them.

#4 here prices may not be as high as you'd think, but this is where obscure items begin to pop up. decoys, mini-spies, target and headmaster bots will fall in line here. 

#5 middle of the road, and we're now into "nerd" territory. you'll have to have been in a fandom for a while to know about these kinds of figures. you've definitely pushed up your glasses and said "actually..." while referencing this kind of toy. diaclone, microman, shogun warriors, popy era toys...the list goes on. these are for the die-hards, the super fans, and rarely for the beginning collector. 

#6 these are figures that are truly hard to find. maybe they have tons of little pieces (best of they west complete figures or early 1960s joes), or they may have had low print runs and high collector demand. the g1 monstructor hits all of these criteria and is a gem in many personal collections, but a pipe dream for others. 

#7 we are truly in the land of the rare now, figures many people may never have heard of, even if they've collected for years. i like to think that this area is a sweet spot for collectors. the items here may not always be valuable, but only because so few know about them. these are the forgotten toys, never popular enough to become,e legendary in status, but far exceeding many other toys on the market. g1 dairy queen optimus prime is a perfect example. often only a small handful of these show up throughout a year and mint examples are almost non-existent. 

#8 you'd think items like the uss flagg, fortress maximus, or even eternia would be here, but honestly, those are spendy and hard to find, but would only be in that #5 or #6 range! no, this is the dark corner of the collector world, the gems begin here, the rare of the rare. often pieces here may be limited to only a few hundred or so in the world. the g1 mcdonalds transformers are a good fit here. though only $50-$100 each, these are rare, sought after, and nearly impossible to complete due to all the variations.

#9 don't tread here, walk away. this is where you begin to touch on prototypes, limited exclusives, and items most people would only dare dream of owning. this gumball beastformer toy is one of the rest the g1-era items you're going to find. originally sold in vending machines for around $.25, today you'll be paying hundreds for one of these beasts. few collectors will ever be lucky enough to see, let alone own, one of these kinds of toys. 

#10 lucky draws, 1:1's, vintage displays, and exclusives are only found here. these are the items under glass displays with certificates, and plaques, and make their owners smile ear t

hi everyone, it's erik with toyrobot magazine and i'm finally back with a write-up! hope you enjoy it, as we're going to cover one of the rarer and off-the-wall bots ever to come out of the 1980s.

today we're looking at one of my holy grails and something i've wanted for 25ish years. robotic molto aka the gobot robot ride-on (scooter bot). 

this massive robot was produced sometime in the mid-1980s and its exact origins are kind of a mystery. both sail toys and exinmex (exin). which company made it first i cannot tell you, but most likely exinmex as the gobots line was relying heavily on designs by arco around this time. 

this massive robot stands around 26" (66cm) tall, making him possibly the largest transforming robot to come out of the 1980s, beating out transformers fortress maximus. he converts from a robot into a ride-on scooter in a few easy steps.

in robot mode, his arms move up and down and have spring-loaded pincher claws that open and close with the levers on the back of his arms. under his feet are three wheels that allow him to glide along the floor very nicely. 

changing into a scooter is very simple. pushing down on his head unlocks his chest, which is then swung upwards to reveal the front wheel and change the head into the handlebars (the antenna now extend for this purpose). the body is then pivoted down at the ankles and the transformation is complete. it's very simple, but very sturdy. 

this robot varies from the gobot version only by the stickers that were included, most noticeably the "robotic molto" would instead say "gobots". 

this may be the first time the box, inner contacts, and paperwork have ever been fully detailed and covered by an article, and i'd like to thank mike parisi as he is the one who sold this to me. i cannot express how excited i am.

the box is old-school 1980s corrugated cardboard with simple inks and designs; oddly, the colored picture of the robot seems to have been cut from a paper sheet and then glued onto the box. lots of excellent design going on here, something that has now long been pushed aside for flashier boxes.

the stickers are shown in order as they are numbered (1-16 going from the top left to the bottom right), i seem to be missing sticker #10. 

the paperwork includes an instruction sheet with spanish and english on it, while the sticker guide is strictly in spanish. finally, there is a 90-day warranty sheet, something that is beyond surprising, showing that this was not some cheap toy.

if you want to have more fun, watch the original tv comercial for this found here: https://youtu.be/bxi3-afa-ze?si=cudaur2hn9ufejje

this isn't the fanciest or best robot to come out of the 1980s, but it's rare, sought after, and a hidden gem to the masses. knowing this bot is like knowing who the tonnika sisters are in star wars. you have to have some deep-lore knowledge to know this guy.

want to know why so many names for the gobot version? it's simply because, as of right now, there might be very few people on this planet with a box for one, if any still exist, so we all just have gone by the names assigned to him ages ago by collectors like alex bickmore of super toy archive; back in the days when information on rare toys was scare and he may have some of the only pictures ever shown of this obscure bot. 

today several have shown up (even now, there is one on ebay) but so few know to look for this wonderful toy. i feel that he is one of the most fun toys to ever come out of the 1980s. an actual ride-on scooter toy that is also a transforming robot...what's not to love!

triggercons: crankcase, ruckus & windsweeper

i was showing’m off to my son, who took a look and said “that’s awesome, they look good together even if they’re too obscure of a trio for even me to understand! (which is really sayin’ something since he’s been a fan for 20+ years, knows lore as well as anyone!) 

why is this cool?  well, i love teams & 2025 will be a phenomenal - the most well known all-stars teams getting modern upgrades (aerialbots, constructicons, combaticons!)  what a great way to kick off the year, w/ these obscure guys getting modern updates!  how obscure we talking?  well, only, crankcase made the cut to be on the team of decepticon “misfits” in @j.roberts332 #mtmte comic series. that might be the only way modern fans have heard of any one of them.  and yeah, btw, they do look damn good together!

these figures do lack the gimmick of their original toy counterparts: spring-loaded weapons that pop out w/ the push of a button.  but they make up for it with size, pose-ability, detailing & since their weapons have 5mm ports they’re compatible w/ blast effects to highlight this team’s most important dynamic -firepower! 

the downside is that you have to go pretty far out of your way to get this band back together.   crankcase, was a standard legacy deluxe.  probably you can still find it online w/o having to pay huge aftermarket mark-up pricing.  but since he’s a standard deluxe, it lacked deco - so, i went to toyhax and gave him a sticker set upgrade treatment.

crankcase and windsweeper, well, these 2 have premium decos w/ tampo’s (paint) to replicate necessary color details of the original toy stickers.  in the case of ruckus, the original toy had a sticker shock-absorbers, the legacy upgrade has it molded and painted into the parts itself - gorgeous!  i’m only a little cringy that i had to pay for “doom and destruction” 2-packs, with similarly upgraded voyager toys (g1-ified tf:prime brakedown and comics retool bludgeon) which i’m not overly interested in.   for me tho i’m happy to pay the price so i can get this complete set of triggercons!

						hot off the heels of the announcement of botcon's returning in 2021 under the new management of bc productions (an all new company run by such botcon veterans as karl hartman, andrew hall, mike tinnel, and more, created for the specific purpose of acquiring the rights to botcon from fun publications) comes a few updates regarding this year's robocon, which has been carrying botcon's torch in the meantime.namely, robocon 2020 will be held on june 5-6 at the galt house in louisville, ky, the very same hotel that played host to the last official botcon in 2016. registration has also gone live, with two registration packages available this year. the standard registration package for this year is a remarkably affordable $25.00! the second option, meanwhile, is a special "botcon 2021 pre-party exclusive pack" that features access to a special friday night party celebrating the next year's return of botcon, an exclusive botcon convention t-shirt featuring a "neo-classic" botcon logo, a special vintage botcon logo themed lanyard, and best of all, a 144-page ultimate botcon product guide volume 1 w/ exclusive convention cover, limited to 300 pieces. that one is priced at $98.00 (more than previous robocons but far less than any fun pub botcons ever were)....

						after the brand unification between hasbro and takaratomy kicked off with power of the primes and studio series (and will continue with siege), takara's transformers: legends line continues to persist with another forthcoming takaratomy mall exclusive. this time, however, it is not a recent mold release, but a soon-to-be 20-year-old mold from 1999. seeming to coincide with the transformers encore reissue of the cartoon-accurately-colored big convoy, the next lg-ex release will be a redeco of that figure in the form of blue big convoy! much like the encore release of unicron (micron shūgō-tai color), this is a recreation of what was once a super rare lucky draw figure from 1999. however, also like unicron (micron shūgō-tai color), it is not a straight recreation, as this version will have less translucent plastic with two opaque arms instead of one solid and one clear.more recently, the old lucky draw figure was actually repurposed in comics made for e-hobby's magna convoy exclusive as the leader of a legendary group known as the primus vanguard. while it remains to be seen whether this legends release of blue big convoy will fictionally represent big convoy himself in a new form, the primus vanguard leader remains another distinct possibility for this toy's character identity.legends lg-ex blue big convoy will be released by takaratomy mall in february 2019....

the next encore reissue - unicron (micron aggregate color)!


						2018-07-09 2:55 pm by sabrblade					

						the transformers: encore line of reissues has been dabbling in some post-g1 figures as of late, beginning with god fire convoy from car robots and to be continuing with returns convoy for beast wars returns (beast machines). now, a third post-g1 encore toy has been revealed and is the first one to truly be from a completely non-g1 continuity altogether. its name is unicron (micron aggregate color).a redeco of the armada unicron mold, this is not the chaos bringer himself, but a green copy of him that was formed by a massive amount of mini-cons combining together as one, to fight against their evil creator in the final few episodes of the transformers: armada cartoon, hence the "micron aggregate color" label ("micron" being the japanese term for "mini-con"). previously, in 2004, a toy of this "unicron of light" had been released in limited quantities as a lucky draw figure over in japan, but this encore release will not only see a much wider release but will also sport a vastly different deco from the lucky draw, being almost completely green and turquoise instead of the lucky draw being half-teal/half-gray.unicron (micron aggregate color) is set for release in december 2018. official images can be found below, courtesy of autobase aichi....
