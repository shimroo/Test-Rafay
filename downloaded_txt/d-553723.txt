  "all of my children are having a very good basketball season thanks to your camp. in fact, they all had your shorts on one practice and everyone asked me when your camp is held etc. sadie, my fifth grader has played against other girls in the sorrounding area and it is nice to see how they have become friends through your camp, thanks again so much...see you soon."

  "thanks again - that was a great clinic...you definitely know kids and how to teach them, i got a lot of great ideas from you and looking over the hand-out ni see there are a lot more practice games that i would like to know the rules too (dribble knocj-out, farmington 500, machine gun passing, husky shooting, rip city...to name a few!)"

  "i saw the ad for your camp only 2 hours before the end of the auction called my son-in-law immediately to ask if i should bid on it for her, and won! i sat at the computer until 5 minutes after the auction closed to be sure no one outbid me.m brindi has actually gone to the camp before. she's a six grader who lives for basketball, and she will be thrilled to be going again. thanks to you and your brother, i will have one very happy granddaughter when she gets the gift certificate for her birthday! her name is brindelyn schroeder, daughter of dave and darcy schroeder."
