“humble obedience to the constitution by public servants is the paramount ‘compelling state interest’.” [family guardian fellowship]
u.s. attorneys manual, section 1-15.000 respect for religious liberty (offsite link)

people of all races, genders, political beliefs, sexual orientations, and nearly all religions are welcome here. all are treated equally under real “law”. the only way to remain truly free and equal under the civil law is to avoid seeking government civil services, benefits, property, special or civil status, exemptions, privileges, or special treatment.  all such pursuits of government services or property require individual and lawful consent to a franchise and the surrender of inalienable constitutional rights and equality in the process, and should therefore be avoided.  the rights and equality given up are the “cost” of procuring the “benefit” or property from the government, in fact.  nothing in life is truly “free”.  anyone who claims that such “benefits” or property should be free and cost them nothing is a thief who wants to use the government as a means to steal on his or her behalf. all just rights spring from responsibilities/obligations under the laws of a higher power.  if that higher power is god, you can be truly and objectively free.  if it is government, you are guaranteed to be a slave because they can lawfully set the cost of their property as high as they want as a merchant under the u.c.c.    if you want it really bad from people with a monopoly, then you will get it really bad. bend over.  there are no constitutional limits on the price government can charge for their monopoly services or property.  those who want no responsibilities can have no real/private rights, but only privileges dispensed to wards of the state which are disguised to look like unalienable rights.  obligations and rights are two sides of the same coin, just like self-ownership and personal responsibility. for the biblical version of this paragraph, read 1 sam. 8:10-22.  for the reason god answered samuel by telling him to allow the people to have a king, read deut. 28:43-51, which is god’s curse upon those who allow a king above them.  click here for a detailed description of the legal, moral, and spiritual consequences of violating this paragraph.
