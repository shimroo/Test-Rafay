grizzly bears in montana are an iconic native species with high value to people and cultures across the state and around the world and play important roles in montana ecosystems and economies. at the same time, they can and do injure or kill people and livestock and cause property damage and economic loss, which may disproportionately affect individuals living and working in bear country. their potential presence is both valued and feared.
