formal methods and tools for safe and secure computing,
applications to cyber-physical systems


 
computerized systems control many  everyday and professional objects,
including  those that  perform  critical functions  in the  transport
(automotive,  avionics, rail,  space), telecommunications,  robotics,
banking and healthcare sectors, where expectations in terms of safety
and security are particularly high.
verimag’s work  aims to  produce theoretical  and technical  tools to
meet these expectations with mathematical  rigor, on a broad spectrum
of problems that  may involve circuits, processors,  analog or hybrid
systems,  compilers,  security   protocols,  distributed  algorithms,
systems  integrating  ai, particularly  in  the  context of  critical
systems.
verimag seeks to maintain a balance between fundamental, experimental
and  applied research,  in  particular  through long-term,  sustained
cooperation with industrial and academic partners.
verimag has contributed  and continues to contribute  actively to the
development   of   the  state   of   the   art  in   formal   methods
(model-checking,  static analysis,  automated or  interactive theorem
proving), synchronous  languages, system modeling,  while integrating
sustainability and resource-saving issues.
verimag’s results have numerous industrial applications, notably in
tools for the development of critical software and systems.
verimag (umr 5104) was created in  1993 as a cnrs/verilog unité mixte
from the spectre team of the  lgi laboratory; since 1997, verimag has
been    a   joint    research    unit    of   university    grenoble
alpes (including grenoble inp -
uga)  and cnrs
(ins2i).
verimag  plays an  important  role in  teaching  at grenoble  alpes
university and grenoble-inp, and in training doctoral students.
verimag     is    a     member     of     the    institut     carnot
lsi      and      of     the      labex
persyval-lab
for more information, you can have a look at the last activity report
or the hceres evaluation.
