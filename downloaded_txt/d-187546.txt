byu bands













the ensembles

the mission of byu bands parallels that of our school of music in that “we seek truth in great music.” we strive for educational and artistic excellence as we interact with music that ranges from the classics of the wind band world to outstanding new additions to the band repertoire. our goal is not only to refine the performance, but to enrich the lives of both performer and the listener as we immerse ourselves in the music-making and participation in the divine gift of music.
