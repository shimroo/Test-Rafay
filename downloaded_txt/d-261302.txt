													jet guns should be a

													hepatitis c



														by paul harasim / rj
														a number of veterans as

														believe that vietnam

														through unsafe jet gun 
														vaccinations.







 



















forget stigma, boomers: get tested for hepatis c


by paul harasim / rj


while its possible the governments position on transmission of hepatitis c among boomers may have resulted in less testing, its critical today boomers forget any fears of stigma and get the easy blood test.

																		the 
																		va 
							testimony before the subcommittee on benefits 
							committee on veteransá¦¦airs, u.s. house of 
							representatives, april 13, 2000, gary a. roselle, m. 
							d., program director for infectious diseases, 
							veterans health administration, department of 
							veterans affairs, state, "one in 10 us veterans are 
																		infected 
																		with 
																		hcv", a 
																		rate 5 
																		times 
																		greater 
																		than the 
																		1.8% 
																		infection 
																		rate of 
																		the 
																		general 
																		population." 
																		








																		greater 
																		than one 
																		in 5 
																		veterans 
																		with 
																		hepatitis 
																		c are 
																		from the vietnam 
																		and post 
																		vietnam 
																		era!



															a study conducted in 
															1999, by the 
															veterans health 
															administration (vha), 
															and involving 26,000 
															veterans shows that 
															up to 10% of all 
															veterans in the vha 
															system tested 
															positive for 
															hepatitis c.

															of the total number 
															of persons who were 
															hepatitis c antibody 
															positive, and 
															reported an era of 
															service, 62.7% were 
															noted to be from the 
															vietnam. the second 
															most frequent group 
															is listed as 
															post-vietnam at 
															18.2%, followed by 
															4.8% korean 
															conflict, 4.3% 
															post-korean 
															conflict, 4.2% from 
															wwii, and 2.7% 
															persian gulf era 
															veterans. it wasn't 
															until 2012 the 
															department of 
															defense began to 
															test recruits 
															entering and exiting 
															the service. the 
															figures for the war 
															on terror lack 
															accurate research 
															and expected to 
															exceed the stated 
															claim.

															high risk for hepatitis c (hcv) 
															







pandora's box
the 
										hepatitis c epidemic is discovering what 
										was... in 1988, 242,000 hepatitis c 
										infections were reported annually. these 
										high figures were reported from the 
										1960s and throughout 1980s, then 
										declining after 1992 when another test 
										developed detected 65% of positive 
										patients. however, it wasn't until 2001 
										a test was able to detect 99.9% of 
										positive results.



the following 
										list are recognized service connected 
										transmission methods for the hepatitis c 
										virus and other bloodborne pathogens. if 
										a veteran applies for benefits and does 
										not have "other" risk factors, or can 
										prove service was a "greater risk" for 
										infection with hepatitis c, qualify for 
										service connection.
