welcome 
								to 
renaissance, 
										where our passion is excellence!=

								 during the era known as the renaissance, man 
								emerged from the middle ages
 and experienced a 
								renewed, enthusiastic pursuit along classical 
								lines.  a 
 pursuit distinguished by a 
								revival of interest in the past, by an 
								increasing 
 pursuit of learning, and by an 
								imaginative response to the changing times.

								 it was an era of progressive attitude with only 
								perfection as a goal.  a goal we
 strive to 
								achieve.  producing the vizsla of tomorrow 
								is an art that 
								requires a
 solid foundation in the past as well 
								as a vision of the future.  at renaissance
 vizslas, we believe in the tradition of the old 
								masters;  selectively breeding
 proven 
								foundation lines for beauty, movement, type, 
								temperament and natural
 bird ability.

								 this is the essence of renaissance vizslas.  
								come along and explore the world
								 of renaissance!
