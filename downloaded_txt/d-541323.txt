the white mountains of new hampshire, well worn by time and the elements, are among the oldest in america; seemingly changeless yet still evolving. here inspiration is drawn from the distinction, beauty and antiquity of the land we live on. the environment shapes us; trace the outline of where the mountain range meets the sky and one can share an element of the inspiration behind renna.movement and adaptation define our leather products. our goods express versatility and imagination with respect to the geography of design; we break new paths and reveal new vistas. renna designs are envisioned to suit the shifting terrain of varied lifestyles. choose your passage; remember your origin; carry renna. all paths lead home.
