postcards from home


							in 
                  the years that preceded the end of world war ii, the 
                  photograph served a very important function, not only for families who were living in europe at the time, but also for 
                  those who decided to emigrate and start new lives in the 
                  united states and elsewhere in the world. many families went 
                  to large towns or big cities so that they could take one last 
                  photograph together before one of them emigrated. the families that 
                  had cameras, of course, could take their own photographs, and 
                  they often sent these photographs to their 
                  relatives living abroad by postal mail, accompanied by a 
                  letter, or a few words of affection written in yiddish on the 
                  back. these photographs would often create 
                  one last visual memory that would remind the recipient, 
                  for the rest of their lives, of the years that they had spent 
                  together as a family, as for so many they would never 
                  see each other again.
