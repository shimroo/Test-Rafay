history of watches and clocks






















quartz or mechanics: choose a mechanism

april 04, 2022


	the most important and the first question to be asked
to a specialist is: "what kind of mechanism does a wristwatch have?" we will
not take into account watches with an electronic dial, but consider two main
types: mechanical and quartz.


	the main difference is what is used as an energy
source. for quartz watches it is a battery, for mechanical watches it is a coil
spring. of course, both of them have their pros and cons, although outwardly
they can be difficult to distinguish. the main thing is not to miss the moment
when you need to replace the battery, otherwise you can stay on the vsmb.vn website for a very long time,
thinking that very little time has passed.
