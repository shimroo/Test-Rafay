"it was great to have someone fight for us where we couldn't. the sense of relief we felt knowing someone was in our corner treating us like people and not a burden was incredible. thank you for all your help!"

i am so grateful for your clinic in murfreesboro, i had 5 previous "so called attorneys" that never got anything done with regard to my mom's estate/my trust. my current attorney i met at your clinic is by far a superior attorney and person!!



michael
client




wonderful staff!  i was pleasantly surprised at the level of "niceness" i felt here. if you are going through something you need help with, and can't afford a lawyer, this is definitely the place to go. the lawyer was super nice, and the ladies i met there were also super nice, and all very helpful. amazing.
