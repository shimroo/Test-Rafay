state library victoria acknowledges the traditional lands of all the victorian aboriginal clans, and their
            cultural practices and knowledge systems.
we recognise that our collections hold traditional cultural knowledge belonging to indigenous communities
            in victoria and around the country. we support communities to protect the integrity of this information,
            gathered from their ancestors in the colonial period.
we pay our respects to their elders, past and present, who have handed down these systems of practice to
            each new generation for millennia.
