terra blueslive blues since 1990 . . .














about the clubterra blues is a modern-day blues saloon with a second floor view of bleecker street in the heart of greenwich village. for over 30 years, its arched ceiling has carried the sound of the blues' greatest musicians from new york and abroad. hubert sumlin, little milton, magic slim, james carr, the holmes brothers, phillip walker, and johnny clyde copeland are among the many who have graced the stage (and who now decorate the walls) at terra blues.
