    see what our customers are saying about us

   "i give my strongest possible recommendation to south hills movers. we did a local move, from one pittsburgh neighborhood to another. from our first contacts with the office, through the estimate, through the move itself, everyone at the company provided us with the highest level of courtesy and service. aaron smith and his crew were especially impressive, working very hard and efficiently while maintaining a cheerful and gracious disposition. we could not have asked for a better experience and are recommending south hills movers to all our friends."

 "we relocated from pa to fl and were very pleased with our experience with south hills movers. the team was very professional and mindful of handling all of our furniture with care; both during loading in pa and delivery in fl. they did a great job packing our belongings as nothing was damaged during transit. we had our belongings in our new home within days. i would highly recommend south hills to anyone who is moving."-
kirsten p.

 "i feel compelled to leave a five star review for this company. moving is extremely stressful, and these folks took all the stress out of it. they were very responsive, attentive, and professional. not one scratch in our new home from the move, nor in our old condo. they even went above and beyond to help when other service folks dropped the ball (new furniture delivery men who didn’t want to put felt pads on the bottom of our furniture to avoid scratching wood floors when they promised ahead of time that they would). they were efficient and the move went flawlessly. 10/10 recommend."- samir s.



   "we used for local move in the south hills. donn gave a us a good estimate, which was on spot. they were able to hold over our items on trucks for a three day at a very minor cost, along with making an additional delivery to our son's house . movers did a great job, very efficient along with being pleasant on meeting our needs. highly recommend south hills movers."
- gary s.

 "i used s. hills movers for a move of about 35 miles. the process was easy. the movers were very professional and efficient. they even came in under the estimate. i was very pleased."- donald p.﻿

 "i have used south hills movers many times in the last few years. the experiences have been terrific. from scheduling to multiple destination drop offs, the interaction with personnel has been tops!"- nancy k.
