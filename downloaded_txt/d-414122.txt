 not partially clean, but completely clean
 not partially clean, but completely clean. that's why we believe that all indoor air purifiers need activated carbon in addition to high quality super hepa filters. our air purifiers work to appease so many situations as they can be customized to your specific needs. other air cleaners focus on filtering out particles, but airmedic pro air purifiers featuring activated carbon go one step further and protect you from the harmful chemicals, gases and odors present in every home and office.
        




 complete approach to building air purifiers that tackle all the main irritants affecting poor indoor air quality

dust, pollen, pet dander, pet hair, dust mites, dangerous airborne chemicals, gases, fumes and annoying persistent odors like cigar and cigarette smoke and pet odors. 
unlike many of our competitors who use mere ounces of carbon or a carbon-sprayed mesh, we use pounds of deep bed activated carbon to effectively adsorb dangerous airborne chemicals. activated carbon is among the most effective materials known to man for removing airborne chemicals, gases and odor. it's used widely by hospitals, the military, scientific and industrial facilities, and disaster response units for its safe and powerful adsorbing properties. 

activated carbon is also used in water filters, gas masks and medical treatments to counteract poison. it is the most effective filter media on the market to trap airborne chemicals, gases and odors. it can remove formaldehyde, traffic fumes, benzene, smoke as well as hundreds of other volatile organic compounds. 
the more carbon an air cleaner has, the more chemicals it will be able to adsorb. many air cleaners that claim to have carbon have such an insignificant amount of actual carbon within their units that it is rendered as ineffective as it would be had it had no carbon whatsoever. activated carbon is key for chemical adsorption. for serious chemical adsorption, only airmedic pro series air purifiers with pounds of granular carbon will be effective.
        




 a deeper carbon filter means cleaner air 
 very few air cleaners actually target the full range of pollutants we breathe every day. thatâs why airmedic pro air purifiers combine efficient particle filtration with an activated carbon filter that removes airborne chemicals, gases and odors. in fact we offer the deepest carbon filters, of any leading company, anywhere. a deeper bed of carbon filter means cleaner air and in most cases, fewer
filter changes.





 reinventing the hepa filter

super hepa high efficiency particulate air filters or hepa filters have essentially not changed in 50 years. while effective at trapping particles, they remain a fragile mass of fibers with a glue-like bonding agent, caged in metal to protect it from damage. we knew there had to something better. so allerair pioneered the use of super hepa. our exclusive particle filter captures 99.99% of airborne particles and contains no bonding agents. itâs safe and easy to handle, canât be damaged in transport and is safe for people sensitive to chemicals and odors. this exceptional filter is only available from allerair.
