 what is fleet management software?

                                fleet management software is a very useful tool for managing your inventory of heavy machinery, cargo containers, trailers, dumpsters, vehicles and more. 
                                
                                our cloud based servers collects, stores, reports and analyzes different information related to specific jobs or activities your fleet performs.
                                
                                coastal gps's software detects your drivers' exact locations as they complete deliveries or services across the map. our solution helps you manage your assets, identify operational deficiencies and create optimized schedules and routes for your team.
                            




 how does gps tracking work?

                                our web based application uses the global position system (gps) satellites to track your objects precise location in real-time through a gps chip in our plug-n-play modules, which then transmit the data instantly through a 3g/4g worldwide gsm cellular chip to our servers.
                                
                                the modules sends the geolocation data and key telemetrics from your asset's computers with each ping the cloud server receives.
                                

                                this information can then be viewed and analyzed on our secure encrypted cloud based web application.
                            













fleet maintenance scheduling



                                    get alerts for any vehicle's scheduled maintenance. when the odometer hits any of your custom set intervals you will be alerted for that specific service. never check mileage again!
                                







vehicle routing



                                    optimize routes with googles directions api. take into consideration weather, traffic, tolls, bridges and more. add waypoints to your routes with ease. assign a vehicle their route and go!
                                







geofencing



                                    define and assign a virtual geographical boundary around any address! when a asset enters or exits this boundary a system alert will popup and a live alert will be sent out if you have either or both alert options selected!
                                







live location share



                                    want to be known for your customer service? share your vehicle's live location link to deliver best-in-class eta accuracy and next to eliminate the "when's my delivery showing up" calls.
                                







reporting tools



                                    pinpoint key performance indicators, shorten route times and lower fuel costs by identifying issues ahead of time. view and analyze your long term data to improve your fleet management and routing logistics.
                                







map choice



                                    use google's street maps, google earth's satellite views or join them together for a google earth view with street overlays. research has found that we experience colors differently, so choose light map, dark map silver map!
                                







aerial view



                                    immediately access an aerial map view of your asset. hit the google earth button and route their navigation to the delivery bay, through a maze of buildings and easily track stolen property.
