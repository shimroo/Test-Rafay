        inclusive excellence: strategies for broadening participation and improving belonging in stem

              



speaker: dr. andre issacs
it is becoming increasingly difficult for educators to be effective in the classroom if we continue to decouple students’ lived experiences from their academic learning. this talk will focus on modern strategies that capitalize on the unique learning styles of the younger generation, with special attention to students from historically marginalized groups, to broaden participation in stem. 
please note: this event is only open to members of the university of waterloo community. registration is required.

the university of waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the neutral, anishinaabeg, and haudenosaunee peoples. our main campus is situated on the haldimand tract, the land granted to the six nations that includes six miles on each side of the grand river. our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the office of indigenous relations.
