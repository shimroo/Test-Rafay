state rapid grants provided nearly $28,000 for each of the three sim rigs. additional grant funding provided just over $14,000 for the three stretchers and special equipment. they are used by students in the emergency medical services technology associate degree program, the paramedic certification program, and the emergency medical technician certification program.

a sports-lover all her life, zeaâannah slack knew she wanted to major in exercise science. slack took some courses at columbus state during her junior year of high school, and she enjoyed the experience so much that she decided to enroll here to earn her associate degree. that decision allowed her to forge connections with advisors and teachers early on, and opened the door to new opportunities. slackâs advisor helped her land a research assistant position at ohio state university where sheâs worked on a study looking at the effects of nutrition and exercise for minority students in college.
âthe thing i like the most about columbus state is that you really get to know you professors on a name-to-name basis,â slack says. âit helped me stay focused and get good grades because it was easy for me to get the help and tutoring i needed.â
slack plans to transfer to a four-year school to earn a physicianâs assistant degree with a minor in herbal science â a passion sheâs developed during her time at columbus state. slack aspires to own her own herbal remedy business one day, so she can educate others about the benefits of herbal treatments and create her own affordable yet effective remedies.

erica miller, modern manufacturing
columbus stateâs modern manufacturing work-study program helped miller learn on the job
erica millerâs first foray into engineering and robotics was in middle school, when she participated in the first lego league. âas a kid i was always fascinated with figuring out how things worked. i really liked thinking through problems and evaluating solutions,â she says. today, sheâs channeling that passion for problem-solving into her job as a technician with stanley electric us, inc.
miller gained the knowledge and skills she needed through columbus stateâs modern manufacturing work-study program, which gives students an opportunity to work with a local company while theyâre still in school. for miller, that meant servicing and maintaining robots and equipment at honda. âitâs great how what you learn at school and what you learn on the job build on each other,â she says. âthey ask me to do things at work for the first time and iâm like âhey, i know how to do this!â the classes and lab work really teach you the basics so you can jump in when you get a job.â

nadine reece loves figuring things out â and columbus state's automotive technology department is a piece of that puzzle.
