happy release day


jan. 25th, 2011 at 12:30 pm



 


arcaediatoday is the official release day for bloodshot by cherie priesta 100-year-old vampire thief runs afoul of secret biological experimenters­--first of an urban fantasy series from the versatile author of boneshaker (2009).sassy vampire raylene pendle makes a good living by stealing things to order; luckily, the numerous law-enforcement agencies in pursuit think she's a man. very much a loner, she lives in seattle in a vast abandoned warehouse stuffed with valuable objects acquired as insurance—premises she shares with a pair of street-urchin intruders who, over the months, have gradually morphed into lodgers. when charming blind vampire ian stott asks for her help, money no object, raylene pays close attention. ian needs her to retrieve top secret government files—documents detailing the horrid black-op army experiments, performed on vampires and other unorthodox persons, that left ian blind. after an interloper invades her warehouse—raylene kills him without compunction—she doesn't immediately make the connection. then, in atlanta, she gets a lead on another victim of the experiments via the victim's brother adrian, a huge, exnavy seal drag queen. unfortunately, there are immediate complications: ruthless men in black masquerading as cia; and evidence that project bloodshot, supposedly shut down years ago, is once more roaring ahead thanks to a mysterious, mega-rich private financier. brutally unsentimental narrator raylene—she suffers from early-morning panic attacks and can't help wondering where adrian tucks his male equipment while he's queening—makes a quirky and charming if bloodthirsty host.a refreshing and addictive lure for readers uninterested in fangs, bats, capes and hissing.—kirkus, starred review

happy release day


jan. 18th, 2011 at 10:00 am



 


arcaediatoday is the official release day for debut novel, god's war by kameron hurleyreaders will be fascinated by the setting of this slow-starting but compelling far-future debut. on a planet settled by muslims and ravaged by constant war and pollution, nyx, a former government-sponsored assassin or "bel dame," gets by as a bounty hunter. her assistant is the foreign magician rhys, who can control the ubiquitous insects that drive the planet's technology. when the government asks them to hunt down an off-worlder who possesses technology that could end the war, they find themselves facing off against foreign agents and their fellow bel dames. hurley's world-building is phenomenal, with casual references to insectile technology and the world's history that provide atmosphere without info dumps. far too many pages are spent introducing the characters, but the story is highly engaging once it starts, and hurley smoothly handles tricky themes such as race, class, religion, and gender without sacrificing action. --publishers weekly****the book so nice, i sold it twice. this one didn't have an easy road. i'm glad kameron hung in there, and that she kept believing in me while i was believing in her. kameron goes into more detail here.also, this week, comment on any of the posts at the night bazaar about favorite female characters, and be entered to win a free copy. details here.

arcaediatoday is the official release date for sharon lee and steve miller's the agent gambit, part of baen's reprinting of the earlier liaden novels. this omnibus includes agent of change and carpe diem.agent of change: once a brilliant first-in-scout, val con yos’phelium was “recruited” by the shadowy liaden department of interior and brainwashed into an agent of change—a ruthless covert operative who kills without remorse. val con has been playing a deep game, far from the orderly life of clan and kin. fleeing his latest mission, he saves the life of ex-mercenary miri robertson, a terran on the run from interplanetary assassins. thrown together by circumstances, val con and miri struggle to elude their enemies and stay alive without killing each other-or surrendering to the unexpected passion that flares between them. which name – or face – will the agent choose when the game gets tough and an escape for only one of them seems possible?carpe diem: on the run from interplanetary assassins and a ruthless interstellar crime cartel, covert operative val con yos'phelium and former mercenary sergeant miri robertson formed an alliance of necessity and wound up stranded on a planet with no rescue in sight. their on-world problems were looking manageable after they assumed new identities as musicians, that is until a local war forced them to reveal their alien combat skills – and doubt their own growing partnership of trust and love. by then the relentless hound of an agent on val con's trail was closing in with the very weapon val con and miri most feared, and the game got very rough indeed.a great way to introduce new readers to the series....
