        episode s4:e14  

28 min 30 sec  
immanuel

        with shawn boonstra  

back in the earliest years of christian history, a lot of deep thinkers struggled to wrap their minds around the concept of jesus being not just a man, and not just god, but instead both things at the very same time. how could the eternal almighty himself come to this earth as a real flesh-and-blood human? shawn boonstra takes a little time to examine that claim in this special christmas episode.

        episode s8:e13  

28 min 30 sec  
no other gods

        with shawn boonstra  

lots of people are cool with jesus, and even yahweh...except for that pesky claim of exclusivity. what’s his deal? some have diagnosed god as an egomaniacal control freak.
this week shawn boonstra analyzes the first commandment—“no other gods before me." yet what is a god to us? an idol? it all has to do with the dynamics of creator, created, and the trust that builds or breaks us.

        episode s8:e12  

28 min 30 sec  
an authentic life

        with shawn boonstra  

true freedom or lawful obedience? in the human mind, these concepts are at war, just as modern christian thought severs our lives today from the old testament era: the age of the law (many claim). join shawn boonstra as he unearths the truth—it has always been an age of grace—and the ensuing question: if we’ve never had to buy our salvation, what’s the point of god’s law?
