based in the beautiful columbia river gorge, hood river yacht club is a friendly group of sailors and boaters who enjoy sailing, racing, windsurfing, kiteboarding and pretty much anything else you can do on the water. the club helps sponsor a junior program and adult learn-to-sail classes as well as other community events. here in the gorge, we enjoy sailing in a wide variety of wind and water conditions, from gentle summer evening breezes to epic nuclear blowouts and everything in between. bring your foulies and a sense of adventure and come sail with us!
