randolph county, north carolina
welcome to randolph county! 
our region, known as the heart of north carolina, is one of north carolina’s premium destinations! from the pottery shops of seagrove to the call of the wild at the north carolina zoo, the breezes of the uwharrie mountains, the first family of nascar at petty enterprises, the expanse of linbrook heritage estate, and archdale’s crown jewel, creekside park, there are friendly locals to guide you to what i know will become some of your new favorite places.
observe the remarkable family history and ongoing tradition of pottery in seagrove where genuine potters are creating beautiful one-of-a-kind pieces for you to take home. you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the wood cabin galleries of tableware and folk art pieces; and shops filled with collectible art pieces and historical reproductions.
for the animal lover, your family will love exploring the world’s largest “natural habitat” zoo at the north carolina zoo where you’ll see many majestic creatures, including elephants, gorillas, polar bears, and giraffes.
if you want to learn about the real american south tradition of nascar racing, then check out petty enterprises historic site, home of seven-time champion, richard petty.
for a variety of recreational opportunities, stop by creekside park to play our 18-hole championship disc golf course or follow three miles of walking trails along muddy creek. nearby, tour linbrook hall’s elegant 60 room home, one of the largest in the southeast united states, located atop a hill with sweeping views of the rolling uwharrie mountains.
the heart of north carolina offers an enchanting mix of southern charm, mountain beauty, attractions and events that will leave your heart feeling inspired, exhilarated and energized!
best regards,
darrell frye, chairman
