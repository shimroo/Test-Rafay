about 

bridgefolk is a grassroots movement of mennonites and roman catholics who, through baptism, share the calling of the one who prayed that his followers be one. proceeding through friendship, we come together with humility and courage to celebrate each other’s traditions, explore each other’s practices, and enrich one another’s contributions to the mission of christ’s church. we share our mennonite and roman catholic traditions through worship, dialogue, and action in our common commitment to practices of discipleship, prayer, and gospel nonviolence, while recognizing our distinct understandings of ordinances and sacraments. led by the spirit, we seek sacred spaces to forge new and shared practices of common life, longing for full communion at the lord’s table.
