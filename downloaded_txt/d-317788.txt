missionthe newman centre aims to form an articulate, active and committed catholic laity by actively seeking to integrate the (1) intellectual, (2) spiritual and (3) social facets of human experience. to this end, the newman centre offers a range of activities open to all students, faculty and staff of mcgill university and of neighbouring universities in montreal. the three pillars of our mission converge in our in-residence newman fellowship. students who join the newman fellowship experience a holistic and enriching life of community, fellowship, prayer, growth and support while pursuing academic studies at a university in montreal.














our three pillars.










inspired by the life and work of our patron, saint john henry newman, the newman centre is a place where students are encouraged to explore the relationship between faith and their respective fields of study at mcgill university. 






    intellectual
  










the spiritual life at newman revolves around liturgical life and the sacraments. the newman centre chapel is available for private prayer. in addition to daily mass, we have an rcia program and a catholic priest available for reconciliation.






    spiritual
  










the newman centre is a place of encounter. here, you will forge life-long friendships with people from all over the world. social life at newman includes spontaneous meetings but also a number of planned events through the newman catholic student society (ncss).
