discover waterpower

hydropower

america’s first renewable provides clean, carbon-free energy to roughly 30 million homes, and 40 percent of u.s. renewable electricity, all while providing the flexibility needed to integrate increasing amounts of wind and solar onto the grid.


pumped storage

pumped storage is the nation’s "water battery". representing 92 percent of energy storage in america, it helps to balance the flow of power across transmission networks by absorbing excess when electricity demand is low and releasing it when it increases.


marine energy

marine energy - america’s next gen renewable - consists of wave, tidal, ocean current, riverine, and ocean thermal energy conversion/salinity gradients technologies, all capable of providing predictable, consistent and affordable clean electricity.





 









 

 
















hydropower is clean, renewable energy
