why is there a my chrysler sucks
                    website?
because the world needs one! 
                  people are looking for it!
this site was originally dedicated
                  to the 2000 chrysler 300m that i owned from late 1999 to mid
                  2002.  that's why this site was originally created. 
                  my nightmare with this company and its products is over.
                   i'll never own another vehicle manufactured by
                  daimler-chrysler.
my ownership experience with this
                  vehicle can only be described as it sucked.  my
                  experience with this car and service received from
                  daimler-chrysler in orange county california was the worst i
                  have ever seen in over 35 years of owning and driving
                  vehicles.  it was horrible from the moment i bought it to
                  the day i finally dumped it.  in an attempt to shame the
                  dealer into fixing it, i drove around the los angeles area
                  with signs and license plate frames advertising my website.
not a unique situation i soon
                    learn.
during that time, i realized that i
                  was not alone.  many people contacted me and told me they
                  had the same problems or even worse.  i started to see a
                  pattern.  some contacted me asking for assistance in
                  dealing with their problems.  sadly, i'm not in a
                  position to do much other than maintain this site.
after dumping this pig in 2002, the
                  site remained basically the same over the years.  it was
                  focused solely on my vehicle.  it gradually gained in
                  popularity and i continued to receive email from disgruntled
                  chrysler owners.  now in 2005, i've decided to make it a
                  generic site for all to express their disgust with
                  daimler-chrysler.  if you have something to say about
                  your experience with daimler-chrysler, let me know.  keep
                  it pg rated please.
what sucked?
this particular car and
                  daimler-chrysler 5-star dealer service from two dealerships
                  really did suck.  i can say this with certainty because
                  they were "contemptible or disgusting", the definition of
                  sucks.  it's a statement based on my experience and i
                  think you should know about it.  my experience is not
                  unique.  most contributors to this site have similar or
                  worse to say about their d-c experience.
it sucked because:

  
  there was no obvious customer focus at any
                    level of daimler-chrysler corporation during my ownership
                    experience.
  
  the car had design flaws.  these have
                    been well documented by others and have resulted in numerous
                    recalls and organized efforts by others to have the problems
                    recognized when daimler-chrysler refuses to do anything
                    about it.
  
  the car was full of intermittent problems.
    the vehicle had
                    build quality problems.
    the majority of
                    my problems with this car never got fixed.
    the car had
                    problems that returned after repair.
    almost every
                    problem was ignored or couldn't be duplicated.
    i noticed
                    numerous time the service department didn't bother to write
                    up or properly describe the problems.
    the dealership
                    was very aware of my situation and often visited my web
                    site.
    people claiming
                    to be employees of daimler-chrysler emailed me with abusive
                    remarks.  why not forward them up the chain to
                    management?
    i never received
                    a survey from chrysler asking what i thought of their
                    service.  either they don't do surveys or the dealers
                    scrub the database of "problem" customer names.
    those that did
                    get fixed, more often than not, required more than one visit
                    to the 5 star service department.
    there was no
                    apparent attempt by the dealership to escalate my problems
                    to a higher level.
    if it was
                    escalated, nothing was ever done.
    other than being
                    slightly more courteous, the service was no different at the
                    second dealership.

don't you think that is enough to
                  make most people feel like they own a vehicle that sucks,
                  especially a new vehicle that is the flagship of the company?
i was left with the feeling they
                  didn't care, didn't have to care, and were simply waiting for
                  the warranty to expire so they could get rid of me.. 
                  they were successful.  but it only worked halfway. 
                  i'm gone from the dealerships and manufacturer forever but i'm
                  still here to tell my story and the story of others on this
                  website.
