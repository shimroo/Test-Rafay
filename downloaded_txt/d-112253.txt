âworking and building with dana has been a pleasure i hope more people get to experience. while he usually is the most experienced person in the room, this does not stop him from making sure every one's voice is heard. this quality makes him an outstanding leader.futhermore, his welcoming nature encourages creativity, critical thinking and collaboration from his team. his technical experience and credientials is obviously impressive, but his ability to think outside the box and welcome new ideas is even more impressive to me.â

karim al ansari

âdana love is the person that you want to work for and work with every day. if opportunity to work with him again lined up, i would jump at that chance. dana knows how to push you to get better and without you knowing it, he also gets you to push yourself. he has the presence of mind to allow his team members to try new things and explore different solutions when objections, problems, or obstacles are encountered. although he already knows what needs to be done and what will work best, to him, gaining experience of working through to a solution is part of learning how to avoid those same issues the next time. truly looking out for what is best for the company he will do what he needs to do in order to keep everyone on track until the finish lined is crossed with a win, and then dana will undoubtedly already be thinking and planning for the next finish line so he can get another win.â
