the daily act of remembrance 






										the salute to the fallen							







the last post, the traditional final salute to the fallen, is played by the buglers of the last post association in honour of the memory of the soldiers of the former british empire and its allies, who died in the ypres salient during the first world war (1914-1918). it is the intention of the last post association to maintain this daily act of homage in perpetuity.every evening at exactly 8 o’clock, the police halts the traffic passing under the menin gate memorial to the missing in the belgian city of ieper to allow the buglers to play their simple but moving tribute.everyone can attend this last post ceremony free of charge, without the need for prior reservation, unless you wish to actively participate.
