the time is right





home values are stable in bayside, beechhurst, whitestone, douglaston and flushing. mortgage interest rates are the lowest that they have been in years. if you put off purchasing a home now you will be one of the many saying "i should have bought my home when prices and interest rates were low. if you have good credit and 25 percent downpayment you can take advantage of this market. call me for a look at our inventory of homes priced to sell now.

buyer's market??





if you have been waiting for the right time to purchase a home, condominium or a co-op-this may be the right time. mortgage rates are affordable and financial institutions are receptive to providing loans to purchasers with good credit and who are able to show that they can afford the purchase.inventory has increased and therefor there are more choices for the qualified buyer.motivated sellers understand the current market and are willing to work with a qualified buyer.if you are qualified i advise you to watch for new listings of property since the best value considering price, condition and location move very quickly.find a real estate professional that understands you needs and is willing to spend the time to find the best valued property for you.if i can be of assistance please contact me bob weir at weirrealty@aol.com

commercial real estate





what kind of return are you looking for as a real estate investor? do you think that investing in multi-family residential property is more secure than mixed use or commercial property? what is the minimum and maximum investment period that you think provides the best potential as an investor?

real estate





i am located in bayside queens new york and i really need some help. i do not have enough product to sell. that is i need listings. one of the reasons that our inventory of available homes, condominiums and co-op apartments is so low is that we are very good at marketing and selling properties. the value of property continues to appreciate at an unbelievable rate. however because mortgage interest rates continue to be less than 6% , there are many more buyers than sellers in the real estate market. if you know of anyone that is interested in a free market evaluation in queens county, please have them contact me at weirrealty@aol.com or 718-224-4949.
