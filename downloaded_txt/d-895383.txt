i have been training in grand master dong's school for over 20 years and travel from north carolina on a weekly basis in order to train at the headquarters school. grand master dong has established a very unique and practical system of training which encompasses real-world skills both physical and mental. as a professional instructor and school owner, i have other choices of where to train but there is nowhere else i desire to go. whether you are looking for classes for your child, yourself or your entire family, this school has a program that will meet and exceed your expectations.






patricia m.


our family has enjoyed a twenty-year relationship with grand master dong's karate school, and we can wholeheartedly recommend his schools for anyone seeking not only superb training in the martial arts but in personal development as well.it has always been very important to our family to train in an atmosphere where the leadership is invested in promoting and exemplifying the values of kindness, humility, and respect. it is our observation that gmd's schools uniquely and abundantly claim these essential attributes which are needed for a truly complete education in the martial arts. training in the development of personal integrity, honor, honesty, self-control, and the value of community service are inescapable when one attends his schools.gmd's schools offer a program that trains the whole human being, preparing students to rightly apply the principals mastered with the knowledge and wisdom that was intended for this art form.five solid stars!

my son has been attending dongs karate for a little over 2 years now. we love dongs karate. i have been impressed with what is taught at school as it is more than just self defense that you walk away with. i feel the instructors care about the students not only while they are attending their classes but also outside of class to ensure they are successful at home as well as at school. i would highly recommend dongs karate to anyone interested in learning martial arts.
