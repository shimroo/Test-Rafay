loch lomond



here's another band you ought to know about: loch lomond. they are ex-decemberists tourmates and on the dec's old label, hush records. as you can tell there are many of them. seven, i guess. but they just released an ep on hush called trumpets for paper children. their sound is pretty downbeat, and sounds as if they were singing old scottish folk songs. they have a cd out, paper the walls that i want to check out too. but anyway you can download the ep for free/small donation at hush's website here. here's a track from the ep as a taster.bird and a bear

i don't want to



remember that band soldout i posted on the other day? well digging a little deeper i know a little bit more about them. their newest cd cuts is actually their second lp (there's another disc of remixes and stuff too). the video above comes from their first cd. apparently the track has been remixed several times. but the video above is um amusing? and disturbing.you can find out more about soldout at their label anorak supersport's website. and while you're surfing around check out this video of them playing a track off their new cd called "the cut."

the park



i know pretty much everyone has already seen/heard this but it's just too gorgeous to pass up. justin vernon's voice is perfect for cold weather. i've been listening to his cds on repeat on my walks to school and it clicks very well. and now he goes and covers feist. how awesome would it be if someday in the future they recorded something together?bon iver-the park (feist cover)vernon and feist both appear not once but twice on the dark was the night compilation everyone's buzzing about. pre-order it here.

people got a lotta nerve



okay so i know pretty much all of you have heard this song already but it's for a good cause! i just found this out.neko case has released a new single, "people got a lotta nerve," that is available as a free download at the anti- records website. the record label plans to make a donation to the best friends animal society for every blogger that posts the song and every ilike user who adds it to his or her profile, according to a press release.   the promotion for the song, which is the first single from case's new album, "middle cyclone," will run from jan. 14 to feb. 3. five dollars will be donated for every blog post and $1 for every ilike user that adds the song to their profile. "middle cyclone" will be released march 3. so basically for putting this song on my blog anti- will donate $5 to a good cause, the best friends animal society. so now we know why neko almost always mentions animals in her stuff...anyway go to the song's ilike page and add it to your profile and you'll be helping out too!neko case-people got a lotta nerve

can't stop



ok so i just had to share this. most of you have already heard franz ferdinand's new album tonight (if you haven't, you can stream the whole thing at myspace) but as you may have heard, there's a deluxe edition of the album featuring another disc entitled blood: tonight which features dub versions of several songs off tonight. if you didn't think tonight was dancey enough, check out the dub disc. it's mind-blowing. for sampling, check out the amazing track below. oh, and turn up the bass.die on the floor (can't stop feeling dub)

deep red



what could only be good news really is. deep red is the side project of andrew raposo, morgan wiley & nomi ruiz, all members of 2008 breakout act hercules & love affair. formed while on the road, the band will be playing their very first show in new york this week on the 22nd.if you're desperate to hear new hercules & love affair, you can use these two tracks to try and soothe your jazz-disco needs. deep red's sound is very similar to h&la so, enjoy! and go see them if at all possible!fun girlgood to go

mxsw part 3: selma oxor



also hailing from the beautiful monterrey is selma oxor. the band features, as you can see, two girls and a guy. their rough-edged songs sound like something like a girl band who's influences section on their myspace could be could read: peaches, css, yyys,.they've got the canned drum beats and then some weird organ moans on tracks like "tienes algo," with singer violeta chanting something alongside. the production quality isn't amazing but the potential definitely is there. i'm going to be very excited to see these guys flesh it out live.tienes algosexo morallet's burnabrazame demonio

mxsw part 2: ratas del vaticano



hailing from monterrey, mexico, ratas del vaticano (come on think it out, ratas del vaticano) just might be mexico's answer to the black lips. or the ramones. their grungy and loud guitars definitely are reminiscent of another era, some leftover from the late 70's. but the songs are filled with an intensity (usually in just 1 1/2 - 2 minutes) that'll make you fall in love with the punk asthetic all over again. or maybe even for the first time.tema de las ratasolvidocheck out their myspace for even newer, better songs! i can't wait to see these guys live.
