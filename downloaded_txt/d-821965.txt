 friends 0nlyy. comment here if you`d like to be added.i`ll check out your journal when i get your comment, but if you don't seem like someone who i`d want to be friends w/ then you probally won`t get a reply.basically, if i don't add you back, the two main reasons are because either you annoy me w/ some quirk of yours, or you seem boring ..don't take it personally, though. :)sorry if i sound strickt, but really, i just want to make sure everyone will have a good frienship w/ me when i add them.oh, & please ..read this.it`s kinda important.also, go ahead & feel free to use this post if you need to ask me a question ∨ tell me something important // unimportant. i don`t mind. :dw/ lovee, sam.
