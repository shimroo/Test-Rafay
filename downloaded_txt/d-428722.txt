âi've been going to dr. greg for several years now and i think he's a great dentist! in the past, i have had a bad dentist or two, so i'm not a fan of going for checkups. or i should say i used to be like that. now i have a wonderful dentist who takes care of my teeth!â
 amy l., irving, tx





âentire staff is extremely & genuinely friendly and helpful - from the minute you walk through their door. the doctor himself called me at home after a procedure - just to make sure i was doing ok. i have never experienced this high quality of service before. i am grateful that i found them and would highly recommend their office to anyone needing dental treatment!â
 rand d., southlake, tx




âdr. martin has been my dentist for about 9 years and has been super.  he reworked a crown for me when i first went to him, and i haven't had any trouble with it since.  his work was perfect.  we love our hygienist, lisa.  she is so personable and has become a great friend.  she is always interested in us.  my husband has gone to dr. martin and lisa for over 25 years and would say the same about both, that they're wonderful!â

dental crowns & bridges
restore function & aesthetics
possibly our most versatile treatment options, dental crowns can be used to repair, replace, and renew damaged, lost, or cosmetically flawed teeth. these restorations are custom made, they fit over the top of teeth, and they provide strength, function, and flawless appearance for patients with significantly damaged or decayed teeth. in addition to dental crowns, we also offer a variety of other treatment options including crown-supported fixed bridges, root canal therapy, and dentures.

cosmetic dentistry

dental implants
replace missing teeth
if youâre missing a single tooth or a full arch of teeth, dental implants are an option to consider in renewing function and aesthetics. these small, titanium posts closely resemble screws, and they are implanted below the gum line to mimic the function of tooth roots. dental implant-supported replacements restore the whole tooth, and once in place, a single implant can support a dental crown. several implants can additionally be used for bridge, partial, or full denture treatments.

invisalign® clear braces
straighten your teeth
when you hear braces, do you imagine a mouth full of metal brackets and wires? this used to be the only way to get a straighter, healthier smile. luckily, we have a more cosmetic alternative today â invisalignâ®. this clear alignment tray system allows patients to realign their smiles more quickly, with fewer appointments, and without making significant changes to their diet or oral hygiene plans. get the straight smile you desire without impacting your lifestyle with invisalignâ®.

oral appliances
get the sleep you deserve
do you suffer from sleep apnea but find yourself unable to adjust to cpap therapy? youâre not alone. each year patients choose to use their sleep apnea treatment inconsistently or not all because they find theyâre unable to adjust to the sounds and sensations associated with cpap. if this describes you, let our team talk to you about comfortable, portable oral appliance therapy. these custom-crafted appliances allow patients to breathe deeply and sleep soundly.

we take your dental insurance

            frequently asked dental questions
if youâre looking for a new dentist in grapevine, you probably want to ask questions or address concerns ahead of becoming a new patient. at smiles by martin, we remain dedicated to informing patients to the fullest extent, allowing them to make an educated decision on their familyâs future dental care. below, you can read some of the most common questions we receive, so feel free to take a look as you peruse our website!

how do i find the best place to get work done?

what’s most important is figuring out what your priorities and expectations are ahead of choosing a new dentist. for example, many people confirm if a practice accepts their insurance, fits into their budget, or exists close enough to their home for convenient routine visits. additionally, you’ll want to find out if the practice can meet your needs, whether they be preventive, restorative, or cosmetic in nature. we recommend paying our office a visit so you can get to know the team, dr. martin, and the overall vibe and atmosphere. it’s also encouraged to read our practice’s reviews to hear from other patients!

how much does a checkup and cleaning cost in grapevine?

cost varies based on location, but generally speaking, a checkup and cleaning falls between $200 and $350 within the united states. during these visits, our office starts by looking over patient health history and discussing any concerns you may have upfront. as part of your exam, we typically complete digital x-rays once a year, but may perform additional scans if needed. following the exam, which also includes an oral cancer screening, we clean your teeth of any plaque or tartar deposits, then recommend any treatments we believe you should complete.

what do you do if you can’t afford a dentist?

if you’re putting off routine dental care as a way to save money, we strongly encourage you to reconsider as dentistry is all about prevention first. by investing in your oral health through exams and cleanings, you decrease the chances of needing to spend far more on expensive treatments intended to resolve major oral health problems (i.e. severe tooth decay, infection, etc.) however, those budgeting their dental care without dental insurance should consider either carecredit or citi health, two third-party financing options that let you pay for care over a longer period of time.

how can i make a same-day appointment with a dentist?

please call our office directly if you want to get seen by our team as soon as possible. you’re far more likely to get to speak with a team member when you call vs. sending us an email. you’ll also be able to give our team member more information about your current situation so they can determine the urgency of your dental concern.

how do i get emergency dental care?

call our office as soon as possible if you have an urgent dental issue. if your problem is life-threatening, dial 911 instead. keep in mind that most hospitals cannot address dental emergencies since they lack the professionals and resources to do so. if you have a dental emergency, especially one that is causing significant pain, you should be able to get seen by our office the same day in most cases. at the very least, a team member can provide first-aid tips over the phone to help you manage your situation until you arrive.
