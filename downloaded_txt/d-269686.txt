over 175 years of excellencebishop’s is a predominantly residential, mostly undergraduate university. our primary concern is offering students a quality education in the fine arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, business and education. the residential aspect and our relatively modest size (about 2,900 full-time students) encourages students to immerse themselves in the complete bishop’s experience.
