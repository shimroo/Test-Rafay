upk registration

the orchard park central school district (opcsd) is currently accepting applications for universal pre-kindergarten (upk) for the 2025-2026 school year.   opcsd is once again able to offer upk through a grant provided by the new york state education department. this grant covers the cost of the program but does not cover transportation. it is the responsibility of each family to transport their child to the upk site.    there are only a designated number of upk spots available. a “digital lottery” will determine who will qualify to attend. children are randomly selected for the program and selection is not based on academic or economic need. all registered children are equally eligible for participation.    all students with complete registration before the march 19, 2025 deadline will have an equal chance for selection in the lottery.   click here for more information.

cold weather information

it is a good idea to talk to your child about cold weather safety. it is important to check your child’s (even teenagers') outerwear. protecting exposed skin during cold weather is extremely important: warm coats, hats, gloves, scarves, and boots will help protect your child during the winter season.  when considering the safety of students in cold weather the following information from the national weather service is used as a guideline in making a determination to close schools:  cautionary: wind chills of -18 to -20 degrees advisory: wind chills of -25 degrees or below warning: wind chills of -35 degrees or below  in many areas of the country, schools will not close until the wind chill temperature is at the warning level of -40 degrees or below. the american academy of pediatrics recommends that no one should be outside with unprotected skin with wind-chill factors in the range of -40 degrees or below. in orchard park, if the wind chill temperature reaches above the advisory level, school may be delayed or closed.

girls wrestling at ophs

the 2024-2025 wrestling season marks an exciting milestone for female wrestlers in orchard park and across new york state. orchard park is proud to announce the launch of a dedicated varsity and junior varsity girls’ wrestling team. this team will operate independently from the boys’ wrestling team, offering a focused and specialized environment for female athletes.  for the first time, ophs’ girls’ wrestling team will practice and compete exclusively against other female wrestlers throughout the winter sports season, embracing the "freestyle" format, also known as olympic-style wrestling. this initiative aligns with the rapid growth of girls freestyle wrestling, one of the fastest-growing sports for young women in new york state and nationwide.  historically, female wrestlers in new york have participated on boys’ wrestling teams, training and competing alongside and against their male counterparts. while some schools will continue this practice, a groundbreaking change from the new york state public high school athletic association (nysphsaa) has spurred the creation of separate programs. nysphsaa will now host a sanctioned, girls-only state championship in freestyle wrestling, which requires athletes to qualify through sectional championships dedicated exclusively to female competitors.  orchard park is among the first schools in section 6 to establish a separate girls’ wrestling team. this decision ensures that female wrestlers can train and compete in the freestyle format throughout the entire season, in a space designed specifically for their growth and success.  orchard park is proud to be at the forefront of this exciting movement, providing expanded opportunities for female athletes to thrive and compete.

crayola visits ellicott elementary to reunite former student with artwork created in 1997 with the help of mack hollins

on october 8, ellicott elementary school in orchard park, n.y. welcomed a very special guest – buffalo bills wide receiver mack hollins and representatives from crayola – to celebrate creativity and its importance in students’ lives. the event was part of crayola’s campaign for creativity, which focuses on inspiring children to express themselves through art. hollins, known for his passion for creativity, encouraged students to embrace drawing and dancing as fun ways to show their individuality. one of the highlights of the celebration was the return of a special piece of artwork created by kailey artiles, a former ellicott elementary student. her artwork, made over 25 years ago in 1997, had been safely kept at crayola’s headquarters in pennsylvania. now, it was coming home, showing students the lasting impact creativity can have on their lives. this was part of a larger crayola program that began in 1984, where children’s artwork from across the country was showcased in museums and galleries. in addition to inspiring the students with stories of creativity, crayola made a generous donation of more than $1500 worth of art supplies to ellicott elementary school and the teacher’s desk, a local nonprofit. these supplies will help students continue to explore their creative sides, ensuring that their artistic journeys are just beginning. the day was filled with excitement, art, and the reminder that creativity plays a key role in helping students reach their full potential.
