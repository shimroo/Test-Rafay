bagel me not





gosh knows i love a good everything bagel! they have been the staple of my weekend morning breakfast for years. in the spirit of good health i've switched things up a bit lately. the bagels i desire weigh in at 300 calories before adding toppings. by using a healthier bread (trader joe's california style sprouted wheat) the calorie count starts at 90. the breakfast below features whipped cream cheese, tomatoes, capers, lox and everything bagel seasoning. it comes in under 200 calories total if i use restraint on the cream cheese. the globs of cream cheese i shovel in my pie hole after sandwich making do count! you can add lots of vegetables like cucumber. onion, zucchini and spinach without bumping up the calories. don't stack it too high or the veg might abandon ship before hitting the mouth.

mod pizza 





have not had many blog posts lately, been hanging out on instagram mostly. trying to eat healthy and on a budget excludes a lot of restaurant meals. we stumbled upon a new restaurant in town that has been open for months but stayed under our radar. mod pizza (made on demand)  is staffed with friendly people and  loads of fresh ingredients to make custom pizzas and salads. we very much enjoyed a sizable pizza and enormous salad with leftovers to take home,  all for under $20. mod pizza is a chain and available in several states. lisa was in charge at our novato branch. she makes a mean pie! check it out!

polenta for breakfast





avril made an updated version of what she had as a child, "fried mush." we had polenta last night as a side dish with chicken. the leftover was spread in a square dish and refrigerated. today she cut the solid polenta and sautéed in olive oil and butter. when caramelized she plated, the now soft center polenta, with a honey drizzle and chiffonade of basil. breakfast is served!

pho ramen mash up





it is pouring rain and the skies are grey. this is a soup day if there ever was one. i scoured the pantry and came across a packet of pho broth mix that i had purchased many moons ago. there is always some ramen noodles hanging out, so i put the two together with some roast beef, basil, lime and left over veg. yummy!
