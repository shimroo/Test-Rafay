helping you mold profitscold molds are revolutionary tools that make it easy to produce professional quality ice cream cakes, ice cream pops, ice cream tartufos, and more. cold molds are specially designed for use with ice cream, sorbet, juice fillings, or any other frozen filling. our molds are manufactured using pure silicon rubber, and are specially designed to cure “soft” so that removing frozen cakes or popsicles is exceptionally easy!our molds are practically indestructible. as long as you don’t cut or puncture them, you will find that they last forever. long after you’ve tossed away those old metal molds that will dent, tarnish, break, etc, your cold molds will still look like new.
