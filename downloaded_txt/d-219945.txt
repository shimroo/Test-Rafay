quotes

uselessness 
                                            of worry 
                                            : worrying about your hard work does 
                                            not make the work any easier, and 
                                            it only makes you less strong and 
                                            courageous for doing it.
                                            worrying about some misfortune that 
                                            you cannot help makes the misfortune 
                                            no less and only renders its endurance 
                                            harder. thus far even common sense 
                                            goes. the religion goes further, and 
                                            assures us that even the hard things, 
                                            the obstacles and the hindrances, 
                                            become blessings if we meet them in 
                                            faith, stepping stones upward, disciplinary 
                                            experiences in which we grow ever 
                                            into nobler, stronger life.
quote from 
                                            in green pastures by -j.r. miller, 
                                            d.d.

" children 
                                    represent future, and there can be no future 
                                    with out a present. all our personal and social 
                                    achievements would be futile if we do not 
                                    know that we shall eventually be replaced 
                                    by millions of new beings, by new energy and 
                                    new talents that will take the best we have 
                                    achieved in our days and will pass it down 
                                    to their children to the new generations, 
                                    to those who are destined to make life most 
                                    wonderful. "

                                    net contents of this portal are mainly divided 
                                    in to 3 groups according 
                                    to the age groups viz. up 
                                    to 5 years (royal blooms), 6 
                                    to 11 years (little princes & little princesses),

as 
                                    parents, we’ve always enjoyed vacationing 
                                    with our kids in our timeshare unit. it is 
                                    larger than a hotel room and more luxurious. 
                                    however, recently we’ve been asking what 
                                    is my timeshare worth ? our kids are grown 
                                    and we no longer user the timeshare. hopefully 
                                    the timeshare 
                                    value can put some cash back in our pocket.
