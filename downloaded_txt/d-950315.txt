securesmx® our next generation, secure rtos enables oems to incorporate effective security protection into their devices within reasonable time and cost constraints. it enables dividing software for arm cortex-m microcontroller-based embedded systems into isolated partitions. this achieves high security by limiting hacker invasions so they cannot reach sensitive data, keys, passwords, and other vital information, nor access code or i/o in other partitions. furthermore, it allows focusing scarce programmer talent on strengthening the most critical partitions. read more

      securesmx is based on smx rtos and middleware, which have been used in hundreds of products over 30 years. integrated platforms are available for 150+ boards.
