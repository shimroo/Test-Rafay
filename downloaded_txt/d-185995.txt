what are turmeric and curcumin?



turmeric is a 
golden-orange spice obtained 
from the dried root rhizome of curcuma longa, a 
medicinal herb from the zingiberaceae family of 
ginger plants. the biologically active compound 
within turmeric is curcumin, one of the most studied  

phytochemicals in science. turmeric contains 
2% to 8% curcumin, which we extract and isolate to 95% standardized purity for medical research and nutritional supplementation.

where 
				is our curcumin from?





				since our establishment in 2000, the geographical source of our curcumin 
extract has always been turmeric (curcuma longa) grown in india. within india, we are 
extensively networked with selected pesticide-free farms in the


eastern ghats highlands, known for 
				turmeric with the highest natural 
				curcumin 
content in the world, at 8.8% 
				and the pristine 

				west jaintia hills of meghalaya, india, where lakadong  
				turmeric is one of the world's finest with a curcumin content of 
				about 7.5%. from this high quality all-natural 
				turmeric, we extract curcumin to a minimum 95% 
concentration.





has the safety of curcumin 
95% 
				been established?






the safety, tolerability, and 
				nontoxicity of curcumin at high doses has been well 
established by human clinical trials.  
the 
				
us fda classifies turmeric as
gras (generally 
recognized as safe).  preclinical 
				and clinical studies indicate that curcumin is well tolerated 
				and the overwhelming safety profile of curcumin is evident. 
				before using any herbs or dietary supplements in amounts greater 
				than usually found in foods, consult a health care provider.
				"for centuries, curcumin has been a part of dietary supplements 
				and is widely regarded as safe for consumption from a 
				pharmacological perspective." - 

				scientific reports | 2025
				"according to the results of safety investigations, curcumin is 
				generally considered safe for human consumption. it has also 
				been revealed by several studies that curcumin and the extracts 
				of curcuma longa do not elevate the incidence of 
				adverse events. curcumin is safe for human consumption, even at 
				comparatively high doses, as support from studies conducted in 
				humans indicate that healthy volunteers can tolerate doses of up 
				to 8 grams daily and even 12 grams daily. furthermore, a 
				meta-analysis of 6 human studies including 172 participants 
				found that curcumin substantially reduced circulating c-reactive 
				protein levels when compared to placebo, with no adverse 
				effects. studies on its potential toxicity indicated that it is 
				generally safe, even at larger quantities (up to 12 g in human). 
				according to toxicological studies, curcumin does not cause any 
				discernible mutagenic, teratogenic, or subchronic toxicity 
				damage. furthermore, research conducted by a study group stated 
				that the administration of 8 grams per day of curcumin plus 
				gemcitabine to pancreatic cancer patients was found to be 
				well-tolerated and safe." - 

				pharmaceuticals | 2025
				"curcumin has been shown to be safe up to high concentrations. 
				in a clinical phase i study with 25 patients with high-risk or 
				premalignant lesions, patients received ascending doses of 
				curcumin with initial dose of 500 mg/day and maximal dose of

does piperine improve absorption, enhance
				
				bioavailability, and work synergistically with curcumin?




				 
 
"a combination of curcumin and 
				piperine significantly reduced c-peptide, hba1c, and glucose 
				levels, while higher doses of curcumin (1,000 mg) with piperine 
				increased adiponectin levels, reduced leptin levels, and 
				improved the leptin/adiponectin ratio (panahi et al., 2017). 
				these results illustrate not only the beneficial impact of 
				curcumin on blood glucose and inflammation but also its 
				potential to ameliorate liver markers when combined with 
				piperine." - 

				frontiers in pharmacology | 2024"piperine is 
				known to improve curcumins bioavailability significantly, with 
				studies showing that it can increase absorption by as much as 
				2000%. the enhanced bioavailability is attributed to piperines 
				ability to inhibit enzymes responsible for drug metabolism, thus 
				preventing the rapid breakdown of curcumin in the liver and 
				intestines. this synergy makes curcumin-piperine combinations 
				more effective in therapeutic settings compared to curcumin 
				alone. in breast cancer specifically, piperine not only enhances 
				curcumin absorption but also exhibits its own anticancer 
				properties to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation by 
				inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. the combination of 
				curcumin and piperine has shown promise in preclinical studies, 
				suggesting potential for integrative cancer treatment. studies 
				indicate that this combination may work synergistically with 
				conventional therapies, potentially enhancing the effectiveness 
				of chemotherapy and radiation while reducing their adverse 
				effects. this could be particularly valuable in cases where 
				breast cancer patients experience resistance to standard 
				treatments or have difficulty tolerating high doses of 
				chemotherapeutic drugs. piperine synergistically improves the 
				effectiveness of curcumin as substantiated from published 
				literature." - 

				analysis of curcumin and piperine for breast cancer prevention 
				and treatment | 2024"the association with piperine, an alkaloid derived from black 
				pepper (pipernigrum l), is capable of increasing the 
				bioavailability of some drugs by inhibiting intestinal and 
				hepatic glucuronidation. in humans, administration of 20mg of 
				piperine with 2g of curcumin increased its bioavailability by 
				2000% compared to administration of 2g of curcumin alone. when 
				curcumin (20 and 40mg/kg) was co-administered with piperine 
				(bioavailability enhancer) at a dose of 2.5mg/kg, its 
				pharmacological effects were intensified. piperine is capable of 
				increasing absorption, plasma concentration, and bioavailability 
				of curcumin in both rats and humans without significant side 
				effects. the administration of 20mg/kg of piperine with 2g/kg of 
				curcumin in rats increases its bioavailability by 154% compared 
				to administration of 2g/kg of curcumin alone. piperine is a 
				non-specific drug metabolism inhibitor, with low discrimination 
				between different forms of cytochrome p-450. in rats, orally 
				administered piperine strongly inhibits the hepatic activity of 
				aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (ahh) and udp-glucuronyl 
				transferase, with a potent inhibitory effect on pharmacological 
				metabolism." -

when selecting a

					when each pill actually only contains 750 mg. plaintiff 
					martha valentine says the dietary supplement actually 
					requires three capsules to provide the advertised 2250 mg 
					dosage. she maintains that she was led to believe each of 
					the 180 capsules in the container contains 2250mg of the 
					curcumin supplement after reading and relying on the 
					products label that represented 2250 mg per day of 
					curcumin and 180 vegetarian capsules. she says that at the

					her to take three capsules to reach the full dosage of 2250 
					mg of curcumin, and if she had known the truth regarding 
					naturewises misrepresentations and omissions, she would not 
					have purchased the product. she maintains that this 
					representation led her to believe that each of the capsules 
					contained 2250 mg of the curcumin supplement. however, upon 
					closer inspection of the bottle, naturewise reveals that 
					three capsules must be consumed to provide the 2250 mg per 
					day serving. naturewises misleading representations and 
					omissions lead consumers to pay a premium for the 
					supplements because they falsely believe that they are 
					receiving three times as much curcumin as they actually 
					receive in each bottle. naturewise intentionally fails to 
					adequately disclose to consumers that more than one capsule 
					is required to obtain the labeled dosage amount. defendant

				pharmacology | february 2025our studies proved that curcumin 
				inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer 
				cells in vitro and in vivo using cisplatin as a positive 
				control. curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol, has a variety of 
				pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammation, 
				anti-cancer and anti-oxidation, and is considered to a potential 
				natural product against the growth and metastasis of breast 
				cancer. curcumin is an active polyphenol compound with 
				anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties. we show that 
				curcumin reduced the abilities of migration and invasion of 
				breast cancer cells as well as lung metastasis of breast cancer 
				in nude mice by tead4 induced. tead4 could regulate the 
				transcription level of adhesion molecule fibronectin (fn1), 
				which is an important component of extracellular matrix 
				participating in tumor cell adhesion and migration processes, 
				and the binding of tead4 to the fn1 promoter was suppressed by 
				curcumin. our data elucidated that curcumin inhibited the 
				binding of tead4 to the fn1 promoter and alleviated bc 
				metastasis by regulating tead4 induced cell adhesion. 


turmeric: new study highlights benefits for 
				athletes muscle recoverythe university 
				network | february 2025researchers from the epi4health group 
				at the universitat oberta de catalunya (uoc) have uncovered 
				promising evidence that curcumin  an active component of the 
				turmeric plant  can significantly reduce muscle damage and 
				inflammation following intense physical exercise. both pre- and 
				post-exercise curcumin consumption are associated with better 
				outcomes in terms of muscle recovery, reduced pain and improved 
				antioxidant capacity. curcumin, renowned for its antioxidant and 
				anti-inflammatory properties, is a staple in traditional asian 
				medicine and has been scrutinized in numerous scientific studies 
				for its health benefits. the epi4health study, published in the 
				journal of the international society of sports nutrition, is the 
				latest to affirm curcumins efficacy, especially in the field of 
				sports science. the aim of this study was to assess the 
				scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of curcumin in 
				mitigating exercise-induced muscle damage, such as injuries to 
				muscle fibers, pain and reduced strength, and establish its 
				ability to lower inflammatory markers, improve pain perception 
				and speed up muscle recovery when consumed by trained 
				participants, added popescu-radu. the research points to 
				several crucial factors that influence curcumins effectiveness, 
				including dosage, bioavailability and timing. turmerics active 
				compound curcumin is particularly beneficial when taken 
				immediately after exercise, as it helps in reducing oxidative 
				damage and inflammation triggered by free radicals generated 
				during physical exertion. the effective use of curcumin is 
				contingent upon factors such as dosage, bioavailability and time 
				of consumption, with the most significant benefits seemingly 
				resulting from post-exercise consumption, corresponding author 
				patricia martínez, a dietician and nutritionist and course 
				instructor at uoc, said in the news release. typical suggested 
				doses range from 1 to 4 grams daily, especially beneficial for 
				those involved in eccentric exercises known for causing 
				significant muscle strain. moderate curcumin intake within the 
				established post-exercise dosage range helps improve and speed 
				up muscle recovery, popescu-radu added. however, curcumins 
				absorption and bioavailability depend on its formulation and can 
				be enhanced by other substances like piperine. curcumin could 
				greatly enhance the well-being of those who engage in regular 
				physical training. it may even play a significant role in 
				reducing inflammation biomarkers and improving antioxidant 
				capacity, among other health benefits, the team concluded.

				the authors, the possible benefits of curcumin include 
				mitigating and combating various issues, such as local muscle 
				inflammation and systemic inflammation, as well as oxidative 
				damage resulting from the increased production of free radicals 
				during physical exercise and muscle pain, thus improving the 
				individuals subjective perception of pain and the affected 
				muscle groups range of movement. moderate curcumin intake 
				within the established post-exercise dosage range helps improve 
				and speed up muscle recovery, said popescu-radu. specifically, the experts 
				estimate that a daily curcumin intake of 1-4 grams is enough for 
				people in good health to enjoy these benefits, particularly in 
				relation to eccentric exercise, which tends to be the most 
				damaging to athletes. the effective use of curcumin is 
				contingent upon factors such as dosage, bioavailability and time 
				of consumption, with the most significant benefits seemingly 
				resulting from post-exercise consumption, said martínez. the 
				absorption and bioavailability of curcumin may be affected by 
				the formulation used or the presence of other substances, such 
				as piperine. curcumin could greatly enhance the well-being of 
				those who engage in regular physical training. 

the 
				dynamic role of curcumin in mitigating human illnesses: recent 
				advances in therapeutic applications
				pharmaceuticals | february 2025biochemical and clinical 
				research has identified curcuminthe primary active compound in 
				turmericas possessing significant therapeutic potential. clinical trials have shown that curcumin 
				can decrease inflammatory markers and enhance antioxidant 
				capacities in healthy individuals, improve circulation, chelate 
				metals, and support neurogenesis, among other benefits. 
				curcumins efficacy in preventing the development of disease is 
				shown by its ability to efficiently counteract the effects of 
				reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitrogen species. curcumin 
				inhibits lipid peroxidation and peroxide-induced dna damage via 
				the inhibition of oxidative stress by reducing the production of 
				ros, including the generation of highly reactive free radicals, 
				such as hydroxyl groups, univalent anion oxygen, and singlet 
				oxygen. curcumin modulates many signaling molecules to exert 
				powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects. 
				numerous crucial elements in cellular signal transduction 
				pathways connected to proliferation, differentiation, and 
				malignant transformations have been demonstrated to be inhibited 
				by curcumin. interestingly, curcumin exerts direct antitumor and 
				cytotoxic action by elevating nk cells, cytotoxic cd8+ t cells, 
				and infγ, and by reducing the activity of tregs and mdsc in 
				tumor cells. also, curcumin suppresses tumor progression by 
				reducing tregs and mdsc. it directly suppresses the 
				phosphorylation of akt, leading to a reduction in cellular 
				survival, differentiation, and angiogenesis through the 
				inhibition of gsk3β-mediated stabilization of β-catenin. further 
				inhibition of akt activation leads to the inhibition of 
				transcription factors for inflammatory genes through tsc1/2 and 
				mtorc1 inhibition, thus contributing to the immunomodulatory, 
				anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective actions of curcumin. 
				furthermore, curcumin has been shown to inhibit the adherence of 
				streptococcus mutants to human dental surfaces and the 
				extracellular matrix protein. curcumin suppresses the expression 
				of pseudomonas aeruginosa (pao1) virulence factors, including 
				biofilm formation, pyocyanin biosynthesis, elastase/protease 
				activity, and acyl homoserine lactone (hsl) production. the 
				antimicrobial action of curcumin is multifactorial, including 
				the disruption of cell membrane function, the inhibition of 
				bacterial cell division by binding to ftsz, the induction of 
				bacterial apoptosis, and the induction of phototoxicity due to a 
				photosensitizer under blue-light irradiation. curcumin reduces 
				the bacterial virulence due to the instability of the biofilm 
				structure, increased susceptibility to antibiotics, and the host 
				immune system through the inhibition of a biofilm promotor gene. 
				in addition, it also prevents bacterial growth by disrupting the 
				membrane structures and inhibits dna gyrase, which in turn leads 
				to bacterial lysis. curcumins several antibacterial modes of 
				action have made it a promising candidate for overcoming 
				bacterial resistance and serving as an effective addition to 
				antimicrobial therapy.

				 the 
				efficacy of curcumin in reducing immunosuppressive states of 
				peripheral blood mononuclear cells extracted from oral squamous 
				cell carcinoma patients: an in vitro study
				cureus | february 2025curcumin is currently being evaluated 
				in numerous in vitro and in vivo studies to determine its 
				anti-cancer properties and its role as a chemo-adjuvant for 
				various cancer types. the immunomodulatory effects of curcumin 
				have emerged as a novel area of research, focusing on its 
				potential as an immunotherapy adjuvant. notably, curcumin is 
				safe, non-toxic, and highly acceptable, which will facilitate 
				the development of immunotherapy regimens for patients with oral 
				squamous cell carcinoma. curcumin reduced the levels of pd-1 and 
				pd-l1 in pbmc lysates, with a more substantial effect in stage 4 
				cases with metastasis compared to localized disease and 
				controls. thus, curcumin may prove beneficial as an adjuvant 
				therapy for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma treated 
				with immunotherapy against pd-1 and pd-l1.




the anti-proliferative effects of curcumin in 
				colorectal cancer cell lines: targeting the hippo and rap1 
				signaling pathwaysmedical oncology | 
				january 2025treatment with curcumin resulted in a 
				significant reduction in cell viability in ht-29 and hct-116 
				colorectal cancer cell lines, thereby facilitating apoptotic 
				cell death. furthermore, curcumin administration was associated 
				with the upregulation of lpar1 and adcy9 gene expression, while 
				concurrently downregulating axin2, myc, tead4, and met in both 
				cell lines. this study reveals compelling evidence of curcumin's 
				potent anticancer properties, highlighting its transformative 
				influence on the hippo and rap1 signaling pathways within 
				colorectal cancer cells. these findings not only underscore

exploring the role of curcumin in mitigating 
				oxidative stress to alleviate lipid metabolism disorders
				frontiers in pharmacology, ethnopharmacology | january 2025
				curcumin is a widely studied bioactive metabolite with medicinal 
				properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
				antitumor effects, which have attracted significant attention in 
				scientific research. this paper provides a comprehensive 
				analysis of the research progress on curcumin in attenuating 
				oxidative stress and regulating lipid metabolism disorders and 
				related diseases. curcumin, a natural polyphenolic metabolites, 
				has been shown in a systematic review of the literature to 
				significantly reduce oxidative stress and exhibit antioxidant 
				effects through multiple biological pathways, including 
				inhibition of reactive oxygen species generation, upregulation 
				of antioxidant enzyme expression, and regulation of lipid 
				metabolism-related gene expression. these findings not only 
				enhance our understanding of curcumins biological activities 
				but also offer a scientific basis for the development of novel 
				therapeutic strategies against hyperlipidemia, nafld, 
				atherosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity. curcumin exhibits 
				significant therapeutic effects, regulating blood lipids and 
				blood glucose levels, improving insulin resistance, alleviating 
				vascular endothelial dysfunction, inhibiting fatty acid 
				synthesis, promoting fat conversion, protecting the liver from 
				oxidative stress damage, and promoting liver repair. 
				curcumin, known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
				properties, has been shown to enhance cellular antioxidant 
				activity, mitigate oxidative stress, and alleviate lipid 
				metabolism disorders by reducing reactive oxygen species (ros) 
				accumulation. these effects include decreasing fat deposition, 
				increasing fatty acid uptake, and improving insulin sensitivity. 
				a review of the existing literature reveals numerous studies 
				emphasizing the role of curcumin in the prevention and 
				management of metabolic diseases. curcumin influences metabolic 
				disorders through multiple mechanisms of action, with the 
				oxidative stress pathway playing a central role in various lipid 
				metabolism disorders. notably, the article reviews the role of 
				curcumin in mitigating oxidative stress and in preventing and 
				treating diseases associated with lipid metabolism disorders, 
				including hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
				(nafld), atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes, thereby 
				highlighting the therapeutic potential of curcumin in lipid 
				metabolism-related diseases. curcumin, exhibits numerous health 
				benefits and pharmacological properties (yin et al., 2022). 
				numerous experimental studies from diverse methodologies have 
				demonstrated curcumins anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
				lipid-modulating properties (helli et al., 2021; lopresti et 
				al., 2021; pivari et al., 2022), improvement of insulin 
				resistance (thota et al., 2020), inhibition of tumor cell 
				proliferation and metastasis (zhang z. et al., 2016), among 
				other effects. these positive pharmacological effects highlight 
				curcumins considerable potential in treating related diseases. 
				curcumin works by modulating key oxidative stress pathways to 
				enhance cellular antioxidant activity while attenuating 
				oxidative stress effects (ashrafizadeh et al., 2020; rahban et 
				al., 2020). this makes it an important candidate for the 
				treatment of several oxidative stress-related diseases. 
				curcumins pleiotropic and multi-targeted effects make it a 
				highly attractive and beneficial polyphenolic metabolites. 
				curcumins oxidative properties enable it to scavenge ros in 
				vivo, conferring antioxidant activity in normal cells 
				(priyadarsini, 2014). 


curcumin as a potential inhibitor of tgfβ3 
				computational insights for breast cancer therapy
				scientific reports | january 2025our investigation 
				highlights curcumin as a promising inhibitor against tgfβ3 in 
				breast cancer. previous research has extensively documented the 
				properties and effects of curcumin. curcumin 
				(1,7-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-hepta-1,6-diene-3,5-dione), 
				also known as diferuloylmethane, stands as the primary 
				constituent of turmeric, derived from the rhizome of curcuma 
				longa, a plant native to southeast asia and part of the 
				zingiberaceae family (ginger family). turmeric contains 
				curcuminoids, which include curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and 
				bisdemethoxycurcumin. curcumin, constituting approximately 25% 
				of turmeric, not only provides the spice its characteristic 
				yellow hue but also accounts for a significant portion of its 
				therapeutic properties. in addition to its use as a flavoring 
				and coloring ingredient in food, turmeric has held a prominent 
				place in ayurvedic medicine due to its analgesic, antioxidant, 
				antiseptic, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory attributes. over 
				the past two decades, extensive research has elucidated the 
				significance of various functional groups in mediating the 
				biological activities of curcumin. key structural features 
				contributing to its activity include the o-methoxyphenol group 
				and methylenic hydrogen, which play pivotal roles in its 
				antioxidant properties. these groups enable curcumin to donate 
				electrons or hydrogen atoms to neutralize reactive oxygen 
				species, thereby mitigating oxidative stress. curcumin displayed 
				favourable binding affinities at the tgfβ3 binding pocket, 
				forming key interactions such as hydrogen bonds with residues 
				like asp323, arg325, val333, his334, pro336, lys337, gly393, and 
				arg394. these data suggest curcumin may inhibit tgfβ3, providing 
				a framework for developing new compounds targeting this protein. 
				these in silico findings collectively suggest curcumins 
				potential as a credible inhibitor for tgfb3 in breast cancer.


curcumin, a compound in turmeric, significantly 
				reduces muscle damage and speeds up recovery post-exercise.
				the university network | january 2025a review of the 
				scientific literature by the uoc has concluded that consuming 
				moderate amounts of curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, 
				may facilitate muscle recovery and alleviate pain following 
				strenuous physical exercise its benefits include reducing local 
				inflammation and oxidative damage, and improving subjective pain 
				perception. now, researchers in the epi4health group at the 
				universitat oberta de catalunya (uoc) have found that turmeric 
				and its related products, such as curcumin, may be able to 
				reduce muscle damage and inflammation in the musculoskeletal 
				system following vigorous physical exercise. "both pre- and 
				post-exercise curcumin consumption are associated with better 
				outcomes in terms of muscle recovery, reduced pain and improved 
				antioxidant capacity", said daniel vasile popescu-radu. hundreds 
				of scientific studies have demonstrated the benefits and 
				potential of curcumin, particularly as regards its properties. 
				in fact, this supplement is well-known for its antioxidant and 
				anti-inflammatory properties. however, the experts' novel 
				contribution is the confirmation of these findings in the realm 
				of sports through a review of the scientific literature, which 
				was recently published in open access in the journal of the 
				international society of sports nutrition. "the aim of this 
				study was to assess the scientific evidence regarding the 
				effectiveness of curcumin in mitigating exercise-induced muscle 
				damage, such as injuries to muscle fibres, pain and reduced 
				strength, and establish its ability to lower inflammatory 
				markers, improve pain perception and speed up muscle recovery 
				when consumed by trained participants", said popescu-radu. 
				according to the authors, the possible benefits of curcumin 
				include mitigating and combating various issues, such as local 
				muscle inflammation and systemic inflammation, as well as 
				oxidative damage resulting from the increased production of free 
				radicals during physical exercise and muscle pain, thus 
				improving the individual's subjective perception of pain and the 
				affected muscle group's range of movement. "moderate curcumin 
				intake within the established post-exercise dosage range helps 
				improve and speed up muscle recovery," said popescu-radu, who 
				also explained that "there's always room for professional 
				supervision, as an expert can adjust the dosage and timing of 
				intake to optimize its benefits." specifically, the experts 
				estimate that a daily curcumin intake of 1-4 grams is enough for 
				people in good health to enjoy these benefits, particularly in 
				relation to eccentric exercise, which tends to be the most 
				damaging to athletes. the absorption and bioavailability of 
				curcumin may be affected by the formulation used or the presence 
				of other substances, such as piperine. curcumin could greatly 
				enhance the well-being of those who engage in regular physical 
				training. it may even play a significant role in reducing 
				inflammation biomarkers and improving antioxidant capacity, 
				among other health benefits.




curcumin reverses cognitive deficits through 
				promoting neurogenesis and synapse plasticity via the 
				upregulation of psd95 and bdnf in mice
				nature | january 2025curcumin not only improved the memory 
				impairment but also reversed the neuronal degeneration caused by 
				long-term hypoxia. at the molecular level, curcumin was proved 
				to promote neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity through 
				up-regulating postsynaptic structural proteins psd95 and homer1, 
				and neurotrophic factors protein bdnf. taken together, we 
				believe these findings collectively demonstrate that curcumin is 
				a promising and effective agent for treatment of hypoxic-induced 
				neurological disorders. studies have shown that curcumin 
				improves the spatial learning and memory abilities of the 
				alzheimers disease model mice20 and reduces cell apoptosis and 
				stimulates neurogenesis by downregulating caspase-3 mrna21. in 
				addition, the significant biological function and 
				neuroprotective effects of curcumin in parkinsons disease occur 
				via the activation of bdnf. curcumin has been reported to 
				stimulate neurogenesis and reduce neuronal degeneration. at the 
				molecular level, curcumin was found to promote the expression of 
				brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and postsynaptic 
				density protein 95 (psd95). the results of primary hippocampal 
				neuron detection showed that curcumin could promote dendritic 
				growth. in conclusion, our study indicates that curcumin, 
				increased bdnf and psd95 expression and contacted with 
				interneurons, salvaged of interneurons may normalize ambient 
				neuroplasticity, resulting in the preservation of neurogenesis 
				processes as well as contributing to improve cognitive 
				performance. curcumin has been widely confirmed to have a 
				beneficial effect on cognitive functions in neurodegenerative 
				diseases. the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
				neuroprotective properties of curcumin, found in turmeric, have 
				demonstrated promise. whats more, scholars have found that 
				curcumin in concentrating on hemorrhagic lesions by promoting 
				neurogenesis, and improving motor functions. rat offspring who 
				are exposed to an amorphous formula of curcumin from the 
				embryonic stage have anti-anxiety-like behaviors, enhanced fear 
				extinction learning, and increased synaptic plasticity in the 
				hippocampal dg51. in our study, we found that curcumin promotes 
				synaptic plasticity and improves cognitive dysfunction in 
				normobaric-hypoxic brain injury model mice by significantly 
				upregulating psd95 and homer1. from this, we hypothesize that 
				curcumin is more effective as a compensation mechanism. in 
				summary, our study demonstrated that curcumin effectively 
				reverses memory impairment by virtue of its facilitating role in 
				neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. the observed beneficial 
				effects are probably attributable to a novel mechanism for the 
				neuroprotective action of curcumin mediated by a up-regulation 
				of synaptic proteins, such as psd95 and homer1, that leads to an 
				increase in interneuron survival following hypoxic-induced 
				neurodegeneration, possibly resulting from increased bdnf 
				expression and contact with interneurons. moreover, previous 
				authorization of curcumin for clinical application is expected 
				to pave the way for its therapeutic use in the treatment of 
				hypoxic-related diseases.


curcumin enhances the anti-obesogenic activity of 
				orlistat through skn-1/nrf2-dependent regulation of nutrient 
				metabolism in caenorhabditis elegansnature 
				- international journal of obesity | january 2025evidence 
				suggests curcumin impacts obesity and metabolic disorders by 
				modulating gut microbiota composition, increasing energy 
				expenditure, and regulating lipid metabolism. our findings 
				reveal that the orlistat/curcumin combination exerts an 
				anti-obesogenic effect through skn-1/nrf2-dependent regulation 
				of conserved genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism 
				in c. elegans. the hybrid combination of orlistat and curcumin 
				demonstrates significant anti-obesity activity by regulating 
				nutrient-sensing pathways through skn-1/nrf-2 modulation. this 
				approach may allow for the reduction of orlistat dosage, thereby 
				minimizing its adverse effects while maintaining its therapeutic 
				efficacy. 

				 curcumin: 
				a golden approach to healthy aging: a systematic review of the 
				evidencenuitrients | january 2025by 
				targeting key pathways involved in inflammation,  oxidative 
				stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, curcumin demonstrates 
				significant benefits in improving cognitive function, reducing 
				neurodegeneration, and enhancing muscle health in the elderly 
				population. overall, the evidence presented in this review 
				supports the notion that curcumin holds promise as a valuable 
				adjunct in the management of age-related disorders, offering a 
				natural and potentially effective approach to enhancing the 
				quality of life in aging individuals. curcumin has shown 
				positive effects in delaying the aging process and delaying 
				age-related changes. its potential anti-aging properties are due 
				to its power to alter the levels of proteins associated with 
				senescence, such as adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein 
				kinase (ampk) and sirtuins, and preventing pro-aging proteins, 
				such as nuclear factor-kappa-b (nf-κb) and mammalian target of 
				rapamycin (mtor) [41]. numerous studies have demonstrated 
				mechanisms by which curcumin can act on the aging process; one 
				of them investigated the molecular mechanism of curcumin in 
				extending the lifespan of c. elegans, and the results 
				of the study indicated that this action potentially occurred 
				through increased resistance to os and negative regulation of 
				the ampk signaling pathway. another study demonstrated how 
				long-time curcumin therapy can progressively reverse cognitive 
				dysfunction in d-gal-induced senescent mice, delaying the aging 
				process, improving locomotor activity and cognitive functions, 
				and restoring mitochondrial enzyme complex function. it was 
				further reported that curcumin supplementation rejuvenates 
				senescence-related changes in the thymus among senescent mice 
				caused by d-gal through promoting proliferating cells, 
				protecting cells from apoptosis, and elevating transcription of 
				the autoimmune regulator. curcumin can inhibit the formation of 
				free radicals and other pro-inflammatory biomarkers related to 
				age-related diseases. as a dietary phenolic compound, curcumin 
				is useful for longevity through declining os, modulating signal 
				transduction, and gene expression. curcumin can extend shelf 
				life by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and also increasing 
				antioxidant activities. numerous studies have shown that 
				curcumin has relevant effects on cognitive function. as noted 
				above, using curcumin as a drug therapy adjuvant shows several 
				neurological benefits, including preserving and improving memory 
				and learning, as seen in research using rodents with 
				neurological deficits. 


effect of curcumin on breast cancer cells through 
				mir-145-5p and its target genesjournal of 
				istanbul faculty of medicine | january 2025studies have 
				shown curcumin to be able to successfully inhibit the 
				proliferation of different cancerous cells by acting on 
				mir-145-5p, such as in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and in 
				human prostate cancer stem cells. by modifying the expression of 
				different signaling proteins and molecular pathways, curcumin 
				suppresses the proliferation of breast cancer cells. 
				curcumin exerts a strong anticancer impact on bc mcf- 7 cells by 
				suppressing cellular growth. in vitro and in vivo
				studies have shown curcumin to have anticancer effects on 
				various tumors by reducing the proliferation and migration of 
				cells and by inducing apoptosis. recent studies have suggested 
				curcumin to be able to act as an epigenetic regulator in several 
				cancers by acting on non-coding rnas curcumin is considered an 
				epigenetic regulator with anticancer effects. curcumin treatment 
				and overexpression of mir-145- 5p via the transfection of an 
				mir-145-5p mimic significantly decreased the proliferation and 
				migration of mcf-7 cells. moreover, curcumin treatment 
				significantly increased the expression of mir-145-5p. the 
				possible target genes of mir-145- 5p (i.e., mcm2, mmp1, mmp9, 
				eef1a2) were downregulated in curcumin-treated mcf-7 cells. 
				curcumin inhibits the proliferation and migration of mcf-7 cells 
				by acting on mir-145-5p and its possible target genes. numerous 
				molecular mechanisms have demonstrated the impact of natural 
				nutritional sources such as curcumin on cellular 
				processes.curcumin has been utilized for an extensive period to 
				address issues regarding the gastrointestinal tract, liver, 
				respiratory system, and sinusitis; to promote wound healing; and 
				to alleviate pain and burning sen- sations. studies have 
				demonstrated the pharmacological properties of curcumin, 
				including its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, cell 
				death-inducing, and anticarcinogenic effects in various 
				diseases. the findings have shown curcumin treatment and the 
				overexpression of mir-145-5p to decrease the proliferation of 
				mcf-7 cells as well their migration. additionally, the relative 
				expression level of the tumor suppressor mirna mir-145-5p was 
				significantly elevated in the curcumin-treated cells. curcumin 
				treatment reduced the relative expression of the putative 
				mir-145-5p target genes mcm2, mmp1, mmp9, and eef1a2. the 
				current results suggest curcumin treatment and mir-145- 5p 
				overexpression to both markedly suppress mcf-7 cell 
				proliferation and migration by modulating the expression of the 
				mcm2, mmp1, and mmp9 genes.


the beneficial effects of curcumin on aging and 
				age-related diseases: from oxidative stress to antioxidant 
				mechanisms, brain health and apoptosis
				frontiers in aging neuroscience | january 2025curcumin is a 
				widely-used dietary supplement against various diseases such as 
				cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and aging. curcumin 
				exhibits a variety of pharmacological properties which have made 
				it a proper candidate as a preventive or therapeutic agent in 
				numerous health conditions, including but not limited to 
				diseases of pulmonary, autoimmune, renal, cardiovascular 
				atherosclerosis, different types of cancer, biliary and hepatic 
				disorders, diabetes, wound healing, and chronic inflammation. at 
				cellular and molecular level, curcumin is able to regulate 
				various signaling and signal molecules, such as cytokines, 
				transcription factors, enzymes, growth factors, apoptotic 
				proteins, inflammatory mediators, protein kinases, and cell 
				cycle proteins (carolina alves et al., 2019; leiherer et al., 
				2013; prasad et al., 2014). curcumin decelerates aging through 
				affecting oxidative stress.  regarding age-related 
				diseases, curcumin has shown a variety of antiaging effects by 
				modulating the expression of proteins that are involved in 
				aging, such as ampk and sirtuins, while suppressing the 
				expression of proteins that enhance aging, such as mtor and 
				nf-κb.  in cancer, curcumin can induce apoptosis in a 
				variety of different tumor cell lines. curcumin also activates 
				redox reactions within cells inducing ros production that leads 
				to the upregulation of apoptosis receptors on the tumor cell 
				membrane. curcumin can also upregulate the expression and 
				activity of p53 that inhibits tumor cell proliferation and 
				increases apoptosis. furthermore, curcumin has a potent 
				inhibitory effect on the activity of nuclear factor kappa b 
				(nf-κb) and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), which are involved in the 
				overexpression of antiapoptosis genes such as bcl-2. it can also 
				attenuate the regulation of antiapoptosis phosphoinositide 
				3-kinases (pi3k ) signaling and increase the expression of 
				mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks) to induce endogenous 
				production of ros. 


curcumin inhibits the development of pancreatic 
				cancer by targeting the circ_0079440/mir-522-3p/eif4a1 pathway
				cell biochemistry and biophysics | january 2025curcumin is a 
				natural polyphenol with anti-tumor activity against different 
				cancers, including pancreatic cancer. curcumin has been verified 
				to mediate the expression of circular rnas (circrnas) to inhibit 
				tumor development. results showed that curcumin suppressed cell 
				proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities, and 
				weakened epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a 
				concentration-dependent way. circ_0079440 was expressed at a 
				high level in pancreatic cancer and its level was reduced via 
				curcumin administration in pancreatic cancer cells.  
				furthermore, in the xenograft mouse models, curcumin treatment 
				inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, and circ_0079440 
				upregulation reversed the function of curcumin. to sum up, 
				curcumin suppresses pancreatic cancer development by targeting 
				the circ_0079440/mir-522-3p/eif4a1 pathway, which might provide 
				novel therapeutic targets for treatment of pancreatic cancer.


curcumin attenuates neuroinflammatory damage induced 
				by lps: implications for the role of s100b
				the journal of nutritional biochemistry | january 2025
				curcumin gained attention due to its capacity to cross the 
				blood-brain barrier and its well-described anti-inflammatory and 
				antioxidant activities. curcumin reaches the central nervous 
				system, prevents the locomotory damage caused by lps, and 
				reduces inflammatory signaling via il-1β and cox-2. furthermore, 
				we observed that curcumin was protective against lps-induced 
				s100b secretion in the cerebrospinal fluid and gsh reduction in 
				the hippocampal tissue. our results indicate that oral curcumin 
				administration exerts a protective anti-inflammatory action in 
				the central nervous system, attenuating the sickness behavior 
				induced by icv lps. this work demonstrates that curcumin has an 
				important modulative effect on astrocytes, thus suggesting that 
				astrocytes are critical to the anti-inflammatory effects of 
				curcumin. the ability of curcumin to cross the bbb aside from 
				its well-established antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects 
				turned this molecule into a target for developing new 
				pharmacological strategies to protect the brain from 
				inflammatory damage. curcumin was shown to attenuate 
				inflammatory responses in animal models by diminishing 
				inflammatory cytokine production and thus preventing behavioral 
				alterations caused by neuroinflammation such as weight 
				reduction, lethargy, and anhedonia. oral curcumin undergoes 
				extensive intestinal and hepatic metabolism, resulting in rapid 
				clearance from the body. lps, a component of the cell wall of 
				gram-negative bacteria, is largely used to provoke a

curcumin prevents neurodegeneration by blocking 
				hdac6nlrp3 pathway-dependent neuroinflammation in parkinsons 
				diseaseinternational immunopharmacology | 
				january 2025curcumin, a neuroinflammation inhibitor, blocks 
				neurodegeneration via the hdac6nlrp3 pathway and represents a 
				potentially practical pharmacological approach for treating 
				neuroinflammation-driven neurodegenerative diseases. the main 
				focus is on studying the mechanisms by which curcumin and its 
				related active components play a positive role in 
				neurodegenerative diseases. curcumin can promote the clearance 
				of α-synuclein by activating autophagy and ultimately reducing 
				dopaminergic neuron damage. in addition, curcumin can reduce 
				aflatoxin-induced liver apoptosis and oxidative stress by 
				regulating the nlrp3 inflammasome. the anti-inflammatory 
				properties of curcumin have been supported by numerous 
				preclinical and clinical studies of a variety of inflammatory 
				diseases. curcumin alleviates the degeneration of neurons in 
				parkinsons disease by reducing the activation of nlrp3-mediated 
				inflammatory responses both in vivo and vitro.curcumin could 
				prevent neuronal death and degeneration in a parkinsons disease 
				model, attenuate the overactivation of the nlrp3 inflammasome, 
				and reduce hdac6 levels. this therapeutic effect has been 
				confirmed in both in vivo and in vitro experiments.  
				curcumin affected the interrelationship between hdac6 and nlrp3 
				and restored nlrp3 acetylation levels. in summary, this study 
				elucidated the protective effect of curcumin on parkinsons 
				disease and its ability to mitigate the activation of the nlrp3 
				inflammasome by blocking hdac6. furthermore, in parkinsons 
				disease models, hdac6 directly regulated the deacetylation of 
				nlrp3 and inhibited its degradation through autophagy, which may 
				be a new target for the treatment of neuroinflammation in 
				patients with parkinsons disease.

				study by yang et al elucidates the therapeutic mechanisms of 
				curcumin in gastric cancer treatment, identifying key targets 
				and confirming their interactions with curcumin through 
				molecular docking. this study provides a solid foundation for 
				further exploration of curcumins role in gastric cancer 
				therapy. the inhibitory effects of curcumin on gastic cancer-823 
				cells contribute to further evidence for the use of curcumin in 
				cancer therapy. the cross-analysis with gastic cancer disease 
				targets successfully identified multiple key genes associated 
				with curcumin, laying the foundation for subsequent experimental 
				validation, and providing a powerful tool for the modernization 
				of research into natural medicinal materials. the identification 
				of key genes such as esr1 and egfr, along with the validation of 
				curcumins binding affinity through molecular docking, presents 
				a significant advancement in the field. in vitro experiments 
				demonstrated that curcumin effectively inhibits the growth and 
				proliferation of gastic cancer-823, suggesting its therapeutic 
				potential in gastic cancer through multiple targets and 
				pathways.




effect of curcumin on breast cancer cells through 
				mir-145-5p and its target genesjournal of 
				istanbul faculty of medicine | december 2024in vitro 
				and in vivo studies have shown curcumin to have 
				anticancer effects on various tumors by reducing the 
				proliferation and migration of cells and by inducing apoptosis. 
				curcumin exerts a strong anticancer impact on breast cancer 
				mcf-7 cells by suppressing cellular growth. recent studies have 
				suggested curcumin acts as an epigenetic regulator in several 
				cancers on non-coding rnas.  curcumin is considered an 
				epigenetic regulator with anticancer effects. curcumin treatment 
				and overexpression of mir-145-5p via the transfection of an 
				mir-145-5p mimic significantly decreased the proliferation and 
				migration of mcf-7 cells. moreover, curcumin treatment 
				significantly increased the expression of mir-145-5p. the 
				possible target genes of mir-145-5p (i.e., mcm2, mmp1, mmp9, 
				eef1a2) were downregulated in curcumin-treated mcf-7 cells. 
				additionally, mir-145-5p mimictransfected cells showed low 
				expression levels of the mcm2, mmp1, and mmp9 genes. curcumin 
				inhibits the proliferation and migration of mcf-7 cells by 
				acting on mir-145-5p and its possible target genes.

therapeutic effects of curcumin supplementation on 
				liver enzymes of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients
				food science & nutrition | december 2024the findings of this 
				systematic review and meta-analysis support the potential effect 
				of curcumin on the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver 
				disease. curcuminoids, the main ingredients of turmeric extract, 
				are considered safe and beneficial compounds for various 
				diseases (kalhori et al., 2022). for example, turmeric has 
				positive effects on the management of metabolic syndrome, 
				anxiety, hyperlipidemia, arthritis, and oxidative and 
				inflammatory conditions (hewlings & kalman, 2017; musazadeh, 
				golandam, et al., 2022; musazadeh, roshanravan, et al., 2022; 
				naghsh et al., 2023). moreover, it has been shown that curcumin 
				possesses therapeutic advantages when it comes to oral mucosal 
				diseases, periodontal diseases, and mouth neoplasms (tang et 
				al., 2021). pooled results from a systematic review and 
				meta-analysis of rcts indicated that curcumin had a significant 
				reducing effect on ast and alt in patients with nonalcoholic 
				fatty liver disease (jalali et al., 2020). the present 
				meta-analysis indicated a significant association between 
				curcumin supplementation and a decrease in alt and ast levels in 
				patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld). in 
				conclusion, the current systematic review and meta-analysis 
				indicate that curcumin therapy could potentially decrease alt 
				and ast in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients, with no 
				significant changes in alp. 


				curcumin: epigenetic modulation and tumor immunity in antitumor 
				therapyplanta medica | december 2024
				curcumin is the main ingredient of the turmeric rhizome, used to 
				treat tumors, diabetes, inflammation, neurodegenerative 
				diseases, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and liver 
				diseases. the antitumor effects of curcumin have received even 
				more attention. one of the main mechanisms of antitumor effects 
				includes inhibition of tumor invasion and migration, induction 
				of tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibition of various cell 
				signaling pathways. it has been found that the antitumor 
				biological activity of curcumin in the body is associated with 
				epigenetic mechanisms. that also implies that curcumin may act 
				as a potential epigenetic modulator to influence the development 
				of tumor diseases. curcumin has been found to have significant 
				regulatory effects on tumor immunity and is expected to be a 
				novel adjuvant for tumor immunity. this paper summarizes the 
				antitumor effects of curcumin from four aspects: molecular and 
				epigenetic mechanisms of curcumin against a tumor, mechanisms of 
				curcumin modulation of tumor immunotherapy, reversal of 
				chemotherapy resistance, and novel drug delivery system of 
				curcumin, which provide new directions for the development of 
				new antitumor drugs.




nrf2 depletion enhanced curcumin therapy effect in 
				gastric cancer by inducing the excessive accumulation of ros
				scientific reports - nature | december 2024our study proved 
				that curcumin reduced gastic cancer cells growth by triggering 
				ros and shielded gastric cancer cells from ros damage by 
				activating the keap1-nrf2 signaling pathway. turmerics rhizome 
				contains a polyphenolic component called curcumin, which has 
				been demonstrated to inhibit a variety of tumor cells, such as 
				pancreatic, colon, lung and gastric cancers. its pharmacological 
				properties span a wide spectrum, such as anti-inflammatory, 
				antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant and antitumor activities. 
				in recent years, several studies have demonstrated that curcumin 
				has toxic effects on several malignant tumors. for example, 
				curcumin regulated p38/mapk phosphorylation by inducing ros 
				production, which triggered apoptosis in chemotherapy-resistant 
				lung cancer cells. in bladder cancer, curcumin inhibited 
				microrna-7641 to mediate p16 upregulation to promote apoptosis.  
				curcumin has been shown to have anticancer effects on gc14,15. 
				in addition, curcumin can be used in the prevention and 
				treatment of colorectal cancer and has shown good efficacy and 
				oral safety in clinical studies. curcumin combined with nrf2 
				knockdown significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice 
				transplanted with ags cells. 




anticancer efficacy of curcumin and doxorubicin 
				combination treatment inducing s-phase cell cycle arrest in 
				triple-negative breast cancer cells: an in vitro study
				cureus | december 2024the present in vitro study showed the 
				potential growth-inhibitory activities of curcumin against human 
				breast cancer cells (mda-mb-231). curcumin has drawn the 
				researchers interest due to its wide range of anti-oxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic properties. various studies 
				have reported that curcumin acts as an anticancerous compound 
				against breast cancers to induce cell cycle arrest at various 
				phases by decreasing cdc25 and cdc2 and increasing the 
				expression of the p21 gene. curcumin synergistically 
				chemo-sensitizes the anticancer activity of doxo and enhances 
				the responses toward conventional chemotherapy attenuating 
				breast cancer.


curcumin on human health: a comprehensive systematic 
				review and meta-analysis of 103 randomized controlled trials
				phytotherapy research | december 2024the aim of this 
				meta-analysis was to determine the effect of curcumin on a range 
				of health outcomes. the credibility of the evidence was rated as 
				high for fasting blood sugar (fbs), c-reactive protein (crp), 
				high-density lipoprotein (hdl), and weight. the remaining 
				outcomes presented moderate (waist circumference [wc], hip 
				circumference [hc], body mass index [bmi], insulin, homeostatic 
				model assessment for insulin resistance [homa-ir], quantitative 
				insulin-sensitivity check index [quicki], leptin, gamma-glutamyl 
				transferase [ggt], glutathione [gsh], and superoxide dismutase 
				[sod]), low (14 outcomes), or very low (14 outcomes) evidence. 
				in conclusion, curcumin supplementation can modify fbs and some

evaluation of curcumin intake in reducing 
				exercise-induced muscle damage in athletes: a systematic review
				journal of the international society of sports nutrition | 
				december 2024curcumin, especially when its stability is 
				enhanced through encapsulation, exhibits potent antioxidant and 
				anti-inflammatory properties. piperine, derived from black 
				pepper, is utilized to significantly increase the 
				bioavailability of curcumin by up to 2000%. curcumin possesses 
				antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which are 
				attributed to the actions of enzymes like catalase, superoxide 
				dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. notably, its antioxidant 
				activity surpasses that of vitamin e by tenfold, owing to the 
				presence of the 1,3-diketone system and the phenyl ring with the 
				methoxy group, which impedes the generation of free radicals. 
				the phenolic composition of curcumin primarily accounts for its 
				antioxidant efficacy, facilitating the elimination of hydroxyl 
				and superoxide radicals. in a study conducted by davis et al., 
				it was found that supplementation with curcumin significantly 
				reduced muscle damage induced by eccentric exercise in mice. 
				this effect can be attributed to the ability of curcumin to 
				stimulate the activation of nuclear erythroid factor 2-related 
				factor 2 (nrf2), which enhances its antioxidant action. the 
				anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin are attributed to its 
				ability to suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines 
				such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α), interleukin-6 
				(il-6), and interleukin-8 (il-8). moreover, curcumin has been 
				observed to reduce the concentration of highly sensitive 
				c-reactive protein, an acute phase protein associated with 
				inflammation. other studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory 
				activity of curcumin may involve modulation of the 
				nf-kb.supplementing with curcumin can reduce muscle damage and 
				inflammation caused by eccentric exercise, making it a potential 
				remedy for athletes. these studies suggest that curcumin intake 
				may help reduce muscle symptoms associated with eccentric 
				exercises, thereby improving pain perception. effective use of 
				curcumin depends on factors such as dosage, bioavailability, and 
				timing, with post-exercise ingestion appearing to be more 
				beneficial. curcumin demonstrates a significant potential to 
				relieve muscle-related symptoms, especially delayed-onset muscle 
				soreness (doms) that arises from eccentric exercises, thus 
				potentially improving the well-being of those who are trained. 
				curcumin demonstrates a significant potential to alleviate 
				muscular symptoms, especially delayed-onset muscle soreness 
				(doms) resulting from eccentric exercises. this indicates that 
				curcumin could substantially enhance the well-being of 
				individuals engaged in regular physical training. moreover, 
				curcumin may play a role in reducing biomarkers associated with 
				inflammation and enhancing antioxidant capacity, suggesting 
				broader health benefits.




the effect of curcumin supplementation on glycemic 
				indices in adults: a meta-analysis of meta-analyses
				prostaglandins & other lipid mediators | december 2024
				curcumin, an inherent polyphenolic compound, has the potential 
				to influence glycemic indices. curcumin is a polyphenolic 
				compound with many pharmacological effects, such as 
				anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative, and 
				anti-angiogenic activities [7], [8]. curcumin is safe and 
				effective for a range of chronic diseases, including lung 
				cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, t2dm and inflammatory bowel 
				disease, according to numerous studies.the findings of our study 
				indicate that the administration of curcumin supplements leads 
				to a significant decrease in fasting blood sugar levels, 
				homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance, 
				hemoglobin a1c, and insulin. the results of this study suggest 
				that the administration of curcumin supplements may be a 
				beneficial intervention for enhancing glycemic indices. curcumin 
				supplementation has a decreasing effect on fbs, homa-ir, hba1c, 
				and insulin. longer durations of supplementation (>10-week) are 
				needed to have the decreasing impact on fbs, homa-ir and hba1c. 
				our pooled findings indicate that glycemic parameters can be 
				improved by supplementing with curcumin. supplemental curcumin 
				can enhance glycemic indices in a dose-and time-dependent 
				fashion. 


unveiling the role of gut microbiota in curcumin 
				metabolism using antibiotic-treated mice
				food chemistry | december 2024curcumin has demonstrated 
				therapeutic potential against various human diseases in 
				preclinical studies, including metabolic disorders, 
				cardiovascular diseases, nervous system disorders, and 
				gastrointestinal disorders (ghafouri-fard et al., 2022; liu et 
				al., 2022; peng et al., 2021; zeng et al., 2023). furthermore, 
				it has exhibited safety and tolerability, even at high doses up 
				to 8 g per day in clinical trials (gupta, patchva, & aggarwal, 
				2013). in this study, we innovatively used antibiotics to 
				deplete gut microbiota and compared curcumin metabolism in 
				control and antibiotic-treated mice. our results demonstrated 
				that the gut microbiota significantly altered the host 
				metabolism of curcumin in vivo. in conclusion, our 
				results indicated that gut microbiota might enhance the 
				effectiveness of curcumin by deconjugation, production of active 
				metabolites, and protection against degradation.

				december 2024this study aimed to assess the neuroprotective 
				properties of curcumin against neuronal damage in the rat 
				hippocampus caused by diabetes. it was determined that il-10, 
				sod, catalase, and gsh levels, which were significantly 
				decreased in the d group, increased in the curcumin-supplemented 
				diabetic group (dcu). the relevant sentence has been changed as 
				follows. in conclusion, our findings from this study prove the

the effect of curcumin on alzheimers disease
				advances in aging research | november 2024curcumin has 
				attracted increasing attention owing to its distinct molecular 
				structure, it affects antioxidant and inflammatory pathways as 
				well as amyloid aggregation, which is one of the main 
				characteristics of alzheimers disease.  numerous studies 
				have shown that curcumin has several advantageous properties 
				including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. numerous 
				clinical trials have been conducted to clarify the impact of 
				curcumin on cancers, owing to its documented effects on tumors. 
				recent findings suggest that curcumin may have therapeutic 
				potential in the pathogenesis of alzheimers disease. the 
				overall memory of patients with alzheimers disease has improved 
				because of several benefits of curcumin, including decreased 
				beta-amyloid plaques, delayed neuronal degradation, metal 
				chelation, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and 
				decreased microglial production. modern medicine has shown that 
				curcumin exhibits a wide variety of biological and 
				pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant, neuroprotective, and chemoprotective properties, 
				owing to its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules. 
				many studies concerning the antitumor activity of curcumin have 
				been conducted, and the clinical benefits of curcumin against 
				tumors are being actively investigated, although clinical trials 
				are still in a relatively early phase. current consumption in 
				old age has recently been associated with improved cognitive 
				functions. furthermore, some reports have suggested possible 
				beneficial effects of curcumin on experimental models of 
				alzheimers disease. in recent years, the focus has shifted to 
				the neuroprotective effects of curcumin on cognition. 
				epidemiological data has shown that regular curcumin intake may 
				be associated with improved cognitive function in healthy 
				elderly individuals. it has been demonstrated that curcumin 
				improves cognition in both non-pathological aging and 
				alzheimers disease. animal models of alzheimers disease have 
				demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloid 
				properties of curcumin. research has shown that curcumin helps 
				to reduce risk factors. thus, curcumin may be a promising 
				treatment option for alzheimers disease.

analysis of curcumin and piperine for breast cancer 
				prevention and treatment via simulation and artificial 
				intelligence methodsbiorxiv | november 
				2024the nutraceutical combination of curcumin and piperine 
				may aid in breast cancer prevention by enhancing curcumins 
				anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. curcumin and 
				piperine, two natural compounds with notable bioactive 
				properties, have emerged as potential adjuncts in the prevention 
				and treatment of breast cancer. curcumin, a polyphenolic 
				compound derived from the spice turmeric (curcuma longa), 
				has been extensively studied for its anticancer properties. 
				piperine, an alkaloid from black pepper (piper nigrum), 
				is often used in conjunction with curcumin due to its ability to 
				enhance curcumins bioavailability, which otherwise suffers from 
				poor absorption in the human body. together, curcumin and 
				piperine offer promising therapeutic effects that could support 
				conventional breast cancer therapies. curcumin exhibits a broad 
				spectrum of anticancer activities through various molecular 
				mechanisms, primarily involving inhibition of inflammation, 
				induction of apoptosis, and suppression of tumor cell 
				proliferation. one of the key pathways it influences is the 
				nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kb) signaling pathway, a pathway 
				known to promote cancer cell survival and proliferation. by 
				inhibiting nf-kb, curcumin can potentially reduce tumor growth 
				and decrease cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. 
				additionally, curcumin downregulates the expression of multiple 
				pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are often elevated in breast 
				cancer patients and contribute to tumor progression. curcumin 
				also exerts influence on cellular apoptotic processes by 
				modulating proteins such as p53 and bax, which are critical 
				regulators of programmed cell death. this effect is particularly 
				significant in hormone-responsive breast cancer, where tumor 
				growth depends on signals from estrogen receptors. curcumins 
				ability to downregulate estrogen receptors may help reduce the 
				proliferation of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells. 
				furthermore, curcumin has been shown to inhibit angiogenesisthe 
				formation of new blood vessels that supplies nutrients to 
				tumors, thereby starving cancer cells and slowing tumor growth. 


epigenetic influence of curcumin on histone 
				signatures in breast cancerbiorxiv | 
				november 2024curcumin has been shown to suppress breast 
				cancer through the regulation of a multitude of cellular 
				signaling pathways such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, 
				cell-cycle arrest, reactive oxidative stress (ros), and 
				micrornas with molecular targets ranging from nf-κb, cyclind1, 
				p13k, raf-1, nrf2 and p53. in addition to these mechanisms, 
				curcumin has also been found to influence histone modifications, 
				modulating histone acetylation and methylation in cancer cell 
				lines. for example, in one study on triple-negative breast 
				cancer (tnbc), curcumin was shown to inhibit oncogenic ezh2 by 
				reducing h3k27me3 at the promoter for tumor suppressive dlc1, 
				inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. this is the first study to 
				analyze and profile upwards of 50 histone codes in relation to 
				curcumin in breast cancer and link novel histone ptms with 
				curcumin treatment. in this study we also found possible 
				connections between curcumins epigenetic targets in breast 
				cancer and neurological disorders, suggesting potential common 
				epigenetic pathways utilized by these diseases. overall, our 
				study elucidated possible new therapeutic targets for curcumin 
				as an epigenetic modulator for breast cancer and other 
				diseases.curcumin, a natural plant-derived compound, has been 
				shown to have an anticancer effect via its influence on 
				epigenetic regulation. 




curcuma-based nutritional supplements and risk of 
				age-related macular degenerationjama 
				ophthalmology | november 2024among patients without a 
				history of age-related macular degeneration aged 50 years or 
				older, curcumin supplement use was associated with lower rates 
				of developing nonexudative age-related macular degeneration, 
				advanced nonexudative age-related macular degeneration or ga, 
				exudative age-related macular degeneration, blindness, or 
				requiring intravitreal anti-vegf therapy when compared with 
				matched patients not taking curcumin supplements. results were 
				consistent among subsets of patients 60 and 70 years or older, 
				respectively. among patients with early nonexudative age-related 
				macular degeneration, subsequent instances of curcumin 
				supplement prescription records were associated with lower rates 
				of developing advanced nonexudative age-related macular 
				degeneration or ga when compared with matched patients with 
				early nonexudative age-related macular degeneration without a 
				curcumin supplement prescription record. conclusion and 
				relevance results of this cohort study suggest that a reduced 
				risk of developing age-related macular degeneration or 
				progression to later stages of age-related macular degeneration 
				was associated with subsequent use of curcumin supplements.

				health | november 2024curcumin is a natural plant compound 
				most notably found in turmeric. it has antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and immune system-boosting 
				properties. researchers believe curcumin affects the proteins 
				that play a role in the cellular aging processes, including 
				oxidative stress, inflammation, cellular signaling, dna repair, 
				and apoptosis (death of cells). curcumin can be taken as a 
				supplement on its own or as a turmeric supplement. studies have 
				shown that turmeric doses up to 8,000 milligrams daily for up to 
				eight months and curcumin doses up to 8,000 milligrams daily for 
				up to three months are safe.


				the effects of curcumin supplementation on inflammatory markers

				advances in relieving exercise fatigue for curcumin: molecular 
				targets, bioavailability, and potential mechanism
				journal of food science | november 2024curcumin, the main 
				naturally occurring bioactive polyphenol in turmeric, has 
				anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. there is growing 
				evidence that curcumin can scavenge free radicals, inhibit 
				inflammation, reduce the accumulation of metabolites, and 
				regulate energy metabolism (fernandez- lazaro et al., 2020; hu 
				et al., 2023; xu et al., 2018). curcumin regulates gut 
				microbiota through metabolic pathways, providing a new 
				perspective for alleviating fatigue. , curcumin has been shown 
				to interact with a variety of molecular targets (inflammatory 
				cytokines, transcription factors, growth factors, receptors, 
				cell cycle proteins, apoptosis-related proteins, adhesion 
				molecules, and enzymes) through covalent, non-covalent hydropho- 
				bic, and hydrogen bond interactions, providing a number of 
				possible molecular mechanisms (patel et al., 2020; she- hzad et 
				al., 2017). the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of 
				curcumin are related to its molecular structure and abundant 
				molecular targets. there was evidence that curcumin scavenged 
				free radicals by inducing the acti- vation of the nuclear factor 
				erythroid-2-related factor-2 (nrf2) signaling pathway (he et 
				al., 2012). research has shown that curcumin exerts 
				anti-inflammatory effects by binding to pro-inflammatory 
				molecules such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (mcp)-1, 
				tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α, interleukin-12, il-8, and il-6 
				(derosa et al., 2016; it can reduce oxidative stress, inhibit 
				inflammation, regulate energy metabolism, and decrease 
				metabolite accumulation by modulating the nf- κb, nrf2, and ampk 
				pathways. therefore, curcumin has the potential to play a 
				variety of positive roles, reduce exercise fatigue, improve 
				exercise performance, and help post-exercise recovery. this 
				review summarized the effects of curcumin on fatigue-related 
				indicators of running and swimming in animals, eccentric muscle 
				movements in humans, running, swimming, and cycling, and 
				taekwondo training in profes- sional athletes. it was shown that 
				curcumin supplementation can relieve fatigue to a certain extent 
				under different doses, intake times, exercise types, and 
				exercise groups. this confirmed the effectiveness and 
				comprehensiveness of curcumin in alleviating exercise-induced 
				fatigue through the signaling pathway network. recent studies 
				have also revealed bidirectional interactions between curcumin 
				and the gut microbiota, highlighting the possibility that 
				curcumin alleviates exercise fatigue by improving the icrobial 
				composition and strengthening the intestinal barrier.

curcumin 
				inhibits torc1 and prolongs the lifespan of cells with 
				mitochondrial dysfunction cells | october 
				2024curcumin stands out as a particularly potent candidate 
				for anti-aging interventions. curcumin is a polyphenolic 
				compound extracted from the rhizome of curcuma longa 
				(turmeric), a spice that has been used for centuries in 
				traditional medicine. extensive research has demonstrated 
				curcumins wide-ranging therapeutic potential, including its 
				ability to mitigate the effects of aging and increase lifespan. 
				curcumin possesses the remarkable capacity to forestall cellular 
				aging, and consequently, extend the pomicl of yeast. our 
				outcomes are consistent with an amount of prior research that 
				has underscored the beneficial effects of curcumin in the 
				context of cellular longevity. furthermore, our insights into 
				curcumins influence on cellular lifespan complement analogous 
				investigations conducted using different genetic backgrounds and 
				distinct cell survival assays. collectively, these results 
				compellingly advocate for the potential utility of curcumin as a 
				modulator of cellular aging and lifespan extension across 
				diverse eukaryotic species. our results demonstrate that 
				curcumin has a significant impact on extending the lifespan of 
				postmitotic cells during chronological aging. these findings 
				align with previous studies that have highlighted the beneficial 
				effects of curcumin on healthspan and cellular longevity. 
				notably, curcumins anti-aging effects exhibit a biphasic 
				doseresponse pattern, with lower concentrations showing greater 
				efficacy. mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor associated 
				with age-related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, 
				neurodegenerative disorders, sarcopenia, and age-related macular 
				degeneration. we revealed that curcumin not only extends the 
				lifespan of the wildtype but also rescues the shortened lifespan 
				of mitochondrial-defective postmitotic cells during 
				chronological aging in yeast. this finding suggests that 
				curcumin may have therapeutic potential in mitigating the 
				effects of mitochondrial dysfunction, a common hallmark of 
				aging. our investigation into the mechanisms underlying 
				curcumins anti-aging properties revealed that curcumin inhibits 
				torc1 activity. curcumins ability to inhibit torc1 activity is 
				crucial for its anti-aging effects, especially in cells with 
				mitochondrial dysfunction. curcumin enhances mitochondrial 
				function by increasing atp levels. curcumin derived from natural 
				sources may have the potential to promote healthy aging and 
				extend lifespan. second, curcumins ability to rescue 
				postmitotic cells with mitochondrial dysfunction highlights its 
				relevance for age-related diseases associated with impaired 
				mitochondrial function. third, the hormetic response observed 
				with curcumin treatment underscores the importance of dosage and 
				further emphasizes the need for careful consideration when 
				designing interventions. in summary, our study provides valuable 
				insights into the intricate relationship between curcumin, 
				postmitotic cellular aging, torc1 activity, and mitochondrial 
				function. 




curcumin blunts epithelial-mesenchymal transition to 
				alleviate invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer through the 
				jarid1d demethylationcancer cell 
				international | october 2024curcumin, fundamentally a 
				polyphenolic compound, is derived as a powder from the rhizome 
				of the perennial herb, curcuma longa. previous studies 
				have shown that curcumin, as a multi-target drug, has 
				anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-infective, anti-fibrotic, 
				and anti-atherosclerotic properties, which could significantly 
				inhibit the occurrence and metastasis of various malignant 
				tumors. in addition, mounting evidence indicates that curcumin 
				can act as an epigenetic regulator to exert anti-tumor effects, 
				improve the expression of histone deacetylases, dna 
				methyltransferases, and inhibit the invasion and migration of 
				tumors. the results demonstrated that the invasion and 
				metastasis of prostate cancer induced by the knockdown of 
				jarid1d were significantly inhibited by curcumin. curcumin 
				inhibits the metastatic potential of crpc cells by regulating ar 
				and emt-related genes through methylation of jarid1d. these 
				results underscore the therapeutic potential of curcumin in the 
				treatment of invasive prostate cancer. curcumin, a promising 
				anti-cancer agent, has garnered significant interest for its 
				ability to modulate multiple signaling pathways, thereby 
				inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of 
				prostate cancer cells. our investigation revealed that curcumin 
				effectively suppressed the growth of 22rv1 cells at an ic50 of 
				12.65 µm and enhanced both the expression and demethylation 
				activity of jarid1d at a 14 µm dose. this suggests a capacity of 
				curcumin to upregulate jarid1d expression through demethylation, 
				concurrent with its growth inhibitory effect on prostate cancer 
				cells.  curcumin can affect the progression of pca through 
				the pi3k and wnt signaling pathways [33, 34], but it is more 
				related to the growth and proliferation of prostate cancer 
				cells. in jarid1d mediated invasion and metastasis of pca, the 
				pi3k and wnt signaling pathways do not play a dominant role. 
				both previous report and our study confirm that curcumin may has 
				a dna demethylation effect on tumor cells. further experiments 
				demonstrated that curcumin could significantly inhibit the 
				proliferation of pca cells with different phenotypes treatment 
				with curcumin significantly inhibited pca metastasis caused by 
				jarid1d knockdown and decreased the expression of n-cadherin, 
				vimentin and mmp2, but stimulated the expression of jarid1d, ar 
				and e-cadherin. these results highlight curcumins potential to 
				impede prostate cancer invasion and metastasis, particularly 
				when jarid1d is compromised, through the regulation of ar/emt 
				pathways. in summary, although curcumin has shown certain 
				anti-cancer effects in vitro and animal models, further 
				investigation is required to understand its long-term impact and 
				bioavailability in humans. furthermore, the administration 
				strategy of curcumin combined with jarid1d agonist may be more 
				beneficial to inhibit prostate cancer metastasis. our study 
				revealed that the epigenetic modifier jarid1d could restrict the 
				progression of prostate cancer, and curcumin could stimulate the 
				expression level of jarid1d and regulate the transcriptional 
				regulation of ar through demethylation. taken together, these 
				findings provide the evidence that curcumin has therapeutic 
				potential for invasive pca, and targeting jarid1d may be a 
				viable therapeutic strategy, particularly in metastatic 
				prevention. 




curcumin suppresses cell viability in breast cancer 
				cell line by affecting the expression of mir-15a-5p
turkish journal of biochemistry | september 2024the 
				turmeric plant (curcumin longa) is used to extract 
				curcumin, a hydrophobic and polyphenolic substance with potent 
				anti-cancer effects. there has been an increased interest in 
				research into curcumins effect on non-coding rnas (ncrna) in 
				cancer. some essential cell processes, including proliferation, 
				differentiation, and migration, can be altered as a result of 
				epigenetic modifications. ncrna dysregulation, known to play a 
				key epigenetic regulatory function in the genome, has been 
				associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer. 
				integrating curcumin and tumor suppressor mirnas in therapy for 
				cancer may boost bioavailability and lead to greater success in 
				the battle against it. anti-cancer effects of curcumin have been 
				reported in the literature. the discovery that it can produce 
				this effect by changing the expressions of protein-coding and 
				non-coding rna molecules has paved the way for new research. in 
				the literature on mir-15a-5p, the effect of which we want to 
				examine in breast cancer in our study, it is stated that 
				curcumin-mediated expression of mir-15a-5p in leukemia cells can 
				be increased, and thus, the expression of the wt1 oncogene can 
				be controlled. curcumin provides hope in the battle against 
				cancers as research continues to uncover new therapies. curcumin 
				research is ongoing globally because of its antioxidant and 
				antiviral effects in addition to anti-cancer capabilities. due 
				to these properties, its importance has been emphasized in the 
				literature not only for cancer but also for many 
				neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. curcumin was taken 
				into a clinical phase i trial (nct03980509) and phase ii study 
				(nct03072992) combined with paclitaxel in brca. these clinical 
				phase studies mainly focused on the effects of curcumin on 
				disease recurrence and metastasis. a clinical phase iii trial of 
				curcumin on prostate cancer patients (nct03769766) is still 
				ongoing. in addition to the idea of using curcumin in 
				combination with various chemotherapeutics, it has been 
				suggested that utilizing it in combination with mirnas in cancer 
				could strengthen its anti-cancer role. with the discovery of 
				curcumins ability to modify mirna expression, an alternative 
				field for research in cancer-targeted treatment has emerged. in 
				light of the outcomes of our study, we would like to suggest 
				that curcumins anti-cancer properties could be strengthened 
				through mir-15a-5p, and a combination of curcumin/mir-15a-5p 
				studies in breast cancer could be more beneficial for cancer 
				therapy. 




exploring the renoprotective potential of bioactive 
				nutraceuticals in chronic kidney disease progression: a 
				narrative reviewcureus | september 2024
				curcuminoids, including curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and 
				bisdemethoxycurcumin, are the active compounds found in 
				turmeric. curcumin's potential mode of action in ckd is by 
				focusing on its effects on endogenous intestinal alkaline 
				phosphatase (iap). iap is an enzyme found in the intestines that 
				plays a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis and 
				protecting against inflammation and oxidative stress. curcumin 
				stimulates the production and activity of iap, leading to 
				beneficial effects in ckd. the activation of iap by curcumin is 
				suggested to have multiple protective mechanisms, including the 
				reduction of oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in the 
				kidneys. by enhancing iap activity, curcumin may help maintain 
				gut barrier integrity and reduce the translocation of toxins and 
				harmful substances into the bloodstream, positively impacting 
				kidney health in ckd patients.

				in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled 
				trial 
nutrients | august 2024curcumin, 
				derived from turmeric root, exhibits notable anti-inflammatory 
				effects. the curcumin intervention significantly reduced pulse 
				wave velocity and improved cardiometabolic risk profiles. these 
				findings suggest that curcumin treatment may effectively reduce 
				atherogenic risks in type 2 diabetes patients with obesity. 
				curcumin (curcuma longa), the principal component of 
				the spice turmeric, has recently garnered interest for its 
				potential benefits in addressing various health conditions, 
				notably metabolic syndrome. research has highlighted the 
				antihypercholesterolemic properties of curcumin extract, 
				including a reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride (tg) 
				levels and decreased vulnerability to low-density lipoprotein 
				cholesterol (ldl-c). the anti-atherosclerotic and protective 
				effects of curcumin against coronary heart disease have also 
				been recognized. additionally, curcumin has notable potential in 
				managing metabolic diseases due to its anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant, and lipid-modifying properties. it enhances insulin 
				sensitivity and supports weight management. curcumin also 
				protects liver health and offers cardiovascular benefits by 
				reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. these multifaceted 
				effects make it a promising complementary therapy for conditions 
				like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. 
				curcumin, a bioactive compound in turmeric, shows potential for 
				reducing atherogenic risk by mitigating inflammation and 
				improving cardiometabolic factors. these effects are promising 
				for protecting against atherosclerosis and related 
				cardiometabolic risks in type 2 diabetes patients with obesity. 
				by reducing cardiometabolic risk factors, curcumin provides 
				various health benefits, making it a valuable component of a 
				balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.  




effect and mechanism of curcumin on colon cancer 
				cell senescence through early growth response 1 (egr1)
				translational cancer research | august 2024curcumin 
				inhibited the transcriptional activity of egr1, thereby 
				promoting cell senescence and inhibiting tumor progression. 
				curcumin hampers the activity of tf egr1, affecting the 
				transcription and translation of target genes tert and sirt6, 
				thus promoting cell senescence and inhibiting colon cancer cell 
				proliferation. these findings provide potential insights for 
				targeted therapy of colon cancer. curcumin exhibits diverse 
				anti-tumor properties, including the inhibition of tumor cell 
				proliferation, metastasis, and invasion, rendering it a 
				promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of multiple 
				cancer. curcumin, a traditional chinese medicine derived 
				primarily from the rhizome of turmeric, has been identified by 
				modern pharmacological studies as having multiple benefits for 
				the human body, including its anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, 
				anti-angiogenesis, anti- metastasis, and anti-multidrug 
				resistance activities. curcumin, a natural compound derived from 
				the turmeric plant, has garnered attention for its potential 
				anticancer properties. prior investigations have underscored 
				curcumins induction of cell senescence across various cancer 
				types, including colon cancer. our research extends these 
				findings by delineating the mechanism through which curcumin 
				orchestrates the transcription and expression of key genes such 
				as tert and sirt6, mediated by egr1, thereby contributing to 
				cell senescence.the capacity of curcumin to induce cell 
				senescence bears significant implications for treating colon 
				cancer. senescence cells lose their proliferative potential, 
				thereby impeding tumor growth. moreover, curcumin has been 
				reported to curb the metastatic propensity of colon cancer cells 
				by stifling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt), a pivotal 
				process in initiating metastasis. curcumin dampens egr1 activity 
				and promotes senescence, consequently hindering tumor 
				progression.in conclusion, curcumin mitigates the activity of 
				the tf egr1, augments the expression of target genes tert and 
				sirt6, and accelerates tumor cell senescence. this positions 
				curcumin a potential candidate for colon cancer therapy, 
				offering an alternative approach to clinical treatment. its 
				ability to inhibit cell proliferation and metastasis underscores 
				its therapeutic potential in colon cancer. therefore, strategies 
				targeting egr1 with curcumin may represent a viable option for 
				untreated colon cancer. 


curcumin induces autophagy-mediated ferroptosis by 
				targeting the pi3k/akt/mtor signaling pathway in gastric cancer
				gastroenterology | august 2024the polyphenol compound 
				curcumin shows prominent anti-tumor effects in multiple cancer 
				types, including gastric cancer. curcumin attenuated cell 
				viability but stimulated cell death in gastric cancer cells. 
				curcumin enhanced autophagy in gastric cancer cells, as 
				demonstrated by the increased levels of atg5, atg7, beclin 1, 
				and lc3b. besides, curcumin upregulated iron, mda, gsh, and 
				acsl4 levels while downregulated lipid ros, slc7a11, and gpx4 
				levels, suggesting its stimulation on ferroptosis in gastric 
				cancer cells. curcumin decreased p-pi3k, p-akt, and p-mtor 
				levels in cells. importantly, the ferroptosis inhibitor 
				ferrostatin-1 overturned the impacts of curcumin on gastric 
				cancercell viability, death, and ferroptosis. curcumin 
				suppresses gastric cancer development by inducing 
				autophagy-mediated ferroptosis by inactivating the pi3k/akt/mtor 
				signaling. curcumin has been confirmed to possess anti-oxidant, 
				anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-analgesic, lipid-modifier, 
				and anti-microbial effects. curcumin has previously been 
				reported to suppress tumorigenesis in many types of human 
				cancers by facilitating ferroptosis. in summary, our research 
				confirms that curcumin sup- pressed cell growth but promotes 
				cell death in gastric cancer cells by stimulating ferroptosis. 
				mechanistically, curcumin induces autophagy and inactivates the 
				pi3k/akt/mtor pathway in gastric cancer cells. hence, curcumin 
				might suppress gastric cancer development by inducing 
				autophagy-mediated ferroptosis by restraining the pi3k/akt/mtor 
				signaling. our observations might expand our knowledge of the 
				effects of curcumin on ferroptosis in gastric cancer and provide 
				a novel direction for the potential use of curcumin in gastric 
				cancer treatment.

the 
				bright side of curcumin: a narrative review of its therapeutic 
				potential in cancer management  
cancers | 
				july 2024curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from 
				curcuma longa, exhibits significant therapeutic potential in 
				cancer management. curcumin demonstrates strong antioxidant and 
				anti-inflammatory properties, contributing to its ability to 
				neutralize free radicals and inhibit inflammatory mediators. its 
				anticancer effects are mediated by inducing apoptosis, 
				inhibiting cell proliferation, and interfering with tumor growth 
				pathways in various colon, pancreatic, and breast cancers. 
				curcumin has been used for health maintenance and disease 
				management, dating back to ancient indian and chinese medicine 
				over 4000 years ago. in these traditional practices, turmeric, 
				containing curcumin, was used to treat various conditions such 
				as respiratory disorders, liver diseases, anorexia, rheumatism, 
				and diabetic wounds. curcumin, as highlighted in the literature, 
				holds immense promise in health. its antioxidant properties 
				enable it to neutralize free radicals and protect cells from 
				oxidative damage, while its anti-inflammatory action inhibits 
				the expression of inflammatory mediators and reduces 
				inflammation at the cellular level. curcumin has demonstrated 
				neuroprotective effects and potential benefits in treating 
				neurodegenerative diseases. recent studies have underscored the 
				role of curcumin in reducing brain inflammation, protecting 
				neurons, and promoting neurogenesis. moreover, numerous studies 
				have illuminated the anticarcinogenic potential of curcumin in 
				various types of cancer, including colon, pancreatic, and other 
				high-risk cancers. curcumin has been studied for its ability to 
				inhibit tumor cell growth, induce apoptosis, and reduce 
				resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. curcumin may 
				reverse cancer progression through the inhibition of 
				il-6r/stat3. it also sensitizes cancer to antitumor and 
				antimetastatic effects by suppressing the nf-kappa b cell 
				signaling pathway. therefore, curcumin is an attractive 
				candidate for combination chemotherapy due to its broad spectrum 
				of biological activities. its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
				and antitumor activities improve the efficacy of conventional 
				chemotherapeutic drugs while reducing side effects. curcumin may

				and antitumor activities improve the efficacy of conventional 
				chemotherapeutic drugs while reducing side effects. in 
				colorectal cancer, curcumin has been shown in vitro to sensitize 
				cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) and oxaliplatin. studies 
				have shown that curcumin enhances the cytotoxic effects of these 
				drugs by modulating several signaling pathways, including nf-κb 
				and stat3, leading to increased apoptosis and the inhibition of 
				cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. a synergistic 
				effect in overcoming drug resistance was demonstrated by howells 
				et al., who found that curcumin enhanced resistance to 
				oxaliplatin chemo induction in both in vitro and in vivo colon 
				cancer cells. tian et al. showed that curcumin potentiates the 
				antitumor effects of 5-fu in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
				cells by downregulating nf-kappa b signaling, leading to 
				increased apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. hartojo et al. 
				reported complementary mechanisms of apoptotic pathway 
				activation, stating that the combination of curcumin and 
				cisplatin had an additive effect in inducing apoptosis in 
				esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. curcumin showed synergistic 
				effects with paclitaxel and doxorubicin in breast cancer cell 
				lines. farghadani and naidu, mohammadian et al., and vinod et 
				al. found that the combination of curcumin and these 
				chemotherapeutic agents downregulated her2 and egfr, which are 
				often overexpressed in breast cancer, inhibited cell 
				proliferation, and induced apoptosis. curcumin sensitizes breast 
				cancer cells to 5-fu by modulating signaling events involved in 
				cell survival and apoptosis. in clinical trials, patients with 
				advanced breast cancer who received curcumin combined with 
				docetaxel showed higher response rates compared to docetaxel 
				alone. the combination was well tolerated and resulted in fewer 
				side effects. this suggests the potential of curcumin to improve 
				the efficacy of chemotherapy. the combination of curcumin and 
				gemcitabine significantly reduced tumor growth compared to 
				either agent alone in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. the 
				combination therapy worked by inhibiting angiogenesis and 
				inducing apoptosis by suppressing the nf-κb and cox-2 pathways. 
				yoshida et al. showed that curcumin can sensitize human 
				pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine, potentially overcoming 
				gemcitabine resistance. treatment with a combination of curcumin 
				and cisplatin significantly reduced tumor size and weight in a 
				mouse xenograft model of ovarian cancer. the combination therapy 
				was more effective than either agent alone. also, it attenuated 
				cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, highlighting curcumins 
				protective role against chemotherapys side effects. a phase ii 
				clinical trial in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
				showed that adding curcumin to the standard folfox regimen 
				(5-fu, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) improved overall survival 
				and progression-free survival compared to the standard regimen 
				alone. therefore, combining curcumin with chemotherapeutic 
				agents in vitro and in vivo has shown a synergistic effect in 
				cancer therapy. in summary, curcumin demonstrates substantial 
				therapeutic potential in cancer treatment due to its 
				multifaceted biological activities, including antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, exerting its 
				potential therapeutic effects against various types of cancer. 
				for example, curcumin exhibits substantial anticancer properties 
				particularly against gastrointestinal cancers, such as 
				colorectal and pancreatic cancer, by inducing apoptosis, 
				inhibiting cell proliferation, and modulating multiple cell 
				signaling pathways. additionally, studies have shown promising 
				results in the treatment of breast cancer, where curcumin 
				interferes with cancer cell growth and metastasis. the compound 
				has also demonstrated efficacy in prostate cancer by targeting 
				androgen receptor signaling and in head and neck cancers through 
				the inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis

				potentially modulate the inflammatory response following muscle 
				injury through its effects on the inflammatory cytokine 
				interleukin-6 (il-6). this cytokine plays a vital role in both 
				muscle injury and repair processes. supplementation with 
				curcumin could potentially improve muscle function and joint 
				flexibility. curcumins potent antioxidant properties enable it 
				to neutralize ros generated within the oxidative phosphorylation 
				chain. these combined mechanisms contribute to curcumins 
				effectiveness in reducing ck levels. curcumin alleviates muscle 
				soreness through multiple mechanisms, notably by inhibiting 
				cox-2 expression, which reduces ck activity and prostaglandin 
				release, thereby easing soreness. meta-analyses have shown 
				curcumins efficacy in reducing post-exercise muscle soreness. 
				whether taken before or after exercise, curcumin consistently 
				reduces muscle soreness.

				extended studies, la jolla, california, usa | july 2024
				curcumin has potential as a safe, inexpensive dietary supplement 
				to support cardiovascular health. one study reported curcumin 
				reduced ldl-c by a mean of 39.83 mg/dl. panahi et al. provide a 
				detailed review of the metabolic and cellular moa of curcumin 
				and statins, and point out that they both target the same 
				specific nuclear receptors and enzymes while reducing ldl-c. the 
				authors note that while statins are more efficient in lowering 
				ldl-c, for some patients, they have adverse effects. the authors 
				suggest that for such patients, a combination of a statin and 
				curcumin could synergistically lower ldl-c to a desirable level, 
				while requiring a lower dosage of the statin, which could reduce 
				the risk of adverse effects, such as extreme muscle pain.

				curcumin against parkinsons disease by regulating inflammation, 
				oxidative stress, and aging. the mechanisms of these were 
				associated with activation of pi3k / akt pathway.  in 
				conclusion, the neuroprotective mechanisms of curcumin activate 
				pi3k / akt pathway in parkinsons disease was revealed by our 
				study. recently, there has been increasing interest in using 
				curcumin to prevent parkinsons disease. the mechanisms of 
				curcumin to anti-parkinsons disease may include antioxidant, 
				immune modulation, and the clearance of α-syn. our previous 
				study suggested that curcumins effectiveness in treating 
				parkinsons disease was linked to the gut-brain axis. recent 
				reviews have increasingly suggested that curcumin targeting the 
				pi3k/akt signal pathway to protect dopaminergic neurons, while 
				also inhibiting the activation of microglia. as a result, 
				curcumin has shown promising potential in the treatment and 
				prevention of parkinsons disease. either as antioxidants or 
				modulators of cell signalling, the influence of curcumin on 
				oxidative and inflammation balance are key. consistent with our 
				enrichment analysis results, the neuroprotective of curcumin on 
				parkinsons disease depend on oxidative stress, inflammation and 
				apoptosis of nerve cells has been demonstrated. however, there 
				is no direct experimental evidence in vivo for curcumin exerts 
				the effects of anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammation and 
				anti-apoptosis by activating the pi3k/akt in parkinsons 
				disease. and akt gene expression in the cell was the key role of 
				anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis. 
				finally, our study verified the pi3k/akt pathway activated by 
				curcumin in parkinsons disease. however, to further demonstrate 
				curcumin protects through the activation of the pi3k/akt 
				pathway, our future study should be incorporated an inhibitor 
				targeting the pi3k/akt pathway. this has established a solid 
				theoretical basis for the clinical application of curcumin in 
				treating parkinsons disease.  


potential of curcumin to reduce serum nuclear 
				factor-kappa b (nf-kb) levels after high-intensity exercise
				retos journal | july 2024the group given curcumin after 
				high-intensity exercise reduced serum nf-kb levels significantly 
				(*p<0.05) compared to the placebo group. it can be concluded 
				that the administration of curcumin at 400 mg after 
				high-intensity exercise can reduce serum nf-kb levels. curcumin 
				is known for its active compounds that have anti-inflammatory 
				activity (boarescu et al. 2022). curcumin is able to inhibit 
				inflammation by modulating nf-κb signals and blocking tnf- α 
				signals by activating protein responses in muscles (srivastava 
				et al. 2017; venkata et al. 2012). the anti-inflammatory 
				activity of curcumin also inhibits the production of 
				pro-inflammatory eicosanoids which include prostaglandins and 
				leukotrienes (han, zhang, and li 2021; petrone-garcia et al. 
				2021; zhu et al. 2019). curcumin has been widely used to 
				increase endurance and maximal oxygen uptake vo2 max (hamidie, 
				ali, and masuda 2017). in addition, curcumin has been widely 
				used in the medical world to accelerate wound healing (sharma et 
				al. 2018). curcumin administered at a dose of 400 mg/day can 
				reduce serum nf-kb levels. based on the laboratory tests we 
				conducted, we believe the reduction in pain intensity occurred 
				due to the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin which is able to 
				modulate nf-kb signals and block tnf-a signals.  reducing 
				nf-kb levels is believed to lessen pro-inflammatory cytokines 
				such as tnf-a and is closely related to muscle pain after 
				exercise. we recommend using curcumin as a natural ingredient 
				that can potentially reduce nf-kb.


role of curcumin on beta-amyloid protein, tau 
				protein, and biochemical and oxidative changes in 
				streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats
				naunyn-schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology | july 2024
				results show that curcumin has an effect on reducing oxidative 
				stress caused by diabetes and increasing antioxidant activity. 
				the protective effect of curcumin is tested during induction and 
				active diabetes. the results indicated that diabetic rats 
				displayed increased levels of aβ, tau protein, and total oxidant 
				capacity (tos) compared to the curcumin-treated groups. 
				additionally, the total antioxidant capacity (tas) levels were 
				lower in the diabetic rats (p < 0.05). aβ protein levels are 
				lower in both the serum and brain of rats with active diabetes 
				and treated with curcumin compared to control rats (p > 0.05). 
				in addition, serum tas levels were higher in rats treated with 
				curcumin following the induction of diabetes than pre-induction 
				of diabetes (p > 0.05). the tos levels in the serum were higher 
				in the rats treated with curcumin during active diabetes 
				compared to the rats treated prior to the induction of diabetes.


curcumin as a regulator of th17 cells: unveiling the 
				mechanismsfood chemistry: molecular 
				sciences | july 2024curcumin possesses diverse 
				pharmacological effects due to its interactions with various 
				cells and molecules. curcumin can inhibit th17 proliferation and 
				reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines. curcumin, a 
				polyphenol natural product derived from turmeric, possesses 
				diverse pharmacological effects due to its interactions with 
				various cells and molecules. recent studies have highlighted its 
				immunomodulatory properties, including its impact on immune 
				cells and mediators involved in immune responses.  curcumin 
				exhibits anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant 
				characteristics (chatterjee and pandey, 2011, marjaneh et al., 
				2018, zahedi et al., 2023, mohajeri and sahebkar, 2018). in the 
				past two decades, studies have found that curcumin has 
				immunomodulatory effects, regulating the activity of immune 
				cells. it can reduce the production and release of several 
				proinflammatory cytokines, such as il-12, tnf, and il-6, by 
				preventing the transcription of nf-κb (jagetia, 
				2007). recent reports have shown that curcumin can reduce the 
				proliferation of alloreactive t cells and significantly suppress 
				the differentiation of th17 cells (park et al., 2013). curcumin 
				inhibits the differentiation and development of th17 cells 
				through the downregulation of orγt signaling, il-21, and il-6, 
				as well as the inhibition of stat3 phosphorylation. in summary, 
				curcumin has the ability to hinder the differentiation and 
				proliferation of th17 cells by repressing the secretion of 
				il-23, il-6, and il-21. it also suppresses the production of 
				pro-inflammatory cytokines, including il-17 and tnf-α, in th17 
				cells, thereby reducing the expression of inflammatory cells, 
				particularly neutrophils, and resulting in decreased 
				inflammation and infiltration (haftcheshmeh et al., 
				2021). curcumin demonstrates promise in regulating t cell 
				subsets associated with inflammatory diseases. xiao et al. (xiao 
				et al., 2022) reported that curcumin downregulated 
				pro-inflammatory th17 cells (cd4 + ccr6 + th17, cd4 + il-17a + 
				th17, il-17a, batf, c-maf, rorγt) and upregulated 
				anti-inflammatory treg cells (cd4 + foxp3 + treg, cd4 + il-10 + 
				treg, il-10, foxp3, eomes) in mice with diabetic colitis, 
				suggesting its ability to restore th17/treg balance. these 
				findings highlight the potential of curcumin as a therapeutic 
				agent for various inflammatory conditions by modulating t cell 
				responses. curcumin has been shown to significantly inhibit the 
				proliferation of th17 cells and reduce the production of 
				inflammatory cytokines, including tnf-α, il-22, and il-17. 
				curcumin has several roles in the regulation of enzymes involved 
				in inflammation, adhesion molecules, transcription factors, 
				protein kinases, cytokines, and redox balance. it possesses 
				various pharmacological functions, including antimicrobial, 
				antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antioxidant, and 
				antifungal properties (howells et al., 2021, heidari et al., 
				2023, bagheri et al., 2020, cicero et al., 2020, keihanian et 
				al., 2018, khayatan et al., 2022, mokhtari-zaer et al., 2018, 
				panahi et al., 2019, sahebkar, 2010, sahebkar, 2014, iranshahi 
				et al., 2010, mohammadi et al., 2019, panahi et al., 2012). it 
				also plays a protective role against autoimmune diseases. 
				curcumin, an active compound found in turmeric, exhibits potent 
				immunomodulatory effects, making it a promising therapeutic 
				agent for various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. recent 
				studies have focused on the ability of curcumin to modulate 
				th17-mediated immune responses, which play a critical role in 
				the development of several autoimmune diseases. curcumin has 
				been shown to inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of 
				th17 cells and reduce the production of specific 
				pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-17, il-6, and tnf-α. 
				additionally, curcumin has been found to increase the production 
				of treg cells, which suppress excessive immune responses and 
				maintain immune homeostasis. overall, curcumin's ability to 
				target the th17 axis opens exciting avenues for developing novel 
				therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 
				 


ameliorative effects of curcumin on type 2 diabetes mellitus
				
moleculres | july 2024curcumin, the 
				major curcuminoid of turmeric, is one of the most studied 
				bioactive components of herbal supplements, which has a variety 
				of biological activities. clinical trials and preclinical 
				research have recently produced compelling data to demonstrate 
				the crucial functions of curcumin against type 2 diabetes 
				mellitus via several routes. curcumin, a natural polyphenol 
				derived from the rhizome of curcuma longa (turmeric), 
				which has been widely used in cosmetics, food, and 
				pharmaceutical industries, has gained growing interest in the 
				last years for its pharmacological activities. different studies 
				demonstrated that curcumin has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
				antimicrobial, anti-atherosclerotic, nephroprotective, 
				anticancer, hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, 
				and antirheumatic effects, but with no toxicity. numerous 
				studies demonstrated that curcumin could improve insulin 
				resistance, regulate blood lipid metabolism, decrease glucose 
				and insulin levels, reduce the release of inflammatory factors, 
				inhibit oxidative stress, and regulate gut microbiota in 
				patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. results showed that 
				effectiveness of curcumin on type 2 diabetes mellitus is due to 
				it being anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-hyperglycemic, 
				anti-apoptotic, anti-hyperlipidemia and other activities. 
				numerous studies, including animal and clinical studies, have 
				provided strong evidence to support curcumins crucial role in 
				type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention due to its 
				anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antihyperglycemic, 
				anti-apoptotic, antihyperlipidemic, and other actions. curcumin 
				interacts with a number of biomolecules, such as proteins, 
				nucleic acids, membranes, through non-covalent and covalent 
				binding. as stated above, curcumin exhibits good hypoglycemic 
				action and is well taken at high dosages without adverse 
				effects. it is therefore a potential approach for type 2 
				diabetes mellitus treatment or prevention. in light of these 
				results, curcumin may be a promising prevention/treatment choice 
				for type 2 diabetes mellitus.  


exploring the therapeutic mechanism of curcumin in 
				prostate cancer using network pharmacology and molecular docking
				helyion | july 2024curcumin, a phenolic compound extracted 
				from turmeric rhizomes, exhibits antitumour effects in 
				preclinical models of tumours. we identified 307 key targets of 
				curcumin in cancer treatment. molecular docking experiments 
				showed that the binding energies of curcumin to these core 
				targets were all below −1.85 kj mol−1, which fully demonstrated 
				that curcumin could spontaneously bind to these core targets. 
				through in-depth network pharmacology and molecular docking 
				studies, we have found that curcumin may have anticancer 
				potential by upregulating the expression of pik3r1 and stat3, 
				and downregulating the binding ability of molecules such as src, 
				akt1, hsp90aa1, esr1, egfr, hsp90ab1, mapk8, and mapk1. in 
				addition, curcumin may interfere with the cyclic process of 
				prostate cancer cells by inhibiting key signalling pathways such 
				as the pi3k-akt signalling pathway, mapk signalling pathway, and 
				ras, thereby inhibiting their growth. this study not only 
				reveals the potential molecular mechanism of curcumin in the 
				treatment of prostate cancer but also provides an important 
				theoretical basis for subsequent research. curcumin exhibits 
				multifaceted effects in prostate cancer treatment, including 
				enhancing the sensitivity of prostate cancer to radiotherapy and 
				chemotherapy, inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing cell 
				death, inhibiting the expression of the psa gene, decreasing the 
				expression of androgen receptor, and decreasing the motility of 
				tumour cells. in the present study, we systematically elucidated 
				the possible mechanisms of action of curcumin in prostate cancer 
				treatment by integrating network pharmacology and molecular 
				docking. curcumin acts on multiple targets and pathways involved 
				in the treatment of prostate cancer.  given that this study 
				was conducted using relevant databases and the conclusions 
				lacked experimental support, subsequent biological experiments, 
				and evidence-based drug validation are required to ensure the 
				reliability of the findings. in addition, we explored the 
				molecular mechanism of action of curcumin in treating prostate 
				cancer, providing a theoretical basis for the future development 
				and clinical application of this traditional chinese medicine.

new york post | june 2024
				turmeric is derived from the root of the curcuma longa 
				plant, a type of ginger. this root contains curcumin, a compound 
				rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. known as 
				the gold of the plant kingdom, turmeric also supports liver 
				detoxification and serves as a natural pain killer. by reducing 
				inflammation and oxidative damage, curcumin shields the brain 
				from stressors that lead to cognitive decline. curcumin boosts 
				levels of the brain hormone bdnf, which increases the growth of

				curcumin is a polyphenolic phytochemical derived from the 
				curcuma longa, and it exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
				properties, which associated with cell metabolism. the results 
				showed that curcumin enhanced the osteoblast differentiation 
				which are reduced by hg condition via nrf2 activation and 
				ros/jnk inhibition. knock-down of nrf2 partially blocked 
				curcumin-induced nrf2 activation and ros/jnk inhibition, as well 
				as the attenuation of curcumin-induced osteoblast

				comparative clinical pathology | june 2024the combination of 
				treadmill exercise program and curcumin administration has been 
				shown to offer neuroprotection against epileptic seizure but 
				without detailed mechanism of action being elucidated. this 
				study therefore evaluated the responses of pro-inflammatory 
				(tumor necrosis factor alpha [tnfα] and interleukin 6 [il-6]) 
				and anti-inflammatory (interleukin 10 [il-10]) cytokines, as 
				well as the transcription factor regulator (nuclear factor kappa 
				b [nfκb]) gene expressions to combinatory therapy of curcumin 
				and treadmill exercise in cortex and hippocampus of pilocarpine-induced 
				epileptic seizure in rats. treatment with either curcumin or 
				curcumin plus exercise significantly ameliorated these

				nevertheless, the combinatory therapy of curcumin and exercise 
				showed significantly higher ameliorative effects in the cortical 
				and hippocampal tnfα and il-10, as well as cortical nfκb and 
				il-6. these superior therapeutic properties of the combination 
				of curcumin and treadmill exercise further support the

				taking curcumin for years reported better symptomatic control 
				when compared with patients taking it for months (p 0.01), weeks 
				(p 0.02), or days (p 0.02). there was a significant difference 
				in symptom improvement in patients taking 2001000 mg compared 
				to patients taking less than 200 mg (p 0.01). patients taking 
				curcumin once or twice a day reported significant symptom 
				improvement compared to patients taking it sporadically. 
				symptomatic improvement was reported as pain (35.7%), swelling 
				(25%), stiffness (23.21%), and fatigue (16.07%). an interesting 
				correlation exists between the symptom relief and the frequency, 
				dosages (2001000 mg), and duration (years) of curcumin 
				supplementation. our study indicates that curcumin 
				supplementation positively influenced outcomes in 46.4% of 
				individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, 
				reducing pain, swelling, stiffness, and fatigue. this suggests

curcumin inhibits the progression of non-small cell 
				lung cancer by regulating dmrt3/slc7a11 axis
				molecular biotechnology | june 2024emerging studies have 
				shown that curcumin might repress non-small cell lung cancer 
				progression by regulating ferroptosis. curcumin blocked 
				non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation and angiopoiesis, 
				and induced apoptosis and ferroptosis. dmrt3 or slc7a11 
				upregulation partly abolished the suppressive role of curcumin

				intriguing avenues in the treatment of neurodegenerative 
				disorders, such as alzheimers and parkinsons diseases. 
				curcumin also protects against risk factors such as smoking, 
				alcohol, and stress, the ascertained pleiotropic nature of 
				curcumin creates interference in complex biological processes 
				and various inflammatory factors that regulate 
				oxidationreduction processes, such as reactive oxygen species 
				(ros), cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), interleukins (ils), 
				nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb), c-reactive proteins, 
				transforming growth factor-β (tgf-β), and other enzymes involved 
				in inflammation. curcumin inhibits vascular endothelial growth 
				factor (vegf) and various kinases, demonstrating a controlling 
				action in angiogenesis and the growth of cancerous lesions. due

antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects 
				of curcumin and curcuminoids in sh-sy5y cells infected by 
				sars-cov-2nature | may 2024curcumin, a 
				natural spice, has garnered significant attention for its 
				potential in treating conditions characterized by immune system 
				perturbations and inflammatory responses, including covid-19. 
				cur and other curcuminoids are the primary bioactive components 
				of turmeric (curcuma longa), a substance that has been 
				employed in the traditional medicine practices of diverse 
				cultures for centuries. this enduring use is attributed to the 
				anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral and 
				neuroprotective properties exhibited by curcuminoids. 
				furthermore, curcuminoids can play a role in inhibiting certain 
				enzymes associated with the inflammatory process, such as 
				mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks), c-jun n-terminal 
				kinases (jnk), and nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kb). the 
				antioxidant properties of curcuminoids have been shown to 
				inhibit carcinogenic reactive oxygen species (ros), including 
				superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, nitrites, and peroxides. 
				curcumin can stimulate both the activation of antioxidant 
				enzymes and the decrease in expression of pro-inflammatory 
				cytokines. a recent systematic review identified six studies 
				demonstrating that curcumin supplementation led to a significant 
				decrease in common covid-19 symptoms, reduced hospitalization 
				duration, and decreased mortality rates. the authors concluded 
				that curcumin treatment mitigates the manifestation of cytokine 
				storms by reducing pro-inflammatory factors and activating 
				anti-inflammatory pathways. they further suggested that curcumin 
				treatment may alleviate covid-19 symptoms by restoring the 
				balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory 
				responses.

				treatment significantly alleviated ox-ldl-induced huvecs injury, 
				as evidenced by elevating the proliferative ability, cell 
				migration, and angiogenesis. moreover, the wnt/β-catenin pathway 
				was substantially boosted following ox-ldl treatment, which was 
				suppressed by curcumin. the inhibitory effects of curcumin 
				treatment on the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were reduced by 
				skl2001. furthermore, the promoting effects of curcumin on 
				ox-ldl-induced cell damage were hampered following skl2001 
				treatment in huvecs (p < 0.05). conclusion: curcumin elevated 
				cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of huvecs to 
				inhibit the development of atherosclerosis through inactivating 
				the wnt/β-catenin pathway.  


the 
				impact of curcumin, resveratrol, and cinnamon on modulating 
				oxidative stress and antioxidant activity in type 2 diabetes: 
				moving beyond an anti-hyperglycaemic evaluation  
antioxidants | may 2024curcumin is an active 
				chemical compound present in the rhizome of the plant curcuma 
				longa, also known as turmeric. it exhibits antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-rheumatic, 
				immunomodulatory, anti-hyperglycaemic, and cardio-renal-hepato-protective 
				properties. in one animal study, curcumin and its analogues were 
				shown to have a similar mechanism of action to 
				thiazolidinedione, an antidiabetic drug, through the activation 
				of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 
				(ppar-γ), suggesting that curcumin may be effective in 
				regulating glycaemia and lipid levels. curcumin appears to have 
				beneficial effects in reducing fasting glucose, glycated 
				haemoglobin (hba1c), homeostatic model assessment of insulin 
				resistance (homa-ir), and tnf-α. it also positively influences 
				lipid metabolism by lowering low-density lipoprotein (ldl) 
				cholesterol and triglyceride levels while increasing 
				high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol. curcumin 
				demonstrates beneficial effects not only on the glycaemic 
				control but also on anthropometric parameters. hodaei et al. 
				recruited 53 individuals with excess body weight and t2dm. after 
				10 weeks of supplementation, the study group showed a 
				significant decrease in body weight, body mass index (bmi), 
				waist circumference, and blood glucose levels (p < 0.05) 
				compared to the control group. jiménez-osorio et al investigated 
				the impact of curcumin supplementation on markers of oxidative 
				stress, antioxidant enzyme activity, and nuclear factor 
				erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2) activation. in individuals 
				with non-diabetic proteinuria and ckd, curcumin attenuated lipid 
				peroxidation, whereas curcumin increased antioxidant capacity in 
				individuals with t2dm and ckd with proteinuria. these results 
				suggest a potential reduction in oxidative stress in patients 
				with diabetes and ckd. patients with t2dm and ckd (n = 14) 
				received 500 mg/day of curcumin for 15 days (30 days in patients 
				with overt proteinuria). curcumin supplementation significantly 
				reduced urinary microalbumin excretion and lowered serum mda 
				levels by enhancing the specifically nrf2-regulated protein, 
				nad(p)h quinone oxidoreductase 1 (nqo-1), along with other 
				antioxidant enzymes in the lymphocytes. additionally, patients 
				showed reduced serum lipopolysaccharide (lps) content and 
				increased inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-b kinase (iκb 
				kinase) proteins inhibiting inflammatory signalling in 
				lymphocytes. interestingly, curcumin stimulated the activity of 
				several gut bacteria crucial for maintaining the integrity and 
				functioning of the gut barrier. in summary, short-term curcumin 
				intervention inhibits the progression of dkd by activating the 
				nrf2 antioxidant system and exerting anti-inflammatory effects 
				in patients with t2dm. aerobic training + curcumin 
				supplementation group showed the best results with significantly 
				reduced mda and hs-crp levels and increased glutathione and tac 
				compared to the aerobic-training and 
				curcumin-supplementation-alone, respectively. these results 
				demonstrate the positive effects of curcumin supplementation and 
				physical activity on the metabolic state, oxidative stress 
				markers, and hs-crp. curcumin supplementation appears to have 
				beneficial effects in individuals with t2dm and coronary heart 
				disease. shafabakhsh et al. recruited 60 patients with t2dm and 
				chd aged 4585 and were randomly assigned to two groupsthe 
				experimental group receiving 1000 mg/day of curcumin and the 
				control group receiving a placebo for 12 weeks. after the 
				intervention, the experimental group showed a significant 
				reduction in mda levels and a significant increase in tac and 
				gsh levels compared to those of the placebo group. additionally, 
				curcumin consumption increased the level of peroxisome 
				proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppar-γ). na et al. 
				investigated whether curcumin supplementation reduced a-fabp 
				levels. the curcumin-receiving group had significantly reduced 
				serum a-fabp levels, crp, tnf-α, and il-6compared to the placebo 
				one. additionally, curcumin supplementation also significantly 
				increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (sod) in serum. 
				the researchers concluded that curcumin may have antidiabetic 
				effects by reducing a-fabp levels in serum. curcumin also 
				exhibits lipid-metabolism-lowering effects. forty-four 
				individuals with t2dm were randomly assigned to a group 
				supplementing with curcumin at a dose of 1500 mg/day or to a 
				control group receiving a placebo for 10 weeks. in the 
				curcumin-supplementing group, the average hs-crp concentration 
				significantly decreased, and the average adiponectin 
				concentration significantly increased compared to in the placebo 
				group. these results suggest that curcumin intake may reduce 
				diabetic complications by decreasing tg levels and inflammatory 
				markers.


unraveling the protective effects of curcumin 
				against drugs of abusecell | may 2024
				curcumin, a natural compound derived from the turmeric plant (curcuma 
				longa), has garnered significant attention for its diverse 
				neuroprotective properties. curcumin has been widely recognized 
				for its remarkable anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
				anti-apoptotic effects, which have shown great potential in the 
				treatment of various disorders, encompassing psychiatric and 
				neurodegenerative diseases. overall, curcumin demonstrates 
				promising effects against the neurotoxicity induced by abused 
				drugs through a wide range of mechanisms; modulation of 
				inflammatory cytokines, maintenance of ion homeostasis, 
				epigenetic regulation, enhancement of antioxidant capacity, as 
				well as the activation of the camp response element-binding 
				protein (creb) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) 
				signaling pathways. curcumin has demonstrated its viability as a 
				potential therapeutic option for cancer treatment by selectively 
				targeting diverse cell signaling pathways encompassing growth 
				factors, cytokines, transcription factors, and genes that 
				regulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis. curcumin has been 
				shown to be effective in treating outcomes linked to obesity 
				through promoting the expression of antioxidants and directly 
				slowing preadipocyte development. studies have demonstrated the 
				possible benefits of curcumin in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
				disease (copd), through attenuation of airway inflammation and 
				remodeling. moreover, the relaxant effects of curcumin on 
				tracheal smooth muscle indicate its bronchodilatory properties, 
				suggesting its potential advantage in the treatment of diverse 
				respiratory and allergic disorders. this evidence supports its 
				ability to promote crucial aspects of wound healing, such as 
				collagen deposition, granulation tissue formation, tissue 
				remodeling, and wound contraction. another potential mechanism 
				of action of curcumin on depressive symptoms is linked to the 
				inhibition of transcription signaling pathways of some nuclear 
				factors, including nuclear factor kappa b, which is necessary 
				for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is 
				consequently involved in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation. 
				furthermore, curcumin has been shown to boost levels of 
				brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), a neurotrophin linked 
				to the etiology of depression. in addition to its therapeutic 
				effects on depressive disorders, curcumin has exhibited 
				potential as a therapeutic intervention for delusional 
				disorders. these findings suggest that curcumin emerges as a 
				promising therapeutic agent in combatting the detrimental 
				effects induced by drugs of abuse. curcumin has demonstrated the 
				ability to attenuate neuronal damage, oxidative stress, 
				inflammation, and apoptosis induced by these addictive 
				substances. the findings presented in this review highlight the 
				potential of curcumin as a multifaceted neuroprotective agent in 
				the context of drug addiction. by targeting key pathological 
				pathways associated with drug-induced neurotoxicity, curcumin 
				holds great promise for the prevention and treatment of 
				addiction-related cognitive impairments and neurodegenerative 
				disorders. furthermore, the ability of curcumin to modulate 
				neuroplasticity and synaptic plasticity provides a rationale for 
				its use in promoting neuronal recovery and functional 
				restoration following chronic drug exposure.  


curcumin in the treatment of inflammation and

				brain injury by alleviating oxidative stress and inflammatory 
				responses and promoting neuroprotection. it holds potential as a 
				therapeutic agent for human traumatic brain injury.  
				curcumin significantly mitigates the effects of inflammatory 
				cytokines such as il-1β, il-6, and tnf-α. moreover, curcumin 
				enhances the efficacy of oxidative stress factors, including 
				sod, sir2, gpx, and nrf2. regarding neurological function, 
				curcumin reduces brain edema, increases neuron survival rates 
				and augmentation. furthermore, curcumin enhances the effects of 
				beclin-1 and bcl-2 in autophagy and apoptosis. curcumin, 
				administered in various concentrations, durations, and routes, 
				significantly reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in the 
				experimental group, improves nerve function following tbi, and 
				mitigates the inflammatory response. bassani et al. demonstrated 
				that curcumin effectively reduces neuroinflammation in models of 
				neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. additional 
				studies conducted in animal experimental models have shown that 
				curcumin inhibits the tlr4/nf-κb signaling pathway, thereby 
				down-regulating inflammatory cytokines. the results of this 
				meta-analysis confirm that curcumin effectively reduces 
				oxidative stress levels following tbi. curcumin, a widely used 
				antioxidant with neuroprotective properties, has been shown to 
				inhibit lipid peroxide formation in the presence of lipid 
				peroxidation-inducing drugs. moreover, curcumin reduces levels 
				of mda, 4-hne, and protein carbonyls, restores mitochondrial 
				oxidation function, stabilizes cell membrane homeostasis, and 
				thereby mitigates the oxidative stress response following tbi. 
				gao et al. demonstrated that curcumin treatment significantly 
				reduces mda levels and induces gpx activation, thereby 
				ameliorating tbi-induced oxidative stress in rat models. studies 
				provide evidence that curcumin is a potent activator of nrf2 
				both in vivo and in vitro, enhancing nrf2 
				activation in the brain.

				protect cardiomyocytes against sepsissigna 
				vitae | may 2024the results show that curcumin significantly 
				improved cell viability in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced h9c2 
				cells (p < 0.01). curcumin also significantly reduced 
				inflammatory factor levels in lps-induced cardiomyocytes (p < 
				0.001). curcumin down-regulated ros and mda levels (p < 0.001), 
				and up-regulated sod and gsh levels (p < 0.001). a decrease in 
				both fe2+ content and protein expression of acsl4 (p < 0.001), 
				and increased protein expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 
				(gpx4) (p < 0.001) were observed with curcumin. by knocking down 
				nrf2 curcumins therapeutic effect against lps was eliminated. 
				so curcumin can inhibit lps-induced oxidative stress, 
				inflammation and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes by regulating 
				nrf-2/ho-1 signaling.


the role of curcumin in cancer: a focus on the pi3k/akt pathway
				cancers | may 2024curcumin is a polyphenol isolated from the 
				rhizomes of curcuma longa and has been widely studied for its 
				anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer effects. 
				curcumin acts on the regulation of different aspects of cancer 
				development, including initiation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and 
				progression. the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k)/protein 
				kinase b (akt) pathway is a key target in cancer therapy, since 
				it is implicated in initiation, proliferation, and cancer cell 
				survival. curcumin has been found to inhibit the pi3k/akt 
				pathway in tumor cells, primarily via the regulation of 
				different key mediators, including growth factors, protein 
				kinases, and cytokines. this review presents the therapeutic 
				potential of curcumin in different malignancies, such as 
				glioblastoma, prostate and breast cancer, and head and neck 
				cancers, through the targeting of the pi3k/akt signaling 
				pathway. this review focuses on the multifaceted role of 
				curcumin in improving different malignancies, primarily through 
				the regulation of the pi3k/akt signaling pathway. from a 
				biological point of view, this structural property of curcumin 
				has been widely studied in diseases such as arthritis and 
				alzheimers disease. moreover, the presence of the diketone 
				group, along with the two phenolic groups, allows curcumin to 
				take part in different reactions in which electron transfer and 
				hydrogen abstraction are involved. this is particularly useful 
				in the case of reactions with free radicals. curcumins reaction 
				with reactive oxygen species (ross) results in the formation of 
				curcuminphenoxyl radicals that are more stable and less 
				reactive than the initial free forms. interestingly, the 
				stabilization of superoxide radicals by curcumin has been 
				considered equally efficient to the effects of key antioxidants, 
				such as superoxide dismutase.  


curcumin attenuates brain aging by reducing 
				apoptosis and oxidative stressmetabolic 
				brain disease | may 2024curcumin, exerts its neuroprotective 
				and anti-aging effects in the aged brain. curcumin is a natural 
				antioxidant with potent anti-aging and neuroprotective 
				properties. our results indicated that treatment with curcumin 
				in aged rats attenuates brain lipid peroxidation, which was 
				accompanied by a significant increase in the bdnf, vegf, 
				superoxide dismutase (sod) activity, and anti-apoptotic protein 
				bcl-2. the study indicates that curcumin could alleviate brain 
				aging which may be due to attenuating oxidative stress, 
				inhibiting apoptosis, and up-regulating sod activity, which in 
				turn enhances vegf and bdnf. therefore, curcumin has potential 
				therapeutic value in the treatment of neurological apoptosis,

				and inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease patients: a 
				randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
				preprints | may 2024curcumin, a hydrophobic polyphenol, 
				exhibits potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, 
				antimicrobial, anti-glycating, anti-coagulant and healing 
				properties, as evidenced by both experimental studies and 
				clinical trials clinical trials in ibd and other clinical 
				situations such as type 2 diabetes and some cancers. our 
				findings allow to affirm that the standard commercially 
				available powder, rich in curcumin and combined with piperine, 
				exhibits significant antioxidant action by substantially 
				enhancing the endogenous defense mechanism, as evidenced by a 
				noteworthy increase in serum sod superoxide dismutas levels 
				among supplemented patients over the three-month intervention 
				period. these unprecedented results for this polyphenol 
				underscore its beneficial effects on patients with ibd. results 
				are corroborated by a randomized clinical trial in patients with 
				metabolic syndrome, where the combination of curcumin plus 
				piperine, supplemented at the same dosage used daily in this 
				study (1000 mg + 10 mg), for 8 weeks, significantly increased 
				sod superoxide dismutas activity. another study conducted by 
				panahi et al. also demonstrated the effectiveness of curcumin in 
				increasing sod activity in patients with osteoarthritis after 6 
				weeks thus demonstrating the effectiveness of curcumin on this 
				marker. of redox imbalance. the observed increase in sod levels 
				in this study among patients receiving curcumin plus piperine, 
				with no alterations in h2o2 and mda levels, suggests a 
				beneficial effect of this supplementation.  


curcumin prevents high glucose-induced stimulatory 
				effects of renal cell secretome on fibroblast activation via 
				mitigating intracellular free radicals and tgf-β secretion
				biomedicine & pharmacotherapy | may 2024all the effects of 
				high glucose were successfully mitigated by curcumin. curcumin 
				prevents the high glucose-induced stimulatory effects of renal 
				cell secretome on fibroblast activation, at least in part, via 
				mitigating intracellular ros and tgf-β secretion. in kidney 
				stone mice and h2o2-exposed macrophages, curcumin has been 
				demonstrated to hamper oxidative stress by elevating glutathione 
				production and antioxidant enzyme activity. additionally, 
				curcumin has been reported with an anti-fibrotic property to 
				attenuate renal fibrosis induced by kidney stone disease and 
				ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice accompanied by the reduction 
				of α-smooth muscle actin (α-sma), collagen i, and fibronectin 
				expression. curcumin has multiple health benefits due to its 
				anti-diabetic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. 
				particularly in chronic kidney disease (ckd), recent randomized 
				controlled trials have reported that curcumin can reduce 
				oxidative stress as recognized by a decrease in malondialdehyde 
				(an oxidative stress marker) and an increase in catalase (an 
				antioxidant) in the plasma of ckd patients undergoing 
				hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. furthermore, curcumin 
				supplementation for 12 weeks can suppress inflammatory processes 
				in hemodialysis patients as shown by reduced expression of nf-κb 
				in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and decreased plasma 
				levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-6 and tnf-α). 
				 


a role for curcumin in preventing liver fibrosis in 
				animal: a systematic review and meta-analysis  

frontiers in pharmacology | may 2024curcumin therapy 
				improved fibrosis degree, oxidative stress level, inflammation 
				level, and liver synthesis function in animal models of liver 
				fibrosis. curcumin intervention not only mitigates liver 
				fibrosis but also enhances liver function, while concurrently 
				modulating inflammatory responses and antioxidant capacity in 
				animal models. this result provided a strong basis for further 
				large-scale animal studies as well as clinical trials in humans 
				in the future. numerous studies demonstrated that curcumin 
				effectively targets the inhibition of hsc activation (shu et 
				al., 2023).  curcumin could inhibit activity and promote 
				apoptosis in lx-2 cells by suppressing autophagy through 
				activation of the pi3k/akt/mtor signaling pathway (shu et al., 
				2023). lian et al. discovered that curcumin inhibits glycolysis 
				and regulates metabolism in hscs by modulating hedgehog 
				signaling (lian et al., 2015). qin et al., in their intervention 
				with curcumin on hsc-t6 cells, found that curcumin could protect 
				against activation and migration of hepatic stellate cells by 
				inhibiting the cxcl12/cxcr4 biological axis in liver fibrosis 
				(qin et al., 2018). research indicates that curcumin reduces 
				serum cholesterol levels by increasing hepatic ldl receptor 
				expression, inhibiting ldl oxidation, and enhancing bile acid 
				secretion and faecal cholesterol excretion (zhang et al., 2019). 
				curcumin also suppresses genes involved in cholesterol 
				biosynthesis, proecting against liver injury and fibrogenesis in 
				animal models (fu et al., 2008; peschel et al., 2007). curcumin, 
				a hydrophobic polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of 
				curcuma longa, is widely utilized in the treatment of 
				cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, and tumours (xu et al., 
				2020; jabczyk et al., 2021; pourbagher-shahri et al., 2021). 
				clinical and basic studies have confirmed its remarkable 
				pharmacological efficacy in treating liver diseases like nafld, 
				liver fibrosis, and liver cancer (nelson et al., 2017; farzaei 
				et al., 2018); (e. s. lee et al., 2020) our meta-analysis 
				showcased curcumins effectiveness in preclinical liver fibrosis 
				studies. the potential protective mechanisms observed in animals

				cardiomyocytes by mediating oxidative stress and apoptotic 
				pathways. curcumin acts against coronary microembolization-induced 
				myocardial damage by which the mechanism is related to reducing 
				myocardial apoptosis and inhibiting inflammation. the protective 
				effects of curcumin on cardiovascular diseases have been 
				extensively elucidated. curcumin restores biochemical indices, 
				maintains antioxidant capacity, and reduces pro-inflammatory 
				cytokine in diabetes-induced myocardial infarction. consistent 
				with these study findings, our research discovered that curcumin 
				pretreatment recovered pathological changes in myocardial tissue 
				and reduced apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and oxidative 
				stress by altering relevant indicators. protective efficacy 
				against cardiovascular diseases by curcumin, a common natural 
				polyphenolic compound, which has antithrombotic properties and 
				reduces platelet accumulation in the circulation by inhibiting 
				thromboxane synthesis has been demonstrated. curcumin improved 
				ape-induced myocardial injury, reduced myocardial tissue edema,

				neurodegenerative diseases: a review
				international journal of research and analytical reviews | may 
				2024curcumin, a polyphenolic compound found in turmeric, has 
				gained attention for its potential neuroprotective properties. 
				it has long been utilized as a medical herb and culinary spice 
				in asian countries for a range of illnesses. this review centers 
				on the latest developments and the underlying processes of 
				curcumin's numerous natural benefits against neurodegenerative 
				diseases, including parkinson's disease. the current research 
				indicates that the diagnosis of major depressive disorder is 
				related to both the neuroprotective benefits of antidepressants 
				and cellular shrinkage and the death of neurons. the 
				neuroprotection of curcumin against parkinson's disease and 
				alzheimer's disease is primarily attributed to its 
				anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. in addition, 
				according to reports curcumin improves striatal th survival 
				filaments additionally, pars compacta (snpc) neurons, reduces 
				aberrant turning geste, and exerts neuroprotective effects, at 
				least partially, through a 7-nachr-mediated medium. in multiple 
				sclerosis (ms), an important part of the immune system is 
				inflammation that leads to the damage seen in the cns. curcumin 
				inhibits t cell, and il-12 signaling and may be used to treat ms 
				and other inflammatory conditions. curcumins anti-inflammatory, 
				anticancer, and antibacterial qualities have been the subject of 
				numerous both in vitro and in vivo investigations, both of its 
				own and in conjunction with conventional therapies. studies on 
				epidemiology have shown that cultures with high curcumin 
				consumption have lower rates of disorders affecting inflammatory 
				and memory retention, such as alzheimer's illness. curcumin has 
				been utilized and additionally proposed is a possible preventive 
				measure against parkinson's disorder since studies have 
				indicated that curcumin-consuming indian communities do not 
				exhibit age-related alterations in their neural neurons that 
				produce dopamine. furthermore, as will be covered in more 
				information below, a multitude of both vivo and in vitro 
				investigations offer strong proof that curcumin protects against 
				parkinson's disease-like symptoms. in conclusion, the 
				neuroprotective effect of curcumin on neurodegenerative diseases 
				holds significant promise based on the comprehensive body of 
				research conducted thus far. through its multifaceted mechanisms 
				of action including antioxidant, anti- inflammatory, and 
				anti-amyloid properties, curcumin demonstrates the potential to 
				mitigate neurodegenerative processes associated with conditions 
				such as depression, alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, 
				and multiple sclerosis. the studies reviewed consistently 
				indicate that curcumin possesses the ability to modulate key 
				cellular pathways involved in neuroprotection, thereby 
				attenuating neuronal damage and improving cognitive function in 
				various experimental models. the existing evidence underscores 
				curcumin as a promising natural compound worthy of continued 
				exploration for the development of novel therapeutic strategies 
				against neurodegenerative diseases.

				inhibits α-synuclein aggregation by acting on liquidliquid 
				phase transition food | april 2024
				parkinsons disease, the second most common neurodegenerative 
				disorder, is linked to α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation. curcumin 
				can inhibit amyloid formation by inhibiting the occurrence of 
				llps and the subsequent formation of oligomers of α-syn in the 
				early stages of aggregation. these results may help to clarify 
				the mechanism by which curcumin inhibits the formation of α-syn 
				aggregates during the development of parkinsons disease. 
				curcumin, the main polyphenolic substance present in the 
				rhizomes of curcuma longa l., has been shown to 
				interact with amyloid-β peptide and α-syn, thus inhibiting their 
				aggregation, deposition, and neurotoxicity. importantly, 
				curcumin has also been recognized for its pharmacological 
				benefits in a multitude of pathological contexts, including 
				diabetes, cancer, and even neurodegenerative diseases. we found 
				that curcumin could inhibit the formation of α-syn oligomers by 
				affecting the initial phase transition of α-syn in the

				the curcumin, metformin and curcumin and metformin combination 
				groups. curcumin is therapeutically effective for pcos and is 
				comparable to metformin. curcumin is a major herbal constituent 
				of turmeric (nelson et al. 2017), it had been used in herbal 
				medicine for ages, partially for its anti-inflammatory effects (mahdizadeh 
				et al. 2015). curcumin, that golden concoction, is used for 
				almost every ailment, acute and chronic (amalraj et al. 2017; 
				kunnumakkara et al. 2017). from cancer to obesity, no health 
				problem has not been presumed to profit from curcumin, mainly 
				due to curcumins antineoplastic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, 
				and anti-inflammatory qualities (kocaadam and şanlier 2017; li 
				et al. 2018). increasingly available evidence is accumulating 
				regarding curcumin potential efficacy for pulmonary diseases 
				(lelli et al. 2017). curcumin has also shown the potential to be 
				effective for skin diseases such as psoriasis, atopic 
				dermatitis, and wound care (vollono et al. 2019). additionally, 
				curcumin is non-toxic and safe for humans consumption (soleimani 
				et al. 2018). curcumin anti-inflammatory properties make it 
				potentially useful for many disorders and ailments whose 
				pathophysiological basis implicates inflammation. type ii 
				diabetes (t2d) a prevalent modern world disorder, is also 
				potentially responsive to curcumin in pre- and clinical studies 
				(pivari et al. 2019). endometriosis, a gynecological disorder 
				marked by inflammation, appears to benefit from the 
				anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin (arablou and kolahdouz-mohammadi 
				2018). curcumin effects were expected as it had been shown to be 
				effective for many disorders including gynecological disorders (arablou 
				and kolahdouz-mohammadi 2018). one possible mechanism for 
				curcumin effects on pcos signs might be its antioxidant powers 
				as oxidative stress has a role in pathogenesis of pcos (ryu et 
				al. 2019). curcumin anti-inflammatory properties also most 
				probably contribute to its effectiveness in disorders such as 
				pcos (salehi et al. 2019). also, the effect of curcumin could be 
				through its beneficial effects on glucose tolerance and lipid 
				profile which when improved can also improve symptoms of pcos. 
				curcumin improved insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles in 
				rats models of type 2 diabetes (francesca pivari, alessandra 
				mingione 2019). this study did not attempt to examine the exact 
				mechanism of curcumin effects in this model of pcos. thus, we 
				cannot be certain about the mechanism(s) of curcumin in 
				improving symptoms of pcos in this study.  


network pharmacology and molecular docking reveal 
				the mechanisms of curcumin activity against esophageal squamous 
				cell carcinomafrontiers in pharmacology | 
				april 2024curcumin displays anti-cancer activity against 
				various cancers. numerous lines of evidence indicate that 
				curcumin has a potential in the management of various forms of 
				cancer, including prostate cancer (termini et al., 2020), 
				colorectal cancer (pricci et al., 2020), breast cancer (deng et 
				al., 2022), endometrial carcinoma (zhang et al., 2019) and 
				non-small cell lung cancer (xie et al., 2022). curcumin has 
				potential anti-escc activity. for instance, curcumin can induce 
				apoptosis and enhance the sensitivity of fluorouracil escc cell 
				death by suppressing the nf-κb signaling pathway (tian et al., 
				2012). according to deng and his colleagues, the combination of 
				curcumin and docetaxel triggers cell death and self-degradation 
				in escc cells through the pi3k/akt/mtor signaling pathway (deng 
				et al., 2021). in escc cells, curcumin inhibits stat3-mediated 
				signaling and induces apoptosis and growth arrest (liu et al., 
				2018). curcumin has been widely used in cancer treatment (bar-sela 
				et al., 2010; zoi et al., 2021). a recent study found that 
				curcumin has the ability to regulate the 
				circnrip1/mir-532-3p/akt pathway, resulting in the suppression 
				of escc (luo et al., 2023). furthermore, curcumin induces 
				apoptosis (liu et al., 2018; deng et al., 2021) and suppresses 
				esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation (hosseini 
				et al., 2018), and blocks the growth of primary esophageal 
				squamous cell carcinoma-derived xenografts in vitro (liu et al., 
				2018). based on the findings from the go and kegg analyses, 
				curcumin has the potential to address esophageal squamous cell 
				carcinoma by modulating pathways related to cell cycle, 
				programmed cell death, and cellular aging. our experiments 
				showed that curcumin induced a pause in the cell cycle at the 
				g2/m and s stages. cck8 experiments and clone formation assays 
				indicated that curcumin significantly inhibited esophageal 
				squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation. furthermore, 
				transwell invasion assays demonstrated that curcumin inhibited 
				esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell invasion and sa-β-gal 
				measurement indicated that curcumin can induce esophageal 
				squamous cell carcinoma cell senescence. western blot results 
				showed that curcumin may treat esophageal squamous cell 
				carcinoma by inhibiting cdk2/rb pathway. 5 conclusion in 
				summary, our findings from network pharmacology, molecular 
				docking, and in vitro experimental confirm that curcumin 
				possesses the capacity to inhibit the proliferation and invasion 
				of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. this is achieved 
				through the induction of cell cycle arrest, regulation of foxo, 
				cell senescence, il-17, and many cancer-related signaling 
				pathways. curcumin may exert anti-escc effects by interacting 
				with chek1, top2a, cdk2, aurka, cdk6, dhfr, egfr, stat3, pparg, 
				and serpine1cur arrested escc cells at the g2/m and s phases, as 
				shown by flow cytometry. colony formation and cck8 assays showed 
				that curcumin can inhibit the proliferative ability of 
				esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. the transwell invasion 
				results validated that curcumin can significantly inhibit the 
				invasion rates of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. 
				collectively, these findings indicate that curcumin exhibits 
				pharmacological effects on multiple targets and pathways in 
				esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  


the effects of curcumin plus piperine co-administration on 
				inflammation and oxidative stress: a systematic review and 
				meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
				current medicinal chemistry | april 2024results indicated 
				that curcumin plus piperine administration could effectively 
				reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. the beneficial effects 
				of curcumin against various chronic disorders have been shown in 
				the last few decades. piperine has been used in scientific 
				evaluations as an effective compound to increase the 
				bioavailability of curcumin. according to the current 
				meta-analysis, curcumin plus piperine administration showed a 
				significantly increased sod activity and gsh levels while 
				significantly decreased mda concentrations. in addition, our 
				study revealed that curcumin plus piperine significantly 
				decreased tnf-α and il-6 concentrations.  


nf-κb pathway as a molecular target for curcumin in 
				diabetes mellitus treatment: focusing on oxidative stress and 
				inflammationauthorea | april 2024this 
				study extensively explores the prospective therapeutic benefits 
				of curcumin, a bioactive compound known for its antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic properties, in addressing 
				diabetic complications, predominantly via the modulation of the 
				nf-κb pathway. the findings reveal that curcumin administration 
				effectively lowered blood glucose elevation, reinstated 
				diminished serum insulin levels, and enhanced body weight in 
				streptozotocin -induced diabetic rats. curcumin exerts its 
				beneficial effects in management of diabetic complications 
				through regulation of signaling pathways, such as camkii, 
				ppar-γ, nf-κb, and tgf-β1. moreover, curcumin reversed the 
				heightened expression of inflammatory cytokines (tnf-α, il-1β, 
				il-6) and chemokines like mcp-1 in diabetic specimens, 
				vindicating its anti-inflammatory potency in counteracting 
				hyperglycemia-induced alterations. curcumin diminishes oxidative 
				stress, avert structural kidney damage linked to diabetic 
				nephropathy, and suppress nf-κb activity. furthermore, curcumin 
				exhibited a protective effect against diabetic cardiomyopathy, 
				lung injury, and diabetic gastroparesis. conclusively, the study 
				posits that curcumin could potentially offer therapeutic 
				benefits in relieving diabetic complications through its 
				influence on the nf-κb pathway. curcumin has shown potency 
				against numerous chronic conditions like alzheimers disease, 
				t2dm, rheumatoid arthritis, and metabolic syndrome. it possesses 
				a broad spectrum of therapeutic properties, including 
				antineoplastic, antimicrobial, anti-carcinogenic, 
				anti-mutagenic, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, 
				anti-proliferative, anti-amyloid, and anti-hypercholesterolemic 
				effects. mechanistically, curcumin inhibits the initiation of 
				the radical-sensitive transcription factor nf-κb, reduces 
				cytokine production, and impedes vital cellular survival 
				processes. it also inhibits stat proteins and nf-κb-dna binding, 
				diminishing the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules mmp-9, 
				mmp-3, and cytokines like tnf-α, il-1, and il-8. furthermore, 
				curcumin attaches to the cox-2 protein, curtailing cox-2 
				expression and the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes 
				[61]. clinical trials have consistently affirmed curcumins 
				assurance, acceptability, and effectiveness in addressing 
				diverse chronic disorders in humans. these trials reported no 
				toxicity when curcumin was given by mouth at a daily dose of 6 g 
				for a duration of 4 to 7 weeks. the study underscores curcumins 
				potential as a therapeutic agent in mitigating diabetes mellitus 
				complications, primarily through modulating the nf-κb pathway. 
				by demonstrating anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and 
				anti-fibrotic properties, curcumin has been effective in 
				managing multiple diabetic conditions, including nephropathy, 
				cardiomyopathy, and gastroparesis. the alteration of critical 
				signaling pathways such as camkii, ppar-γ, nf-κb, and tgf-β1 is 
				pivotal in curcumins beneficial effects. additionally, its 
				capacity to diminish os, curb inflammation, and enhance vascular 
				functionality vindicate curcumin as a promising candidate 
				molecule for management of diabetes mellitus complication. these 
				findings highlight the necessity to further explore the 
				potential of curcumin as a supplementary treatment option in 
				management of diabetes mellitus complications.


regulatory effects of curcumin on nitric oxide 
				signaling in the cardiovascular system
				nitric oxide | april 2024curcumin improves cardiovascular 
				function, acting as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
				increasing bioavailability of nitric oxide. the major component 
				of curcuma longa, curcumin, has long been utilized in 
				traditional medicine to treat various illnesses, especially 
				cardiovascular diseases. curcumin's pharmacological effects have 
				been well studied. it works by lowering the generation of ros, 
				restricting the entrance of potassium, suppressing nf-κb, 
				extracellularly regulated protein kinases (erk) 1/2 and c-jun 
				n-terminal kinase (jnk), and preventing the activity of 
				apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (asc). furthermore, 
				curcumin stimulates the sirtuin1 (sirt1)-forkhead box 
				transcription factor o1 (foxo1) axis, which decreases cardiac 
				oxidative stress levels and debilitates myocardial apoptosis. by 
				the sirt1/adenovirus e1b 19 kda-interacting protein 3 
				(bnip3)/b-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2)/beclin-1 autophagy axis, 
				curcumin may also preserve cardiomyocytes. curcumin enhances 
				left ventricular function in pressure-overloaded rabbits by 
				inhibiting collagen remodeling and reducing the expression of 
				tnf-a and mmps in the myocardium. tharaux et al. demonstrated 
				that curcumin inhibits fibrosis in the aorta and renal arteries, 
				preserving vessel wall elasticity. curcumin was found to exert 
				these effects by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin 
				system-transforming growth factor β1 (tgf-β1) collagen axis. 
				curcumin improves cardiovascular function as well as having 
				important pleiotropic effects, such as anti-inflammatory and 
				antioxidant, through its ability to increase the bioavailability 
				of nitric-oxide and to positively impact nitric-oxide related 
				signaling pathways.   


protective effect of curcumin on d-galactose-induced senescence 
				and oxidative stress in llc-pk1 and hk-2 cells
				antioxidants | april 2024curcumin has been reported to exert 
				antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, antimicrobial, 
				hypoglycemic, and anticancer effects. moreover, its safety, 
				tolerability, and non-toxicity have been reported in clinical 
				trials. regarding its antioxidant effects, curcumin is a 
				bifunctional antioxidant. it has two phenol groups which confer 
				a high hydrogen-donating activity and directly scavenges ros. 
				furthermore, this curcumin polyphenol increases the activity of 
				antioxidant enzymes such as cat, sod, glutathione peroxidase, 
				and heme oxygenase-1 through the activation of nuclear factor 
				erythroid 2-related factor (nrf2) that induces the expression of 
				genes coding for elements of the antioxidant system. 
				furthermore, curcumin has also been considered an anti-aging and 
				senolytic agent in different in vitro and in vivo models. 
				curcumin, through its antioxidant properties, decreased dna 
				damage and reduced the number of senescent cells, preventing the 
				decrease in lamin b1 in llc-pk1 cells. it has been observed that 
				the expression of lamin b1 is decreased by oxidative stress and 
				is related to the senescent phenotype. our results show that 
				curcumin prevents changes induced by d-galactose in different 
				senescence markers, notably β-galactosidase activity (decrease 
				of 20% in llc-pk1 cells) and pcna (decrease of 60% in hk-2 
				cells). moreover, it decreases oxidative stress (ros reduction 
				of 20% in both cell lines) and oxidative damage (8-ohdg 
				reduction of 25% in llc-pk1 cells) caused by d-galactose 
				treatment. therefore, curcumin has a moderate protective effect 
				on d-galactose-induced senescence and oxidative stress in 
				llc-pk1 and hk-2 cells and could be further considered as a 
				possible therapeutic agent. curcumin treatment decreased by 20% 
				the number of cells positive for senescence-associated 
				(sa)-β-d-galactosidase staining and by 25% the expression of 
				8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) and increased by 40% lamin 
				b1 expression. in hk-2 cells, curcumin treatment increased by 
				60% the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna, 
				50% klotho levels, and 175% catalase activity. in both cell 
				lines, this curcumin antioxidant decreased the production of ros 
				(20% decrease for llc-pk1 and 10 to 20% for hk-2). these data 
				suggest that curcumin treatment has a moderate protective effect 
				on d-galactose-induced senescence in llc-pk1 and hk-2 cells. 
				 


the modulatory effects of curcumin on the gut microbiota: a 
				potential strategy for disease treatment and health promotion
				microorganisms | march 2024in addition to its antioxidant 
				properties, curcumin exhibits various other biological 
				activities, such as anti-inflammatory effects, the modulation of 
				lipid metabolism, and the modulation of the immune system. these 
				activities contribute to its potential as an anticancer, 
				antitumor, and antithrombotic agent. furthermore, curcumin is 
				known to interact with various cellular and molecular targets, 
				including growth factors, chemokines, transcription factors, and 
				cell adhesion molecules, further enhancing its therapeutic 
				potential. the contradiction with the low bioavailability of 
				curcumin and its diverse pharmacological activities could be 
				resolved by considering the interactions of curcumin with the 
				gut microbiota. since this discovery, a large number of clinical 
				trials started to explore the therapeutic potential of curcumin 
				for a variety of human diseases, namely cancer, cardiovascular 
				diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammation. the 
				latest research indicates elevated levels of curcumin in the 
				gastrointestinal system after the oral intake of curcumin. it 
				has been proposed that curcumin interacts dynamically with the 
				intestinal microbiota, modulating the composition and activity 
				and exerting a potential therapeutic effect on diseases caused 
				by the dysbiosis of the intestinal flora. it has been found that 
				oral curcumin supplementation is able to target improvements in 
				gut barrier function and that higher levels of curcumin residues 
				have been found in the gut after oral curcumin administration, 
				emphasizing the possible positive effects of curcumin on the gut 
				microbiota. the important biological activities of curcumin, 
				such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-obesity, and 
				anticancer, have long been demonstrated, and it is able to fully 
				utilize its pharmacological effects through various molecular 
				targets. the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin is mainly 
				achieved by inhibiting the nf-κb, reducing the release of a 
				variety of pro-inflammatory factors, accompanied by the 
				scavenging of free radicals and the downregulation of ros 
				generation, thereby reducing oxidative stress and exerting its 
				antioxidant effects. therefore, curcumin can improve the 
				occurrence and development of atherosclerosis and inflammatory 
				bowel disease. in addition, curcumin maintains intestinal 
				barrier function by regulating multiple signaling pathways to 
				prevent damage from dietary factors or endogenous injury. 
				secondly, curcumin can regulate lipid metabolism and production 
				through mpak signaling, thus achieving the goals of treatments 
				for obesity.  


curcumin as a regulator of th17 cells: unveiling the 
				mechanismsfood chemistry oxford | march 
				2024curcumin exhibits anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and 
				antioxidant characteristics (chatterjee and pandey, 2011, 
				marjaneh et al., 2018, zahedi et al., 2023, mohajeri and 
				sahebkar, 2018). in the past two decades, studies have found 
				that curcumin has immunomodulatory effects, regulating the 
				activity of immune cells. recent reports have shown that 
				curcumin can reduce the proliferation of alloreactive t cells 
				and significantly suppress the differentiation of th17 cells 
				(park et al., 2013). curcumin also suppresses the production of 
				pro-inflammatory cytokines, including il-17 and tnf-α, in th17 
				cells, thereby reducing the expression of inflammatory cells, 
				particularly neutrophils, and resulting in decreased 
				inflammation and infiltration (mohammadian haftcheshmeh et al., 
				2021). curcumin demonstrates promise in regulating t cell 
				subsets associated with inflammatory diseases. xiao et al. (xiao 
				et al., 2022) reported that curcumin downregulated 
				pro-inflammatory th17 cells (cd4 + ccr6 + th17, cd4 + il-17a + 
				th17, il-17a, batf, c-maf, rorγt) and upregulated 
				anti-inflammatory treg cells (cd4 + foxp3 + treg, cd4 + il-10 + 
				treg, il-10, foxp3, eomes) in mice with diabetic colitis, 
				suggesting its ability to restore th17/treg balance. human 
				studies on curcumin's systemic bioavailability, metabolites, and 
				pharmacokinetics have primarily focused on patients with cancer. 
				garcea et al. (garcea et al., 2005) found that patients with 
				different stages of colorectal cancer who took 3.6 g of curcumin 
				for 7 days had pharmacologically effective concentrations of 
				curcumin in both normal and colorectal tissue (menozzi et al., 
				2009). curcumin has several roles in the regulation of enzymes 
				involved in inflammation, adhesion molecules, transcription 
				factors, protein kinases, cytokines, and redox balance. it 
				possesses various pharmacological functions, including 
				antimicrobial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, 
				antioxidant, and antifungal properties (howells et al., 2021, 
				heidari et al., 2023, bagheri et al., 2020, cicero et al., 2020, 
				keihanian et al., 2018, khayatan et al., 2022, mokhtari-zaer et 
				al., 2018, panahi et al., 2019, sahebkar, 2010, sahebkar, 2014, 
				iranshahi et al., 2010, mohammadi et al., 2019, panahi et al., 
				2012). it also plays a protective role against autoimmune 
				diseases. several studies have demonstrated that curcumin can 
				enhance the antitumor effects of chemotherapeutics, including 
				paclitaxel, against various cancers while also reducing the side 
				effects of conventional chemotherapies (ashrafizadeh et al., 
				2020). curcumin acts as an active scavenger of reactive oxygen 
				species (ros) and reactive nitrogen species. moreover, it 
				increases the synthesis of glutathione (gsh), a crucial 
				intracellular antioxidant (menon and sudheer, 2007, zheng et 
				al., 2017). curcumin also plays a role in protecting against 
				catalase activities and reducing the levels of glutathione 
				s-transferases (gst), superoxide dismutase (sod), and 
				glutathione peroxidase (gpx) (arshad et al., 2017). because 
				oxidative stress is closely related to inflammation, curcumin 
				indirectly inhibits pro-inflammatory reactions in the immune 
				system (he et al., 2015). notably, curcumin is a potent 
				immunomodulator, with strong interactions with different types 
				of immune cells, including neutrophils, t cells, mast cells, 
				epithelial cells, eosinophils, and basophils, resulting in the 
				regulation of pathological immune system reactions (panahi et 
				al., 2015, mohammadi et al., 2022, rahimi et al., 2019). the 
				immunomodulatory effects of curcumin, which confer protection 
				against immune-mediated diseases, are attributed to its ability 
				to interact with cells of the immune system (gao et al., 2004, 
				gautam et al., 2007, momtazi-borojeni et al., 2018). curcumin 
				can influence both the innate and adaptive immune reactions (haftcheshmeh 
				et al., 2022, gao et al., 2004). curcumin's immunomodulatory 
				properties arise from its ability to modulate the expression of 
				numerous pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, including 
				interleukin (il)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α, il-6, and 
				monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) (haftcheshmeh et al., 
				2022, gao et al., 2004, momtazi-borojeni et al., 2018, panahi et 
				al., 2016). curcumin, an active compound found in turmeric, 
				exhibits potent immunomodulatory effects, making it a promising 
				therapeutic agent for various inflammatory and autoimmune 
				disorders. recent studies have focused on the ability of 
				curcumin to modulate th17-mediated immune responses, which play 
				a critical role in the development of several autoimmune 
				diseases. curcumin has been shown to inhibit the proliferation 
				and differentiation of th17 cells and reduce the production of 
				specific pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-17, il-6, and 
				tnf-α. additionally, curcumin has been found to increase the 
				production of treg cells, which suppress excessive immune 
				responses and maintain immune homeostasis. overall, curcumin's 
				ability to target the th17 axis opens exciting avenues for 
				developing novel therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and 
				inflammatory diseases.  


phytocompounds-based therapeutic approach: investigating 
				curcumin and green tea extracts on mcf-7 breast cancer cell line
				
journal of genetic engineering and 
				biotechnology | march 2024results showed the anticancer and 
				cytotoxic properties of curcumin against mcf-7 cells, with a 
				relatively higher level of released ldh. the curcumin extract 
				downregulated the oncogenic raf-1, suppressed the telomerase and 
				upregulated the tnf-α and il-8 genes. results from the elisa 
				showed a notable increase in il-8 and tnf-α cytokines levels 
				after curcumin treatment, which culminated after 72 h. among 
				both extracts, only curcumin effectively modulated the 
				understudy molecular targets, achieving multi-targeting 
				anticancer activity against mcf-7 cells. moreover, the applied 
				dosage significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory 
				cytokines, which represent a component of the 
				cytokines-targeting-based therapeutic strategy.  


cytotoxic evaluation of curcumin and quercetin in 
				mcf-7 cell linesworld journal of biology 
				pharmacy and health sciences | march 2024curcumin, a 
				naturally occurring compound found in turmeric, has been 
				extensively studied for its potential anticancer properties, 
				including its effects on mcf-7 cell lines. mcf-7 cells are 
				commonly used as a model for studying breast anti-inflammatory 
				effects: both curcumin and quercetin possesses anti-inflammatory 
				properties, and chronic inflammation is often associated with 
				cancer development. by reducing inflammation, curcumin may 
				indirectly contribute to the cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. 
				in this study, the cytotoxic potential of a curcumin was found 
				to be greater than the cytotoxic potential of quercetin in the 
				individual testing, however the phyto nutrient combination & 
				natural extracts of both curcumin and quercetin shows the better 
				cytotoxic potential in the mcf7 breast cancer cell line. the 
				combination of both the phytoconstituents shows an effective 
				synergistic effect that can elicit a powerful cytotoxic response 
				on the breast cancer cells. the synergistic effects observed in 
				the combination of curcumin and quercetin on mcf-7 cells suggest 
				that the compounds may act through complementary mechanisms, 
				enhancing their individual anticancer activities.  


impact of curcumin on aging: manifestations and 
				limitationscurcumin and neurodegenerative 
				diseases | march 2024due to its potential for treating 
				cancer and alzheimers disease, turmeric, which contains 
				curcumin, has gained considerable attention in recent years. the 
				primary reason why curcumin is effective is its 
				anti-inflammatory properties. age-related redox imbalance 
				results in overexpression of reactive oxygen species levels. 
				curcumin reduces oxidative stress associated with cellular 
				senescence and can benefit aging individuals.

				simulationintegrative medicine discovery | 
				march 2024a wide range of pharmacological properties have 
				been attributed to curcumin, including antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, etc. researchers found that 
				curcumin had a beneficial effect on the expression of vascular 
				endothelial growth factor (vegf), tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
				(tnf-α), and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the retina of 
				diabetic rats. in addition, curcumin has also been demonstrated 
				to have the capability of slowing down or even reversing the 
				progression of certain fundus diseases, making it a new option 
				for the treatment of retinal diseases. as a result of this 
				study, curcumin may exert a role in the treatment of diabetic 
				retinopathy through multi-target and multi-pathway regulation, 
				which indicates a possible direction of future research. in 
				summary, through network pharmacology, molecular docking, and md 
				simulations, the present study investigated the potential 
				mechanisms of curcumin in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. 
				following its introduction into the body, curcumin has multiple 
				targets and pathways for treating diabetic retinopathy. several 
				targets were shown to be used by curcumin to exert anti-diabetic 
				retinopathy effects, including akt1, il-1b, il-6, alb, and 
				tnf-α, and regulating several signaling pathways such as 
				pi3k-akt signaling pathway, lipid and atherosclerosis signaling 
				pathway, and age-rage signaling pathway in diabetic 
				complications.

				curcumin due to its therapeutic potential in various diseases, 
				particularly in neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimers 
				disease. research indicates that this substance holds remarkable 
				potential as an effective and safe treatment.  


curcumin activates the jnk signaling pathway to 
				promote ferroptosis in colon cancer cells
				chemical biology & drug design | march 2024recent evidence 
				has proved that curcumin as a natural polyphenol has anticancer 
				and anti-proliferative effects in cancer cells. curcumin 
				suppressed sw-480 cancer cells viability in dose-dependent 
				manner. cell treatment with curcumin led to accumulation of ros 
				and iron within cells and increase in the intracellular levels 
				of lipid peroxidation. in addition, curcumin modulated the mrna 
				and protein expression levels of ferroptosis-related proteins 
				including acsl4, gpx4 and fth1 and suppression of jnk signaling. 
				curcumin may exhibit its anticancer effect on colorectal cancer 
				by downregulating jnk signaling to induce ferroptosis in sw-480 
				cells.

curcuminoids with antineurodegenerative properties: 
				current trends and future perspectives
				curcumin and neurodegenerative diseases | march 2024
				curcuminoids are bioactive compounds found in curcuma longa 
				linn. (zingiberaceae), a species commonly known as turmeric or 
				turmeric root, widely used in traditional medicine for 
				centuries. recent research has demonstrated the potential of 
				these metabolites as antineurodegenerative agents, substances 
				that can help prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases such 
				as alzheimers disease, parkinsons disease, and multiple 
				sclerosis. studies have focused on understanding the molecular 
				mechanisms by which curcuminoids exert their 
				antineurodegenerative properties, as well as developing more 
				effective and bioaccessible formulations of these compounds to 
				improve their bioavailability and ability to cross the 
				bloodbrain barrier. additionally, research has explored the 
				combination of curcumin with other substances or therapies, such 
				as combining them with other natural compounds, conventional 
				drugs, or non-pharmacological therapies like deep brain 
				stimulation.  


curcumin protects mice with myasthenia gravis by 
				regulating the gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids, and the 
				th17/treg balanceheliyon | march 2024 
				curcumin modified the gut microbiota composition, increased 
				microbial diversity, and, in particular, reduced 
				endotoxin-producing proteobacteria and desulfovibrio levels in 
				t-achr-induced gut dysbiosis. moreover, we found that curcumin 
				significantly increased fecal butyrate levels in mice with t-achr-induced 
				gut dysbiosis. in addition, curcumin repressed the increased 
				levels of lipopolysaccharide (lps), zonulin, and fd4 in plasma. 
				curcumin enhanced occludin expression in the colons of mg mice 
				induced with t-achr, indicating dramatically alleviated gut 
				permeability. furthermore, curcumin treatment corrected t-achr-induced 
				imbalances in th17/treg cells. curcumin modifies gut microbiota 
				composition and increases the abundance of scfa-producing 
				bacteria. curcumin reduced fd4 concentrations as well as lps and 
				zonulin levels in serum.  curcumin supplementation 
				increased the level of butyrate and regulated the th17/treg 
				balance.  curcumin is an effective constituent of the 
				traditional asian medicine turmeric with antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. of note, 
				curcumin has been recently proposed for the management of 
				neurological diseases by regulating the gut microbiota and 
				improving gut barrier function. it was reported that curcumin 
				could considerably alter the ratio of pathogenic and beneficial 
				bacteria by reducing the relative abundance of genera including
				prevotellaceae, coriobacterales, enterobacteria, and 
				enterococci while increasing the relative abundance of 
				favorable genera including bifidobacteria and 
				lactobacilli. hence, curcumin seems to have promising 
				clinical applications. we found that curcumin alleviated the 
				clinical symptoms, corrected the microbiota imbalance, increased 
				scfa-producing bacteria, reduced intestinal permeability, and 
				regulated the th17/treg balance in t-achr-induced mg mice. 
				considering the protective effect of curcumin on the gut 
				microbiota and the regulation of immune responses by scfas, we 
				evaluated the concentrations of scfas in the feces by using 
				gc‒ms. in the t-achr-induced eamg group, fecal acetic acid and 
				butyric acid concentrations were decreased, whereas curcumin 
				administration reversed this reduction. these changes may be 
				directly correlated to the abundance of the genera 
				oscillospira, akkermansia, and allobaculum. 
				curcumin has been proven to be neuroprotective and 
				anti-inflammatory in both humans and animals; furthermore, 
				curcumin is used to treat huntington's disease, alzheimer's 
				disease, and cerebral ischemia.according to our study, curcumin 
				alleviated the clinical symptoms of mg mice, which was 
				consistent with previous reports. in addition, curcumin altered 
				the gut microbiota composition, increased scfa-producing 
				bacteria, reduced intestinal permeability, and regulated the 
				th17/treg balance of t-achr-induced mg mice.  curcumin and 
				its metabolites have been demonstrated to affect the gut 
				microbiota. our findings have revealed that curcumin could 
				restore the original gut microbial composition in t-achr-induced 
				mg mice and increase the abundance of a few important bacterial 
				species. however, the disorders of the gut microbiota during 
				eamg were restored after treatment with curcumin, which mainly 
				manifested as an increase in gut microbial diversity and 
				richness. consistently, curcumin increased the frequency of cd4+ 
				cd25+ foxp3+ tregs and decreased the frequency of cd4+ il-17a+ 
				th17 cells in spleens and inguinal lymph nodes. this shows that 
				curcumin has the ability to restore the imbalance of th17/treg 
				cells in t-achr-induced mg mice. as a result, the host's immune 
				system contributes to the beneficial effects.  


curcumin promotes diabetic foot ulcer wound healing 
				by inhibiting mir-152-3p and activating the fbn1/tgf-β pathway
				molecular biotechnology | march 2024curcumin has been used 
				as a traditional remedy for inflammation and wound healing, and 
				it works at diverse stages, such as inflammation, maturation, 
				and proliferation, thereby accelerating the entire process of 
				wound healing. studies have shown that curcumin treatment can 
				cause fibroblasts to infiltrate into the wound site and 
				accelerate wound healing. in addition, curcumin has been found 
				to be beneficial for  diabetic foot ulcer and may be a 
				potential candidate for treatment. curcumin inhibited the 
				apoptosis of fibroblasts, promoted their migration ability, and 
				alleviated the damage of fibroblasts stimulated by hg. 
				furthermore, curcumin treatment promoted angiogenesis and 
				accelerated wound healing in  diabetic foot ulcer rats. 
				this suggests that curcumin plays an important role in the 
				process of alleviating  diabetic foot ulcer. according to 
				previous studies, there are many mirnas involved in the 
				treatment of different diseases by curcumin. studies have shown 
				that curcumin can attenuate vascular calcification through the 
				exosomal mir-4b-92p/klf3 axis, and curcumin therapy protects 
				pc12 cells from high glucose-induced inflammatory responses. 
				curcumin alleviates the progression of  diabetic foot ulcer 
				by inhibiting mir-152-3p.  in summary, curcumin activates 
				the fbn1/tgf-β pathway by inhibiting mir-152-3p, thereby 
				inhibiting hg-induced fibroblast apoptosis, promoting fibroblast 
				proliferation and migration, alleviating hg-induced fibroblast 
				damage, and promoting angiogenesis in  diabetic foot ulcer 
				rats, thereby accelerating wound healing in  diabetic foot 
				ulcer rats. this provides a new theoretical basis for curcumin 
				treatment of dfu and may become a potential therapeutic target 
				for diabetic foot ulcer.  


effects of turmeric (curcuma longa) on the gut-brain 
				axiscurcumin and neurodegenerative 
				diseases | march 2024 turmeric is a spice widely known for 
				its medicinal properties, including its effects on gut and 
				neurobehavioral health. the results showed that curcumin is the 
				most studied bioactive compound in turmeric. in vitro and in 
				vivo studies with animal models have demonstrated antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer properties of 
				turmeric and its isolated compounds. some studies have shown the 
				effects of this spice against gastrointestinal diseases, on the 
				balance of the intestinal microbiota, and neurobehavioral 
				parameters.  


preservative 
				effects of curcumin on semen of hu sheep  

				animals | march 2024curcumin is a diketone compound found in 
				the rhizomes of ginger plants that can neutralize ros and 
				improve the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes in the 
				body. curcumin can also promote nrf2 nuclear transport by 
				inhibiting the binding of keap1 to nrf2, thereby upregulating 
				the nrf2/are pathway, which increases the levels of ho-1 and 
				nqo1 and improves antioxidant activity in the body. curcumin has 
				been widely used in feed additives, which can enhance the 
				antioxidant capacity of animals and promote the nutrient 
				absorption rate in the gut. these results show that adding an 
				appropriate concentration (20 µmol/l) of curcumin to sheep semen 
				can affect sphingosine-1-phosphate, dehydroepiandrosterone 
				sulfate, phytosphingosine, and other metabolites of semen, 
				inhibit ros production, and prolong the time of 
				cryopreservation.


cardioprotective effects of curcumin against 
				diabetic cardiomyopathies: a systematic review and meta-analysis 
				of preclinical studiestraditional and 
				western medicine center for cardiovascular | march 2024
				meta-analysis showed that curcumin significantly improved 
				cardiac function indices, decreased markers of myocardial 
				injury, hw/bw ratio and randomized blood glucose compared to the 
				control group, in addition to showing beneficial effects on 
				mechanistic indices of myocardial oxidation, inflammation, 
				apoptosis, and autophagy. curcumin may exert cardioprotective 
				effects in dcm through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
				autophagy-enhancing, and anti-apoptotic effects. modern studies 
				have shown that curcumin can attenuate damage in dcm by being 
				anti-inflammatory(wei et al., 2023), anti-oxidative stress(wu et 
				al., 2022), anti-apoptosis(ren et al., 2020), modulation of 
				autophagy(sadeghi et al., 2023), and anti-fibrotic(wang et al., 
				2022). thus, curcumin emerges as a potential cardioprotective 
				candidate for ameliorating dcm. our results suggest that 
				curcumin may play a cardioprotective 486 role in dcm through its 
				antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, autophagy-enhancing, and 
				anti-apoptotic effects.  


curcumin inhibits prostate cancer by upregulating 
				mir-483-3p and inhibiting ube2cjournal of 
				biochemical and molecular toxicology | march 2024evidence 
				has shown the efficacy of curcumin in inhibiting the progression 
				of  prostate cancer. in this research, curcumin was found 
				to suppress the proliferation and enhance the apoptotic rate in 
				in vitro  prostate cancer cell models in a dose- and 
				time-dependent manner.  in humans, the expression levels of 
				ube2c are significantly higher in  prostate cancer versus 
				benign prostatic hyperplasia. treatment with curcumin decreased 
				the expression of ube2c, whereas it increased mir-483-3p 
				expression. in summary, curcumin exerts its antitumor effects 
				through regulation of the mir-483-3p/ube2c axis by decreasing 
				ube2c and increasing mir-483-3p. the findings may also provide 
				new molecular markers for  prostate cancer diagnosis and 
				treatment.


curcumin and turmeric extract inhibit sars-cov-2 
				pseudovirus cell entry and spike-mediated cell fusion
				biorxiv | march 2024our study shows that turmeric extract 
				and curcumin are potential inhibitors of sars-cov-2 infection at 
				entry points, either by direct or indirect infection models. 
				curcumin has been tested for its anti-sars-cov-2 activities by 
				plaque assay in vero cells. using the original virus, curcumin 
				inhibits sars-cov-2 infection. curcumin may inhibit sars-cov-2 
				viral replication as indicated by reduced n protein expression 
				following viral infection. here, we showed that curcumin and te 
				reduced psv entry in331 293t/hace2/tmprss2 cells, in which 10 μm 
				curcumin and 10 μg/ml te significantly affected the number of 
				gfp dots. from the previous studies, marin-palma et al. reported 
				that 10 μm curcumin can inhibit sars-cov-2 infection in vero e6 
				cells. it is also reported that curcumin inhibits sars-cov-2 
				infection at concentrations of 3-10 μm.28. furthermore, curcumin 
				inhibited psv339 entry in 293/hace2 cells. these results 
				corroborate curcumin effects against sars-cov-2340 infection 
				with our data representing curcumin inhibition at psv cell entry 
				point. it has been known that curcumin affects the early stages 
				of viral replication cycles, including viral-receptor 
				attachment, internalization, and fusion that have been studied 
				against several types of viruses which involve influenza, 
				dengue, zika, chikungunya, pseudorabies, and vsv. moreover, 
				curcumin and te inhibit secondary infection via cell-to-cell 
				transmission in a syncytia formation model mediated by 
				sars-cov-2 spike expression. cells treated with curcumin and te 
				showed smaller syncytia with fewer nuclei than control cells. 
				curcumin can also interact with sars-cov-2 spike. these data 
				align with our results that curcumin inhibited psv350 entry and 
				syncytia formation. our in vitro study using psv and syncytia 
				models revealed that both curcumin and te are potential 
				inhibitors of sars-cov-2 infection. curcumin can interfere with 
				the spike-receptor binding during direct viral or  
				intercellular transmission, hindering viral infection and cell 
				fusion.


interleukin-4 from curcumin-activated oecs emerges 
				as a central modulator for increasing m2 polarization of 
				microglia/macrophage in oec anti-inflammatory activity for 
				functional repair of spinal cord injury

cell communication and signaling | march 2024
				curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol extracted from rhizome of the 
				curcuma longa, possesses a variety of pharmacological and 
				biological effects properties, such as anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant, anticancer, immunomodulatory, autophagy-enhancing, 
				and anti-microbial, etc. [34,35,36,37,38]. in addition to the 
				reported benefits, numerous studies have shown that curcumin 
				exerts distinct neuroprotective and neutrophic effects on 
				neuronal cells and glia by modulating their related signalling 
				pathways [39,40,41]. noteworthy, several recent reports have 
				demonstrated that curcumin can improve oec proliferation, 
				migration, morphologic changes, secretion of neurotrophic 
				factors and phagocytic activity [29, 42]. that is, curcumin 
				significantly enhance the activation of oecs. in this regard, 
				curcumin potentiates the beneficial behavior of oecs including 
				anti-inflammation and immunomodulation. as a result, aoecs could 
				function as the most promising candidates for cell-based 
				transplantation therapy targeting the cns injury and 
				neurodegenerative diseases.  


investigation of the role of curcumin against the 
				toxicity induced by bisphenol a on the reproductive system in 
				male ratsjournal of kerbala for 
				agricultural sciences | march 2024the effect of curcumin as 
				a protective role against bpa on the oxidative stress parameters 
				showed that curcumin could decrease mda concentration and at the 
				same time increase the concentration of both catalase and sod. 
				also, the results revealed that curcumin could increase the 
				concentration of lh, fsh, and testosterone as compared to the 
				bpa-treated group. studies have demonstrated that curcumin 
				effectively addresses several male reproductive problems, hence 
				enhancing fertility. the positive benefits of curcumin may be 
				attributed to its capacity to scavenge free radicals and 
				function as an antioxidant agent, as well as its ability to 
				elevate serum testosterone levels. curcumin mitigated the impact 
				of bpa and suppressed the antioxidant enzyme system in the host 
				tissues. this resulted in a noteworthy decrease in mda levels 
				and a significant increase in catalase and sod levels compared 
				to the rats treated with bpa. therefore, curcumin partially 
				prevented the adverse effects caused by bpa. the presence of 
				phenolic compounds in curcumin's structures is a crucial element 
				in its ability to scavenge oxygen-derived free radicals that 
				cause cell lipid peroxidation. curcumin exhibits a protective 
				impact on the enzymes sod and cat, which are reduced as a result 
				of bpa induction. additionally, curcumin decreases lipid 
				peroxidation, specifically mda. when curcumin is used together 
				with other drugs, there is a considerable increase in 
				antioxidant enzyme levels and a reduction in oxidative stress. 
				using curcumin as an antioxidant to counteract the effects of 
				bpa has a positive impact by effectively neutralizing the 
				harmful free radicals and maintaining the sexual hormones at 
				their optimal levels.  


efficacy and safety of curcumin therapy for knee 
				osteoarthritis: a bayesian network meta-analysis
				journal of ethnopharmacology | march 2024compared with 
				placebo, curcumin significantly reduced the visual analogue 
				scale pain score and total womac score. compared with nsaids, 
				curcumin and curcumin + nsaids had a reduced incidence of 
				adverse reactions. the surface under the cumulative ranking 
				curve results indicated that curcumin monotherapy, curcumin + 
				chondroprotective agents, and curcumin + nsaids have good 
				clinical value in osteoarthritis treatment. curcumin, either 
				alone or in combination with other treatments, is considered to 
				have good clinical efficacy and safety in osteoarthritis 
				treatment. drug combinations containing curcumin may have the 
				dual effect of enhancing efficacy and reducing adverse 
				reactions. curcumin has anti-inflammatory, antitumour, 
				antioxidant, lipid-regulating, anticoagulant and other 
				pharmacological effects (benameur et al., 2023; luo et al., 
				2023; moballegh nasery et al., 2020; zhang et al., 2018). 
				curcumin is a bioactive natural substance with great potential 
				clinical application value and is widely used in traditional 
				chinese medicine to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
				arthritis (akaberi et al., 2021; feng et al., 2022; henrotin et 
				al., 2022). curcumin has anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects 
				similar to those of nsaids for arthritis and has a lower 
				incidence of adverse reactions (chopra et al., 2013). curcumin 
				is believed to exert an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting 
				the biological activity and synthesis of important proteases 
				that mediate the inflammatory process, such as cyclooxygenase-2, 
				lipoxygenase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) (paulino 
				et al., 2016). in addition, curcumin is believed to protect 
				cartilage (comblain et al., 2016; liu et al., 2018). prior to 
				the current work, some clinical studies preliminarily confirmed 
				the clinical efficacy of curcumin in the treatment of arthritis 
				(atabaki et al., 2020; jamali et al., 2020). there are also 
				traditional head-to-head meta-analyses in the literature that 
				provide further evidentiary support for treating arthritis with 
				curcumin (feng et al., 2022; wang et al., 2021). in terms of 
				reducing rm use, curcumin, curcumin + nsaids and nsaids are 
				better than placebo, and curcumin + nsaids are better than 
				nsaids alone. these results indicate that the use of curcumin 
				may reduce the total amount of analgesic drugs used by knee 
				osteoarthritis patients. in terms of the incidence of adverse 
				reactions, both curcumin and curcumin + nsaids were lower than 
				nsaids alone. the results found that curcumin, curcumin + cp, 
				and curcumin + nsaids have good clinical value in treating knee 
				osteoarthritis. the results of sucra indicate that the two best 
				treatment measures for reducing vas pain scores are curcumin and 
				curcumin + cp. curcumin and nsaids are the preferred options for 
				reducing the total womac score. curcumin + nsaids is the best 
				medication for reducing the use of rm. curcumin + nsaids and 
				curcumin + cp are the best two drug regimens for reducing the 
				incidence of ae. the above results suggest that curcumin can not 
				only have better clinical efficacy in the treatment of knee 
				osteoarthritis but also reduce the incidence of ae by its 
				combination with nsaids, but this situation still needs more 
				clinical data for verification. the conclusion of this nma will 
				provide a new perspective for clinical decision-making on the 
				use of curcumin in the treatment of koa, and we believe that the 
				combination of curcumin with other drugs should be studied 
				further. experimental research (guan et al., 2022; hamdalla et 
				al., 2022; zhang and zeng, 2019) suggests that curcumin has a 
				good effect in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, which can 
				promote chondrocyte proliferation, inhibit chondrocyte 
				apoptosis, inhibit the destruction of inflammatory factors on 
				cartilage, and maintain the balance of the internal environment 
				of articular cartilage. shakibaei et al. found that curcumin can 
				inhibit the expression of mmp-3 and mmp-9 induced by il-1β/tnf-α 
				in human chondrocytes (shakibaei et al., 2007), which indicates 
				that curcumin can inhibit the decomposition of cartilage matrix 
				and play a role in treating koa. the experiment with human 
				chondrocytes as the research object shows that curcumin can 
				downregulate the expression of inflammatory factors in cells, 
				such as nitric oxide, prostaglandin 2, tnf-a, il-6, and il-8, 
				reduce cartilage inflammation, and then inhibit cartilage damage 
				(crivelli et al., 2019; kim and kim, 2019). in this context, 
				combined with our nma results, we believe that curcumin has 
				great clinical application value in the treatment of knee 
				osteoarthritis and may become a substitute for nsaids.  


therapeutic advantages of curcumin, a polyphenol, 
				against traumatic brain injury through interaction with 
				different inflammatory signaling pathways and their effects on 
				levels of cytokines and related biomarkers molecular 
				neurobiology | march 2024the recent findings on curcumin 
				demonstrate its remarkable versatility as a molecule that 
				interacts with a variety of molecular targets. various central 
				nervous system disease models have been shown to be susceptible 
				to curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties, including 
				intracerebral hemorrhage, global brain ischemia, and 
				neurodegeneration, all of which are associated with the 
				inflammation of the central nervous system. similarly, curcumin 
				exerts neuroprotective effects in mammals when it crosses the 
				bloodbrain barrier. curcumin has been shown to reduce cerebral 
				edema, enhance membrane and energy homeostasis, and influence 
				synaptic plasticity following traumatic brain injury in studies. 
				curcumin has been shown by numerous studies to be effective in 
				reducing inflammation. research has shown that curcumin 
				suppresses the activation of nf-κb by inhibiting the 
				phosphorylation and degradation of iκb; as a result, curcumin 
				reduces the inflammation caused by nf-κb. the effects of 
				curcumin have been shown to be not only reduced post-traumatic 
				brain injury neuroinflammation, but also decreased levels of 
				inflammatory mediators that are produced following a traumatic 
				brain injury. the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin were 
				demonstrated in an in vitro study using 100 mg/kg of curcumin. 
				according to the report, curcumin was able to reduce the amounts 
				of damage after traumatic brain injury induction and apoptosis, 
				particularly in the cortical cell model derived from embryonic 
				15-day pregnant mice, resulting in reduced damage. one study in 
				rats with traumatic brain injury administered 30 and 50 mg/kg of 
				curcumin daily for 35 days reduced levels of nlrp3, il-1β, il-6, 
				il-18, and tnf-α. there was a reduction in neuroinflammation and 
				subsequent complications of tbi when curcumin was administered. 
				furthermore, curcumin (at 500 mg/kg/day) decreased injury in the 
				ipsilateral cortex as a result of its ability to enhance 
				neutrophil infiltration (weight drop model-tbi). curcumin 
				reduced apoptosis in cells and increased antioxidant activity, 
				suggesting potential neuroprotective effects. the pain levels 
				decreased when curcumin (50 mg/kg) was administered to 
				surgically induced traumatic brain injury rats. curcumin has 
				been found to inhibit non-selective histone acetyltransferases, 
				suggesting potential benefits through histone acetylation. in a 
				rat model of tbi induced by fpi, curcumin (100 mg/kg) exerted 
				neuroprotective properties by activating the nrf2 pathway. bdnf, 
				synapsin i, and creb levels were reduced in animal models 
				following tbi after curcumin treatment (500 ppm). when given 
				oral doses of 100 mg/kg of curcumin per day, oxidative damage 
				was decreased, and omega-3 fatty acid dha levels and 4-hne (an 
				indicator of membrane lipid peroxidation) increased. curcumin 
				supplements may have neuroprotective effects after brain injury 
				and may increase the activity of docosahexaenoic acid and fatty 
				acid-transport protein. according to sharma et al.'s study 
				published in 2010, curcumin reduced ipla2, 4-hne, and stx-3, 
				which improved learning progress and relieved complications 
				associated with traumatic brain injury. several studies, such as 
				the one by zahedi et al., suggest promising effects of curcumin, 
				developing effective therapeutic strategies necessitates 
				rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials.


curcumin mitigates acrylamide-induced ovarian 
				antioxidant disruption and apoptosis in female balb/c mice: a 
				comprehensive study on gene and protein expressions
				food science & nutrition | march 2024curcumin is known for 
				its antioxidant properties.evidence has shown that curcumin 
				exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidants, anti-cancer activities 
				(khajeh pour et al., 2023; mailafiya et al., 2023). these 
				advantageous features are attributed to its elevated antioxidant 
				activity, stemming from the hydroxyl and methylene groups within 
				the β-diketone moiety present in its chemical structure (chen et 
				al., 2023; wang et al., 2017). there are several studies that 
				explored the positive effects of curcumin on the ovary tissue. 
				azami et al. (2020) showed that curcumin could prevent ovarian 
				aging by increasing ovarian volume and the number of follicles. 
				lv et al. (2021) also suggested that curcumin had beneficial 
				effects on the ovary and reproductive organs by regulating the 
				pten-akt-foxo3a pathway. furthermore, acr exposure led to a 
				significant increase in estradiol, luteinizing hormone, 
				testosterone, ovarian tumor markers such as ca125, and 
				carcinoembryonic antigen (cea), while serum progesterone, 
				follicle-stimulating hormone, and total antioxidant capacity 
				decreased in female rats. curcumin treatment restored 
				serological indices toward normal levels (elsawi et al., 2023). 
				in our study, acr exposure adversely affected ovarian 
				antioxidant defense thereby leading to increased pro-apoptotic 
				markers. notably, curcumin treatment effectively mitigated these 
				effects, restored antioxidant potential, and reduced 
				acrylamide-induced toxicity in female mouse ovaries. our 
				findings indicate that the administration of curcumin at doses 
				of 100 and 200 mg/kg efficiently restores the expression of 
				antioxidant genes, demonstrating a significant improvement at 
				the 200 mg/kg dose compared to the 100 mg/kg dose. several 
				studies have illustrated the efficacy of curcumin in mitigating 
				oxidative stress-related concerns, encompassing factors like 
				total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde (mda), and 
				superoxide dismutase (sod) within physiological conditions (chen 
				et al., 2022; khayatan et al., 2023). in a recent systematic 
				review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, 
				curcumin exhibited a substantial influence on indicators of 
				oxidative stress, including total antioxidant capacity, 
				malondialdehyde, and sod levels (dehzad et al., 2023). in 
				various animal models of ovarian diseases, curcumin has 
				demonstrated the ability to enhance overall ovarian function (eser 
				et al., 2015; wang et al., 2017). furthermore, the 
				administration of curcumin has been proven beneficial in 
				addressing gynecological diseases in women, as highlighted in 
				studies (kamal et al., 2021; shen et al., 2022). for instance, 
				curcumin supplementation has beneficial effects on weight loss, 
				glucose and lipid metabolism, metabolic parameters, and androgen 
				levels in polycystic ovary syndrome patients (ghanbarzadeh-ghashti 
				et al., 2023; sohaei et al., 2019). curcumin causes a reduction 
				in serum nitric oxide release in women with primary dysmenorrhea 
				and premenstrual syndrome pain (farrokhfall et al., 2023). it 
				also decreases the total score of primary symptoms of menopause 
				by affecting oxidative stress biomarkers (farshbaf-khalili et 
				al., 2022). importantly, curcumin treatment emerged as a 
				promising therapeutic intervention, effectively restoring 
				antioxidant potential and mitigating acrylamide-induced toxicity 
				in the ovaries of female mice. these results contribute to a 
				deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in 
				acr-induced reproductive toxicity and underscore the potential 
				of curcumin as a protective agent against such detrimental 
				effects.


curcumin abrogates cobalt-induced neuroinflammation 
				by suppressing proinflammatory cytokines release, inhibiting 
				microgliosis and modulation of erk/mapk signaling pathway.
				journal of chemical neuroanatomy | march 2024curcumin 
				treatment significantly reduced tissue levels of proinflammatory 
				cytokines tnf-α and il-1β. microglial activation and erk protein 
				upregulation induced by cobalt were attenuated by curcumin. 
				results showed that curcumin abrogated neuroinflammation by 
				suppressing the release of proinflammatory biomarkers, reducing 
				microgliosis, and modulating the erk mapk pathway. extensive 
				studies have suggested that curcumin possesses anti-inflammatory 
				(wang et al., 2017), neuroprotective (teter et al., 2019), 
				antioxidant (memarzia et al., 2021), anti-cancer (dou et al., 
				2017), hepatoprotective (macías-pérez et al., 2019). curcumin 
				significantly suppressed the release of neuroinflammation 
				markers and reduced microgliosis in the hippocampus of the rats. 
				in addition, the significant correlation between erk expression 
				and proinflammatory biomarkers and microgliosis has offered some 
				mechanistic insight into curcumin's neuroprotective properties.

				of curcumins structure, especially its conjugated enol-ketone 
				system, lies in its ability to engage in diverse molecular 
				interactions. in colorectal cancer, early studies indicated 
				potential benefits of curcumin in reducing polyp number and size 
				in familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) patients, suggesting its 
				role in managing precancerous lesions. for head and neck cancer, 
				particularly oral leukoplakia, curcumin showed a significant 
				clinical response compared to placebo. it is also noteworthy 
				that the combination of clinical and histological responses 
				indicated a more pronounced effect of curcumin, suggesting its 
				potential utility in the early-stage management of oral 
				leukoplakia. in the context of multiple myeloma, particularly in 
				patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance 
				(mgus) or smoldering multiple myeloma (smm), curcumin 
				demonstrated some promise. the promising results in certain 
				areas warrant continued research to optimize curcumins 
				formulation, delivery, and dosing to maximize its clinical 
				benefits.

				complementary therapies in medicine volume | march 2024
				curcumin supplementation was associated with significant changes 
				in fasting blood glucose and homeostatic model assessment for 
				insulin resistance in adults with nafld. curcumin 
				supplementation was associated with significant changes in 
				triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein in 
				adults with nafld. curcumin supplementation in doses of 
				50−3000 mg/day over 812 weeks was associated with significant 
				reductions in levels of fbg, homa-ir, tg, tc, ldl, weight and 
				bmi in patients with nafld. previous studies have reported 
				curcumin as a safe complementary therapy for several diseases. a 
				systematic review suggested that curcumin is effective in 
				lowering low density lipoprotein, cholesterol (ldl-c), tg, 
				fasting blood glucose (fbg), homeostatic model assessment for 
				insulin resistance (homa-ir), and weight in nafld patients, and 
				it is well tolerated. another study revealed that curcumin 
				supplementation has favorable effects on metabolic markers and 
				anthropometric parameters in patients with nafld.  also, 
				results of a randomized controlled trial suggest that curcumin 
				supplementation reduces serum lipids in patients with nafld.  
				a study showed curcumin supplementation has a favourable effect 
				on total cholesterol (tc), and bmi in participants with nafld. 
				therefore, promoting curcumin as adjuvant treatment on nafld 
				patients might be justified. in conclusion, our study indicated 
				that curcumin supplementation in doses of 50 − 3000 mg/day over 
				812 weeks was associated with significant changes in fbg,

curcumin suppresses metastasis of triple-negative 
				breast cancer cells by modulating emt signaling pathways: an 
				integrated study of bioinformatics analysis
				medicine | february 2024curcumin demonstrates potential 
				anticancer properties in the treatment of triple-negative breast 
				cancer cells. the findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of 
				curcumin on the motility of triple-negative breast cancer cells 
				could be attributed to the concurrent downregulation of specific 
				signaling pathways, through influencing the emt signaling 
				process. this study employs a comprehensive approach that 
				integrates bioinformatics analysis with in vitro experimental 
				methodologies, providing substantial evidence supporting 
				curcumins potential in breast cancer therapy. curcumin exhibits 
				its therapeutic potential in triple-negative breast cancer cells 
				by modulating multiple signaling pathways. these findings 
				provide experimental evidence for considering curcumin as a 
				potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of 
				triple-negative breast cancer cells. this study concentrates on 
				curcumin, a yellow phenolic pigment derived from turmeric, 
				renowned for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
				immunomodulatory properties. recent research has shown that 
				curcumin is crucial in treating several tumors by modulating 
				typical cell biological effects such as cell proliferation, 
				apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis. thus, curcumin may play a 
				significant role in the initiation and progression of various 
				cancers, including breast, lung, and liver cancers, through 
				affecting multiple signaling and molecular pathways, such as rb, 
				p53, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-k 
				(pi3k)/protein kinase b, and nf-kappab (nuclear factor kappa b 
				cells, nf-κb). previous studies have demonstrated curcumins 
				capacity to inhibit cell proliferation and invasion in human 
				triple-negative breast cancer cells. this study is significant 
				for its exploration of curcumins potential clinical 
				applications in treating triple-negative breast cancer cells. by 
				elucidating the antitumor mechanisms of curcumin in tnbc cells, 
				it establishes a crucial foundation for developing innovative 
				therapeutic strategies. curcumin significantly inhibited the 
				proliferation of hs578t and mda-mb-231 cells. flow cytometry 
				results showed that curcumin induced apoptosis in these cells 
				and arrested the cell cycle at the g2/m phase. additionally, 
				transwell assay results showed that curcumin effectively reduced 
				the motility of hs578t and mda-mb-231 cells. enrichment analysis 
				of rna sequencing data showed that the mechanism of action of 
				curcumin was significantly associated with signaling pathways 
				such as pathways in cancer, focal adhesion, and pi3k-akt 
				signaling pathways. finally, western blotting analysis showed 
				that curcumin significantly decreased the expression levels of 
				key proteins including fibronectin, mtor, β-catenin, p-akt, akt, 
				n-cadherin, p-s6, and s6.  curcumin, an efficacious 
				anticancer compound isolated from turmeric rhizomes, mediates 
				its therapeutic effects through the modulation of various 
				cellular pathways. these include the suppression of tumor 
				metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation, alongside the 
				modulation of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and resistance 
				to multiple drugs. the role of curcumin as a cancer 
				chemopreventive agent has been rigorously studied in various 
				cancer models. recent studies have highlighted curcumins 
				antiproliferative and antimotility effects on breast cancer 
				cells. in this study, our objective is to elucidate the 
				antitumor properties of curcumin, focusing on its potential 
				mechanisms of action and therapeutic efficacy. employing gene 
				enrichment analysis, incorporating both gene ontology and kyoto 
				encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways, on rna sequencing 
				data, we determined that curcumin predominantly acts through 
				pathways such as pathways in cancer, focal adhesion, pi3k-akt 
				signaling pathway, and cell cycle. he cck8 assay indicated that 
				curcumin markedly reduces the cellular activity of tnbc cells. 
				in parallel, western blot analysis revealed that curcumin lowers 
				the expression of key proteins, including n-cadherin, 
				fibronectin, β-catenin, p-akt, akt, mtor, p-s6, and s6, in 
				hs578t and mda-mb-231 cells. these proteins play crucial roles 
				in the emt process and its related signaling pathways, 
				particularly the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway. the results imply that 
				curcumins inhibitory effect on the motility of triple-negative 
				breast cancer cells may stem from the simultaneous 
				downregulation of these signaling pathways, impacting the emt 
				signaling cascade.  


curcumin enhances the anti-cancer efficacy of cdk4/6 
				inhibitors in prostate cancerarchivos 
				españoles de urología | february 2024this study aimed to 
				investigate the potential of combining cyclin-dependent kinase 4 
				and 6 (cdk4/6) inhibitors with curcumin, a natural compound 
				known for its anti-aging properties, to enhance the anti-cancer 
				efficacy in prostate cancer. curcumin is a natural compound 
				extracted from turmeric, which has been shown to have multiple 
				biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant 
				and anti-cancer effects. the synergistic effect observed in this 
				study suggested that curcumin may enhance the therapeutic 
				efficacy of cdk4/6 inhibitors in prostate cancer treatment, 
				further proving the previously reported findings. furthermore, 
				this study revealed that curcumin regulated cellular aging 
				induced by cdk4/6 inhibitors through the inhibition of the mtor 
				and stat3 pathways, which was also reported in previous studies. 
				similar conclusions were drawn in this study, which showed that 
				curcumin could modulate cellular senescence. interestingly, 
				curcumin contributed to the anti-cancer effects of cdk4/6 
				inhibitors in prostate cancer treatment. moreover, this study 
				revealed that curcumin could inhibit the stemness 
				characteristics of cancer cells induced by ly cm, as evidenced 
				by the downregulation of cancer stem cell markers aldh1a1, cd44 
				and nanog. the ability of curcumin to target cancer stem cells 
				provides further evidence of its potential as an effective 
				therapeutic agent in prostate cancer treatment. as previously 
				reported, the combination of curcumin and ly cm can inhibit the 
				dryness of cancer cells. overall, the findings of this study 
				support the notion that combining cdk4/6 inhibitors with 
				curcumin may have clinical implications for the treatment of 
				prostate cancer. the findings of this study provide valuable 
				insights into the potential of combining cdk4/6 inhibitors with 
				curcumin in the treatment of prostate cancer.

immunomodulatory effects of curcumin on macrophage 
				polarization in rheumatoid arthritis
				frontiers in pharmacology | february 2024as a natural 
				compound, curcumin is favorable for improving symptoms in 
				rheumatoid arthritis patients due to its potent efficacy, 
				affordability, and minimal side effects. in addition, curcumin 
				has been reported to ameliorate several diseases via epigenetic 
				regulation, encompassing: (1) suppression of dnmts; (2) 
				regulation of histone acetyltransferases and histone 
				deacetylases; and (3) regulation of mirnas (boyanapalli and 
				kong, 2015). several studies have shown that curcumin can be 
				used in cancer treatment to reverse dna methylation, alter 
				histone modifications and target mirna expression (shu et al., 
				2011; bao et al., 2012; yu et al., 2013). curcumin has been 
				extensively demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anticancer properties in both 
				experimental and clinical studies (xu et al., 2018). curcumin 
				has shown strong therapeutic potential, especially in autoimmune 
				diseases, such as ra and systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) 
				(yang et al., 2019; chamani et al., 2022; kou et al., 2023). a 
				large number of investigations have indicated that curcumin 
				modulates macrophage polarization and function to alleviate 
				inflammation and therefore can be used to treat 
				inflammation-related diseases (gao et al., 2015; karuppagounder 
				et al., 2016; abdollahi et al., 2023). curcumin regulates the 
				functions of various immune cells, including macrophages 
				(mohammadi et al., 2019), dendritic cells (dcs) (rahimi et al., 
				2021), b cells (mohammadi et al., 2022) and t cells (rahimi et 
				al., 2019), thereby modulating both innate and adaptive immunity 
				(shehzad and lee, 2013). the anti-inflammatory activity of 
				curcumin is due to its suppression of multiple signalling 
				molecules, including nf-κb, activated protein (ap)-1, mapks, and 
				protein kinase c (kahkhaie et al., 2019). in addition, curcumin 
				is a potent inhibitor of reactive-oxygen-generating enzymes, 
				such as lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase (cox), xanthine 
				dehydrogenase and inos (rao, 2007). as shown in macrophages, 
				curcumin inhibits lps and ifn-γ-induced nitric oxide production. 
				 


curcumin mediated dendritic cell maturation by 
				modulating cancer associated fibroblasts
				journal of cancer research and therapeutics | february 2024
				curcumin, traditionally known for its anti-inflammatory effects, 
				has been shown to be a potent immunomodulatory agent that can 
				modulate the activation of various immune cells by 
				downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, including il-1, il-2, 
				il-6, il-8, il-12. in our previous studies, we have reported on 
				curcumin's different potential to target cancerous cells in 
				acute myeloid leukemic (aml) patients as well as lung cancer 
				patients.  moreover, several reports have suggested that 
				curcumin-treated dcs produce significantly lower levels of il-6, 
				il-12, il-10, and tnfα, thus creating a th2 permissive 
				environment. in addition, there are several other reports 
				confirmed that curcumin inhibited il-1b, il-6 through modulation 
				of nf-kb and mapk pathways. moreover, curcumin-inhibited 
				il-6-induced stat3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in 
				multiple myeloma cells. recently, paul s and sa g revealed that 
				curcumin acting as an adjuvant in immunotherapies may present 
				with novel approaches for researchers and clinicians to obtain 
				improved treatment outcomes. collectively, our results concur 
				with previous findings reported by other researchers, signifying 
				curcumins potential to decrease the secretion of il-6, il-10, 
				and tgf-β in conditioned media, this being mediated via 
				curcumins efficacy to instruct cancer associated fibroblasts to 
				secrete exosomes resulting in the creation of an 
				immunomodulating tme from an immunosuppressive tme environment. 
				this study may provide basis to revise fundamental treatment 
				rationales and formulate synergistic therapeutic approaches by 
				using curcumin along with dc-based immunotherapies to overcome 
				cellular resistance in cancer treatment but it still requires 
				more in-depth research to have an in-sight into mechanism, which 
				might open up a newer avenues for curcumins use as an 
				appropriate immunotherapeutic modulator.

				become the focus of pharmacokinetic research. curcumin has a 
				good therapeutic effect, especially in the cardiovascular field. 
				previous reviews have summarized the protective effects of 
				curcumin on cvds. in 2020, li et al reviewed the preclinical 
				studies of curcumin in cvds such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart 
				failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, stroke, drug-induced 
				cardiotoxicity, and diabetic cardiovascular complications, and 
				reviewed the potential molecular targets of curcumin. 
				pourbagher-shahri et al also reviewed the effects of curcumin on 
				the cardiovascular system in 2021. the protective mechanism of 
				curcumin against cardiovascular diseases is complex and 
				networked. it is important to note that curcumin is a 
				complementary or alternative medicine, not a replacement for the 
				main treatment, and needs to be used under the guidance of a 
				doctor. to be sure, curcumin is an important drug that is worth 
				exploring.  


curcumin alleviates atrazine-induced cardiotoxicity 
				by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in 
				mice through atf6/chop/bcl-2 signaling pathway
				biomedicine & pharmacotherapy | february 2024curcumin 
				displays promise in alleviating heart injury by alleviating 
				cardiac apoptosis.  curcumin, acclaimed for its pronounced 
				anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, has garnered 
				interest as a potential therapeutic agent. collectively, our 
				findings illuminate curcumins cardioprotective effect against 
				atr-induced injury, primarily through its anti-ers and 
				anti-apoptotic activities, underscoring curcumins potential as 
				a therapeutic for atr-induced cardiotoxicity. curcumin has many 
				biological benefits, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammation and 
				immunoregulatory effect. research has shown that curcumin can 
				help reduce damage to various systems in the body, such as the 
				cardiovascular, digestive, and respiratory systems. in addition, 
				adding the curcumin to the diet can significantly reduce the 
				body weight and body fat rate of mice which fed with high-energy 
				diet, and alleviate inflammation and diabetes in mice. 
				meanwhile, curcumin significantly decreased the expression of 
				inflammatory factors induced by tumor necrosis factor-α in 
				adipocytes and the differentiation of preadipocytes. mortezaee 
				and his colleagues study shown that curcumin inhibits the 
				growth of tumor cells. curcumin has various pharmacological 
				effects, including reducing inflammatory reactions and oxidative 
				stress, enhancing immunity, and combating infections. recent 
				studies have shown that the cardioprotective benefits of 
				curcumin are facilitated through myriad mechanisms, among which 
				include the modification of gut microbiota makeup, inducement of 
				macrophage polarization, alleviation of oxidative stress, and 
				modulation of pivotal signaling pathways such as ampk and mtor. 
				in doing so, curcumin minimizes damage to the subcellular 
				structures within the myocardium. the present study revealed 
				that curcumin can alleviate the atr-induced damage in cardiac 
				cells. this mitigation manifests as reductions in inflammatory 
				cell infiltration and subcellular membrane damage (including 
				mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus) instigated by 
				atr. most notably, curcumin appears to have the capacity to 
				remediate myocardial damage.  


improving cognitive function with intermittent dose 
				escalation of curcumin extract in chemotherapy-induced cognitive 
				impairment patients: a randomized controlled trial
				advances in traditional medicine | february 2024the group of 
				subjects receiving curcumin extract experienced clinically and 
				statistically significant improvements in cognitive function. 
				administration of curcumin extract with intermittent dose 
				escalation regimen proved to be safe and able to improve 
				cognitive function of cognitive impairment patients clinically 
				and statistically significant. recently, there has been multiple 
				pharmacological studies done to investigate the antioxidant, 
				antiinflamation, anticarcinogenic, and anti-bacterial effects of 
				curcumin. curcumin is a safe natural product to be consumed by 
				humans (abd el-hack et al. 2021). curcumin is also known to 
				increase the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents via 
				increasing cancer cells sensitization against chemotherapy and 
				protecting normal cells from chemotherapy damage (tan and 
				norhaizan 2019). curcumin extract has several advantages, 
				including having a pleiotropic effect as anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant, and antiapoptotic (panahi et al. 2021; abd el-hack 
				et al. 2021). furthermore, curcumin extract also has 
				anti-carcinogenic effects. thus, the combination of various 
				mechanisms of action makes curcumin extract a comprehensive 
				therapeutic modality to prevent or treat cellular damage, 
				especially due to exposure to neurotoxic and oxidative stress 
				chemotherapeutic agents (liu et al. 2019; akbari et al. 2020). 
				in addition, curcumin extract also has a low toxicity index, so 
				it has a broad and safe therapeutic window profile. clinically, 
				curcumin extract has been widely tested and is known to have 
				neuroprotective effects. for example, curcumin extract can 
				inhibit cognitive function impairment caused by the oxidative 
				stress of cigarette smoke (muthuraman et al. 2019). in the 
				context of chemotherapy, curcumin has been shown to improve 
				neurogenesis and synaptogenesis that play a role in brain 
				plasticity, as well as increase hippocampal autophagy so that it 
				can suppress the process of apoptosis in the central nervous 
				system, after exposure to cisplatin-based chemotherapy (yi et 
				al. 2020). thus, administration of curcumin extract in carcinoma 
				patients undergoing chemotherapy regimens can help prevent, even 
				improve, the symptoms of cognitive impairment. based on the 
				results of the analysis of this study, valid evidence was found 
				that the administration of curcumin extract with the new regimen 
				was proven to be safe and effective in improving cognitive 
				function in patients with cognitive impairment due to 
				carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen.  
				administration of curcumin extract with a dose escalation system 
				was proven to improve cognitive function of patients with 
				clinical and statistical significance. administration of 
				curcumin extract with this dosage regimen has also been shown to 
				have a good safety profile.  


a review on medicinal benefits of curcumin on cancer
				international research journal of modernization in engineering 
				technology and science | february 2024curcumin, a natural 
				polyphenol found in the food spice turmeric, has been shown to 
				inhibit the survival and proliferation of cancer cells and 
				trigger apoptosis without promoting side effects. in this 
				context, the regulation of the cell cycle and its modulation by 
				curcumin has attracted great attention in recent years. curcumin 
				can inhibit cancer cells, cause apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, 
				inhibit the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, as well as 
				inhibit the immune system of cancer cells. various studies have 
				reported the antitumor activity of curcumin against breast 
				cancer, lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 
				prostate cancer, and brain tumors. curcumin and its derivatives 
				have attracted great attention in the last two decades due to 
				their biofunctional properties such as antibacterial, antifungal 
				and antiviral. curcumin exerts its anti-cancer effect through 
				various mechanisms. curcumin can inhibit the growth of many 
				cancer cells by reducing the regulation of anti-apoptotic cells, 
				activating caspases, and promoting tumor suppressors such as 
				p53. curcumin has properties that scavenge free radicals and 
				therefore may play an important role in inhibiting the growth of 
				cancer. many cellular and preclinical studies have shown that 
				curcumin can prevent dna damage caused by oxidative factors 
				(such as ionizing radiation) by inhibiting free radicals and 
				reactive oxygen species. curcumin prevents cancer formation by 
				inhibiting the formation of nf-kappab. curcumin prevents tumor 
				formation and growth by inhibiting and activating two enzymes 
				(phase 1 and phase 2).  the motivation to use curcumin 
				stems not only from its therapeutic potential, but also from the 
				fact that curcumin is more easily absorbed by patients without 
				the side effects of many other medicinal products such as 
				nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair lossand more serious long-term 
				conditions such as liver failure. various studies comparing 
				breast cancer incidence and cancer rates in india and the west 
				show that the risk of breast cancer is lower in india. curcumin 
				can interact with various biochemical pathways of cancer cells 
				and survive by directly or indirectly binding to different 
				targets. curcumin has been shown to interact with many targets, 
				including transcription factors, growth factors, dna, rna, and 
				many proteins involved in cell signaling pathways. the chemical 
				structure of curcumin has diverse properties that make it highly 
				effective and has many synergistic properties for various 
				molecular targets. curcumin, the active ingredient of turmeric 
				extract, has been used for many years as anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant, anti-cancer and more. although there is much to 
				learn about curcumin and its therapeutic properties, it has 
				great potential in the treatment and prevention of cancer. 
				curcumin, a natural product, is not only non-toxic but also has 
				many effects on various pathways involved in tumorigenesis.

the combination of vitamin d and curcumin piperine attenuates 
				disease activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels 
				insystemic lupus erythematosus patients
				current rheumatology reviews | february 2024
				curcumin-piperine might synergise with vitamin d to induce 
				clinical remission in patients with systemic lupus 
				erythematosus. curcumin supplementation in premenopausal women 
				and dysmenorrhea improves vitamin d levels. several studies have 
				reported the efficacy of vitamin d or curcumin for sle 
				treatment. curcumin is a phenolic compound widely found in 
				ginger, turmeric, and curcuma plants and has the potential as an 
				immunomodulator for the complementary treatment of sle. curcumin 
				acts as an activator or inhibitor of several transcription 
				factors that play a role in activating and differentiating th1, 
				th2, th17, and tregs. in a previous report, curcumin 
				synergistically interacts with vitamin d because it is also a 
				natural ligand for the vitamin d receptor (vdr). previous 
				studies reveal that administering a combination of curcumin and 
				vitamin d3 resulted in a better recovery of neuronal cells from 
				alzheimer's disease. another study demonstrates that curcumin 
				supplementation in premenopausal women and dysmenorrhea improves 
				vitamin d levels. although vitamin d or curcumin-piperine alone 
				could improve the clinical outcome and cytokines levels in sle, 
				curcumin-piperine combined with vitamin d had the best outcome 
				in improving the disease activity and cytokines levels among 
				patients.  


can curcumin supplementation break the vicious cycle 
				of inflammation, oxidative stress, and uremia in patients 
				undergoing peritoneal dialysis?clinical 
				nutrition espen | february 2024curcumin supplementation for 
				twelve weeks attenuates lipid peroxidation and might reduce 
				uremic toxin in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing 
				dialysis. supplementation with 2.5 g of curcumin, three days a 
				week for 12 weeks, reduced the mrna expression of nuclear factor 
				kappa b (nf-κb) and protein c- high-sensitivity reactive 
				(hs-crp) in patients undergoing hemodialysis. in this 
				single-blind, randomised, controlled trial, we showed that a 
				12-week curcumin supplementation reduced the levels of mda, a 
				standard marker of lipid peroxidation and showed a tendency to 
				reduce the pcs, a uremic toxin from gut microbiota, in patients 
				with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis.  a review 
				based on twelve clinical trials comprising 631 patients with 
				chronic kidney disease showed that curcumin supplementation has 
				a favourable impact on oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
				proteinuria. similarly, a recent study from our group showed 
				that curcumin supplementation for patients with chronic kidney 
				disease ckd undergoing hemodialysis significantly reduced nf-κb 
				mrna expression and plasma levels of hs-crp. curcumin has 
				phenolic groups in its chemical structure, which has essential 
				antioxidant activity as it is a hydrogen donor, stabilising free 
				radical molecules directly. indeed, curcumin has been tested 
				because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in 
				patients with chronic kidney disease ckd. our results showed 
				that curcumin supplementation may be a potential nutritional 
				strategy to help alleviate oxidative stress.

a review on the extraction process and therapeutic 
				activity of curcumin on diabetes mellitus and cancer
				international journal for multidisciplinary research | february 
				2024curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the active ingredient in 
				turmeric, has significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and 
				anti-cancer properties. research (in vitro and in vivo) showed 
				that curcumin can also inhibits the activity of some signaling

				as protein kinases) and can be modulated in this way 
				inflammatory process, gene expression and could possibly control 
				the effectiveness of curcumin for the treatment of many organ 
				diseases, mainly diabetes and its complications. turmeric or 
				curcuma longa is a natural product whose medicinal 
				properties have been widely studied and a wide range of 
				therapeutic effects in various diseases, including 
				neurodegenerative, liver, kidney damage, cancer and diabetes 
				have been linked mainly to its curcuminoid content. action of 
				curcumin or curcuminoids as a hypoglycemic agent or only as a 
				healing aid improve metabolic profile and improve 
				diabetes-related complications such as diabetes nephropathy and 
				cardiopathy are discussed. curcumin has also been shown to be a 
				mediator of chemoresistance and radioresistance. anticancer 
				effects have been observed in a number of clinical trials, 
				mainly a natural chemopreventive agent in colon and pancreatic 
				cancer, cervical neoplasia and barrett's metaplasia. the potent 
				antiproliferative effects of curcumin, which interact with 
				multiple intracellular signaling pathways, may enhance the 
				antitumor effects of gemcitabine. turmeric has also be widely 
				used as antioxidant, antiamyloid, antimicrobial, antitumor,

the use of curcumin in the treatment of colorectal, 
				breast, lung, and prostate cancers: an in vivo study update

jlar | january 2024studies have demonstrated 
				that curcumin can potentially treat various cancers. there is 
				evidence that curcumin has significant anti-cancer properties, 
				including tumor growth inhibition, metastasis inhibitory 
				activity, and angiogenesis. several studies have demonstrated 
				the versatility and potential of curcumin in treating cancer. 
				curcumin has considerable cancer treatment potential, based on 
				the in-vivostudies. curcumin and its derivatives have had 
				bifunctional properties in the past two decades, such as 
				antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. the anti-cancer 
				properties of curcumin have been demonstrated in vitro 
				and in vivo at all stages of cancer growth, including 
				the disease's promotion and initiation. curcumin treats a wide 
				range of diseases, including asthma, allergies, coughs, 
				bronchial hyperactivity, sinusitis, anorexia, coryza, and 
				hepatitis. many studies show its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
				anti-infectious, hepatoprotective, thrombosuppressive, 
				cardioprotective, chemopreventive, anti-arthritic, and 
				anticarcinogenic properties. curcumin has also modulated several 
				molecular targets in the body.  according to the combined 
				evidence presented in the included studies, curcumin is 
				potentially effective against various types of cancer, 
				highlighting its numerous anti-cancer properties. researchers 
				have found that curcumin inhibits tumor growth, induces 
				apoptosis, suppresses angiogenesis, and modulates several 
				cellular signaling pathways against cancer. considering its 
				broad spectrum of action, curcumin may be used as a 
				complementary treatment and an adjunct therapy for these common 
				types of cancer. as a result of this systematic review, curcumin 
				has the potential to be a promising anti-cancer agent against 
				colorectal, lung, prostate, and breast. it is clear that 
				curcumin has excellent potential as a cancer treatment agent, 
				and further study of its potential is warranted to achieve more 
				effective and holistic cancer treatments.


protective role of curcumin in disease progression 
				from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to hepatocellular 
				carcinoma: a meta-analysisfrontiers in 
				pharmacology | january 2024curcumin demonstrates a 
				significant improvement in key indicators across the stages of 
				nafld, liver fibrosis, and hcc. the research results reveal that 
				curcumin effectively hinders disease progression at each stage 
				by suppressing inflammation. curcumin exerted hepatoprotective 
				effects in the dose range from 100 to 400 mg/kg and treatment 
				duration from 4 to 10 weeks. with excellent anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties, curcumin is expected to 
				be an effective treatment for all stages of liver disease. based 
				on the results of the quantitative analysis evaluated in this 
				system, we can conclude that curcumin is applicable to a 
				spectrum of nafldlfhcc models and that most liver diseases 
				proceed based on the hepatic inflammatory microenvironment. more 
				attention should be paid to the anti-inflammatory effects of 
				curcumin.  curcumin has been shown to be effective in 
				inhibiting the progression of nafldlfhcc at doses of 100400 
				mg/kg over a 48 weeks duration with significant 
				hepatoprotective effects, and its therapeutic mechanisms are 
				related to multiple pathways, including anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant, and apoptotic regulations which are regulated in 
				all stages of liver disease.


the effect of curcumin on the gut-brain axis: 
				therapeutic implicationsjournal of 
				neurogastroenterology and motility | january 2024several 
				types of nutrients, such as curcumin, have been proposed as 
				regulators of the dysbiotic state, and preclinical experiments 
				have suggested that curcumin is not only beneficial but also 
				safe. curcumin possesses anti-inflammatory, 
				anti-atherosclerotic, neuroprotective and metabolic 
				disorder-modulatory effects. indeed, the gut microbiota directly 
				interacts with curcumin to produce small catabolites that can be 
				absorbed through the intestinal wall, as confirmed by the high 
				concentration of curcumin in the gut after oral administration. 
				in addition, curcumin influences the gut microbiota by promoting 
				the growth of beneficial bacterial strains, improving microbial 
				richness and diversity as well as enhancing intestinal barrier 
				function. curcumin also had beneficial effects on the gastric 
				tissue of diabetic gastroparesis model rats, exhibiting anti-gastroparetic 
				properties through improving ghrelin (a gut-brain peptide 
				hormone) expression, thereby balancing energy and promoting 
				gastrointestinal motility in the presence of oxidative stress. 
				likewise, curcumin demonstrated a modulatory role on gastric 
				emptying via enhancing stem cell factor/c-kit signaling (through 
				reduction of oxidative stress) and the nuclear factor kappa b 
				cascade in the stomach of a diabetic gastroparesis rat model.  
				in fact, curcumin may be one of the non-invasive alternatives to 
				the invasive oral endoscopic gastric myotomy procedure. curcumin 
				positively affects multiple pathways in parkinsons disease (pd) 
				treatment such as the inhibition of α-synuclein aggregation, an 
				increase in tyrosine hydroxylase, and reduction of n-acetylneuraminate 
				degradation, along with its influence on gut microbiota. some in 
				vivo studies have indicated that the protective effect of 
				curcumin on neurodegenerative diseases and pd occurs through the 
				regulation of the gut microbiota by curcumin. oral 
				administration of curcumin can alter the diversity of beneficial 
				or pathogenic bacteria accord- ing to the dose, duration of 
				treatment or formulation. in addition, curcumin and its 
				metabolites may have a direct impact on neurons, hormones, 
				blood, lymphatic vessels, and immune cells; thus, it is likely 
				that the direct and indirect effects of curcumin (gut-brain 
				axis) act together synergistically to modulate disease and 
				improve host health. based on the beneficial effects of curcumin 
				on health-promotion, disease management, and its wide 
				application as a spice in daily food, this review has sought to 
				understand the interplay between curcumin and the gut-brain axis 
				in multiple diseases, mainly based on available in vivo 
				experimental models. the findings presented here indicate that 
				curcumin has promising potential, with acceptable efficacy, as a 
				regulator of the gut-brain axis in several dis- eases associated 
				with gm dysbiosis. in addition, curcumin can not only act as a 
				treatment but is also able to interact with intestinal 
				microflora in dysbiosis to target microbiota activation or 
				suppression, thereby enhancing its therapeutic effect through 
				the production of more active metabolites and better 
				pharmacokinetics.  


curcumin 
				mitigates the high-fat high-sugar diet-induced impairment of 
				spatial memory, hepatic metabolism, and the alteration of the 
				gut microbiome in alzheimers disease-induced (3xtg-ad) mice
				
nutrients | january 2024curcumin 
				enriched beneficial gut microbiota. the observed alteration in 
				these gut microbiota profiles suggests a potential crosswalk in 
				the liver and brain for regulating metabolic and cognitive 
				functions, particularly in the context of obesity-associated 
				cognitive disfunction, notably alzheimers disease. curcumin, a 
				major bioactive chemical constituent derived from turmeric, has 
				been found to exhibit a range of neuroprotective effects, 
				including the reduction in the amyloid burden, 
				neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, infection, and 
				inflammation. previous findings also provided evidence of the 
				modulatory role of curcumin in mediating several targets of 
				metabolic diseases. reduced plasma glucose and triglyceride and 
				improved β cell function and afamin levels were also evident 
				after curcumin consumption in some clinical trials. our previous 
				studies have demonstrated the protective effects of curcumin on 
				metabolic dysfunctions such as body weight gain, liver fat 
				accumulation, and dysregulated insulin homeostasis in hfhsd-fed 
				middle-aged and old mice. curcumin supplementation demonstrated 
				a notable impact on body weight gain in the 3xtg-ad mice 
				subjected to hfhsd. this aligned with the previous findings from 
				our studies and others, revealing a consistent reduction in body 
				weight in the mice following curcumin supplementation, 
				particularly under various metabolic challenges. curcumin 
				supplementation effectively ameliorated these memory deficits, 
				as evidenced by an enhanced performance during the y-maze test, 
				consistent with our prior finding. in conclusion, our study 
				demonstrated the multifaceted effects of curcumin on the body 
				weight, metabolic pathways, memory function, and gut microbiota 
				in 3xtg-ad mice under hfhsd conditions. the selective reduction 
				in body weight gain, improvements in memory function, and the 
				modulation of the metabolic pathways suggest the potential 
				therapeutic value of curcumin in mitigating alzheimers-related 
				symptoms.  


curcumin inhibits bladder cancer by inhibiting 
				invasion via akt/mmp14 pathwaydiscovery 
				medicine | january 2024curcumin could inhibit bladder cancer 
				by inhibiting invasion through the akt/mmp14 pathway. the target 
				of curcumin for bladder cancer includes signal transducer and 
				activator of transcription 3 (stat3), akt, cyclin a2 (ccna2), 
				epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr), e1a binding protein 
				p300 (ep300) and mmp14. mmp14 was highly expressed in bladder 
				cancer than in normal tissues and was associated with a worse 
				prognosis (p < 0.05). curcumin could inhibit the proliferation 
				and migration of bladder cancer cells.


targeting endothelial cells with golden spice 
				curcumin: a promising therapy for cardiometabolic multimorbidity
				pharmacological research | january 2024curcumin, a widely 
				used dietary supplement derived from the golden spice 
				curcuma longa, has demonstrated remarkable potential in 
				treatment of cmm through its interaction with endothelial cells. 
				numerous studies have identified various molecular targets of 
				curcumin (such as nf-κb/pi3k/akt, mapk/nf-κb/il-1β, ho-1, nos, 
				vegf, icam-1 and ros). these findings highlight the efficacy of 
				curcumin as a therapeutic agent against cardiometabolic 
				multimorbidity through the regulation of endothelial function. 
				curcumin, derived from the golden spice carcuma longa and widely 
				used as a dietary supplement, possesses anti-inflammatory, 
				analgesic, anti-angiogenic and anti-oxidative properties. 
				several studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic effects 
				of curcumin against cardiometabolic multimorbidity were 
				attributed to its ability to target ecs. studies have shown that 
				in patients with obesity, curcumin (oral, 1 g/d for 4 weeks) 
				could effectively regulate inflammation and immunity by reducing 
				levels of hs-crp, il-1β, il-4, or vegf, and decreased levels of 
				mcp-1, il-6, and tnf-α in serum of metabolic syndrome (ms) 
				patients. curcumin, a natural compound derived primarily from, 
				the rhizomes of curcuma longa, possesses significant 
				pharmacological properties. extensive studies have confirmed its 
				high oral safety. additionally, our review has highlighted the 
				tremendous potential of curcumin in the treatments a majority of 
				cardiometabolic multimorbidities by the alleviation of 
				endothelial damages. furthermore, research studies have 
				demonstrated the potential of curcumin in alleviating 
				endothelial inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular 
				inflammation caused by diverse pathological conditions, such as 
				hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, 
				cerebral ischemia, and myocardial infarction. in animal models 
				of obesity, ms, diabetes, and related complications, curcumin 
				was administered at a higher dose and for a longer duration of 
				300400 mg/kg/day for 812 weeks. this dosage exceeds the amount 
				used to treat hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cerebral 
				ischemia, which falls within a dosing range of 100200 mg/kg/day 
				for 46 weeks.  


examination 
				of the effect of curcumin supplementation on liver enzymes and 
				some physiological parameters in volleyball players  
revista de gestão e secretariado | january 2024
				it has been observed that curcumin supplementation applied in 
				addition to volleyball training affects the lipid metabolism and 
				physiological parameters of the athletes. in line with this 
				information, we believe that the supplements to be applied in 
				addition to their routine training will positively affect the 
				athletic performance of the athletes. curcumin has been 
				investigated for its anti-obesity, anti-inflammation, 
				anti-cancer, anti-angiogenesis, anti-diabetes, hepatoprotection, 
				radioprotection, and chemopreventive action. curcumin is also 
				said to affect obesity and lipid metabolism via a number of 
				pathways, including energy metabolism regulation, inflammation 
				suppression, and angiogenesis. turmeric has lately gained 
				widespread interest from researchers who have done studies 
				demonstrating that its therapeutic characteristics are linked to 
				pain relief, as well as the prevention and treatment of 
				cardiovascular, cancer, and other chronic diseases. curcumin 
				administration has also been shown to improve physical activity 
				and sports performance in animal studies. curcumin 
				supplementation is said to aid in muscle repair and  
				inflammation reduction, improve mitochondrial biogenesis, reduce 
				oxidative stress, and prevent fatigue and muscle damage. during 
				aerobic exercise (1 hour treadmill jog), there was a substantial 
				reduction in physical exercise-derived inflammation compared to 
				the pre-exercise moment in studies when turmeric supplementation 
				was used. despite some inconsistent results, curcumin 
				administration appears to be useful for pain relief as well as 
				muscle damage mitigation by lowering serum ck. nicol et al. 
				(2015) found that those treated with curcumin (5 g/day -5 days) 
				had less muscular pain and lower ck serum values (22-9%; ± 
				21-22%) at 24-and 48 hours. curcumin supplementation for 8 weeks 
				resulted in substantial improvements in crp, ldh, mda, and vo2 
				max values in healthy young adult women in trials. it has been 
				observed that curcumin supplementation applied in addition to 
				volleyball training affects the lipid metabolism and 
				physiological parameters of the athletes. in line with this 
				information, the diversity of nutrients or compounds derived 
				from food factors or medicinal plants can be explored to 
				understand their possible effects on exercise physiology and the 
				different bioactivities that can be used for health promotion.


profiling inflammatory biomarkers following curcumin 
				supplementation: an umbrella meta-analysis of randomized 
				clinical trialsevidence-based 
				complementary and alternative medicine | january 2024the 
				umbrella of meta-analysis suggests curcumin as a promising agent 
				in reducing inflammation as an adjunctive therapeutic approach 
				in diseases whose pathogenesis is related to a higher level of 
				inflammatory biomarkers. curcumin is remarkable bioactive 
				polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of turmeric (curcuma 
				longa). curcumin has a wide range of medicinal effects such 
				as hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant, and antitumor activities. the anti-inflammatory 
				feature of curcumin is mediated by several pathways. intestinal 
				alkaline phosphatase, an endogenous antioxidant and 
				anti-inflammatory enzyme, is upregulated by curcumin. moreover, 
				curcumin modulates inflammatory markers through nuclear 
				factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (nrf2∗)-keap1 
				regulatory pathway. given these effects, curcumin can have 
				regulatory effects on the level of inflammatory biomarkers such 
				as crp, il-6, and tnf-α. according to the us food and drug 
				administration (fda) report, curcumin has been considered as 
				generally recognized as safe (gras) even at doses between 4000 
				and 8000 mg/day. the beneficial effect of curcumin on various 
				health conditions in some studies shows that the 
				anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin is not dependent on the 
				disease. curcumin has a polyphenol nature; therefore, its 
				anti-inflammatory mechanisms may be due to its antioxidant 
				properties. many properties of curcumin such as antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antimutagenic attribute to 
				the presence of hydroxyl and methoxy groups in the curcumin 
				structure. the present study shows that curcumin has reducing 
				effects on il-6, crp, and tnf-α levels. therefore, curcumin can 
				be considered as a useful agent for longevity through decreasing 
				oxidative stress.  


anti-inflammatory 
				mechanisms of curcumin and its metabolites in white adipose 
				tissue and cultured adipocytes  
nutrients | 
				january 2024overall, our in vivo and in vitro studies 
				demonstrate that curcumin alleviated diet-induced 
				obesity-associated inflammation. the plant-derived polyphenol 
				curcumin alleviates the inflammatory and metabolic effects of 
				obesity, in part, by reducing adipose tissue inflammation. both 
				curcumin and its metabolites reduced lps-induced adipocyte il-6 
				secretion and mrna levels. proteomic analyses indicated that 
				curcumin upregulated eif2 and mtor signaling pathways. overall, 
				curcumin exerted anti-inflammatory effects in adipocytes. 
				previously, we reported that curcumin exerted protective 
				metabolic effects in diet-induced obese mice, independent of 
				changes in body weight. curcumins effects may have been 
				mediated through its metabolic products, which are produced in 
				the gut, liver, or other tissues.  


the 
				effects of curcumin on neurodegenerative diseases: a systematic 
				reviewjournal of herbal medicine | january 
				2024curcumin has been considered in the therapeutic approach 
				to neurodegenerative diseases due to its relevant antioxidant 
				and anti-inflammatory properties. adding curcumin to traditional 
				drug therapy appears promising and safe for treating 
				neurodegenerative diseases. curcumin could be an option due to 
				its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory 
				properties (colaço et al., 2023, grant et al., 2023, marton et 
				al., 2022). the consumption of this plant or its derivatives, 
				such as curcumin, can improve the function and structure of 
				synapses by regulating proteins and delaying neuronal 
				dysfunction processes.  


antioxidant curcumin induces oxidative stress to 
				kill tumor cells (review)oncology letters 
				| january 2024curcumin is a plant polyphenol in turmeric 
				root and a potent antioxidant. curcumin is a plant polyphenol in 
				the rhizome of turmeric and was classified as a third-generation 
				cancer chemopreventive agent by the national cancer institute. 
				several studies have reported anticancer mechanisms mediated by 
				curcumin through the induction of elevated ros. curcumin has 
				anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hepatoprotective and 
				anticancer properties, and its anticancer effects have been 
				reported in several tumor types. in melanoma, curcumin has been 
				reported to increase the ros level and activate oxidative stress 
				in the cysteine asparaginase pathway, which causes tumor cell 
				death. furthermore, curcumin-induced accumulation of ros in 
				tumors to kill tumor cells has been noted in several studies, as 
				discussed in the present review. curcumin is well tolerated by 
				humans. for example, a study that evaluated the toxicity of 
				curcumin in humans reported that subjects administered 8 mg/day 
				curcumin did not develop toxicity. curcumin is a natural 
				compound that has been used for the treatment of numerous types 
				of diseases, such as alzheimer's disease, fatty liver and 
				cancer. of note, curcumin has a dual role in oncological and 
				non-oncologic diseases. specifically, in non-neoplastic 
				diseases, curcumin is a potent antioxidant that attenuates 
				oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. conversely, in 
				tumors, curcumin binds to several enzymes and increases ros 
				levels. these different effects may be the result of differences 
				in dosage. for instance, in a previous study on curcumin 
				treatment of drug-resistant tumor cells, a low dose of curcumin 
				showed no effect on antioxidant proteins, whereas a high dose 
				resulted in the inhibition of antioxidant proteins, thereby 
				increasing ros levels. furthermore, mitochondria may be a 
				potential target for high-dose curcumin. in addition, compared 
				with normal cells, proteins abnormally expressed in tumor cells, 
				such as gsh and ho-1, may be targeted by curcumin to cause 
				oxidative stress in tumor cells.  in terms of autophagy, 
				curcumin has been reported to induce elevated ros levels and the 
				appearance of autophagy markers and autophagosomes, causing 
				tumor cells to undergo autophagy. curcumin achieves anticancer 
				effects by regulating the expression of nrf2 and its downstream 
				target ho-1, inhibiting the expression of gpx4 and altering the 
				accumulation of intracellular iron and inducing the fenton 
				reaction. over the past two decades, the mechanisms by which 
				curcumin inhibits several types of tumor have been gradually 
				elucidated.  in conclusion, curcumin may have the potential 
				to become a cutting-edge drug for the treatment of tumors and 
				other diseases.  


antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and epigenetic 
				potential of curcumin in alzheimer's disease
				biofactors | january 2024curcumin - an integral component of 
				traditional medicine in numerous cultures worldwide - has 
				garnered interest as a promising alzheimer's disease treatment. 
				current research indicates that curcumin may exhibit therapeutic 
				potential in neurodegenerative pathologies, attributed to its 
				potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 
				additionally, curcumin and its derivatives have demonstrated an 
				ability to modulate cellular pathways via epigenetic mechanisms. 
				this article aims to raise awareness of the neuroprotective 
				properties of curcuminoids that could provide therapeutic 
				benefits in alzheimer's disease. the paper provides a 
				comprehensive overview of the neuroprotective efficacy of 
				curcumin against signaling pathways that could be involved in 
				alzheimer's disease and summarizes recent evidence of the 
				biological efficiency of curcumin in vivo. curcumin is a 
				naturally occurring polyphenol found in turmeric, which has long 
				been utilized in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory 
				and antioxidant properties. curcumin's anti-inflammatory 
				properties stem from its capability to inhibit multiple 
				proinflammatory signaling pathways mediated by nuclear factor 
				kappa b (nf-kb) and immune cell activation. through this 
				modulation of inflammatory mediators, encompassing cytokines, 
				adhesion molecules, growth factors, and enzymes, curcumin holds 
				the potential for therapeutic benefits. numerous studies have 
				investigated the therapeutic potential of curcumin against 
				various neurodegenerative diseases, including alzheimer's 
				disease. some evidence suggests that curcumin may be able to 
				counteract the formation of amyloid plaques. additionally, 
				curcumin has been found to modulate alzheimer's 
				disease-associated epigenetic changes by influencing methylation 
				patterns, micrornas, and histone-modifying enzymes. multiple 
				human studies suggest a potential of curcumin to modulate 
				alzheimer's disease pathways in-vivo. zhang et al.'s 2006 
				findings demonstrated in-vivo effectiveness of curcumin in 
				clearing amyloid deposits. it was observed that treatment of 
				macrophages of alzheimer's disease patients with curcuminoids 
				notably enhanced the uptake of aβ. research by disilvestro et 
				al. extended these findings, investigating the effect of 
				curcumin on inflammatory pathways and aβ clearance in healthy 
				middle-aged individuals. daily administration of a low dose of 
				curcumin has exhibited potential in reducing plasma levels of aβ 
				protein and augmenting antioxidant capacity by elevating the 
				levels of radical scavenging enzymes catalase and 
				myeloperoxidase. in a different study, a solid lipid formulation 
				of curcumin was observed to enhance cognitive performance, 
				alleviate fatigue, and mitigate the detrimental effects of 
				psychological stress. further exploration into the therapeutic 
				potential of curcumin in alzheimer's disease was initiated by 
				baum et al.'s double-blind study in 2008. their 6-month clinical 
				study confirmed the previously described advantageous effects of 
				curcumin in alzheimer's disease, as such showing its potential 
				to promote disaggregation of aβ and anti-inflammatory and 
				antioxidant responses. in 2020, thota et al. demonstrated that 
				daily oral curcumin supplementation for 12 weeks could decrease 
				circulating levels of islet amyloid peptide (iapp) and glycogen 
				synthase kinase-3 (gsk-3β), both implicated in insulin 
				resistance. curcumin and its metabolites have been shown to play 
				a neuroprotective role, with the capacity to alter the 
				pathological sequelae that may lead to alzheimer's disease. 
				curcumin's demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory role, 
				along with its high safety profile, poses an intriguing 
				possibility in preventing and treating alzheimer's disease. 
				 


curcumin 
				in alzheimers disease and depression: therapeutic potential and 
				mechanisms of actionbrazilian archives of 
				biology and technology | january 2024curcumin is a 
				polyphenol present in curcuma longa, a root used in asian 
				cuisine for thousands of years, and it has several medicinal 
				properties, acting as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
				anticancer, among others. the data analyzed demonstrated that 
				curcumin supplementation is able to restore bdnf (brain derived 
				neurotrophic factor) levels in alzheimer's disease and 
				depression, in addition to modulating monoamines and reducing 
				oxidative stress, inflammation, beta-amyloid aggregation, tau 
				protein accumulation and aluminum neurotoxicity, improving their 
				symptoms. curcumin has several medicinal properties as 
				antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-hiv, antibacterial and 
				antitumor effect. in addition, curcumin is also used as a 
				therapeutic agent in inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, 
				arthritis, some types of cancer [24], head trauma, anxiety, 
				parkinsons, depression, alzheimer's disease, as well as acting 
				as bdnf restorer. most of curcumin benefits can be attributed to 
				its anti-inflammatory action, obtained by the modulation of the 
				expression and production of enzymes such as cyclooxygenase-2 
				(cox-2), lipoxygenase and inducible nitric oxide synthase 
				(inos), and by the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines, 
				including interleukin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α), 
				monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp), among others. in 
				neurodegenerative and neuropsychological diseases, curcumin's  
				role in restoring bdnf levels and, consequently, promoting 
				neurogenesis, is extremely important and may contribute to the 
				reversal of cognitive and mood disorders. after chronic curcumin 
				supplementation, subjects had a significant reduction in 
				depressive symptoms, with a reduction in the hamilton depression 
				scale and the montgomery-asberg scale. curcumin supplementation 
				was also able to elevate plasma bdnf levels and reduce 
				inflammatory cytokines tnf-α and il-1β, and salivary cortisol 
				concentrations, when compared to the placebo group. these 
				results suggest that supplementation with curcumin is able to 
				improve the action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
				class of antidepressants, such as escitalopram, mainly by 
				increasing bdnf levels, inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and 
				reducing cortisol secretion. therefore, there is strong evidence 
				of curcumin potential as a therapeutic agent in the 
				neuropsychological and neurodegenerative context, especially 
				when used in more bioavailable and high-quality formulations. in 
				summary, the data presented suggests that curcumin is able to 
				prevent and improve the symptoms of alzheimers disease through 
				the improvement of cognitive and memory deficit by restoring 
				bdnf levels, reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, 
				beta-amyloid aggregation, tau protein accumulation and aluminum 
				neurotoxicity. in depression, curcumin treatment was also able 
				to improve its symptoms by restoring bdnf levels, modulating 
				monoamines and reducing inflammation. this study helps to 
				clarify the various mechanisms of action of curcumin in the 
				neurodegenerative / neuropsychological diseases, alzheimers 
				disease and depression, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic 
				agent without any significant side effects.  


targeted therapies of curcumin focus on its 
				therapeutic benefits in cancers and human health: molecular 
				signaling pathway-based approaches and future perspectives
				biomedicine & pharmacotherapy | january 2024curcumin 
				modulates several biochemical pathways and targets involved in 
				cancer growth. owing to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
				mutagenic, and antibacterial properties, curcumin has been 
				utilized as medication in asian countries owing to their 
				antioxidant and anticancer activities.  additionally, it 
				has been shown to be advantageous for kidneys. curcumin has 
				several medical uses, most of which are attributed to its 
				inflammatory and antioxidant properties. curcumin has 
				anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective 
				properties, potentially managing diabetes, easing arthritis, and 
				potentially reducing inflammation in bowel diseases. curcumin 
				can cure metabolic syndrome, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, and 
				oxidative and inflammatory diseases. furthermore, a low dose can 
				still be beneficial for one's health, even if they have not been 
				diagnosed with a health condition. it has great potential as a 
				cancer treatment.  


curcumin 
				and breast cancer: therapeutic potential and mechanism in

				studied in composition with chemotherapy drugs including 
				cisplatin,paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil in bc 
				celllines such as mcf-7, mcf-7adr, mda-mb-231. studies reported 
				that curcumin increases the sensitivity in the resistant cells 
				to chemotherapy drugs, which has apoptotic and growth inhibitory 
				effects. also, curcumin could decrease multi-drug resistance 
				breast cancer through induction ofautophagy by down-regulate the 
				expression of ccat1, pi3k/akt/mtor pathway.  according to 
				the results of preclinical studies, curcumin administration can

curcumin 
				for treating breast cancer: a review
				pharmaceutics | january 2024curcumin, a phytochemical 
				derived from curcuma longa (turmeric), has shown 
				substantial potential in inhibiting bc cell migration, 
				metastasis, and proliferation. curcumin constitutes the primary 
				bioactive compound found in the plant curcuma longa, 
				commonly known as turmeric. curcumin, a natural compound found 
				in the turmeric plant curcuma longa, is generally 
				considered safe when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods 
				and traditional herbal remedies. in 2021, the european food 
				safety authority (efsa) established an acceptable daily intake 
				of curcumin at 3 mg/kg body weight. for optimal pharmacological 
				effects, an oral dose of more than 8.0 g/day is often required. 
				numerous clinical studies demonstrated that a daily intake of 12 
				g of curcumin is well tolerated and safe. curcumin 
				unquestionably exhibits potential as an anticancer agent, with 
				relevance not only to breast cancer but also to lung cancer, 
				gastric cancer, and other malignancies.


protective 
				role of curcumin in disease progression from non-alcoholic fatty 
				liver disease to hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis
				frontiers in pharmacology | january 2024curcumin 
				demonstrates a significant improvement in key indicators across 
				the stages of nafld (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), liver 
				fibrosis, and hcc (hepatocellular carcinoma). the research 
				results reveal that curcumin effectively hinders disease 
				progression at each stage by suppressing inflammation. with 
				excellent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer 
				properties, curcumin is expected to be an effective treatment 
				for all stages of liver disease. this is the first meta-analysis 
				to correlate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, liver fibrosis, 
				and hepatocellular carcinoma and evaluate the therapeutic 
				effects of curcumin on systemic liver disease. the mechanisms of 
				curcumin in the inhibition of the transition from non-alcoholic 
				fatty liver diseaseto hcc are multiple, well-established, and 
				multi-targeted. the phenotypes involved are mainly related to 
				oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. based on the 
				results of the quantitative analysis evaluated in this system, 
				we can conclude that curcumin is applicable to a spectrum of 
				non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaselfhcc models and that most 
				liver diseases proceed based on the hepatic inflammatory 
				microenvironment. in the development of a range of liver 
				diseases, one of the most remarkable molecular changes driving 
				the non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaselfhcc axis is the nf-κb 
				signaling pathway, so anti-inflammatory processes play a crucial 
				role in all three disease stages. more attention should be paid 
				to the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin. curcumin 
				exerted hepatoprotective effects in the dose range from 100 to 
				400 mg/kg and treatment duration from 4 to 10 weeks. the 
				mechanistic analysis reveals that curcumin primarily exerts its 
				hepatoprotective effects by modulating multiple signaling 
				pathways, including tlr4/nf-κb, keap1/nrf2, bax/bcl-2/caspase 3, 
				and tgf-β/smad3. in summary, curcumin has shown promising 
				therapeutic effects during the overall progression of 
				non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-lf-hcc. it inhibited the pathological progression by 
				synergistic mechanisms related to multiple pathways including 
				anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and apoptosis regulation.


therapeutic effects of curcumin on 
				constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome is associated 
				with modulating gut microbiota and neurotransmitter

frontiers in microbiology | january 2024in a 
				30-day randomized trial, in subjects with irritable bowel 
				syndrome, abdominal bloating can be successfully reduced with a 
				supplementation with curcumin (giacosa et al., 2022). previous 
				studies have shown that cur has a significant effect on reducing 
				the levels of 5-ht in serum and colon (yu et al., 2019). 
				curcumin  is the major active constituent of curcuma 
				longa. modern studies have demonstrated its potent 
				anti-inflammatory (kocaadam and şanlier, 2017), antioxidant (ahangarpour 
				et al., 2019), and antidepressant (chang et al., 2016) effects. 
				it has been found that treatment with curcumin can modulate 5-ht 
				levels, with treatment with curcumin significantly increasing 
				5-ht levels in the hippocampus, while decreasing 5-ht levels in 
				the colon in ibs models (yu et al., 2015). curcumin can interact 
				directly with the gut microbiota. curcumin has been shown to 
				positively affect the gut microbiota and modulate microbiota 
				composition and function, further improving gut health (ng et 
				al., 2018). these studies support the potential therapeutic 
				effect of curcumin on ibs-c through modulation of the gut 
				microbiota and neurotransmitters. the results of this study show 
				that curcumin is able to decrease the levels of ht, vip and sp 
				and regulate the gut microbiota in rats with irritable bowel 
				syndrome-c, and then exert the therapeutic effect on irritable 
				bowel syndrome-c. the results suggest that curcumin may 
				represent a treatment option for irritable bowel syndrome-c 
				through modulation of the gut microbiota and relevant 
				neurotransmitters. our results support the possibility of using 
				curcumin to treat irritable bowel syndrome-c patients.

				to alleviate inflammation and mitigate the progression of 
				osteoarthritisplos one | january 2024
				this study, for the first time, provides evidence of the 
				mitigating effect of vitamin d and curcumin on par-2 mediated 
				inflammation. nutraceuticals, such as vitamin d and curcumin, 
				present potential therapeutic alternatives, offering

therapeutic 
				potential of curcumin, a bioactive compound of turmeric, in 
				prevention of diabetes through the modulation of oxidative 
				stress and inflammationmolecules | january 
				2024in physiological and biochemical studies, it was found 
				that curcumin decreases glucose, creatinine, urea, and 
				inflammatory markers and increases antioxidant enzyme levels. in 
				addition, the histopathological findings revealed that curcumin 
				plays a significant role in the maintenance of renal tissue 
				architecture through the reduction in all pathological changes. 
				this study showed that curcumin has a vital role in the 
				regulation of the expression pattern of the il-6 protein and 
				fibrosis. based on biochemical and histopathological findings, 
				this study delivers a scientific suggestion that curcumin could 
				be a suitable remedy in the management of diabetes mellitus. the 
				novelty of the current study is that curcumin showed 
				anti-fibrotic potential by reducing collagen fiber deposition. 
				curcumin treatment showed a significant decrease in parameters 
				and an increase in insulin level as compared to negative control 
				rats. oral administration of curcumin significantly ameliorated 
				changes. hence, based on biochemical and histopathological 
				findings, this study delivers a scientific suggestion that 
				curcumin could be a suitable remedy in the management of 
				diabetes mellitus. curcumin, a yellow-colored compound, is 
				produced by plants of curcuma longa species, and it is 
				chemically known as 1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1, 
				6-heptadiene-3, 5-dione. it possesses antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and other biological activities. 
				curcumin is capable of exercising its antioxidant action via 
				scavenging a variety of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide (no) 
				radicals and reactive oxygen species (ros) as superoxide 
				radicals and by preventing lipid peroxidation. moreover, several 
				in vitro as well as in vivo studies have described that curcumin 
				has potential for treating numerous inflammatory diseases. 
				curcumin significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen, serum levels 
				of urea, and creatinine and simultaneously reduced 
				albumin/protein urea and increased creatinine clearance. 
				further, it also prevented damage to renal tubules and the 
				thickness of the basement membrane. curcumin treatment 
				efficiently counters diabetes-induced oxidative-stress-mediated 
				hepatic damage. another finding reported that curcumin improved 
				the survival as well as the function of islet cells, with 
				reduced cell apoptosis in the islet of langerhans and increased 
				insulin secretion in the stz-induced diabetic model.  


exploring the potential of curcumin in preserving 
				telomere length: a new frontier in cellular aging and health
				medium | january 2024curcumin has been valued for centuries 
				for its medicinal properties, particularly its potent 
				antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. recent studies have 
				explored the potential of curcumin in influencing the length and 
				maintenance of telomeres, providing insights into its possible 
				role in combating cellular aging. curcumin's role in preserving 
				telomere length largely hinges on its antioxidant properties. 
				oxidative stress, a result of an imbalance between free radicals 
				and antioxidants in the body, is a key factor in the 
				acceleration of telomere shortening. curcumin, with its strong 
				antioxidant capacity, helps neutralize these free radicals, 
				potentially reducing the rate of telomere shortening and thereby 
				promoting cellular longevity. in addition, the anti-inflammatory 
				properties of curcumin might help mitigate damage, thereby 
				slowing down the rate of telomere attrition. this could be 
				particularly significant in the context of chronic diseases and 
				age-related conditions where inflammation plays a pivotal role. 
				one of the most intriguing aspects of curcumin's relationship 
				with telomeres is its potential effect on the activity of 
				telomerase. some studies have shown that curcumin might 
				stimulate telomerase activity, thus aiding in the maintenance 
				and even extension of telomere length. this suggests a possible 
				direct intervention in the cellular aging process. the 
				implications of curcumin's effects on telomeres extend to the 
				prevention and management of various diseases. age-related 
				diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and 
				cardiovascular problems have been linked to telomere length. 
				therefore, by preserving telomere length, curcumin could 
				potentially play a role in mitigating these conditions. its 
				antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, combined with its 
				potential to impact telomerase activity, make it a compound of 
				significant interest in the fields of aging and disease 
				prevention. in the realm of medicine, the exploration of 
				curcumin's role in telomere biology could lead to novel 
				therapeutic strategies. for instance, it could be employed as 
				part of a regimen for diseases where telomere shortening plays a 
				key role.  


the 
				effect of curcumin on the necroptosis signaling pathway in colon 
				cancer cells  
bulletin of biotechnology | 
				january 2024curcumin, a yellow compound isolated from the 
				turmeric plant, is important in preventing cancer. studies have 
				shown that curcumin has an anticancer effect by driving cancer 
				cells into apoptosis, but studies showing its effect on 
				necroptosis are inconclusive. consequently, the current data 
				clearly suggest that curcumin is a prominent driver of 
				necroptotic signaling-mediated colon cancer cell death. 
				accumulating mass of indication suggests that curcumin has 
				antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-diabetic, 
				and anti-cancer activities (selvam et al. 2019). curcumin has 
				shown to have significant impact on many signaling pathways in 
				cancer cells, which controls various cellular activities. the 
				anticancer activities of curcumin have also been shown in colon 
				cancer cells (selvam et al. 2019). curcumin has been 
				demonstrated to show anti-cancer activity in ht-19 colon cancer 
				cells by suppressing colony formation, cell viability, and dlec1 
				promoter methylation (guo et al. 2015). in addition, curcumin 
				has been shown to suppress the level of atg5 (autophagy related 
				5) protein in hct-116 cells, leading to the suppression of 
				autophagosome formation, cellular senescence, and cell cycle 
				arrest (mosieniak et al. bull biotechnol (2023). in addition, 
				studies have shown that curcumin has anticancer activity in 
				other colon cancer cells such as caco-2, hct-15, and sw620 (selvam 
				et al. 2019). curcumin, which is extracted from the plant 
				curcuma longa, is known to have numerous biological and 
				pharmacological activities. curcumin has been reported to 
				stimulate cell death pathways such as apoptosis, autophagy, and 
				pyroptosis in many different cancer cells. in a study by 
				blakemore et al., curcumin was shown to disrupt the cell cycle 
				progression by inducing g2/m cell cycle arrest in various colon 
				cancer cells (blakemore et al. 2013). in addition, curcumin 
				treatment has been shown to cause abnormal mitotic spindle 
				formation and dna damage. in addition, curcumin has been shown 
				to dose- dependently suppress cell proliferation. bull 
				biotechnol (2023). remarkably, in our study, curcumin was shown 
				to stimulate necroptosis by increasing the expression of ripk1, 
				ripk3, and mlkl genes, especially in ht -29 colon cancer cells. 
				in conclusion, present findings strongly indicates that curcumin 
				is a significant driver of colon cancer cell death mediated by 
				necroptotic signaling.

how may curcumin
				effect aging and longevity as an antiaging agent?


effect of curcumin 
				on vascular aging
				
| growing evidence indicates curcumin as a promising 
				antiaging agent. the effects of curcumin feeding have been 
				largely investigated in animal models, unanimously reporting a 
				suppression of intermediated oxidative stress and inflammation. 
				by chelating nitrogen dioxide (no2), curcumin administration in 
				mice significantly attenuates nitric oxide- (no-) associated 
				vascular endothelial dysfunction and generation of advanced 
				glycation end-products (ages), leading determinants of 
				age-related large elastic artery stiffening. as an additional 
				mechanism, curcumin fixes lysosomal membranes and reduces the 
				function of lysosomal acid hydrolases, thus preventing the 
				aberrant deposition of different connective tissue components in 
				aging endothelium. curcumin mitigated hypertrophy in the aging heart 
				via suppression of p300, the global transcription activator. 
				beneficial effects of curcumin on vascular aging also concern 
				the development of age-related macular degeneration (amd), one 
				of the most important causes of blindness in elderly. curcumin 
				remarkably increases the viability of retinal pigment epithelial 
				cells (rpecs) modulating their proliferation apoptosis and os. 
				overall, those evidences suggest potential application of 
				curcumin as an innovative approach to amd, as for other ocular 
				diseases (e.g., ocular dryness, conjunctivitis, uveitis, 
				pterygium, and glaucoma). even curcumin has been found to 
				prevent the development of cataract in diabetic rats by 
				decreasing age accumulation and serum lpo. curcumin reverses 
				those effects in cultured ecs, whereas in experimental models, 
				prolonged curcumin feeding decreased ros generation and promoted 
				cerebrovascular endothelium-dependent relaxation, finally 
				leading to improved cerebrovascular function. neuroprotective 
				effects of curcumin due to ucp2 overexpression suppression 
				especially target hippocampal neurogenesis in the ca1 area, thus 
				affecting spatial learning and memory. curcumin also prevents 
				detrimental effects of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion by 
				maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. curcumin also contributes 
				to maintain cholesterol homeostasis, otherwise upset by chronic 
				cerebral ischemia. indeed, curcumin promotes cholesterol efflux.
effect of curcumin on longevity and lifespan |  curcumin was 
				shown to increase the fecundity, reproductive lifespan, and 
				child viability of d. melanogaster. it has been shown 
				that curcumin supplementation of d. melanogaster 
				elevated the developmental duration and longevity of adult 
				
				drosophila possibly through epigenetic programming of the 
				pace of life. curcumin increased longevity was observed in two 
				distinctive strains of d. melanogaste as a result of the delayed 
				expression of aging genes, improved locomotion, and 
				chemoprevention as well. curcumin was also shown to reduce os, 
				dna damage, and number of mutagenic phenotypes induced via 
				high-dose ionizing irradiation. also, in vivo experiments on 
				curcumin -fed diets (0.5 and 1.0 mg/g of diet) were effective in 
				extending the average lifespan in both females (6.2% and 25.8%, 
				respectively) and males (15.5% and 12.6%, respectively). also, 
				in c. elegans, curcumin effectively improves lifespan 
				and aging by lowering intracellular ros and lipofuscin. the 
				effects of curcumin on c. elegans longevity are 
				manifested by body size and pharyngeal pumping rate. this 
				evidence indicates that curcumin would exert its effects 
				independently of the age-1-daf-16 pathway but rather through 
				other constituents of the iis pathway. with regard to cognitive 
				impairment, the in vivo experiment demonstrated that curcumin 
				can improve learning and memory also reducing aβ plaque 
				formation in the context of alzheimer disease. 
				d. 
				melanogaster is a promising animal model for research in 
				ad. by increasing amyloid fibril conversion, curcumin reduces 
				the generation of prefibrillar/oligomeric species of aβ, 
				ultimately protecting against neurotoxicity. the human β-amyloid 
				precursor cleavage enzyme (bace-1) is another critical enzyme 
				targeted by curcumin in the d. melanogaster model of 
				alzheimer disease.effect of curcumin on cell senescence | the 
				antiaging effect of curcumin does not rely on delayed cellular 
				senescence. as reported by banji et al., curcumin (40 mg/kg) and 
				piperine (12 mg/kg), especially when combined, counteract 
				d-gal-induced senescence in male wistar rats by targeting os and 
				lipofuscin deposition, finally leading to higher hippocampal 
				volume and function with improved spatial memory and 
				serotoninergic signaling. another study even reported how 
				long-time curcumin therapy may progressively reverse cognitive 
				dysfunction in d-gal-induced senescent mice by delaying the 
				aging process and improving cognitive functions and locomotor 
				activity, as well as restoring the mitochondrial enzyme complex 
				function curcumin. in a recent study, curcumin supplementation 
				rejuvenates senescence-associated changes in thymus among 
				d-gal-induced senescent mice through promotion of proliferating 
				cells, preventing cells from apoptosis, and enhancing the 
				transcription of the autoimmune regulator. curcumin feeding 
				(50 mg/kg) was also tested in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 
				mice resulting in increased hippocampal sod activity as well as 
				upregulation of p-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase ii. 
				overall, these findings suggest a role of curcumin in improving 
				cognitive difficulties and the expression of hippocampal 
				plasticity-associated proteins. with regard to vascular 
				function, curcumin administration significantly mitigated 
				premature senescence in huvecs, characterized by a reduction of 
				senescence-related β-galactosidase-positive cells, cell 
				division, levels of senescence-related protein p21 rna, os, and 
				apoptosis. curcumin is also associated with enhanced enos 
				phosphorylation and no generation, in addition to upregulating 
				sirt1 transcription, translation, and enzymatic activity. in 
				light of these mechanisms, diets containing curcumin  were 
				demonstrated to significantly extend mean lifespan in 
				male c57bl/6 mice and delayed the os-caused premature 
				senescence. as recently demonstrated, sirt1 signaling also 
				mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin in c57bl/6 
				mice fed with high fat diet in addition to improved myocardial 
				structure and function in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice fed 
				with thc (120 mg/kg/d). even more recently, it has been 
				hypothesized that the antiaging effect of curcumin may rely on 
				the control of core clock genes. curcumin treatment in middle 
				aged male wistar rats restored the phase and daily pulse. 
				moreover, it has been shown that curcumin mitigated mouse 
				ovarian aging, upgraded embryonic development, promoted oocyte 
				maturation and fertilization via improvement of ovarian 
				hormones, and elevated the amounts of sirt1 and 3 genes as well 
				as attenuation of aging-associated oxidative stress and cell 
				death. besides, curcumin can reduce oxidative stress, 
				inflammation status, and lipofuscin deposition in aged rat 
				liver.



				how may curcumin work against neurological and neurodegenerative 
				disorders such as alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, 
				multiple sclerosis, huntingtons disease, and cognitive decline 
				or impairment?


















				effect of curcumin on alzheimer's 
				disease |  evidence has accumulated that curcumin has 
				neuroprotective properties and is a candidate for the treatment 
				of alzheimers disease. curcumin is widely recognized for its 
				neuroprotective effects, which are pivotal in combating 
				neurodegenerative diseases. many active metabolites of 
				curcuma longae rhizoma, such as curcumin, modulate the 
				nf-κb pathway, significantly reducing neuroinflammation, which 
				directly impacts the progression of neurodegenerative diseases 
				such as alzheimers and parkinsons (jyotirmayee and mahalik, 
				2022). by suppressing the production of inflammatory cytokines 
				in the brain, curcumin slows disease progression, helping manage 
				symptoms and potentially altering disease trajectories (lee et 
				al., 2023). furthermore, curcumin's potent antioxidant 
				properties combat oxidative stress, a primary contributor to 
				neuronal damage, and enhances the activity of endogenous 
				antioxidants, shielding neural cells from oxidative damage and 
				preventing cell death (razavi and hosseinzadeh, 2020). in 
				addition to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, 
				curcumin also plays a crucial role in the regulation of 
				neurotransmitter functions. it influences key neurotransmitter 
				systems, including dopamine and serotonin, which are essential 
				for maintaining cognitive function and emotional balance (abbas 
				et al., 2020). by influencing these neurotransmitter pathways, 
				curcumin contributes to better mental health and improved 
				quality of life for individuals suffering from these conditions. one of the 
				proposed mechanisms by which curcumin decreases os in brain is 
				its ability to scavenge free radicals. curcumin attaches to fe2+ 
				and fe3+ ions, stopping the iron from redox cycling, indicating 
				it might offer another way to lessen fe2 + −triggered lipid 
				peroxidation (dairam et al., 2008). furthermore, comparing high 
				(5,000 ppm) and low doses of curcumin on mice shows that low and 
				high amounts of curcumin effectively decreased oxidized proteins 
				and interleukin-1beta, which is a type of proinflammatory 
				cytokine that is commonly found in the brains of these mice (lim 
				et al., 2001). when treated with a low amount of curcumin, the 
				astrocytic marker gfap decreased. additionally, the amount of 
				microgliosis in the neuronal layers was suppressed by the 
				curcumin treatment (lim et al., 2001). a study on old female 
				wistar rats shows that curcumin administration is able to reduce 
				os in rats brain through causing a reduction in brain lipid 
				peroxidation and an induction in sod levels (cheriki et al., 
				2024). the most recent study in this field shows that curcumin 
				also works at mitochondria levels to reduce os in aged cells of 
				brain. in this study, d-gal was used for simulating a condition 
				like aging in male rats brains and then these rats were treated 
				with 200 mg/kg of curcumin for 6 weeks. reverse 
				transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) gene expression 
				analysis on these rats showed that os markers (like sirt-1) were 
				significantly lower after curcumin treatment which was probably 
				the result of increased activity of electron transport chain 
				complexes in the mitochondria of aged brain tissues (singh a. et 
				al., 2024). in an alzheimers disease transgenic 
				mouse, curcumin decreased oxidative stress and repaired amyloid 
				pathology. antioxidant and anti-inflammatory features of 
				curcumin helped to minimize the manifestation of alzheimers 
				disease, which is characterized by inflammation and oxidation. 
				recent studies have indicated that curcumin treatment can 
				promote the decomposition of β-amyloid in brain tissues and 
				prevent the aberrant production and accumulation of β-amyloid, 
				which reduces the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and 
				effectively prevents the degeneration and injury of brain 
				neurons. curcumin has protective effects for several risk 
				factors of neurodegeneration and is used in the treatment of 
				alzheimer's disease as well. in vivo studies show the beneficial 
				effects of curcumin on cognition with a dose-dependent manner 
				that higher dosages is more effective as compared to lower 
				dosages. based on the preclinical findings, curcumin stabilizes/prevents cognitive decline in 
				alzheimer's disease. a literature review was conducted to verify 
				studies that evaluated the effects of curcumin supplementation 
				on neurodegenerative / psychological disorders such as 
				alzheimer's and depression in animal and human models, and their 
				respective mechanisms of action. pluta and colleagues focus on the role 
				and mechanisms of curcumin in inhibiting ischemia/reperfusion 
				brain injury and potential therapeutic strategies in the 
				treatment of ischemic brain damage of the alzheimers disease 
				phenotype. comparably, ferreira and colleagues also delineate 
				neuroprotective characteristics by summarizing what is known 
				about the role of curcumin on transthyretin amyloidosis. 
				according to previous reports, curcumin modulates abnormal 
				transthyretin (ttr) aggregation and inhibits its deposition in 
				the tissue. as the gutbrain axis is linked to 
				neurodegeneration, curcumin exerts neuroprotective effect 
				against neurodegenerative disorders by restoring the intestinal 
				barrier function and a healthy gut microbiome. these findings 
				highlight the importance of neuroprotective effect of curcumin 
				against brain damage by regulating both inflammation and 
				oxidative stress. this is consistent with previous findings 
				where curcumin was shown to reduce significantly the mrna 
				expression of nf-kb and tlr4 and showed protective effects 
				against glutamate neurotoxicity. studies have shown that 
				curcumin has a therapeutic effect on alzheimers disease by 
				several molecular mechanisms, including decreasing oxidative 
				damage and constraining the creation of the aβ fibrils in vitro. 
				the anti-inflammation effects of curcumin as a food additive 
				were evaluated in the appsw mice (alzheimer-like model) at 
				several doses. the results have indicated that low-dose curcumin 
				(160 ppm) reduced gfap, which is an astrocytic marker associated 
				with inflammatory processes. furthermore, the effect of curcumin 
				on spatial memory (an alzheimers disease symptom) in 
				alzheimers disease rat models has shown that curcumin 
				significantly decreases gfap mrna in hippocampal astrocytes, 
				which improves the spatial memory in the alzheimers disease rat 
				model. ambegaokar et al. reported that the inhibition property 
				of curcumin is dose and time-dependent. for example, curcumin 
				concentrations of 1530 μm are more effective for short trials 
				(<24 h), while its concentrations of 515 μm are better suited 
				for longer periods (46 days). these data suggest that curcumin 
				may be more effective in preventing ad in low doses if used for 
				long periods. accumulating data show that aβ can increase the 
				expression of cox-2, il-1, and il-6, while decreasing the 
				peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (pparγ) in 
				amyloid-beta protein precursor transgenic mice, and curcumin can 
				inhibit this function in amyloid-beta-treated astrocytes. most 
				of the literature about curcumin indicates that this spice has 
				especially strong properties against ad. for instance, the 
				incidence of alzheimers disease among indian people (who 
				regularly consume these spices) is very low when compared with 
				the reported incidence in western countries. only 0.7% of 7079 
				years old people in india are affected by ad; however, about 
				3.1% of americans in this age range are also affected. up to 
				now, the potential anti-amyloid therapeutic methods for 
				alzheimers disease treatment have been focused on the amyloid 
				cascade theory, on which the use of aβ vaccines and 
				metal-complexing agents is based. strimpakos et al. reported 
				that curcumin has anti-amyloidogenic properties, thus acting 
				against ad-induced aβ fibrils in vitro and improving cognitive 
				functioning in vivo. interestingly, another study 
				analyzing the curcumin-mediated neuroprotective effects on brain 
				aging induced by d-galactose in in vitro and in vivo models 
				revealed an anti-aging effect through regulating neuronal loss, 
				apoptosis in d-galactose induced brain aging, and anti-oxidant 
				enzyme expression. furthermore, curcumin improved neuronal 
				length and cellular senescence down-regulated expression of p16 
				and p21 and upregulated expression of antioxidant enzymes, 
				including sod-1, gpx-1, and catalase. administration of curcumin 
				ameliorated the cognitive impairment and suppressed apoptosis in 
				the cerebral cortex by downregulating bax and poly (adp-ribose) 
				polymerase expression and increasing bcl-2 expression [86]. in 
				neurodegenerative diseases, such as ad, pd, als, microglia play 
				an important role by inducing oxidative stress, redox imbalance 
				and neuroinflammation. the activated microglia are represented 
				by m1 (pro-inflammatory) and m2 (anti-inflammatory) functional 
				phenotypes based on the surface molecules and cytokine 
				expression profiles. different natural products show therapeutic 
				properties on microglia and consequent prevent neurodegenerative 
				diseases; they act by inhibition of microglia polarization and 
				production of inflammatory mediators. in microglia, curcumin 
				acts on different molecular targets. curcumin inhibited 
				lps-induced nf-kb and activator protein-1 (ap-1) dna bindings in 
				bv2 microglial cells decreasing inflammatory mediators. 
				peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-γ (pparγ) is a 
				transcription factor and nuclear receptor protein that regulates 
				inflammatory responses in microglia, astrocytes and when is 
				activated, pparγ suppresses the production of proinflammatory 
				cytokines and inflammatory pathways by binding the peroxisome 
				proliferator response element. curcumin activates pparγ 
				which reduces nf-κb cytokine production in a mouse model of ad, 
				in rat hippocampal primary cell lines and primary astrocytes. 
				moreover, our group has found that curcumin suppresses lps 
				induced inflammatory response in microglia cells by down 
				regulation of pi3k/akt and jak/stat/socs signaling pathway. in 
				addition, curcumin induces anti-inflammatory mediators, such as 
				ho-1/nrf-2 consequently reducing oxidative stress and 
				neuroinflammation. curcumin treatment improved neuron loss and 
				degeneration, while also inhibited cellular senescence and 
				oxidative stress by upregulating antioxidant enzyme expression 
				in ra-induced sy5y cells. in line with the findings described 
				above, the protective effect of curcumin against cognitive 
				impairment has been demonstrated in diabetes mellitus/chronical 
				cerebral hyperperfusion-induced cognitive deficit model. 
				moreover, curcumin treatment attenuated the neuronal death and 
				suppressed neuroinflammation induced by microglial activation. 
				these protective effects involved the modulation of triggering 
				receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (trem2)/tlr4/nf-kb 
				pathway. curcumin treatment reduced nod-like receptor protein 3 
				(nlrp3) dependent pyroptosis. since nlrp3-dependent pyroptosis 
				has been reported to be involved in the progression of 
				neurodegenerative diseases, this result suggests that curcumin 
				may be useful as pharmacological strategy for neurodegenerative 
				diseases. the pleiotropic activities of curcumin provide 
				multiple ways to tackle ttr pathophysiology, through direct 
				interaction of curcumin with ttr, or indirect effects affecting 
				signaling pathways associated with ttr amyloid fibril formation 
				and clearance. bielak-zmijewska and coworkers summarize 
				scientific data on curcumins ability to postpone progression of 
				age-related diseases in which cellular senescence is directly 
				involved. they furthermore point out that curcumin causes 
				elongation of the lifespan of model organisms and alleviates 
				aging symptoms. in addition, they discuss thoroughly curcumins 
				ability to modulate cellular senescence. common brain disorders, including depression and alzheimers disease, have 
	been linked to diminished levels of an important neurologic growth hormone 
	called brain-derived neurotrophic factor. reports suggest curcumin has 
				neuroprotective action in alzheimers disease, major depression, 
				epilepsy, and other neurodegenerative disorders. the hippocampus 
				region of brain is associated with memory and cognition. studies 
				have shown that hippocampus undergoes structural and biochemical 
				changes with normal aging that results in age-related 
				deterioration in hippocampus-dependent cognition. curcumin has 
				been found to ameliorate age-related memory deficits in aged 
				mice. in elderly, regular curcumin intake improves cognitive 
				function and ameliorates age-related spatial memory deficits. an 
	



australian study, in the 
				journal of psychopharmacology in 2015, 
	found that curcumin improved attention and working memory and reduced mental 
	fatigue in older people who took it for four weeks, compared to a placebo. several studies have shown that 
	curcumin, the active medicinal compound in turmeric, can increase levels of 
	bdnf in the human brain and therefore delay or even reverse a range of 
	common neurological disorders. one of the main drivers of this process is 
				brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), which is a type of 
				growth hormone that functions in your brain (20). many common 
				brain disorders have been linked to decreased levels of this 
				hormone, including depression and alzheimer's disease. 
				interestingly, curcumin can increase brain levels of bdnf. by 
				doing this, it may be effective in delaying or even reversing 
				many brain diseases and age-related decreases in brain function. 
				it may also improve memory and make you smarter, which seems 
				logical given its effects on bdnf levels. however, controlled 
				studies in people are needed to confirm this. in addition, scientists are beginning to 
	suspect that the neurologic powers of curcumin dont just stop there, with 
	research suggesting that this compound may improve memory and increase 
	cognitive capacity. curcumin, thanks to its wide range of effects,
				
seems to help the brain resist buildup of harmful plaque in brains with 
	alzheimer's.  a

study in 
	the annals of indian academy of neurology explored curcumin's potential 
	for use in the treatment for alzheimer's disease. some of the key points 
	included: curcumin may help the macrophages, which play an important role in 
	our immune system, clear the amyloid plaques found in alzheimer's disease. 
	curcumin has anti-proliferative actions on microglia. microglia are immune 
	cells of the central nervous system that become active in response to any 
	number of stressors on the body. however, if the microglia have been 
	stimulated to react too often, they become hyper-reactive, which can trigger 
	system-wide inflammation that can be difficult to stop. curcumin has 
	powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. "overall, curcumin 
	decreases the main chemical for inflammation and the transcription of 
	inflammatory cytokines the exposure to curcumin also impaired the 
	production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-1, il-6 and tnf-)." as chronic 
	neuro-inflammation is considered one of the major factors in the development 
	of alzheimer's, it's possible too that curcumin may help in the treatment of 
	other inflammatory disorders. researchers found that curcumin 
	
not only reduces oxidative damage and inflammation, but also 
reduces amyloid accumulation and synaptic marker loss and promotes amyloid 
phagocytosis and clearance. curcumin worked to prevent synaptic marker and 
cognitive deficits caused by amyloid peptide infusion and abeta oligomer 
toxicity in vitro, and may help the immune system clear the
brain of amyloid beta, which forms the plaques found in alzheimer's disease. clinical trials are in progress at ucla with curcumin
for alzheimer's. in the 
alzheimers disease anti-inflammatory prevention trial, researched showed that 
reducing inflammation has positive effects on patients with alzheimers. 
curcumin significantly lowered several inflammation markers, in addition to 
reducing plaque on the brain (a sign of alzheimers) by 43 to 50 percent.
the effect of curcumin (turmeric) on alzheimer's disease: an overview 
	neuroprotective activity has also been shown in curcumin. in alzheimers 
	disease (ad), a peptide called β-amyloid (aβ peptide) aggregates into 
	oligomers and fibrils and forms deposits known as amyloid (or senile) 
	plaques outside neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of patients. 
	another feature of ad is the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary 
	tangles formed by phosphorylated tau protein. abnormal microglial 
	activation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death are also associated with 
	the progression of the disease. curcumin has been found to inhibit aβ fibril 
	formation and extension and to destabilize preformed fibrils 
				in vitro. metal chelation by curcumin might interfere with metal ion 
	(cu2+/zn2+)-induced aβ aggregation. curcumin might also affect the 
	trafficking of aβ peptide precursor (app) and the generation of aβ peptides 
	from app. abnormally activated microglia and hypertrophic astrocytes around 
	amyloid plaques in ad brains release cytotoxic molecules, such as 
	proinflammatory cytokines and ros, which enhance aβ formation and deposition 
	and further damage neurons. curcumin was found to reduce the inflammatory 
	response triggered by aβ peptide-induced microglial activation and increase 
	neuronal cell survival. when injected into the carotid artery of a 
	transgenic mouse model of ad, curcumin was found to cross the blood-brain 
	barrier, bind to amyloid plaques, and block the formation of aβ oligomers 
	and fibrils. in other animal models of ad, dietary curcumin decreased 
	biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative damage, increased aβ peptide 
	clearance by macrophages, dismantled amyloid plaques in the brain, 
	stimulated neuronal cell growth in the hippocampus, and improved aβ-induced 
	memory deficits. as a result of promising findings in animal models. a few 
	recent clinical trials have examined the effect of oral curcumin 
	supplementation on cognition in healthy older adults and ad patients. a significant reduction in mental 
	fatigue and higher levels of calmness and contentedness following cognitive 
	test sessions were observed in individuals who consumed curcumin (either 
	acutely or chronically) compared to the placebo group. additionally, the 
	results of cognitive ability tests suggested that curcumin treatment had 
	limited benefits on cognitive function, as shown by better scores in 
	measures of sustained attention and working memory compared to placebo. the 
	results of a six-month trial in 27 patients with ad found that oral 
	supplementation with up to 4 g/day of curcumin - containing all three major 
	curcuminoids - was safe. curcumin also helps inhibit 
				plaque that research has linked to neuron damage in the brain 
				and a sign of the disease. there may be good news on the horizon 
				because curcumin has been shown to cross the blood-brain 
				barrier. its known that inflammation and oxidative damage play 
				a role in alzheimer's disease, and curcumin has beneficial 
				effects on both. in addition, a key feature of alzheimer's 
				disease is a buildup of protein tangles called amyloid plaques. 
				studies show that curcumin can help clear these plaques. 
				alzheimers disease (ad) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease 
				characterized by the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau protein 
				in neurofibrillary tangles, selective neuronal loss, progressive 
				memory and cognitive impairment (campbell and gowran 2007). the 
				molecular pathogenesis of ad involves extracellular deposition 
				of beta-amyloid (ab) peptides in the hippocampus and curcumin 
				is known to reduce alzheimers pathology (serafini et al. 2017) 
				possibly due to its anti-aggregatory properties (cole, teter, 
				and frautschy 2007). in a clinical study, curcumin 
				administration (1 or 4 g, 6 months trial) significantly 
				increased the levels of antioxidant vitamin e without inducing 
				any adverse events in patients with ad (baum et al. 2008). in 
				preclinical studies, curcumin is known to reduce aboligomer and 
				fibril formation (yang et al. 2005; xiong et al. 2011), inhibit 
				the neurotoxicity of abin the brain (jiang et al. 2012; sun, 
				zhao, and hu 2013), suppress ab-induced inflammation (lim et al. 
				2001; lu et al. 2014) and markedly reduce the levels of il- 
				1b(griffin et al. 2006) and inducible nitric oxide synthase 
				(inos) (begum et al. 2008) in transgenic mouse brain. several 
				studies demonstrated dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of 
				curcumin against ab-induced toxicity. curcumin exhibited 
				anti-aggregatory effect against ab plaque formation by metal 
				chelation (huang et al. 2004; tamagno et al. 2005), anti-oxidant 
				effects (hamaguchi et al. 2009), cholesterol lowering effects 
				(fassbender et al. 2001; refolo et al. 2001), inhibition of 
				presenilin-2 and/or by increasing degrading enzymes such as 
				insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin (wang et al. 2014). 
				curcumin potentiate heat shock proteins production in response 
				to cellular stress, which protects neuronal cells from ab 
				neurotoxicity and prevent ab aggregation and accumulation.  
				curcumin, a bioactive compound from turmeric, has emerged as a 
				promising neuroprotective agent due to its multifaceted 
				mechanisms of action. curcumin mitigates neuronal degeneration 
				by suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation, cell death, and 
				mitochondrial dysfunction. it activates the nrf2 pathway by 
				dissociating from keap1, leading to the increased expression of 
				antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (ho1) and 
				nad(p)hquinone oxidoreductase 1 (nqo1), while inhibiting 
				pro-inflammatory cytokines, like tnf-alpha, il-6, and il-1beta 
				[166]. this dual action enhances neuronal survival and 
				plasticity, critical for combating neurodegeneration. in animal 
				models, curcumin has demonstrated significant neuroprotective 
				effects. for instance, chronic administration of curcumin in 
				stressed rats reduced il-1beta expression and neuronal death in 
				the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, correlating with decreased 
				depressive behavior. additionally, curcumin enhanced 
				neurotransmitter levels and modulated the serotonergic system, 
				contributing to its antidepressant effects. in alzheimers 
				disease models, curcumin reduced beta-amyloid plaque formation, 
				oxidative stress, and neuronal damage, demonstrating its 
				potential to slow disease progression. furthermore, the 
				transcriptional modification of dysfunctional microglial mir-155 
				reduced retinal inflammation and related vasculopathy by 
				decreasing the generation of clec7a/galectin-3+ microglia, which 
				led to neurodegenerative outcomes. interestingly, curcumin 
				stimulated microglial migration to and phagocytosis of amyloid 
				plaques, decreased mir-155-mediated neurodegenerative phenotype, 
				and reduced amyloid stress in mouse brains.effect of curcumin on parkinsons disease | 
				dietary curcumin is an important candidate in the prevention or 
				treatment of parkinsons disease. 
				


				 in parkinsons disease models induced by 
				6-hydroxydopamine, curcumin protected dopaminergic neurons, 
				improved memory function, and increased dopamine and 
				acetylcholine levels in the substantia nigra, while reducing 
				oxidative stress and upregulating neurotrophic factors, like 
				bdnf and trkb. overall, curcumins ability to enhance 
				antioxidant defenses, ssuppress inflammatory pathways, and 
				promote neuronal health underscores its potential as a 
				neuroprotective agent. curcumin is suggested to be an effective therapeutic and 
				nutraceutical agent for parkinsons disease treatment. 
				interestingly, curcumin was found to inhibit the synthesis of 
				moa-b enzyme (khatri and juvekar, 2016), which would lead to an 
				increase in the level and availability of da in the brain. 
				neuroprotective effects of curcumin in a 6-hydroxydopmin e 
				animal model of parkinsons disease (el nebrisi et al., 2020) 
				indicated an increase in the survival of striatal th fibers and 
				snpc neurons, decreased abnormal turning behavior, and exerted 
				neuroprotective properties. these findings provide evidence that 
				α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors could be a potential 
				therapeutic target and curcumin would be the first natural 
				source that is found to modulate nicotinic receptors in 
				parkinsons disease. 
recent evidence indicates 
				decreased superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1) expression in reactive 
				astrocytes in the damaged substantia nigra, thus leading to 
				inflammation and oxidative stress that contribute to the 
				degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in parkinsons disease. 
				curcumin, through the preservation of sod1 expression in 
				reactive striatal astrocytes in hemiparkinsonian mice, has 
				anti-inflammatory properties. gui et al. showed that curcumin, 
				through the inhibition of cyp2e1 (the cytochrome p450 2e1) 
				expression and its activity in reducing ros and maleic 
				dialdehyde in astrocytes, leads to protection of the 
				mesencephalic astrocytes against lps-induced toxicities. these 
				results indicate that curcumin could affect the metabolism of 
				several compounds in the cns and provide evidence for the 
				therapeutic approach in parkinsons disease using curcumin at 
				low concentration. studies show that the oral administration of 
				curcumin (150 mg/kg/day for a week) in mouse models of 
				parkinsons disease reversed gfap and inducible nitric oxide 
				synthase protein expression and also decreased proinflammatory 
				cytokine in the striatum, suggesting that curcumin can improve 
				motor performance in a mouse model of parkinsons disease. in 
				addition, curcumin, through the bcl-2-mitochondria-ros-inducible 
				nitric oxide synthase pathway, can protect against mpp+ 
				(1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium)- and mptp− 
				(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro­pyridine)-induced 
				apoptosis in pc12 cells. curcumin can significantly inhibit 
				nf-κβ translocation and activation in astrocytes. in one  study, chronic curcumin administration (50, 
				100 or 200 mg/kg, p.o., for 3 weeks) significantly ameliorated 
				behavioral alterations like locomotor activity and 
				motor-coordination in mouse model of parkinsons disease. in the 
				similar study, curcumin administration reduced oxidative damage 
				and mitochondrial dysfunction in brain homogenate by reducing 
				ache activity. curcumin administration decreased malondialdehyde 
				(mda) and nitrite while increased superoxide dismutase (sod), 
				catalase (cat) and reduced glutathione (gsh) levels in the brain 
				homogenate of rotenone induced mouse model of parkinsons 
				disease (khatri and juvekar 2016). it has been demonstrated that 
				curcumin administration alleviate motor dysfunction and increase 
				tyrosine hydroxylase activity in rotenone induced parkinsons 
				disease rat model. curcumin administration phosphorylates nrf-2 
				and akt thereby attenuated oxidative damage of dopaminergic 
				neuron (cui, li, and zhu 2016). moreover, dietary curcumin 
				supplementation 0.5% or 2.0% (w/w) attenuated 
				1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp) induced 
				neurotoxicity in mice via increasing the expression of glial 
				cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and tgf-b1 in 
				nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and thus slowing the 
				progression of parkinsons disease (he et al. 2015b). curcumin 
				administration increased monoaminergic neurotransmitters such as 
				norepinephrine and dopamine in hippocampal homogenate and 
				alleviated hippocampal damage in 6-hydroxydopamine induced 
				parkinsons disease in rat. in addition, curcumin treatment 
				upregulated the expression of bdnf, trkb and pi3k in the 
				hippocampus (yang et al. 2014). curcumin treatment (200 mg/kg, 
				for 1 week) significantly attenuated loss of tyrosine 
				hydroxylase, sustained sod1 level and diminished activation of 
				microglia and astrocytes in the striatum.effect of 
				curcumin on cognitive 
				impairment | curcumin has been reported to improve 
				neuropsychological functions. curcumin dietary administration on 
				24-month-old male rodents shows that 1 month of giving curcumin 
				greatly improves the damaged ability of the blood vessels of 
				brain to relax in old rats. in the brain arteries of these rats 
				and in cultured endothelial cells, curcumin increases the 
				phosphorylation of enos and ampk, and reduces the production of 
				ros. this effect of curcumin is mostly beneficial for inhibiting 
				neurodegenerative diseases than cerebrovascular accidents.  
				another study on senescent cardiomyocytes shows that curcumin 
				can also affect these cells through inhibiting phosphorylation 
				of mtor and thereby, activating ampk in a dose-dependent manner 
				(yang 
				et al., 2022).curcumin has several inhibitory

				and nrf2 gene, as well as the prohibition of p-mtor and p-nf-κb. 
				curcumin prevents d-gal-induced brain aging and cognitive 
				impairment through increments of antioxidant enzymes and 
				inhibition of apoptosis. beneficial effects of curcumin on 
				mental abilities and functional capacities are associated with a 
				lpo reduction in brain tissue, especially in the hippocampal 
				area. curcumin improves the redox state in this area and 
				prevents the decline of hippocampal long-term potentiation by 
				maintaining synapse input specificity. recently, olesen et al. 
				described that the dysfunction of synaptic mitochondria of the 
				hippocampus causing memory loss during aging. they showed that 
				curcumin feeding significantly improved integration and activity 
				of the synaptic mitochondrial of the hippocampus, inhibiting 
				mitochondrial swelling and enhancing the production of synapses 
				surrounding the mitochondria in mice.effect of 
				curcumin on multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
				| curcumin was studied to determine if it could help als 
				patients, particularly those with bulbar involvement, survive 
				longer (ahmadi et al., 2018). curcumin therapy reduced the 
				development of als and oxidative damage in a double-blind 
				therapeutic trial (chico et al., 2018). recent studies suggest that curcumin, through reduced mmp-9 
				enzyme activity and decreased release of il-6 in the astrocyte 
				population of cns, might beneficially cause anti-inflammatory 
				responses in neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple 
				sclerosis. curcumin represents some potential for treatments of 
				various autoimmune diseases related to th17 cells including ms. 
				curcumin, through interfering with protein kinase c activity and 
				ca2+ entry, can eliminate both pma and thapsigargin-induced ros 
				generation by the dose-dependent manner. curcumin can prevent 
				the production of h2o2 and no; the free radicals produced by 
				macrophages and astrocytes in vitro. in eae, curcumin has 
				important roles in lymphocyte proliferation inhibition, 
				reductions of il-17 production by th17 cells, and toll-like 
				receptors 4 and 9 (tlr 4 and 9) downregulations. xie et al. 
				reported that in eae mice or rats, curcumin shrinks inflammatory 
				cells, including th17 cells, and hinders its infiltration and 
				differentiation in the cns. curcumin has the promising potential 
				for treating multiple sclerosis. curcumin delivering to the 
				animal models through intraperitoneal injection or oral 
				administration leads to nf-κβ pathway activation decreasing in 
				rat and mouse microglial cell cultures and also in the rat 
				brain. furthermore, curcumin can also reduce nf-κβ activation in 
				human cell lines and can neutralize ros in vitro and can 
				stimulate the nrf2-are pathway similarly in the brain and 
				skeletal muscles of mice and also in isolated rat astrocytes. 
				sod1-misfolded and -aggregated proteins in the motor neurons 
				have an important role in disease pathogenesis, and its 
				targeting treatment can decrease als progression in animal 
				models. as previously shown, curcumin can constrain sod1 
				aggregation in vitro. curcumin through gene expression can also 
				stimulate the clearance of the aggregated protein in pals and 
				alzheimers disease blood cells. up to the present time, several 
				studies confirm that regimens treatment can cause motor neuron 
				enhancement (although there are several different descriptions 
				for these improvements). furthermore, a small pilot trial 
				revealed some advantage of curcumin in pals.effect 
				of curcumin on huntingtons disease | studies using 
				established yeast models showed that curcumin inhibits mhtt 
				aggregation, by acting through endosome-sorting complexes 
				required for transport machinery and also destabilizes preformed 
				aggregates. curcumin, by downregulation of vps36, a component of 
				the endosome-sorting complexes required for transport-ii 
				complex, prevents recruitment of misfolded protein to the 
				perivascular compartment, thus inhibiting the formation of large 
				aggregates. the amyloid-binding ability and anti-amyloid 
				properties of curcumin, along with its ease of oral 
				administration, make it an attractive therapeutic candidate for 
				several neurodegenerative diseases.  


how may curcumin work against diabetes?















curcumins ability to decrease blood 
				sugar levels in human patients was first reported in 1972. 
				curcumins potential as an anti-diabetic agent is supported by 
				its multifaceted mechanisms, which include improving insulin 
				sensitivity, enhancing glucose uptake and utilization, 
				regulating lipid metabolism, and mitigating inflammation and 
				oxidative stress. zhao et al. (2021) noted that curcumin reduces 
				the activity of genes involved in liver fat production, such as 
				those coding for sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c 
				(srebp1c) and carbohydrate response element-binding protein 
				(chrebp), which are key in cholesterol synthesis. furthermore, 
				curcumin boosts the activity of enzymes like carnitine 
				palmitoyltransferase 1 (cpt1) and acyl-coa cholesterol 
				acyltransferase (acat) to enhance lipid mobilization (zhao et 
				al., 2021). curcumin also modulates lipid accumulation in the 
				liver by activating ppar-γ through the ampk pathway, showcasing 
				its antioxidant capabilities. in terms of anti-inflammatory 
				actions, it reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators 
				such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (mcp-1), interleukin-1β 
				(il-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-α), interleukin-6 
				(il-6), and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox2), which are significantly 
				elevated in type 2 diabetes (pivari et al., 2019). clinical 
				studies by panahi et al. (2018) further underscore curcumins 
				therapeutic potential. curcumin, with its multifaceted 
				bioactive properties, has been extensively investigated for its 
				potential to manage diabetes and its complications through 
				mechanisms including improved lipid metabolism, reduced 
				inflammation, antioxidant effects, and prevention of cell death. 
				curcumin administration has demonstrated significant benefits in 
				clinical trials. additionally, curcumin administration at 300 
				mg/kg for three months in diabetic obese patients significantly 
				reduced fasting blood sugar, insulin resistance, hba1c, serum 
				triglycerides, and free fatty acids, while increasing 
				lipoprotein lipase activity, highlighting its efficacy in lipid 
				metabolism modulation. additionally, combining curcumin with 
				piperine significantly improved glycemic control and hepatic 
				parameters.  curcumin also plays a role in mitigating 
				diabetic complications. these findings underscore curcumins 
				potential as a comprehensive adjunct therapy for managing 
				diabetes and its complications, although further large-scale, 
				long-term randomized trials are necessary to fully establish its 
				efficacy and optimize dosing strategies. regular intake of curcumin has 
				been found to improve glucose and lipid metabolism, enhance 
				intracellular antioxidant responses, and improve insulin 
				signaling, providing benefits for diabetes-related metabolic 
				diseases (kim and clifton, 2018). curcumin alleviated oxidative 
				stress in a rat model of type 1 diabetes (stz-induced), as 
				evidenced by not only lowering blood glucose levels, but also 
				decreasing plasma mda, gsh-px, and cat activity while increasing 
				sod and insulin levels (xie et al., 2018). the value of curcumin 
				in preventing and reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial 
				dysfunction was demonstrated by findings showing that curcumin 
				treatment improved mitochondrial tbars levels in the liver and 
				kidney in experiments with animal models of hyperglycemia, and 
				may enhance oxygen consumption rate and atpase activity through 
				scavenging free radicals and preventing protein and lipid 
				peroxidation (soto-urquieta et al., 2014). high doses of 
				curcumin reduced tc, tg, ldl-c, and hdl-c levels in diabetic 
				rats by lowering fasting blood glucose (fgb) concentrations 
				improving oral glucose tolerance, and preventing its 
				deterioration in diabetic rats (xia et al., 2020). in an animal 
				study, curcumin treatment reduced fasting blood glucose levels 
				and increased insulin levels in diabetic rats, and significantly 
				reduced cholesterol and triglyceride levels (alsulaim et al., 
				2023). curcumin attenuated high glucose/palmitate (hp)-induced 
				oxidative stress in pancreatic islet cells and reduced apoptotic 
				damage in these cells by modulating the nadph pathway (li et 
				al., 2019). curcumin has been shown to restore gastric emptying 
				(ge) by activating nrf2 to suppress oxidative stress markers and 
				pro-inflammatory cytokines in the gastric tissues of 
				obesity-induced diabetic mice (bharucha et al., 2019; sampath et 
				al., 2021). supplementation with curcumin also inhibited 
				myocardial lipid peroxidation and transforming growth factor β1 
				(tgf-β1) production in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats, which 
				attenuated oxidative stress and myocardial fibrosis (gbr et al., 
				2021). because of its anti-inflammatory 
				property, curcumin represents a promising therapeutic option for 
				type 2 diabetes. this disease can be targeted by curcumin 
				through regulating many fundamentals of ampk signaling pathway. 
				curcumin not only increases the expression and phosphorylation 
				of ampk itself but also affects other related proteins such as 
				acetyl-coa carboxylase (acc) and thereby, decreasing blood 
				glucose 400 times better than metformin (jiménez-flores et al., 
				2014; kim et al., 2009; lu et al., 2019). besides, curcumin is 
				also able to decrease the complications of diabetes in 
				elderlies. for instance, diabetic nephropathy is one of these 
				unwanted consequences of diabetes which can be inhibited by 
				curcumin (kim et al., 2016). curcumin activates ampk signaling 
				which leads to nrf2 induction and decreasing os and thus, it 
				exerts its reno-protective effects by inhibiting renal lipid 
				accumulation (kim et al., 2016). diabetic encephalopathy (de) is 
				also another complication that curcumin has the ability to 
				reduce in diabetic rats through the down-regulation of 
				ampk-mediated gluconeogenesis (lakshmanan et al., 2011). 
				regarding the other complication of diabetes. curcumin 
				stimulated ampk and jnk1, leading to the phosphorylation of 
				bcl-2 and bim. this caused them to separate from beclin1, 
				promoting autophagy and reducing apoptosis. furthermore, 
				curcumin likely regulates autophagy by inhibiting the mtorc1 
				pathway through ampk in diabetic conditions. their research 
				indicates that curcumin can defend against diabetic 
				cardiomyopathy by controlling the interaction between autophagy 
				and apoptosis (yao et al., 2018). curcuminoids have been demonstrated in diabetes 
				mellitus type 2 patients to improve insulin resistance, reduce 
				glucose and insulin levels, enhance adiponectin secretion, and 
				lower levels of leptin, resistin, interleukin (il-6, il-1β), and 
				tnf-α (hajavi et al., 2017).  curcumin and its three 
				derivatives (dimethoxy curcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and 
				diacetyl curcumin) were reported for their antioxidant 
				capabilities (faizal et al., 2009). ingestion of curcumin along with insulin 
				synergistically reduced the blood sugar level. furthermore, when 
				the insulin dosage was decreased to the minimum, the 
				anti-diabetic effect of curcumin was persistent. interestingly, 
				when the ingestion of curcumin and turmeric was discontinued for 
				a week, random blood sugar levels increased to 140 mg/dl. 
				therefore, ingestion of a daily 5-g dose of curcumin was 
				resumed, which promptly reduced the fasting blood sugar level to 
				110 mg/dl. blood urea in this patient after 3 months of turmeric 
				therapy was 20 to 22, and the patients electrocardiogram was 
				normal. turmeric therapy was not associated with any palpable 
				adverse effects; rather, the beneficial effects of turmeric as a 
				good appetite stimulant and effective laxative were observed. 
				more recently, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
				clinical trial assessed the efficacy of curcumin in delaying 
				development of type 2 diabetes in the prediabetes population.  
				after 9 months of treatment, 16.4% of participants in the 
				placebo group were diagnosed with  type 2 diabetes, whereas 
				none were diagnosed with  type 2 diabetes in the 
				curcumin-treated group (fig. 6a). in addition, the participants 
				of curcumin-treated group showed a better overall function of β 
				cells, with higher homa-β and lower c-peptide levels. the 
				curcumin-treated participants also exhibited a lower level of 
				homa-ir and higher adiponectin when compared with the placebo 
				group. the authors of this study concluded that the curcumin may 
				be beneficial in a prediabetes population. 

curcumin has been shown to equal in effectiveness to the drug metformin 
	in the management of diabetes, but without negative side effects. in the 
	study curcumin was shown to lower blood glucose levels and reverse insulin 
	resistance by suppressing glucose production in the liver. among those 
	verging on type 2 diabetes, curcumin capsules
				
seem to help stall the onset of the disease. the study that returned 
	these results found that while a little more than 16% of people taking a 
	placebo wound up with a diabetes diagnosis, no one taking curcumin received 
	one. a
	
clinical trial from thailand, published in 
				diabetes care in 
	2012, found that people with prediabetes who took curcumin for nine months 
	had improved function of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, along with 
	a significantly reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. other studies 
	suggest that curcumin can improve insulin sensitivity. another study found curcumin
				
improved metabolic 
	function and reduced the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries of 
	type-2 diabetes patients. curcumin also acts as an anti-diabetic and 
	antioxidant in patients with
				
type-1 diabetes. curcumin acts directly on liver cells to help 
prevent them from becoming fatty, and studies have concluded that curcumin may 
have an anti-diabetic effect by decreasing serum fatty acid through the 
promotion of fatty acid oxidation and utilization. curcumin also works directly on pancreatic beta cells 
to help them produce insulin normally. by helping the liver and the pancreas, 
curcumin is taking stress off the two most important organs whose function 
declines before the onset of type 2 diabetes. curcumin also influences key 
hormones, supports major body organs, and regulates inflammatory signaling all 
in ways that help correct or prevent metabolic problems. curcumin helps lower 
inappropriately high levels of leptin (reducing leptin resistance) while 
boosting the all-important levels of the adiponectin 
(which lowers insulin resistance). curcumin also helps activate the fat-burning 
gene signal ppar gamma, which also helps to make more new, metabolically-fit fat 
cells. curcumin directly reduces major inflammatory events from occurring inside 
white adipose tissue (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and monocyte 
chemotactic protein-1). by lowering such inflammation, the source of 
overweight-induced disease is targeted. oxidative stress and inflammation have 
				been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
				and related vascular complications. a large body of preclinical 
				evidence suggests that the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
				glucose-lowering activities of curcumin and its analogs may be 
				useful in the prevention and/or treatment of type 2 diabetes. in 
				a nine-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
				in 237 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (pre-diabetes), 
				no progression to overt diabetes was reported with a daily 
				ingestion of a mixture of curcuminoids (0.5 g), while 16.4% of 
				placebo-treated participants developed diabetes. in addition, 
				curcumin supplementation was shown to reduce insulin resistance 
				and improve measures of pancreatic β-cell function and glucose 
				tolerance. supplemental curcumin was found to be as effective as 
				lipid-lowering drug atorvastatin (10 mg/day) in reducing 
				circulating markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) and 
				inflammation (endothelin-1, tnfα, il-6) and in improving 
				endothelial function. another randomized controlled trial also 
				reported that oral curcumin supplementation (1.5 g/day) for six 
				months improved endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, and 
				metabolic markers associated with atherogenesis (plasma 
				triglycerides, visceral fat, total body fat) in participants 
				with type 2 diabetes. finally, in a two-month randomized, 
				double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 40 individuals with 
				type 2 diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease), daily curcumin 
				ingestion (66.3 mg) significantly reduced urinary concentrations 
				of proteins and inflammation markers (tgf-β, il-8), suggesting 
				that curcumin might be helpful with slowing the progression of 
				kidney damage and preventing kidney failure. the research on 
				curcumin suggests it can work as a hypoglycemic agentlowering 
				and helping control blood glucose (blood sugar) levels in people 
				with type 2 diabetes. this can ultimately prevent those with the 
				disease from developing other serious health complications 
				associated with diabetes, such as neuropathy (damage to the 
				nervous system) and nephropathy (kidney disease). a study 
				published in the journal biochemistry and biophysical research 
				community explored how curcumin might be valuable in treating 
				diabetes, finding that it activates ampk (which increases 
				glucose uptake) and suppresses gluconeogenic gene expression 
				(which suppresses glucose production in the liver) in hepatoma 
				cells. interestingly, they found curcumin to be 500 times to 
				100,000 times (in the form known as tetrahydrocurcuminoids(thc)) 
				more potent than metformin in activating ampk and its downstream 
				target acetyl-coa carboxylase. diabetic neuropathy is a type of 
				neuronal damage, associated with chronic diabetes, characterized 
				by demyelination and deterioration of nerve fibers, alterations 
				in the micro- vasculature and loss of sensory fibers that leads 
				to pain, foot ulcers, amputations, depression, phobias, 
				anorexia, loss of memory and reduction in complex reasoning 
				skills (patel and udayabanu 2013). 
















curcumin 
				treatment (50 mg/kg, for 8 weeks) upregulated bdnf in frontal 
				cortex and hippocampus alongside reduced oxidative damage in the 
				hippocampus of diabetic db/db mice (franco-robles et al. 2014). 
				curcumin administration significantly increased na (þ) -k (þ) 
				-atp activity, reduced lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity and 
				lactic acid content as well as stimulates ca (þ) -mg (þ) -atp 
				activity in brain homogenate of alloxan induced diabetic mice. 
				in addition, curcumin administration ameliorated energy 
				metabolism in the brain homogenate of diabetic mice (miao, 
				cheng, and li 2015). curcumin administration (60 mg/kg, p.o., 
				for two weeks) downregulated the expression of glucose 
				transporter (glut) type 3, muscarinic receptor type 3, 
				a7-nicotinic receptor and ache in brain- stem and cortex of 
				streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. in addition, it reduced 
				the expression level of insulin receptor and choline 
				acetyltransferase in brainstem. curcumin treatment upregulated 
				the gene expression of choline acetyltransferase, sod and 
				insulin receptor in cortex. it is known to upregulate the 
				expression level of muscarinic cholinergic receptor 1 in 
				brainstem and cerebral cortex (kumar et al. 2013) as well as 
				attenuate cognitive deficits in streptozotocin induced diabetic 
				rats (kumar et al. 2011). curcumin treatment (60 mg/kg, p.o., 
				for 15 days) downregulated the expression level of dopaminergic 
				d1 and d2 receptor in the cortex. in addition, curcumin 
				administration significantly upregulated dopaminergic d1 
				receptor and downregulated d2 receptor in the cerebellum of 
				diabetic rodents. curcumin treatment upregulated phospholipase c 
				and transcription factor camp response element-binding protein 
				expression in the cerebellum and cortex of streptozotocin 
				induced diabetic rats resulting in amelioration of emotional 
				and cognitive performance (kumar et al. 2010). curcumin 
				administration (60 mg/kg, p.o., for 16 days) upregulated the 
				glutamate decarboxylase while downregulated bax, caspase 3 and 
				caspase 8 expressions in the cerebral cortex. in addition, 
				curcumin administration attenuated nmda and ampa receptor 
				mediated oxidative stress and excitotoxicity in the cerebral 
				cortex of streptozotocin induced diabetic rats (jayanarayanan et 
				al. 2013). curcumin supplemented (0.5%) with animals diet 
				decreased b-d-glucuronidase activity (chougala et al. 2012), 
				nitric oxide level, total oxidant status, mda level and 
				oxidative stress index. diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to 
				as diabetes, is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by 
				hyperglycemia, glycosuria, negative nitrogen balance, polydipsia 
				and sometimes ketonemia. in a randomized, double-blind, 
				placebo-controlled trial, oral curcumin extract supplementation 
				(three capsules per day, each curcumin capsule has curcuminoid 
				content of 250 mg) for nine months ameliorated b-cell function, 
				lowered c-peptide and increased homeostasis model assessment-b, 
				reduced insulin resistance and increased the adiponectin level 
				in type 2 diabetic subjects as compared to placebo group 
				(chuengsamarn et al. 2012). in another clinical study, curcumin 
				administration lowered the level of hba1c and fasting blood 
				glucose as well as partially reduced ldl-cholesterol and body 
				mass index in diabetic subjects (rahimi et al. 2016). a recent 
				meta-analysis revealed that, curcumin or combined curcuminoids 
				supplementation effectively lowered the level of fasting blood 
				glucose in individuals with some degree of dysglycemia. in 
				addition, isolated curcumin supplementation significantly 
				decreased hba1c as compared to placebo and suggested its 
				beneficial role as adjuvant in the treatment of dysglycemic 
				patients (de melo, dos santos, and bueno 2018). in animal study, 
				curcumin administration is reported to reduce glucose 
				intolerance through induction of glucagon-like peptide-1 
				secretion. in addition, curcumin administration is known to 
				reduce insulin resistance by downregulating phosphorylation of 
				irs-1 serine residue and upregulating phosphorylation of irs-1 
				tyrosine in the skeletal muscle of rats fed with high fructose. 
				curcumin treatment also reduced glucose intolerance, 
				hyperinsulinemia and homeostasis model assessment-insulin 
				resistance (homa-ir) level. curcumin treatment decreased c 
				reactive protein and tnf-levels besides downregulated the 
				protein kinase theta (pkch) and cox-2 protein expressions. 
				additionally, curcumin significantly downregulated extracellular 
				kinase 1/2 (erk 1/2) and p38 protein expressions in skeletal 
				muscle. further, curcumin treatment ameliorated the activity of 
				gpx and attenuated the activation of inflammatory cascades 
				(maithilikarpagaselvi et al. 2016). curcumin treatment 
				significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, ldl-cholesterol, 
				triglycerides, aspartate transaminase (ast), alanine 
				transaminase (alt), total cholesterol, glycemia, total oxidative 
				status, mda and nitrative stress. a recent study demonstrated 
				that, curcumin administration (100 mg/kg, p.o., daily for 8 
				weeks) attenuated splenic damage and improved immunity in 
				streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats via antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms  (rashid et 
				al. 2017). curcumin treatment is known to attenuate diabetes and 
				its associated complications like liver disease, adipocyte 
				dysfunctions, pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, vascular 
				dysfunction, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy etc. (zhang et 
				al. 2013b). in cell culture studies, curcumin treatment 
				suppressed palmitate-mediated insulin resistance, inhibited the 
				ubiquitin-proteasome system, reduced the endoplasmic reticulum 
				(er) protein aggregation and activated the autophagy signaling 
				in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ye et al. 2017). the 
				suggested anti-diabetic mechanisms of curcumin effects are 
				ameliorating b-cell dysfunction, insulin signaling, glucagon 
				like peptide-1 secretion, and reducing glucose intolerance, 
				hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, homa-ir level, hyperlipidemia, 
				islet apoptosis and necrosis etc. therefore, these finding 
				demonstrate that curcumin supplementation in diabetic population 
				may be beneficial.


how may curcumin work against 
				cancer?
















curcumin, 
				particularly noted for its high content of bioactive metabolites 
				like curcumin, demonstrates significant anticancer properties by 
				modulating key molecular signaling pathways, leading to 
				apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis {sultana et 
				al., 2021). studies suggest that curcumin may have 
				antimetastatic, antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory 
				effects that contribute to suppressing the growth and spread of 
				cancer cells. furthermore, curcuma longae rhizoma metabolites 
				inhibit angiogenesis, a critical process for tumor growth and 
				metastasis, by interfering with angiogenic factors such as vegf 
				and bfgf (zhang y. et al., 
				2021). in recent years, in-depth studies of cancer progression 
				have revealed that curcumin suppresses tumors by interfering 
				with all aspects of tumor progression, which is the action of 
				some of the most promising anticancer drugs. curcumin has 
				promising potential as an anticancer and antimetastatic agent, 
				with anticancer activity demonstrated in various cancers. the 
				efficacy of curcumin on cancer cells is due to its multitarget 
				mechanism. known targets of curcumin include several 
				transcription factors related to cell survival and proliferation 
				(e.g., nf-κb (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of 
				activated b cells), ap-1 (activator protein 1), stat3 (signal 
				transducer and activator of transcription 3), ppar-γ (peroxisome 
				proliferator-activated receptor gamma)), factors related to 
				metastasis and angiogenesis (e.g., vegf (vascular endothelial 
				growth factor), icam-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), 
				cox-2 (cyclooxygenase-2), mmp-9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9)), 
				receptors and kinases (e.g., egfr (epidermal growth factor 
				receptor) and erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), jak 
				(janus kinase), akt (protein kinase b)), and cytokines (e.g., 
				tnf-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha), il-1β (interleukin-1 beta), 
				il-6 (interleukin-6) and mip (macrophage inflammatory protein)). 
				in the present time, many authors have reported that curcumin 
				and other curcuminoids display potent antitumor and 
				antimetastatic effect in the various types of cancer such as 
				lung, breast, prostate or colorectal cancers. in the dependence 
				of cancer type and experimental conditions, curcumin can 
				directly repress growth of primary tumor, decrease migration of 
				tumor cells, stimulate antitumor immune response, positively 
				modulate gut microflora and target tumor microbiota. more 
				importantly curcumin (including clinical trials) generally 
				displays a positive effect on the usually used anticancer 
				regiments. curcumin can influence several important signaling 
				pathways that are associated with the development and 
				progression of tumors. one of the major signaling pathways that 
				curcumin affects is nf-κb, which is associated with 
				inflammation, tumor growth and resistance to therapy. it has 
				been shown that curcumin can inhibit nf-κb activation, thereby 
				suppressing the growth and spread of cancer cells. in an in 
				vitro study performed on hnc cell lines, curcumin was found to 
				downregulate the nf-κb pathway and thus inhibit tumor cell 
				proliferation.  another important signaling pathway 
				affected by curcumin is the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway, which is 
				associated with cell survival, growth, and migration. inhibition 
				of this pathway may also contribute to the suppression of cancer 
				cell growth and spread. furthermore, it has been found that 
				curcumin can inhibit the migration and invasion of head and neck 
				tumors and can influence several key processes associated with 
				metastasis. this reduces the ability of cancer cells to 
				penetrate into surrounding tissues and spread to distant sites 
				in the body.  curcumin is also capable of affecting various 
				pathways associated with cell migration, such as emt, which is 
				associated with increased migration of cancer cells. curcumin 
				modulates the expression of emt markers (snail, e-cadherin) and 
				induces the expression of p53, which is important for emt 
				repression. the effect of curcumin in combination with 
				conventional therapies has also been investigated and it has 
				been found that curcumin can increase the sensitivity of cancer 
				cells to these conventional therapies, e.g., chemotherapy and 
				radiotherapy, suggesting that it could be used as an adjuvant 
				therapy to improve existing treatments. the synergistic effect 
				of curcumin and cisplatin was demonstrated, and their 
				combination led to inhibition of ikkβ and enhanced growth 
				suppression. in addition to 
				these direct actions against cancer cells, curcumins 
				anti-inflammatory effects play a crucial role in its anticancer 
				activity and it reduces the inflammatory environment that can 
				foster cancer progression (xu et al., 2020). moreover, curcumin 
				influences epigenetic changes, potentially reversing aberrant 
				methylation patterns in cancer cells to restore normal cell 
				functions (fabianowska-majewska et al., 2021). the promising 
				results from preclinical studies suggest that curcumin could be 
				a potent, non-toxic adjunct to existing cancer therapies, 
				deserving further exploration and clinical testing to harness 
				its full potential (sultana et al., 2021). additionally, curcumin downregulates ap-1, which is 
				associated with anti-apoptotic proteins, promoting cancer cell 
				death. by targeting the il-6/stat3 pathway, curcumin disrupts 
				oncogenic signaling, further inhibiting tumorigenesis. these 
				mechanisms underscore curcumins dual role as an 
				anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic agent, enhancing its 
				potential as both a standalone and adjunctive therapy across 
				various cancer types, including pancreatic, prostate, breast, 
				oral, lung, colorectal cancers, and multiple myeloma. at the root of cancer 
				progression, curcumin has been shown to elevate the 
				ubiquitination level of taz that increases proteasome-degrading 
				taz protein, thereby activating the hippo pathway and negatively 
				regulating cancer stem cell function. additionally, curcumin 
				significantly impedes the self-healing of circulating cancer 
				stem cells, limiting stem cell metastasis. curcumin also alters 
				the expression of more than 700 genes linked to carcinoma 
				development, such as those involved in dna recovery or 
				associated with the cell cycle, cell proliferation, or 
				metastasis in nci-h460 human lung cancer cells. researchers 
				revealed that curcumin not only changes the expression of many 
				genes, but also alters signaling pathways. through further 
				investigation, it was found that those curcumin-altered genes 
				induce cell death and control extracellular matrix receptors, 
				repressing nsclc cell proliferation and migration. these 
				observations indicate that curcumin governs nsclc tumor growth 
				and exhibits cytotoxic mechanisms at the genetic level. curcumin 
				possesses various biological activities, such as anticancer 
				effects on various cancers, such as breast, liver, lung, gastric 
				and prostate cancers. the anticancer effects of curcumin have 
				been extensively studied in different cancers, such as breast, 
				lung, colorectal, head and neck, gastric, bladder, prostate, 
				thyroid, liver, ovarian, oral, pancreatic, cervical, tongue and 
				brain cancers. because of its multitargeting activities, curcumin 
				has exhibited activities against numerous cancer types in human 
				clinical trials. studies have demonstrated that curcumin can 
				suppress the proliferation of cancer cells by interfering with 
				the cell cycle. specifically, it induces cell cycle arrest at 
				the g2/m phase in several cancer types, modulating the level of 
				cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and cyclins through the 
				increased expression of cdk inhibitors. furthermore, curcumin 
				induces apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. 
				curcumin enhances the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins such 
				as bax, bak, puma, bim, and noxa and death receptors such as 
				trail-r1/dr4 and trail-r2/dr5. in addition, curcumin decreases 
				the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins like bcl-2, bcl-xl, survin, 
				and xiap. this shift in the balance of apoptotic regulators 
				facilitates the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and 
				activates caspases, leading to programmed cell death. curcumin, 
				a polyphenolic compound derived from turmeric, exerts its 
				anticancer effects through multiple mechanisms. these include 
				the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of 
				apoptosis via cell cycle arrest and the modulation of apoptotic 
				proteins. curcumin suppresses the activity of key transcription 
				factors like nf-κb, stat3, and ap-1 and interferes with critical 
				signal transduction pathways such as pi3k/akt/mtor and mapk/erk. 
				additionally, curcumin inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis by 
				downregulating vegf, vegfr2, and matrix metalloproteinases 
				(mmps). epigenetic modifications through the inhibition of dna 
				methyltransferases (dnmts) and histone deacetylases (hdacs) 
				further contribute to its anticancer properties. finally, 
				curcumin alters mitochondrial energy metabolism and reduces 
				oxidative stress by inhibiting fof1-atp synthase, thereby 
				impacting atp production and reactive oxygen species (ros) 
				generation, which are crucial for cancer cell growth and 
				proliferation. curcumins anticancer efficacy is also attributed 
				to its ability to inhibit nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb), a 
				transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in cancer cell 
				survival, proliferation, and metastasis. nf-κb is often 
				constitutively active in various cancers, promoting the 
				expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell survival, and 
				angiogenesis. curcumin suppresses nf-κb activation by inhibiting 
				iκb kinase (ikk), thereby preventing the phosphorylation and 
				degradation of iκbα, an inhibitor of nf-κb, and reducing the 
				transcription of nf-κb target. in addition to nf-κb, curcumin 
				also modulates other transcription factors such as stat3 and 
				ap-1. by inhibiting these factors, curcumin reduces the 
				expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, 
				contributing to its anticancer properties. curcumins impact on 
				various signal transduction pathways further elucidates its 
				multifaceted anticancer effects. it has been shown to interfere 
				with the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway, a critical signaling axis for 
				cell growth and survival. curcumin inhibits the phosphorylation 
				of akt, leading to the suppression of downstream targets 
				involved in cell proliferation and survival. additionally, 
				curcumin affects the mapk/erk pathway, which is implicated in 
				cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. by 
				inhibiting this pathway, curcumin can reduce cancer cell growth 
				and induce apoptosis. curcumin also exerts anti-angiogenic and 
				anti-metastatic effects, which are crucial for limiting tumor 
				growth and spread. curcumin inhibits angiogenesis by 
				downregulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth 
				factor (vegf) and its receptor vegfr2. this inhibition prevents 
				the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, thereby 
				reducing blood vessel formation. moreover, curcumin inhibits 
				metastasis by modulating the expression of matrix 
				metalloproteinases (mmps), enzymes involved in the degradation 
				of the extracellular matrix, a key step in cancer cell invasion 
				and metastasis. curcumin downregulates mmp-2 and mmp-9, thereby 
				impairing the invasive capabilities of cancer cells. also, it 
				inhibits the chemokine cxcl12/cxcr4 axis, whose activation is 
				involved in tumor epithelialmesenchymal transition (emt), 
				cancer cell motility, and metastasis. emerging evidence suggests 
				that curcumin can also exert its anticancer effects through 
				epigenetic modifications. these modifications include the 
				inhibition of dna methyltransferases (dnmts) and histone 
				deacetylases (hdacs), which play a role in gene expression 
				regulation. by modulating these epigenetic factors, curcumin can 
				reactivate tumor suppressor genes and inhibit oncogenes, 
				contributing to its anticancer activity. although the energy 
				metabolism of cancer cells appears to be supported more by 
				anaerobic glycolysis (the warburg effect), mitochondria play a 
				pivotal role in cancer cell physiology, driving both energy 
				production and the biosynthetic processes essential for rapid 
				proliferation. several studies reported that cancer cells often 
				exhibit altered mitochondrial function, characterized by 
				enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) and increased 
				mitochondrial biogenesis. these adaptations support the high 
				metabolic demands of tumorigenesis, since mitochondrial function 
				reprogramming can confer resistance to chemotherapy and 
				contribute to metastatic potential. beyond energy production, 
				mitochondria play a pivotal role in cancer cell growth and 
				proliferation, primarily through the generation of reactive 
				oxygen species (ros). a mild ros concentration induces the 
				activation of signaling pathways such as mapk, pi3k/akt, and 
				nf-κb, which are involved in cell proliferation and survival. 
				moreover, oxidative stress can induce the expression of growth 
				factors and cytokines, enhancing tumor progression and 
				metastasis. in this scenario, curcumin appears to be one of the 
				most promising molecules to modulate oxphos activity and the 
				related oxidative stress production. the literature reports that 
				curcumin directly inhibits the activity of fof1 -atp synthase 
				(atp synthase), as it binds to the f1 moiety through its 
				4′hydroxy groups and a β-diketone, reducing the available energy 
				to support the proliferation and growth of cancer cells. in 
				addition, atp synthase inhibition not only impacts atp 
				production but also modulates oxidative damage. in coupling 
				conditions, atp synthase reduction slows down electron transport 
				chain (etc) function and the relative ros production, switching 
				off the proliferation signaling associated with the pro-oxidant 
				environment. by contrast, when mitochondria are damaged, 
				curcumin concurs with the oxidative stress increment. probably the first indication of curcumins 
				anticancer activities in human participants was shownby 
				kuttan and co-workers, who conducted a clinical trial involving 
				62 patients with external cancerous lesions. curcumin was found 
				to produce remarkable symptomatic relief as evidenced by 
				reductions in smell, itching, lesion size, and pain. kuttan and 
				his colleagues work was the first to demonstrate curcumins 
				anti-cancer potential in both in vitro and in vivo experimental 
				models (kuttan et al., 1985). curcumin activates dna damage 
				response, laying the foundation for the therapeutic use of these 
				nutraceuticals in prostate cancer chemoprevention (horie, 2012). 
				the general anti-carcinogenic effect of curcumin involves 
				mechanisms like induction of apoptosis and inhibition of 
				cell-cycle progression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (chen 
				and huang, 1998). the antiproliferative effect is regulated 
				partly through hindrance of protein tyrosine kinase activity and 
				c-myc mrna expression, while the apoptotic effect may partly be 
				mediated via preventing the functioning of protein tyrosine 
				kinase, protein kinase c, and expressions of c-myc mrna and 
				bcl-2 mrna (chen and huang, 1998). curcumin inhibits the 
				transcription factor nf-κb (figure 6) and various downstream 
				gene products like c-myc, bcl-2, cox-2, nitric oxide synthase 
				(nos), cyclin d1, tnf-α, ils, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 
				(mmp-9) and has anti-proliferative activities in a diversity of 
				malignancies. curcumin, either alone or in combination with other agents, has 
				demonstrated potential against colorectal cancer, pancreatic 
				cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, lung 
				cancer, oral cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. curcumin was found to exert its anticancer activities 
	in many different types of cancer cells by regulating a variety of signaling 
	pathways.  curcumin induces cell death in numerous animal and human 
				cell lines, including leukemia, melanoma, and carcinomas of the 
				breast, lung, colon, kidney, ovaries and liver. it appears to 
				function by caspase­dependent and independent (mitochondrial) 
				mechanisms, which are associated with the presence and absence 
				of p53. curcumin has been studied as a beneficial herb in cancer 
				treatment and been found to affect cancer growth, development 
				and spread at the molecular level. studies have shown that it 
				can contribute to the death of cancerous cells and reduce 
				angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels in tumors) and 
				metastasis (spread of cancer). multiple studies indicate that 
				curcumin can reduce the growth of cancerous cells in the 
				laboratory and inhibit the growth of tumors in test animals. 
				there is also evidence that it may prevent cancer from occurring 
				in the first place, especially cancers of the digestive system 
				like colorectal cancer.
 curcumin is capable of inhibiting the growth 
				of cancer cells in skin, oral, intestinal, and colon cancers. 
				animal models show that not only does curcumin block growth of 
				cancer cells in these models, but it also increases the number 
				of cancer-fighting enzymes in the system.  a 2011 study 
				works to quantify the prohibitive properties of curcumin on 
				cancer cells in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. this 
				type of cancer is the 6th most commonly-diagnosed cancer in the 
				united states. that study showed curcumin not only works as a 
				treatment for squamous cell carcinomas with incredibly promising 
				results, but it has also been shown to demonstrate powerful 
				anti-cancer properties. part of the excitement surrounding the 
				potential anti-cancer benefits of curcumin revolves around the 
				safety of use of the compound. it is considered 
				pharmacologically safe, which means there are no known drug 
				interactions or specific reactions among patients, making it 
				extremely well-tolerated. for more evidence that turmeric with 
				curcumin in particular being a powerful anti-cancer compound, we 
				need only look at the rates of cancer in parts of the world 
				where turmeric is consumed in higher quantities. over the years, cancer research has 
				examined the role curcumin plays in treating this disease. 
				curcumin is antimutagenic as it potentially helps to prevent new 
				cancers that are caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy 
				used to treat existing cancers. it effectively inhibits 
				metastasis (uncontrolled spread) of melanoma (skin cancer) cells 
				and may be especially useful in deactivating the carcinogens in 
				cigarette smoke and chewing tobacco. curcumin generates an 
				anticancer effect by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb), 
				and also reduces the formation of glycation end products which 
				induce inflammation. curcumin also mediates anticancer activity 
				by targeting many other enzymes/pathways, maintaining levels of 
				vitamins c and e, preventing peroxidation of lipid, and dna 
				damage. curcumin targets transformed cells without altering 
				primary astrocytes. it also promotes apoptosis, and shows a 
				synergistic effect in combination cisplatin and doxorubicin 
				drugs. an active constituent of turmeric suppresses 
				carcinogenesis in multiple human carcinomas, which include 
				ovarian cancers, stomach cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, 
				head and neck cancer. curcumin suppresses the carcinogenesis by 
				targeting diverse molecular targets of cellular division and 
				apoptosis. the beneficial effects of curcumin on various 
				transcription factors, oncogenes, and signalling proteins are 
				well known. it also targets various stages of carcinogenesis 
				from the initial stage to tumorigenesis, growth, invasion, and 
				metastasis. animal studies involving rats and mice as well as in 
				vitro studies utilizing human cell lines have demonstrated 
				curcumin's ability to inhibit carcinogenesis at three stages: 
				tumor promotion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. in two studies 
				of colon and prostate cancer, curcumin inhibited cell 
				proliferation and tumor growth. the anticarcinogenic effects of 
				turmeric and curcumin are due to direct antioxidant and 
				free-radical scavenging effects and their ability to indirectly 
				increase glutathione levels, thereby aiding in hepatic 
				detoxification of mutagens and carcinogens and in inhibiting 
				nitrosamine formation. a number of laboratory studies on cancer 
				cells have shown that curcumin does have anticancer effects. 
				these studies have found that curcumin can significantly inhibit 
				the growth, development and movement of cancer throughout the 
				body. it seems to be able to kill cancer cells and prevent more 
				from growing. it has the best effects on breast cancer, bowel 
				cancer, stomach cancer and skin cancer cells. an american study 
				that combined curcumin with chemotherapy to treat bowel cancer 
				cells in a laboratory showed that the combined treatment killed 
				more cancer cells than the chemotherapy alone. another american 
				study seemed to show that curcumin helped to stop the spread of 
				breast cancer cells to other parts of the body. doctors think 
				that curcumin stays in the digestive system and is absorbed by 
				the cells in the bowel. several studies have shown that curcumin 
				taken as capsules does get absorbed by the gut and is present in 
				the blood. one of the mechanisms by which it does this is 
				reducing the growth of new blood vessels in tumors (otherwise 
				known as angiogenesis) and can also directly contribute to the 
				death of cancerous cells. scientists discovered that turmeric is 
				effective in killing cancer cells and also preventing their 
				growth. according to the american cancer society, tests indicate 
				that curcumin "interferes with several important molecular 
				pathways involved in cancer development, growth and spread" and 
				has boosted the effects of chemotherapy in animals. curcumin has 
				the potential for treatment of cancers including colon, breast, 
				prostate, lung, skin and bowel. curcumin shows a strong ability 
				to kill cancer cells as well as inhibit their growth, boost 
				antioxidant levels and balance the immune system. it seems to 
				work on improving mitochondrial function at a cellular level. 
				even against drug-resistant strains of leukemia, curcumin caused 
				cell death of cancer cells. curcumin has been shown to 
				substitute chemotherapy for colorectal cancers, and in 
				multidrug resistant cancers. the ability of curcumin to regulate 
				a variety of signaling pathways involved in cell growth, 
				apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis in preclinical 
				studies elicited scientific interest in its potential as an 
				anticancer agent in tumor therapy. curcumin is one of the most 
				powerful and promising chemopreventive and anticancer agents, 
				and epidemiological evidence demonstrates that people who 
				incorporate high doses of this spice in their diets have a lower 
				incidence of cancer. curcumin's epigenetic modulation has been 
				studied by the us national cancer institute (nci) and academic 
				investigators around the world. because of low toxicity and 
				great efficacy in multiple in vitro and in vivo cancer models, 
				curcumin was selected for further development, put through 
				extensive toxicology testing and has successively made it 
				through the first stages (phase i) of clinical testing abroad 
				and is currently in clinical trials at several sites in the u.s. 
				a phase i clinical trial looked at giving curcumin to 25 
				patients with pre cancerous changes in different organs. this 
				study seemed to show that curcumin could stop the precancerous 
				changes becoming cancer. numerous mechanisms have been described 
				for the anticancer activity of curcumin. curcumin inhibits the 
				nf-b and stat3 signaling pathways, which play key-roles in the 
				development and progression of cancer. it inhibits a highly 
				expressed transcription factor sp-1 and its downstream genes, 
				including ephrin type-b receptor 2 precursor, hdac4, calmodulin 
				and adem10 which serve as an important mechanism to prevent 
				metastasis. curcumin enhances the expression of several 
				extracellular matrix components and inhibits the phosphorylation 
				of focal adhesion kinase (fak) and cd24 expression, thus 
				prevents cancer formation, migration and invasion (vallianou et 
				al. 2015; shi et al. 2001; zhou et al. 2013). in addition, the 
				potential mechanism of the anti-invasive effect of curcumin 
				includes downregulation of akt, egfr, cyclin d1, cmet and 
				upregulation of dnaj/heat shock protein (hsp) 40 chaperone. 
				recent studies revealed that er stress and autophagy might 
				involve in apoptosis process. mechanistically, autophagy 
				inhibition could increase curcumin induced apoptosis by inducing 
				er stress (vallianou et al. 2015). further, the anticancer 
				effects induced by phytoconstituent curcumin in malignant cells 
				are mediated via the modulation of multiple signaling pathways 
				and its effectors. curcumin induced anti-carcinogenic effects 
				includes down-regulation of the insulin-like growth factor 
				type-1 receptor (igf-1r), egfr/avian erythroblastosis oncogene 
				b1 (erbb1), erbb2/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
				(her2), wnt/b-catenin and sonic hedgehog/glioma associated 
				oncogene (shh/glis), and their respective downstream signaling 
				effectors. curcumin modulates intra-cellular signal transduction 
				elements such as p21, p27, inhibitor of growth family member 4 
				(ing4), cyclin d1, c- myc, vegf, icam-1, mmps, upa, cox-2, 
				cxcr-4, bax, bad, bak, noxa, p53, modulator of apoptosis, 
				caspases etc. resulting in reversal of cancer incidence, 
				progression and relapse (jordan et al. 2016; mimeault 
				and batra 2011; kasi et al. 2016). a2012 study 
				indicates that rates of colorectal cancer in india are among the 
				lowest in the developed world. another study from 2016 shows 
				that indian women are less likely to be diagnosed with breast 
				cancer, as well. part of the reason for the lowered cancer rates 
				in india has been attributed to diet, with turmeric and curcumin 
				being major dietary contributors in that part of the world.
				

				combining curcumin with anticancer 
				drugs like gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer, docetaxel in breast 
				cancer, and imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia may be safe and 
				well tolerated. a recent single-arm, phase ii trial combining 
				three cycles of docetaxel/prednisone and curcumin (6 g/day) was 
				carried out in 26 patients with castration-resistant prostate 
				cancer. the level of prostate-specific antigen (psa) was 
				decreased in most patients and was normalized in 36% of them, 
				and the co-administration of curcumin with drugs showed no 
				toxicity beyond adverse effects already related to docetaxel 
				monotherapy. many registered phase i/ii clinical trials designed 
				to investigate the effectiveness of curcumin alone or with 
				first-line treatment in patients with breast, prostate, 
				pancreatic, lung, or colorectal cancer are under way. research 
				into preventing cancer: a phase i clinical trial looked at 
				giving curcumin to 25 patients with pre-cancerous changes in 
				different organs. this study showed how curcumin could stop the 
				precancerous changes becoming cancer. a number of laboratory 
				studies on cancer cells have shown that curcumin does have 
				anticancer effects. it kills cancer cells and prevent more from 
				growing. it has the best effects on breast cancer, bowel cancer, 
				stomach cancer and skin cancer cells. a study that 
				combined curcumin with chemotherapy to treat bowel cancer cells 
				in a laboratory showed that the combined treatment killed more 
				cancer cells than the chemotherapy alone. an american study 
				in mice showed that curcumin helped to stop the spread of breast 
				cancer cells to other parts of the body. doctors think that 
				curcumin stays in the digestive system and is absorbed by the 
				cells in the bowel. several studies have shown that curcumin 
				taken as capsules does get absorbed by the gut and is present in 
				the blood. a number of activities of curcumin, which are exerted 
				in a chemopreventive and a directly therapeutic manner, indicate 
				that it may be a potential anticancer remedy. researchers at 
				m.d. anderson cancer center in houston, tx state that curcumin 
				has enormous potential to prevent and treat cancer. curcumin 
				was able to suppress tumor formation, growth, and even 
				metastasis according to their review. currently, there are 
				clinical trials being conducted on the effects of curcumin on 
				patients with bowel cancer. according to the american cancer 
				society, tests have shown that curcumin can kill cancer cells in 
				laboratory dishes, and also slow the growth of the surviving 
				cells. furthermore, it has been found to reduce the development 
				of several forms of cancer in lab animals, while also shrinking 
				various animal tumors. a review -
				
anticancer potential 
	of curcumin: preclinical and clinical studies - in anticancer research 
	concluded that, "it is quite apparent that curcumin has tremendous 
	potential for prevention and therapy of various cancers." another study on
				
the role of curcumin in cancer therapy 
				found that,  curcumin is a potent anti-inflammatory agent 
	with strong therapeutic potential against a variety of cancers. curcumin has 
	been shown to suppress transformation, proliferation and metastasis of 
	tumors, and called for additional and larger controlled studies to 
	determine its full potential. inhibition of proliferation
of tumor cells, induction of apoptosis (a mode of cell death), inhibition of
transformation of cells from normal to tumor, inhibition of invasion and
metastasis and suppression of inflammation have been linked with the 
activity of curcumin. resistance to chemo and radiotherapy is the major reason 
				for cancer relapse. this arises due to the presence of a 
				subpopulation of cancer cells, having self-renewal capabilities 
				called cancer stem cells (cscs). studies have confirmed that 
				curcumin could inhibit the breast cancer stem cell population by 
				downregulating the expression of stem cell genes oct4, sox2 and 
				nanog and also the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) as 
				observed by the down-regulation of mrna levels of vimentin, 
				fibronectin and β-catenin and up-regulation of mrna levels of 
				e-cadherin (hu et al., 2019). a combination of sub-optimal dose 
				of 5-fu and curcumin elicits synergistic antitumor potential in 
				murine models as evaluated by a reduction in the tumor-related 
				parameters. mechanistically, curcumin down-regulates 5-fu 
				induced up-regulation of thymidylate synthase (ts), which is 
				responsible for 5-fu chemoresistance (vinod et al., 2013; 
				haritha et al., 2021). another study reported that cervical 
				cancer cells can be sensitized by curcumin to paclitaxel-induced 
				apoptosis through down-regulation of nf-κb, akt and bcl2 (bava 
				et al., 2011). the chemopreventive agent curcumin also act as a 
				potent radiosensitizer in human cervical tumor cells. curcumin 
				pre-treatment increased reactive oxygen species production and 
				overactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway 
				in hela and siha cells when treated with ionising radiation (javvadi 
				et al., 2008).  mechanism of action of curcumin mainly 
				involves down-regulation of transcription factor nf-κb by 
				inhibition of notch signalling, which is involved in cell 
				proliferation, apoptosis, maintenance of stem cell and their 
				renewal. this results in a reduction in expression of nf-κb 
				regulated genes, which includes bcl-2, cyclin d1 and vegf (oriordan 
				et al., 2005). curcumin is a strong inhibitor of protein kinase 
				c (pkc) and several oncogenes such as c-jun, c-fos, c-myc, nik, 
				mapks, erk, elk, pi3k, akt and cdks. curcumin also inhibits of 
				the notch-1 downstream target hes-1 in esophageal cancer cells. 
				hes-1 is an important notch signalling target and mediator (subramaniam 
				et al., 2012). the curcumin analog, 2-pyridylcyclohexanone has 
				also been shown to decreases basal stat3 phosphorylation and 
				promotes apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell, escc cells (wang 
				et al., 2018). curcumin quenches free radicals, induces 
				antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione 
				peroxidase), and up-regulates antioxidative protein markers, 
				nrf2 and ho-1 that led to the suppression of cellular oxidative 
				stress. in cancer cells, curcumin aggressively increases ros 
				that results in dna damage and subsequently cancer cell death (ak 
				and gülçin 2008). curcumin was found to suppress inflammatory 
				cytokines such as il-6, il-8, granulocyte macrophage colony 
				stimulating factor and tnf-α as well as ikkβ kinase in the 
				saliva of hnscc patients. kim sg., et al., also suggested that 
				ikkβ kinase could be a plausible biomarker for the detection of 
				the effect of curcumin in head and neck cancer as curcumin 
				inhibited ikkβ kinase activity and this resulted in the reduced 
				expression of a number of cytokines (kim et al., 2011). 
				molecular docking studies further aids in identifying the role 
				of curcumin in numerous signalling cascades involved in 
				carcinogenesis and confirms the already suggested molecular 
				mechansims responsible for the chemopreventive efficacy of 
				curcumin. using inverse molecular docking several proteins 
				associated with cell proliferation and tumor formation namely, 
				macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 receptor, aldo-keto 
				reductase family 1 member c3, amiloride-sensitive amine oxidase 
				and tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 were 
				identified as potential targets of curcumin. curcumin was 
				previously reported to inhibit the nfkb mediated activation of 
				genes linked to cell survival and proliferation (divya and 
				pillai 2006). proteins such as mmp-2, nad-dependent protein 
				deacetylase sirtuin-2, core histone macro-h2a.1, nad-dependent 
				protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 and epidermal growth factor 
				receptor were also revealed to be targets of curcumin, the 
				binding of which regulates the activity of nf-kb (furlan et al., 
				2018). these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the 
				anticancer effects of curcumin. targeting phosphodiesterase 4 
				(pde4) has been reported to be a potential therapeutic strategy 
				against inflammatory disorders (i sakkas et al., 2017). studies 
				suggest that curcumin may exhibit its anti-cancer property 
				through the inhibition of pde2 and pde4 (abusnina et al., 2015). 
				furlan et al. also gives evidences for the inhibitory effect of 
				curcumin on pde4 (furlan and bren 2021).
curcumin as an anti-inflammatory 
				| it has been observed 
				that chronic inflammation is responsible for several diseases, 
				such as tumor progression, autoimmunity, allergies, and 
				arthritic syndromes. numerous researches revealed that curcumin 
				can decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ifn-γ, tnf-α, 
				il-1, and il-8 by interfering with several signaling and 
				transcription factors such as nf-кb, jaks/stats, and mapk 
				pathways (64). the anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin mainly 
				depends on its potentiality to inhibit nf-kβ activation. 
				curcumin inhibits inflammation by downregulating cytokines, 
				il-1, il-8, and tnf-α. curcumin blocks tnf-mediated nf-кb 
				activation in human myeloid ml-1a cells by suppressing activator 
				proteins. curcumin also blocks nf-кb activation by hydrogen 
				peroxide and phorbol esters. il-1β-mediated icam-1 and il-8 gene 
				expression are also inhibited by curcumin, which finally leads 
				to the inhibition of nf-кb activation. jak/stat is an important 
				signaling pathway in maintaining inflammation in immune cells. 
				it transduces signal type 1 and 2 cytokine receptors in response 
				to pro-inflammatory cytokines. curcumin inhibits jak/stat 
				pathway by blocking the phosphorylation of jak-1 and -2 and 
				stat-1 and -2 in ifn-γ, gangliosides, and lps-activated 
				microglial cells. curcumin has a distinct role in the 
				inflammatory mapk pathway. curcumin significantly lowers the 
				pge2 (prostaglandin e2) level and the expression of tnf-α and 
				il-6 by preventing phosphorylation and activation of p38 mapk 
				functioning. curcumin can suppress lps-induced phosphorylation 
				of p38, jnk, and erk1/2-mediated mapks pathways and subsequently 
				inhibit the ros production by microglial cells (70). kim et al. 
				validated that if immature dcs cells pre-treated with curcumin, 
				it blocked the lps-induced maturation function of dcs by 
				preventing phosphorylation of p38-, jnk-, and erk1-/2-mediated 
				mapk signaling, which consequently checks the inflammation 
				occurrence .it is well 
				known that the human body is capable of self-healing after a 
				short-term inflammatory response, but long-term chronic 
				inflammation could lead to initiation of the cancer process. 
				many studies have shown that inflammatory factors (including 
				interleukins, tnf-α, nf-ϰb) and the ros production-induced 
				inflammation infiltrate the inflammatory microenvironment 
				leading to dna damages and ultimately initiation of cancer. by 
				acting on several signaling pathways, especially the 
				wnt/β-catenin pathway, curcumin can have anticancer effect by 
				inhibiting chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. the 
				chronic inflammatory microenvironment of tumors could also be 
				targeted by curcumin. immunomodulatory 
				role of curcumin | curcumin can inhibit the expansion of t 
				cells triggered by plant lectin concanavalin a (con a), 
				according to a report on the role of the genus curcuma and its 
				bioactive metabolites to control the immunological response. 
				curcumin inhibits lymphoma b-cell proliferation by lowering the 
				potency of c-myc, bcl-xl, and nf-κb. curcumin has also been 
				demonstrated to suppress the production of ros in macrophages. 
				curcumin also stimulates nk cell apoptosis by modulating the 
				nf-κb pathway and inhibiting bcl-xl and cyclin d. curcumin 
				inhibits il-1 and il-6 inflammatory cytokines such as from 
				lps-stimulated dendritic cells and suppresses the expressions of 
				cd80, cd86, and mhc class ii by dendritic cells. curcumin also 
				causes reduced lps-induced mapk activation and nf-κb p65 
				translocation in dendritic cells (nair et al., 2017) along with 
				impaired activation of th1 responses. curcumin significantly 
				suppressed the formation of il-6, il-8, tnf-α, and mcp-1 from 
				higher glucose-cultured monocytes, according to jain et al. 
				(2009). curcumin decreased nos activity and macrophages ability 
				to secrete nitric oxide (no). in the management of immune modulation, 
				curcumin treatment can promote the activation of immune 
				component cells, including reduce excessive activation of 
				inflammation and allergy, and enhance endogenic immune activity 
				to fight foreign pathogens or cancer cells. remarkably, curcumin 
				can suppress intracellular nf-κb, mapks, jaks/stats, β-catenin, 
				and the notch-1 pathway by regulating the expression and 
				secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il-1β, tnf-α, 
				il-2, il-6, il-10, which mediate inflammatory pathways. in the 
				managements of clinical treatment, curcumin can also be applied 
				to autoimmune diseases therapies, such as lupus erythematosus, 
				rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, etc. 
				curcumin treatment can restore cellular immune-reactive t cells 
				and assist the body to fight endogenous cancer cells and 
				exogenous pathogens. in vitro and in vivo data showed curcumin 
				can hinder cancer cell proliferation or cause cancer cell 
				apoptosis. curcumin as an immunomodulator interacts not 
				just with various cellular components, such as dcs, macrophages, 
				natural killer cells, and both b and t lymphocytes, but also 
				with modulatory molecules involved in the processes of 
				inflammation and cell proliferation with their downstream 
				signaling. in recent times, curcumin has gained the potential 
				therapeutic interest to cure neoplastic disease, because of its 
				significance as an anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative 
				substance. the anti-cancer properties of curcumin also modulate 
				several other signaling pathways involved in mutagenesis, 
				oncogene expression, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, 
				angiogenesis, and metastasis. the effectiveness of curcumin has 
				been proven in the restoration of cd4+ and cd8+ cells in the tme 
				and in directing th2 cytokine bias towards th1-type response 
				again. it increases th1-type immune responses and upregulates 
				ifn-γ mrna expression. curcumin effectively reduces treg cell 
				population and levels of il-10 and tgfβ. it also can reduce the 
				expression of ctla4 and foxp3 both at protein and mrna levels 
				(55). interestingly, curcumin has the potentiality to encounter 
				all six hallmarks of cancer cells and checks tumor outgrowth 
				in the host. hence, it is considered very interesting to 
				envision the role of curcumin concerning cancer immunotherapies 
				as an immunomodulator.effects of curcumin on immune 
				cells |  curcumin has the potentiality to 
				modulate the proliferation and activation of t cells. depending 
				on the dose, it can both suppress and induce the proliferation 
				of t cells. several studies reported that curcumin downregulates 
				the proliferation of t cells induced by concanavalin a (con a), 
				phytohemagglutinin (pha), and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate 
				(pma). tomita et al. reported that curcumin can suppress the 
				proliferation of htlv-1-infected t cells and primary atl cells 
				through cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. research 
				carried out by hussain et al. stated that in t cell acute 
				lymphoblastic leukemia, curcumin blocks constitutively activated 
				targets of pi3-kinase (akt, foxo, and gsk3) in t cells, which 
				lead to the inhibition of proliferation and induction of 
				caspase-dependent apoptosis. on b cell: curcumin prohibits the 
				proliferation of b-cell lymphoma cells via downregulation of 
				c-myc, bcl-xl, and nfκb activities. it also blocks epsteinbarr 
				virus (ebv)-induced immortalization of b-cells. on macrophage: 
				curcumin modulates macrophage activities, prevents generation of 
				ros in macrophages, and stimulates enhanced phagocytosis of 
				peritoneal macrophages in mice. on natural killer cell: curcumin 
				works against natural killer t cell lymphoma cell lines, where 
				it induces apoptosis by controlling the nfκb pathway and 
				suppression of bclxl, cyclin d1, etc.. on dc: curcumin can 
				reduce the expression of cd80, cd86, and class-ii antigens by 
				dcs. curcumin suppresses the release of inflammatory cytokines 
				like il-1β, il-6, and tnf-α from lps-stimulated dcs. curcumin 
				also modulates phosphorylation of mapk and nuclear translocation 
				of nfκb in dcs.curcumin as an anti-proliferative and 
				anti-metastatic substance | curcumin acts upon numerous 
				cell proliferation signaling pathways that are intensely 
				associated with cancer progression. curcumin inhibits nf-кb 
				signaling by suppressing iкb kinase activity. curcumin 
				suppresses the other proliferation signaling pathways, such as 
				pi3k, akt, mtor, ap1 (jun and fos), jnk, jak/stat, pkc, cmyc, 
				mapk, elk, cdks, inos, and wnt/β-catenin, which confirmed its 
				vital role in the prevention of cancer progression. cyclin d1, 
				the proto-oncogene that is highly expressed in several types of 
				cancer and acts in cell cycle progression and proliferation, is 
				also suppressed by curcumin. along with this, curcumin also 
				inhibits excessive tgfβ receptor signaling and egf- and 
				egfr-mediated signaling pathway and remarkably controls 
				epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and tumor 
				progression, respectively. a significant activity of the 
				telomerase enzyme has been observed in cancer cells, which 
				prevents telomere shortening and stimulates continuous cell 
				proliferation signaling. curcumin prevents human telomerase 
				(htert) activities and reduces htert-mrna expression that led to 
				telomere shortening. by targeting telomerase activities, 
				controlling replicative cell senescence and mortality, curcumin 
				ultimately controls the uncontrolled cell proliferation of 
				cancer cells. numerous studies have reported the incredible 
				potentiality of curcumin to inhibit cell migration, invasion, 
				and colony formation in vitro and decrease tumor growth and 
				metastasis in vivo. curcumin downgrades the expression of matrix 
				metalloprotease, ccrx4, cox2, elam1, and ecam1, which are 
				essential for metastasis. besides, curcumin also hampers the 
				functioning of slug, snail, fak, twist, and other essential 
				transcription factors that play a crucial role in the metastasis 
				process.curcumin as an apoptotic and anti-angiogenic 
				substance 
 curcumin has been suggested as an enhancer of apoptosis in 
				cancer cells. it has the ability to modulate a wide range of 
				signalling pathways involved in apoptosis resistance in cancer 
				cells. curcumin also triggers programmed cell death in colon 
				cancerous cells and inhibits micro-inflammation in the 
				gastrointestinal system linked to inflammatory bowel illnesses, 
				according to laboratory research (nita, 2003). okanlawon et al. 
				(2020) determine the influence of the inclusion of powdered c. 
				longa on carcass yield and intestinal increase in rabbit 
				production. farombi et al. (2007) explored the combined effects 
				of curcumin and kolaviron (a bioflavonoid extracted from 
				garcinia kola seeds) on dbp-induced testicular injury in rats. 
				curcumin treatment of mice infected with human prostate cancer 
				cells resulted in a lowered microvessel density, cell 
				proliferation, an improvement in apoptosis. endothelial cells 
				derived from bovine aorta exposed to curcumin (515 μm) under 
				normoxic (oxygen tensions within 1021%) or hypoxic (oxygen 
				tensions within 15%) conditions were reported to increase heme 
				oxygenase activity and resistance to oxidative stress. 
				consumption of alcohol sensitizes the pancreas to give an 
				inflammatory response through nf-κb activation via protein 
				kinase c epsilon. one pilot study concluded that an oral dosage 
				of 500 mg of curcumin with 5 mg of piperine could restore lipid 
				peroxidation in patients suffering from tropical pancreatitis (durgaprasad 
				et al., 2005).a common property for most cancer cells is 
				some mutations in tumor suppressor genes, especially p53 and 
				pten. mutations in these genes lead to them escaping cell death 
				and also resistance to therapy. curcumin has the ability to 
				reverse the activities of both p53 and pten. inhibition of 
				mir-21 has a key role in the activation of pten, leading to 
				inhibition of the pi3k/akt pathway. suppression of akt following 
				treatment with curcumin can cause degradation of mdm2, which 
				leads to activation of p53. furthermore, suppression of akt can 
				reduce the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as cox-2, 
				nf-κb and bcl-2. downregulation of these genes by curcumin has 
				shown its potential to sensitize a wide range of cancer cells to 
				chemotherapy and radiotherapy. in addition to the regulation of 
				a wide range of genes in cancer cells, curcumin has been shown 
				to modulate the tumor microenvironment in favor of tumor 
				suppression. inhibition of some immunosuppressive cells' 
				cytokines such as il-10 and tgf-β leads to more infiltration and 
				proliferation of nk cells and ctls as well as inhibition of 
				tumor-promoting cells including tams, cafs and tregs. these 
				immunoregulatory effects of curcumin lead to the release of dead 
				signals such as fasl and tnf-α for cancers. upregulation of fas, 
				tnfr and trail because of elevated ros production by cancer 
				cells can facilitate apoptosis pathways following treatment with 
				curcumin. curcumin blocks the 
				phosphorylation of another tumor suppressor protein, rb 
				(retinoblastoma), which plays a significant role in the cell 
				cycle process. curcumin induces both tp53-dependent and 
				-independent apoptosis of cancer cells by upregulating 
				pro-apoptotic molecules such as bax, bim, and puma and by 
				downregulating anti-apoptotic molecules like bcl2, bcl-xl, and 
				survivin. consequently, the caspase activity gets enhanced and 
				proceeds to apoptosis. besides, curcumin stimulates lysosomal 
				proteases, phosphatases, and lipase activities, which induce 
				autophagy-mediated cell death. blocking the angiogenesis process 
				is a vital step to control tumor outgrowth. curcumin suppresses 
				vegf receptor (vegfr1 and vegfr2) expression, blocks 
				vegf/vegfr-mediated signaling pathway, and downregulates 
				angiopoietin expression to confine angiogenesis. in vitro and in 
				vivo studies have indicated that curcumin prevents 
				carcinogenesis by affecting two primary processes: angiogenesis 
				and tumor growth. turmeric and curcuminoids influence tumor 
				angiogenesis through multiple, interdependent processes: i) 
				action at the level of transcription factors associated with 
				inflammatory processes and early growth response protein which 
				reduces the expression of il­8 in pancreatic and head and neck 
				cancer cell lines and prevents the induction of vegf synthesis; 
				ii) inhibition of angiogenesis mediated by no (nitric oxide) and 
				iii) inhibition of cox­2 and 5­lox; iv) action at the level of 
				angiogenic factors: vegf, the primary factor for migration, 
				sprouting, survival and proliferation during angiogenesis, and 
				basic fibroblast growth factor. because of its anti-apoptotic 
				and antiproliferative efficacy, its ability to interfere with 
				several tumor progression associated signaling pathways, and to 
				modulate tumor-associated mirna expression, curcumin is regarded 
				as antitumorigenic. in addition, curcumin prevents formation of 
				breast and prostate metastases in vivo. the review by 
				willenbacher et al. in this issue summarizes some papers that 
				have been published in the field of curcumins antitumorigenic 
				effects. curcumin is also potent against cancer types that are 
				difficult to treat, like melanoma or glioblastoma, as 
				demonstrated by the work of maiti et al. in this issue. an 
				american phase 2 study reported in 2008. 25 patients had 
				curcumin treatment and 21 had tumors that could be measured. in 
				2 patients their tumors shrank or remained stable. in some 
				patients their levels of particular immune system chemicals that 
				destroy cancer cells went up. curcumin also has been studied 
				with regards to the core inflammatory gene signal, 
				nf-kappab, resulting in a beneficial domino effect throughout the 
				body. one benefit of this domino effect is a direct reduction in 
				the risk of cancer from overweight-induced inflammation. 
				curcumin has been found to induce cell-cycle arrest and 
				apoptosis by regulating a variety of cell-signaling pathways (3, 
				41-45). for example, the inhibition of cell proliferation by 
				curcumin has been associated with the nrf2-dependent 
				downregulation of dna repair-specific flap endonuclease 1 (fen1) 
				in breast cancer cells in culture. curcumin has been shown to 
				induce p53-dependent or -independent apoptosis depending on the 
				cancer cell type. in a panel of cancer cell lines, 
				p53-independent apoptosis induced by curcumin was mediated by 
				the rapid increase of ros and the activation of mapk and c-jun 
				kinase (jnk) signaling cascades. inhibition of nf-κb signaling 
				by curcumin also suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis 
				in cancer cells.effect of curcumin on 
				chemoresitance | curcumin has a proven ability to 
				counter chemoresistance in cancer cells. the ability of curcumin 
				to modulate the regulatory networks governing the balance of 
				cell survival and induction of cell death is well established. 
				curcumin has been demonstrated to amend the expression of 
				molecules central to chemoresistance including members of the 
				abc drug efflux transporter family. curcumin modulates the 
				cancer metabolism and bio-physiological composition of the 
				extracellular milieu culminating in the induction of cell death 
				and retardation in disease progression. metabolic alterations 
				and suppression of receptor-mediated signaling were suggested to 
				provide chemosensitization of cancer cells by curcumin. the 
				previous investigation on hepatic carcinoma cells demonstrated 
				that curcumin can thwart lactate-induced chemoresistance. 
				interestingly, curcumin can be exploited to provide health 
				benefits in diabetes mellitus owing to its antioxidant and 
				anti-inflammatory capabilities. in renal tubular epithelial 
				cells, curcumin was also shown to obviate high glucose-induced 
				epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. high glucose conditions 
				can aggravate the invasion and migration, while curcumin can 
				impede the metastatic events in a variety of malignancies. 
				antineoplastic potential, metabolic modulatory ability, and 
				chemosensitizing property along with safety investigations 
				provide an edge to curcumin over other phytochemicals. curcumin 
				has the ability to avert high glucose-induced chemoresistance in 
				cancer cells. various aspects of the underlying mechanism were 
				also explored. curcumin mediated the amputation of 
				chemoresistance by repressing the hyperglycolytic behavior of 
				malignant cells via modulated expression of metabolic enzymes 
				(hkii, pfk1, gapdh, pkm2, ldh, sdh, idh, and fasn), transporters 
				(glut-1, mct-1, and mct-4), and their regulators. along altered 
				constitution of extracellular milieu, these molecular changes 
				culminated into improved drug accumulation, chromatin 
				condensation, and induction of cell death. molecular alterations 
				in the expression level of transcription factors (p53, hif-1α, 
				myc), drug efflux pumps (mdr-1), and their regulators (hcar-1, 
				mtor, and stat3) can be suggested as the underlying molecular 
				mechanism. this investigation contributed to the understanding 
				of the anticancer ability of curcumin through the prevention of 
				chemoresistance in hyperglycemic conditions along with 
				underlying mechanisms. the demonstrated potential of curcumin 
				against high glucose-induced chemoresistance will have 
				implementations in clinical management of malignancies in 
				diabetic patients.
				curcumin as an anti-tumor substance | the anti-tumour 
				activity of curcumin is mediated via anti-inflammatory, 
				apoptosis-inducing, anti-oxidative and anti-angiogenic 
				activities. in colon cancers, the anti-tumour activity of 
				curcumin was mediated via inhibition of cox-2. p53 
				(apoptosis-inducing in stressful situations) has been shown to 
				have a varied response to curcumin administration; 
				overexpression in human hepatoblastoma, human breast cancer 
				cells and human basal cell carcinoma and downregulation in 
				colorectal carcinoma reveal that it may be tissue-specific. its 
				anti-angiogenic effect is by inhibition of angiogenic factors 
				like fibroblast growth factor (fgf), ligands of vegf and 
				angiopoietin 1 and 2 and regulation of cell adhesion molecules 
				like endothelial adhesion molecule-1 (elam-1), intracellular 
				adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 
				(vcam-1) and cell surface proteins that are involved in tumour 
				metastasis. implementation of 
				curcumin reduces cell mutations caused by exposure to 
				carcinogens and induces the body's anti-tumor responses. 
				curcumin can promote m1-like tumor microglia activation and 
				increase recruited natural killer cell to cause tumor 
				decimation. curcumin can inhibit the cancer cell proliferation 
				by inhibit nf-κb, cox-2, cd-31, vegf, and il-8, matrix 
				metalloproteinase (mmp)− 9. turmeric extract or curcumin 
				can inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells such as head and 
				neck cancers,  lung cancer, digestive system cancer, 
				urinary system cancer, and reproductive system cancer in vitro 
				and in vivo. the oral submucosal fibrosis, which is highly 
				associated with oral cancer, is a chronic latent disease that 
				leads to the hardening of the oral mucosa and deep tissues, and 
				extends to the wall of the throat or esophagus, gradually 
				causing difficult or loss of eating, swallowing, and 
				pronunciation. in clinical management of oral mucosal fibrosis, 
				curcumin is evident to treatment can prevent, reduce, and 
				improve oral mucosal fibrosis. curcumin treatment can increase 
				the levels of vitamins c and e in salivary and serum to enhance 
				organisms antioxidative values, and decrease the malonaldehyde, 
				8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) to decrease oxidative stress. 
				in clinical application, curcumin is used as an adjuvant or 
				supplement for chemotherapy or nuclear therapy in clinical tumor 
				treatments to reduce postoperative adverse reactions, which 
				still requires clinical verification. curcumin has 
				multiple potentials due to its numerous antineoplastic 
				mechanisms for cancer therapy. curcumin, a chemo-sensitizing 
				agent, also enhances the efficacy of several chemotherapeutic 
				agents. according to the study by chens group, among four 
				anticancer chemotherapeutic factors (erlotinib, sorafenib, 
				sunitinib, and doxorubicin), sunitinib combined with curcumin at 
				a molar ratio of 0.46 achieved the most potent synergistic 
				effect in vitro and has been selected to be studied in an animal 
				model. the anti-tumor effects of curcumin or turmeric extract in 
				combination with bevacizumab in ht29 colon tumor-bearing mice 
				have been examined by yues group. when curcumin is combined 
				with bevacizumab therapy, it suppressed tumor growth 
				significantly with no physical side effects. this highly 
				indicates the therapeutic promise of adjuvant application of 
				curcumin for treating cancer, particularly combined with several 
				mabs. a clinical trial has been executed by basak et al. with 
				oral cancer patients where apg-157, a botanical drug containing 
				multiple polyphenols, including curcumin has been administrated 
				orally. according to the study, apg-157 was absorbed well and 
				significant trace of curcumin has been found in the blood and in 
				tumor tissues. this trial reported the downregulation of 
				inflammatory markers and bacteroides species in the saliva and 
				upregulation of the immune t cells in the tumor tissue. 
				additionally, it reduced inflammation and attracted cytotoxic t 
				cells to the tumor site, signifying its potential usage in 
				combination with immunotherapy drugs. curcumin alone induced a 4955% reduction in mean ovarian 
				cancer tumor growth compared with control animals, while the 
				combination of curcumin with docetaxel resulted in a 77% 
				reduction in mean tumor growth compared with the controls. in an 
				animal study, the administration of curcumin decreased the 
				number of lung tumor nodules and inhibited lung metastasis of 
				melanoma. therefore, it is possible to use curcumin in order to 
				arrest the metastatic growth of tumor cells. 
				
 
a 
				study 
				conducted in 2014 revealed that curcumin was able to 
				obstruct tumor growth and metastasis in several animals organs 
				including the stomach, colon, and liver.
effect of curcumin on lung cancer | 
				curcumin has the potential to mitigate the toxicity induced by 
				smoking tobacco products. for instance, curcumin has been shown 
				to repress ferroptosis in lung cells exposed to smoke. curcumin 
				can also restore the expression of histone deacetylase 2, which 
				represses the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as il-8 
				and macrophage inflammatory protein-2α. in accordance with the 
				aforementioned findings, in vivo models have demonstrated that 
				the application of curcumin leads to the alleviation of lung 
				damage. in regards to lung cancer, curcumin exerts its effect through 
				the reduction of levels of 14-3-3 proteins, which leads to a 
				decrease in cytosolic bad protein and an increase in 
				mitochondrial bad. this resulted in a lowering of the 
				mitochondrial membrane potential. curcumin not only lowered the 
				amount of 14-3-3 proteins but also encouraged bad to be 
				dephosphorylated in a way that depended on akt (endo et al., 
				2020). curcumin was also found to greatly reduce the movement 
				and penetration of a549 cells. additionally, introducing mir-206 
				mimics strengthened curcumins ability to inhibit cell movement 
				(wang et al., 2020). furthermore, the outcomes of another study 
				demonstrated that curcumin could reduce the viability of human 
				non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) cells in a manner that 
				depended on both the duration and amount of dosage. 
				additionally, after treatment with curcumin, there was a 
				noticeable increase in autophagy, as evidenced by the presence 
				of fluorescent particles (autophagic vesicles) and a significant 
				rise in the lc3-ii/lc3-i and beclin1 ratio, along with a 
				decrease in p62 expression. additionally, it was found that 
				curcumin greatly decreased the activity of the pi3k/akt/mtor 
				pathway. interestingly, combining curcumin with inhibitors of 
				mtor or pi3k/akt further enhanced cell death and 
				self-degradation triggered by curcumin, resulting in a notable 
				reduction in cell growth (liu et al., 2018). according to the 
				results of another study, curcumin is also able to affect 
				epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) along with migration by 
				the means of blocking hgf-induced c-met phosphorylation and 
				downstream activation of akt, mtor, and s6 (jiao et al., 2016). cancer stem cell-based treatments with curcumin could be proven 
				as potential processes and targets for tackling lung cancer (ye 
				et al., 2012). curcumin also seems to promote tumor progression, 
				reducing the efficiency of docetaxel in lung cancer patients.
				the therapeutic effect of curcumin has also been exploited in 
				lung cancer. a mechanistic approach was used to study curcumins 
				anti-cancer potential, by targeting jak2/stat3 and nf-κb 
				signaling pathways, in the a549 lung cancer cell lin. in 
				addition, curcumin, via pi3k/akt signaling suppression and 
				microrna-192-5p up-regulation induced apoptosis in non-small 
				cell lung cancer cells with inhibition of cell proliferation.
				in vivo curcumin lessens the migratory and invasive 
				capabilities of a549 cells and inhibited adiponectin expression 
				thought to be mediated through the nf-κb/mmp pathways and has 
				been proposed as an adjuvant in lung malignancy (tsai et al., 
				2015). curcumin against human non-small cell lung cancer cell line 
				a549, which showed 50% cell viability at a high dose of 10,000 u 
				of interferon (ifn)-alpha (ifnα), was investigated to understand 
				the resistivity of these cells against such a higher 
				concentration of ifnα. on treatment with one-tenth of the 
				ic50 value, the a549 cells showed an increase in p50 (nf-κb1) 
				and p65 (rela) subunits of nf-κb with respect to time, in 
				addition to an increase in cox-2 expression. on pretreatment 
				with curcumin, a dose-dependent decrease in these subunits was 
				noticed in western blot analysis and a decrease in cox-2 
				expression was also noted. thus, curcumin showed a remarkable 
				decrease in nf-κb and cox-2 activity in a dose-dependent manner 
				with a maximum dose of 50 μm in ifnα resistant a549 cell lines 
				and it increased the vulnerability of cells towards the 
				cytotoxic activity of ifnα. animal 
				study revealed that curcumin administration reduced 
				ultra-histoarchitecture and histoarchitecture abnormalities 
				against benzo[a]pyrene induced lung carcinogenesis in mice (wang 
				et al. 2016c). in in vitro studies, curcumin treatment is 
				reported to induce mir-98 and suppressed mmp-2 and mmp-9 which 
				leads to inhibition of lung cancer in a549 cell line (liu et al. 
				2017). curcumin downregulated the expression of htert, induced 
				cytotoxicity and attenuated proliferation in a549 cell line, and 
				suggested as effective target for lung cancer therapy 
				(sadeghzadeh et al. 2017). curcumin treatment reduced 
				cd133-positive cells, reduced the formation tumorsphere, 
				downregulated the expression of lung cancer stem cells markers 
				like oct4, aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1a1, cd133, cd44 and 
				nanog alongside induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of 
				lung cancer cells. in addition, it reduced lung cancer via 
				inhibition of sonic hedgehog and wnt/b-catenin signaling 
				pathways (zhu et al. 2017). curcumin treatment inhibits 
				hepatocyte growth factor induced epithelial-mesenchymal 
				transition and angiogenesis by inhibiting pi3k/akt/mtor signal 
				transduction regulated by c-met in human lung cancer cell line 
				a549 (jiao et al. 2016). recent evidence suggest that curcumin 
				treatment effectively prevented lung cancer metastasis and 
				growth by downregulating microrna (mir)-let 7c and mir-101 mediated expression of enhancer of 
				zeste homolog 2 along with downregulation of notch1 expression 
				in human lung cancer cell lines (a549 and nci-h520) (wu et al. 
				2016).  curcumin inhibited 
				il-6-induced proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of human 
				small cell lung cancer (sclc) cells by reducing jak/stat3 
				phosphorylation (i.e., activation) and downstream genes coding 
				for cyclin b1, survivin, bcl-xl, mmps, intercellular adhesion 
				molecule 1 (icam-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor 
				(vegf). the therapeutic efficiency of curcumin in lung cancer is 
				exhibited by the suppression of cox-2, egfr, nf-­κb, and 
				pi3k/akt signaling pathway. an interesting study by jeeyun lee 
				et al. investigated if interferon (ifn)-α stimulation activates 
				an nf-κb in lung cancer cells, and if curcumin annuls ifn-α 
				dependent nf-κb activation and subsequently nf-κb-regulated 
				gene's (cyclooxygenase-2's) expression. they reported that the 
				aforementioned hypothesis was correct in the case of a549 lung 
				cancer cells and curcumin effectively down-regulate cox-2 
				expression through ifn-α-dependent activation of nf-κb. g 
				radhakrishna pillai et al. reported that curcumin ic50 of 50 μm 
				is required to induce in vitro apoptosis in a549 cells [50]. 
				lichuan wu et al. highlighted the fact that curcumin could 
				inhibit cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumorspheres 
				in lung cancer cell line nci-h460. the underlying mechanisms of 
				curcumin-induced tumorspheres suppression are mainly due to the 
				inhibition of the jak2/stat3 signaling pathway. furong liu et 
				al. showed that curcumin exerts a cytotoxic effect on nsclc a549 
				cells by inhibiting the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway to promote 
				apoptosis and autophagy. it indicates that pi3k/akt/mtor signal 
				transduction pathway is a key pathway involved in the role of 
				curcumin in lung cancer. one of the studies showed the effect of 
				curcumin on erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer 
				(nsclc) cells.  the combination of erlotinib and curcumin 
				reduced tumor growth remarkably in vivo in erlotinib-resistant 
				nsclc cells. ping chen et al. provided the evidence that 
				gefitinib-resistant nsclc cells growth could be inhibited by 
				downregulating sp1/egfr activity and the receptor tyrosine 
				kinase pathways with the use of curcumin and gefitinib together. 
				they also validated that curcumin could be utilized, in the 
				treatment of nsclc with wild-type kras and egfr mutation, as a 
				sensitizer of egfr-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (egfr-tkis).
effect of curcumin on breast cancer | curcumin 
				against resistant breast cancer have resulted in promising 
				results. in breast cancer cells, a study indicates that curcumin 
				caused a halt in the cell cycle at the g2/m phase and elevated 
				the levels of p21. it also stopped the activation of akt/mtor, 
				bcl2 and boosted bax while triggering caspase 3 cleavage, 
				leading to breast cancer cell apoptosis. overall, curcumin 
				suppressed breast cancer cell growth and prompted g2/m phase 
				cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, possibly by blocking akt/mtor 
				phosphorylation and promoting mitochondrial apoptotic pathway 
				(hu et al., 2018). curcumin reduced the growth of mcf-7 cells 
				and caused cell death in a way that depended on the amount of 
				curcumin present and the exposure time. it triggered cell death 
				through apoptosis and raised the activities of caspase-3/9. 
				moreover, curcumin decreased the levels of mir-21 in mcf-7 cells 
				by enhancing the pten/akt pathway (wang et al., 2017).  
				curcumin down-regulates the nf-κb signaling pathway, thus, 
				affecting the cell proliferation and invasion contributing to 
				breast cancer treatment. in another breast cancer model, 
				curcumin induced autophagy through down-regulation of akt 
				protein, posing a significant management strategy for breast 
				cancer. these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of 
				curcumin following multiple signaling pathways. 


adriamycin resistant mcf-7adr and tumor necrosis factor 
				resistant bt-20tnf breast cancer cell lines showed 15% (± 6%) 
				and 8% cell viability respectively against curcumin at a dose of 
				1 μg/ml (2.7 μm). the same study claimed that curcumin 
				exhibited the growth inhibitory effect on estrogen-dependent 
				mcf-7 and t-47d as well as estrogen-independent sk-br3 cell 
				lines at lower concentrations, and arrested the majority of 
				cells in the g2/m phase and inhibition of ornithine 
				decarboxylase (odc) activity. a comparative study of the effect 
				of curcumin on human mammary epithelial (mcf-10a) and mdr breast 
				carcinoma (mcf-7/th) cell lines reported that the ic50 value of 
				curcumin against mcf-10a was 3.5 times higher than that of 
				mcf-7/th although cytometric analysis showed equal accumulation 
				of curcumin in both cell lines and it is well complemented with 
				the apoptosis studies where 40 µm (24 hr) concentration of 
				curcumin led 1.8% of mcf-10a cells into apoptosis while 46.6% of 
				mdr, mcf-7/th went into apoptosis under similar conditions, 
				which in terms of considering the collateral damages is a 
				significant observation. in an investigation undertaken by 
				meiyanto et al., doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cell lines 
				mcf-7/dox cells with over-expression of her2 were tested against 
				doxorubicin (ic50 = 7) and curcumin (ic50 = 80 ± 2.39) 
				separately and in combination. the mtt assay showed that 
				curcumin at half of its ic50 concentration in combination with 
				doxorubicin at half of its ic50 concentration, decreased the 
				percentage cell viability of mcf-7/dox cell lines by almost 80%, 
				and this synergistic action of combinatorial treatment-induced 
				cell death, evident through the accumulation of more cells in 
				sub-g1 and g1 phase as compared to the percentage of cells when 
				they were treated separately by doxorubicin and curcumin. 
				efficacy of curcumin against resistant breast cancer cell lines 
				was demonstrated through srb assay on mcf-7, 
				antiestrogen-resistant mcf-7/lcc2 and mcf-7/lcc9 cell lines, 
				which revealed ic50 values of curcumin to be 9.7, 12.2 µm and 
				11.34 µm respectively against these cancer cell lines and colony 
				formation for each cell line was suppressed by curcumin at a 
				concentration of 30 µm. these activities of curcumin were 
				attributed to lowering of anti-apoptotic expressions and 
				inhibition of nf-κb and akt/mtor pathway. the photosensitization 
				of cancer cells by curcumin towards photodynamic therapy (pdt) 
				has been covered by muniyandi et al. and apoptosis is the mode 
				of action in majority of the works cited in the review. the 
				adriamycin resistant breast cancer cell line mcf-7/adr was found 
				to be equally affected as mcf-7 cells (cell viability 50%) on 45 
				minutes preincubation with curcumin (7.5 μm) followed by 
				irradiation with blue light (450 nm, 100 mw/cm2) for 5 min and 
				subsequent 24 h incubation. clinical trial study 
				recommended that, administration of curcumin (6 g/day for seven 
				consecutive days in every 3 weeks) in combination with docetaxel 
				to be safe, effective and well tolerated for advanced and 
				metastatic breast cancer (bayet-robert et al. 2010). in vitro
				models revealed that curcumin treatment is known to induce 
				cytotoxicity through apoptosis induction and inhibit the 
				viability of mcf-7 cells via caspase-3 and 9 activations. it 
				reduced the expression of mir-21 by upregulating the pten/akt 
				signaling in breast cancer cells (wang et al. 2017). 
				experimental evidence suggested that curcumin administration 
				downregulate the expression of estrogen receptor-alfa (er-a) and 
				tumor suppressor protein exerting antiproliferative effects in 
				t-47d human breast cancer cells (hallman et al. 2017). besides, 
				curcumin treatment reduced hypermethylation of glutathione 
				s-transferase (gst) pi 1 (kumar, sharma, and rathi 2017) and 
				deleted in liver cancer 1 (dlc1) (liu et al. 2017), 
				downregulated the sp1 and dna methyltransferase 1 expressions, 
				resulting in inhibition of proliferation of human breast cancer 
				cells (liu et al. 2017). a recent study revealed that curcumin 
				treatment downregulated the expression of fibronectin, twist1 
				vimentin, axl, slug, b-catenin, n-cadherin and e-cadherin 
				thereby inhibited the migration and invasion of cancer in breast 
				cancer cell lines (gallardo and calaf 2016). curcumin inhibits 
				nf-jb signaling resulting in inhibition of cell growth and 
				invasion in mda-mb-231 human breast cancer cell line (yodkeeree 
				et al. 2010). further, curcumin arrested the cell cycle at the 
				late s and g2m phase alongside induced ros mediated apoptosis, 
				accumulated p16/rb and p53/p21 in breast cancer cells (calaf et 
				al. 2011; wang et al. 2016d). in breast cancer cells, curcumin 
				prevented emt-associated morphological changes induced by 
				lipopolysaccharide (lps) while upregulating e-cadherin and 
				downregulating vimentin. it was further shown that curcumin 
				inhibited nf-κb/snail signaling involved in lps-induced emt. in 
				another study, curcumin increased the expression of the small 
				non-coding rna mir181b, which then downregulated proinflammatory 
				cytokines, cxcl1 and cxcl2, as well as mmps, thereby reducing 
				the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. compelling 
				evidence has demonstrated the benefits of curcumin combination 
				therapy as compared to monotherapy in breast cancer. an in vitro 
				investigation reveals that the co-administration of curcumin and 
				4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-oht), a metabolite of tamoxifen, could 
				restore the sensitivity of 4-oht of hr-positive mcf-7 cells 
				through the downregulation of cyclin d1 and upregulation of p21. 
				compared to either curcumin or 4-oht alone, combined treatment 
				also remarkably activated pro-apoptotic protein bcl-xl and 
				suppressed the bcl-2 proteins, thereby further enhancing the 
				apoptotic activities. the phenomenon was reversed with the 
				combined treatment of curcumin and 4-oht in mda-mb-231 cells, 
				mediating cell death and preventing the metastatic behavior of 
				breast cancer cells, respectively. co-treatment of curcumin (10 
				μg/ml) and trastuzumab (10 μg/ml) significantly reduced cell 
				proliferation and induced g2/m arrest in her2-overexpressed 
				bt-474 and sk-br-3-hr (a herceptin resistant strain from 
				sk-br-3) breast cancer cells, compared to trastuzumab alone. 
				further in vivo study revealed that bt-474 xenograft mice models 
				had the smallest tumor volume after 4 weeks of curcumin (45 
				mg/kg) and trastuzumab (4 mg/kg) co-treatment. curcumin also 
				serves as a potential adjuvant with other chemotherapeutic 
				agents in augmenting anticancer effects. the combined treatment 
				of curcumin and paclitaxel significantly suppressed the 
				paclitaxel-mediated nf-κb expression and its regulatory genes 
				cox-2, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (mmp-9), vegf, and 
				intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1), thus promoting the 
				anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic behavior in breast cancer 
				cells. interestingly, further experiments proved that curcumin 
				and paclitaxel curbed the metastasis of mda-mb-435 breast cancer 
				cells to lung tissues in xenograft mice models. more 
				importantly, this combination of curcumin (ranging from 25225 
				mg/kg) and paclitaxel (5 mg/kg) was found to be safe and induced 
				no toxicity effects in mice models. hindered by drug efflux and 
				chemoresistance, doxorubicin was explored in combination with 
				curcumin in breast cancer treatment.  this has successfully 
				augmented the cytotoxicity effect on breast cancer cells another 
				study illustrated that curcumin inhibited the 
				doxorubicin-induced emt via the suppression of akt, β-catenin 
				and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (gsk3β) protein expression, 
				emphasizing the importance of the combined treatment of curcumin 
				and doxorubicin in inhibiting the metastasis of breast cancer 
				cells. apart from the combination with chemotherapeutic agents, 
				the combined treatment of curcumin with other natural compounds 
				has also been investigated in breast cancer. flow cytometry cell 
				death analysis showed that the co-treatment of curcumin (5 μm) 
				and berberine (25 μm) synergistically exerted apoptosis and 
				autophagy cell death to mda-mb-231 and mcf7 breast cancer cells. 
				moreover, curcumin (1.5 μm) sensitized the au565 breast cancer 
				cells treated with quercetin (4 μm) and optiberry (2 μg/ml) to 
				decrease lapatinib-mediated her2 overexpression via the 
				downregulation of her2/akt signalling pathways. another study 
				reported the benefits of curcumin (200 mg/kg) and 
				epigallocatechin gallate (egcg) (25 mg/kg) in lowering the tumor 
				burden of xenograft models via the reduction in phosphorylated 
				akt, egfr and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 
				(vegfr-1) expression, highlighting the enhanced anticancer 
				potential of this treatment regimen. curcumin is believed to 
				show its impact on cell growth and invasion of breast cancer 
				partially through the down-regulation of nf-κb signaling 
				pathways. curcumin induces p53-dependent apoptosis and also 
				causes cell cycle arrest in mcf-7 breast cancer cells. in 
				curcumin-treated mcf-7 cells, proapoptotic protein b-cell 
				lymphoma-2 (bcl-2)-associated x protein (bax) was found in a 
				high concentration and it indicates curcumin's p53-dependent as 
				well as p53-independent antiproliferative effects. xiao-dong sun 
				et al. identified that curcumin could inhibit the 
				phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase 
				(erk1/2) in mda-mb-231 cells. erk1/2 is a major signaling 
				molecule in the downstream pathway of egfr. this is how curcumin 
				inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis, by 
				inhibiting the egfr pathway in vitro in mda-mb-231 cells. yunus 
				akkoç et al. reported that in metastatic mcf-7 breast cancer 
				cells, overexpression of b-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) is a 
				constraining factor for curcumin-induced apoptosis. the 
				overexpression of bcl-2 blocks curcumin-induced autophagy 
				through its inhibitory interaction with beclin-1 in mcf-7 cells. 
				they found that pre-treatment with ly294002, a pi3k inhibitor, 
				enhanced curcumin-induced autophagy and apoptosis by modifying 
				bcl-2 expression and subsequent autophagosome formation in mcf-7 
				breast cancer cells. in vivo effect of curcumin and its 
				derivative (2e,6e)-2,6-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)cyclohexanone 
				(bhmc) had been checked on 4t1 (triple-negative breast cancer 
				cell line) breast cancer cells challenged mice. a study showed 
				that curcumin and bhmc treated mice had low tumor burden, 
				mitotic cells, lung metastasis as well as regeneration capacity 
				compared to the untreated mice.
				effect of curcumin on prostate cancer

 a randomized, double-blind, controlled study evaluated the 
				effects of soy isoflavones and curcumin on serum psa levels in 
				men. the authors of this study concluded that curcumin 
				presumably synergizes with isoflavones to suppress psa 
				production. curcumin against resistant prostate cancer, the induction of 
				apoptosis has been one of the modes of action of curcumin. 
				pi3/akt pathway, which promotes cell growth, proliferation, and 
				survival, is inhibited by curcumin. mechanistic studies, carried 
				out at subtoxic concentrations of curcumin in lncap cells showed 
				that pretreatment with curcumin sensitized the cells towards 
				tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail) 
				through inhibition of the nf-κb pathway of cell survival. 
				in a pilot phase ii study, curcumin (6000 mg per day for 7 
				consecutive days) along with docetaxel and prednisone showed 
				therapeutic potential against castration-resistant prostate 
				cancer with good patient acceptability and tolerability 
				(mahammedi et al. 2016). in vitro models revealed that, 
				curcumin treatment downregulated pgk1 via upregulation of 
				mir-143 alongside increased the expression of foxd3, resulting 
				in inhibition of proliferation and migration of prostate cancer 
				cell (cao et al. 2017). curcumin treatment is known to induce 
				transferrin receptor protein 1 (tfr1) and iron regulatory 
				protein 1 (irp1) expression which leads to induced autophagy and 
				apoptosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells (yang et 
				al. 2017a). it has been reported that curcumin treatment 
				inhibited mt1-mmp and mmp-2 expressions in du145 cells thus 
				reduced the metastasis and survival of prostate cancer cells 
				mediated by notch-1 signaling cascade (yang et al. 2017b). 
				curcumin treatment induced the arrest of g0/g1 cell cycle phase 
				alongside inhibited the regulatory proteins cyclin d1 and cdk-2. 
				besides, it upregulated the expression of p21, p27 and p53 while 
				downregulated bcl-2 expression. further, curcumin treatment is 
				known to activate caspase (3, 8 and 9) (sha et al. 2016) while 
				decreased akt, mmp (2 and 9), bcl- 2, bcl-xl and tumor volume in 
				prostate cancer (jordan et al. 2016). curcumin treatment is 
				reported to increase hdac (1, 4 and 8), apoptosis, production of 
				ros and nrf- 2 expression, while decrease vegf, hif1-a, gsk-3b, 
				akt, prostate-specific antigen (psa) level, psa mrna expression, 
				hat activity and cellular proliferation in lncap cell lines. the 
				available in vitro studies have shown that curcumin is able to 
				inhibit viability, proliferation, survival, migration/invasion, 
				and adhesion of various human prostate cancer cells. curcumin 
				inhibited both androgen-sensitive and insensitive prostate 
				cancer cells by targeting a number of signaling cascades 
				responsible for regulating cellular function. the 
				antiproliferative, antisurvival, and antimigratory effects of 
				curcumin in prostate cancer cells may be due to the inhibition 
				of the akt/mtor, ras/mapk signaling pathways, decreased nf-κb 
				activation, enhanced proapoptoptic caspase and parp cleavage, 
				and the inhibition of members of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 family 
				of proteins. curcumin was also able to induce cell-cycle arrest 
				and enhance autophagy in various prostate cancer cell lines. the 
				available in vivo studies have shown that curcumin 
				administration is able to inhibit the growth/volume, formation, 
				development, proliferation, and angiogenesis of prostate cancer 
				tumors while promoting apoptosis. these effects were observed in 
				mice xenografted with both androgen-sensitive and insensitive 
				prostate cancer cells. curcumins inhibition of prostate tumor 
				growth and progression may be due to its inhibition of akt 
				expression/activation, decreased nf-κb activation, inhibition of 
				the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl, increased 
				expression of the proapoptotic proteins bax and bak, and 
				enhanced parp and caspase expression. these findings from in 
				vivo studies are in agreement with those from the in vitro 
				studies. the downregulation of cell proliferation, paired with 
				the enhanced activity of programmed cell death both in vitro and 
				in vivo, render curcumin an ideal candidate for the development 
				of novel anticancer pharmaceutical agents providing fewer 
				detrimental effects due to its low toxicity.
				
androgen­dependent lncap 
				prostate cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into mice fed 
				with a 2% curcumin containing diet for up to 6 weeks. curcumin 
				significantly increased the extent of apoptosis, as measured by 
				an in situ cell death assay, and caused a reduction in cell 
				proliferation, as measured by a brdu incorporation assay. 
				multiple studies have been done to evaluate the anticancer 
				effects of curcumin on androgen-sensitive as well as 
				androgen-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. t dorai et al., 
				2000, reported that curcumin can reduce the proliferation rate 
				to 20-30% compared to untreated lncap cells (androgen sensitive 
				prostate cancer cell-line).  asok mukhopadhyay et al. 
				suggested that curcumin can cause tumor necrosis factor 
				(tnf)-induced apoptosis by suppressing nf-κb activation in the 
				prostate cancer cell. similarly, curcumin also affects multiple 
				other proteins and pathways, such as c-jun/activator protein 1 
				(ap-1), cyclin d1, cdk-4, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
				(pi3k)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor)/e-twenty six 
				proto-oncogene 2 (ets2) pathway to reduce proliferation, cell 
				growth in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines. studies 
				have also shown the anticancer properties of curcumin on the 
				androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines. 
				curcumin-treated du-145 prostate cancer cells showed reduced 
				expression of nf-κb in paired with less proliferation and 
				increased apoptosis. curcumin additionally downregulated the 
				expression of nuclear transcription factor activator protein-1 
				(ap-1), composed of c-fos and c-jun. many studies have analyzed 
				the effects of curcumin treatment in vivo on the mice 
				xenografted with various human prostate cancer cells. thambi 
				dorai et al., 2001, studied the effect of curcumin on athymic 
				nude mice implanted with lncap cells. it showed a significant 
				increase in apoptosis and reduction in proliferation of lncap 
				cells demonstrated by the increased pycnotic brown staining 
				nuclei in situ.effect of curcumin on colorectal cancer 
				 
 curcumin has demonstrated potential against colorectal cancer in 
				numerous clinical trials. in colorectal cancer, curcumin 
				addresses the complex etiology involving genetic, environmental, 
				and inflammatory factors. clinical trials have shown that 
				standardized curcuma extracts achieve pharmacologically active 
				levels in colorectal tissues, reducing polyp size and number in 
				familial adenomatous polyposis patients and preventing 
				precancerous lesions in smokers without significant toxicity. 
				for instance, a dose-escalation study administering up to 3.6 
				g/day of curcumin demonstrated effective tissue concentrations 
				and safety, while combinations with quercetin further enhanced 
				therapeutic outcomes. these findings highlight curcumins 
				efficacy and safety, emphasizing the need for larger, randomized 
				clinical trials to optimize its bioavailability and fully 
				validate its therapeutic benefits in colorectal cancer 
				treatment. curcumin could be used to 
				avoid colorectal cancer in diabetics with type 2 diabetes 
				by lowering leptin blood levels and increasing adiponectin 
				levels. in a dose-escalation study 
				that explored the pharmacology of curcumin in humans, 15 
				patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to 
				standard chemotherapies consumed capsules compatible with 
				curcumin doses of between 0.45 and 3.6 g/day for up to 4 months. 
				levels of curcumin and its metabolites in plasma, urine, and 
				feces were analyzed. curcumin and its glucuronide and sulfate 
				metabolites were detected in plasma in the 10 nmol/l range and 
				in urine. a daily dose of 3.6 g of curcumin caused 62% and 57% 
				decrease in inducible prostaglandin e2 production in blood 
				samples taken 1 h after the dose was administered on days 1 and 
				29, respectively. a daily oral dose of 3.6 g of curcumin was 
				recommended for the phase ii evaluation in the prevention or 
				treatment of cancers outside the gastrointestinal tract. in 
				another study, patients were given curcumin capsules at three 
				different doses (3.6, 1.8, and 0.45 g/day) for 7 days . the 
				recoveries of curcumin in normal and malignant colorectal 
				tissues of patients receiving 3.6 g of curcumin were 12.7 ± 5.7 
				and 7.7 ± 1.8 nmol/g, respectively. in addition, two metabolites 
				of curcumin, curcumin sulfate and curcumin glucuronide, were 
				identified in the tissue samples. trace levels of curcumin were 
				found in the peripheral circulation. the levels of m1g were also 
				decreased by curcumin treatment in malignant colorectal tissue. 
				the study concluded that a daily dose of 3.6 g of curcumin is 
				pharmacologically efficacious in colorectal cancer patients. curcumin against resistant 
				colorectal cancer studies on human colorectal cancer cell line 
				hct116 and its isogenic 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) resistant cell 
				line hct116r in a 3d model showed that curcumin potentiated the 
				anti-proliferative activity of 5-fu against these cell lines 
				through apoptosis and inhibition of formation of colonies, with 
				suppression of nf-κb pathway. this synergistic combination 
				increased the percentage of apoptotic cells by 56% in hct116r 
				cell lines. the molecular role of curcumin in apoptosis has 
				already been shown in another report where it intensified the 
				downregulation of anti-apoptotic bclxl and cell division 
				favoring cyclin d1 protein caused by 5-fu in hct116 and 
				hct116+ch3 (complemented with chromosome 3) cell lines and 
				inhibiting activation of ikbα kinase and its phosphorylation. 
				chemo-sensitization of drug-resistant cancer cell lines by 
				curcumin, towards a particular chemotherapeutic agent, has been 
				reported in one more investigation involving oxaliplatin 
				sensitive human colorectal adenocarcinoma ht29 cells and its 
				oxaliplatin resistant derived sub-line htoxar3 cells, which 
				showed that combination of curcumin and oxaliplatin almost 
				reversed the oxaliplatin resistance. clinically, curcumin 
				administration (3 g/day orally for one month) converted advanced 
				colon cancer derived regulatory t cells to t helper 1 cells via 
				increasing ifn-c production and repression of foxp3 expression in 
				colon cancer patients (xu, yu, and zhao 2017). in a 
				nonrandomized, open-label clinical trial, oral curcumin (2 g or 
				4 g per day for 30 days) administration reduced the number of 
				aberrant crypt foci and prevented the colorectal neoplasia 
				(kunnumakkara et al. 2017; carroll et al. 2011). 
				in vitro models 
				revealed that treatment with curcumin induced apoptosis, 
				arrested the cell cycle at the g1 phase, decreased the cell 
				population as well as inhibited the proliferation and mutation 
				of colo 320dm cells (dasiram et al. 2017). additionally, 
				curcumin treatment stimulated 50amp-activated protein kinase, 
				suppressed the phosphorylation of p65 nf-jb, downregulated 
				mmp-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (upa) expression 
				as well as reduced the binding ability of nf-jb dna in lovo and 
				sw480 cells leading to inhibition of colon cancer invasion (tong 
				et al. 2016). curcumin treatment downregulated chemokine 
				receptor 4 expression, upregulated naked cuticle homolog 2 
				expression and suppressed wnt signaling. in addition, curcumin 
				treatment downregulated vimentin and upregulated e-cadherin 
				expression, which leads to inhibition of proliferation and 
				epithelial mesenchymal transition in sw620 human colon cancer 
				cells (zhang et al. 2016d). evidence suggested that curcumin 
				treatment downregulated the expression of p-glycoprotein 
				(neerati, sudhakar, and kanwar 2013) and upregulated 
				ppar-c protein (liu et al. 2015), the potential mechanism by 
				which curcumin can be used for the treatment of colon cancer 
				(neerati, sudhakar, and kanwar 2013). in a 30-day study in 44 
				men with lesions in the colon that sometimes turn cancerous, 4 
				grams of curcumin per day reduced the number of lesions by 40%. 
				in a nonrandomized, open-label clinical trial in smokers, 
				curcumin reduced the formation of aberrant crypt foci (acf), the 
				precursor of colorectal polyps.  curcumin at 4 g/day 
				significantly reduced acf formation. the reduction in acf 
				formation by curcumin was associated with a significant fivefold 
				increase in post-treatment plasma curcumin/conjugate levels. 
				curcumin was well-tolerated at both concentrations. these 
				findings demonstrated the effect of curcumin against acf 
				formation in smokers. a study published in the international 
				journal of cancer found that curcumin compares favorably with 
				oxaliplatin as an antiproliferative agent in colorectal cell 
				lines.  a study showed a profound reduction in the incidence of 
				colorectal carcinoma when curcumin is introduced. in another 
				recent study, curcumin was administered to patients with 
				colorectal cancer after diagnosis and before surgery. curcumin 
				was given three times a day for 1030 
				days. curcumin administration decreased 
				serum tnf-α level, increased the number of apoptotic cells, and 
				enhanced the expression of p53 in tumor tissue. the authors of 
				this study concluded that curcumin treatment can improve the 
				general health of colorectal cancer patients via the mechanism 
				of increased p53 expression in tumor cells. in summary, the 
				studies discussed in this section suggest curcumins safety and 
				efficacy in patients with colorectal cancer. 
 
effect 
				of curcumin on pancreatic cancer  
				| a single-blind, randomized, 
				placebo-controlled study from india was conducted to evaluate 
				the effects of oral curcumin with piperine on the pain and 
				markers associated with oxidative stress in patients with 
				tropical pancreatitis. twenty patients with tropical 
				pancreatitis were randomly assigned to receive 500 mg of 
				curcumin with 5 mg of piperine or to receive placebo for 6 
				weeks, and the effects on the pattern of pain and on red blood 
				cell (rbc) levels of mda and gsh were assessed. the results 
				indicated a significant reduction in the erythrocyte mda levels 
				compared with placebo after curcumin therapy, with a significant 
				increase in gsh levels. the authors of this study concluded that 
				oral curcumin with piperine may reverse lipid peroxidation in 
				patients with tropical pancreatitis. curcumin was found safe and 
				well-tolerated in a phase ii clinical trial of patients with 
				advanced pancreatic cancer. of the 25 patients enrolled in the 
				study, 21 were evaluable for response. patients were given 8 
				grams of curcumin per day orally until disease progression, with 
				restaging every 2 months. no toxicities associated with curcumin 
				administration were noted in the patients. a downregulation in 
				the expression of nfκb, cox-2, and pstat3 in peripheral blood 
				mononuclear cells of patients was observed after curcumin 
				intake. there was considerable interpatient variation in plasma 
				curcumin levels, and drug levels peaked at 22 to 41 ng/ml and 
				remained relatively constant over the first 4 weeks. the study 
				concluded that the oral curcumin is well-tolerated and, despite 
				limited absorption, has biological activity in some patients 
				with pancreatic cancer. an open-label phase ii trial evaluated 
				the efficacy of curcumin in combination with gemcitabine against 
				advanced pancreatic cancer. kanai et al. recently evaluated the 
				safety and feasibility of combinations of curcumin and 
				gemcitabine in 21 patients with gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic 
				cancer. curcumin at 8 g/day in combination with gemcitabine was 
				safe and well-tolerated.effect of curcumin on bladder 
				cancer 
				| in animal model, curcumin suppressed the invasion and growth 
				of bladder cancer via induction of apoptosis and arresting g1/s 
				phase transition in n-methyl-n-nitrosourea induced bladder tumor 
				in rats (pan et al. 2017). curcumin treatment suppressed the 
				n-methyl-n-nitrosourea-induced urothelial tumor in rats. in cell 
				lines studies, curcumin treatment is known to downregulate the 
				expression of insulin-like growth factor (igf)-2 and reduces the 
				igf1r and irs-1 phosphorylation in t24 and umuc2 bladder cancer 
				cells. in this regards curcumin functions through suppression of 
				igf-2-mediated pi3k/akt/mtor signal transduction (tian et al. 
				2017). curcumin treatment reversed the transition of 
				epithelial-mesenchymal cells via reducing erk5/ap-1 signaling 
				pathway in sv-40 human urothelial cells which might be the 
				potential drug candidate for prevention of bladder cancer (liu 
				et al. 2017). in human bladder cancer cell lines, curcumin 
				treatment exert multiple effects like inhibition of mmp-2/9, 
				generation of ros, upregulated the expression of ho-1, increased 
				the hypomethylation of the mir-203, upregulated the expression 
				of mir-203, inhibited aurora a promoter activity, downregulated 
				histone h3 activation, induced g2/m phase cell cycle arrest, 
				decreased the expression of cyclin d1 and cox-2, decreased vegf 
				level, decreased c-myc, decreased bcl-2 expression, 
				downregulated survivin protein, upregulated the expression of 
				p53 and bax, induced fragmentation of dna, downregulated cyclin 
				a expression and decreased nf-kb expression thereby inhibited 
				the cancer cell invasion, viability of cancerous cells and 
				growth (imran et al. 2016; saini et al. 2011). 

				effect of curcumin on blood cancer (multiple myeloma and 
				leukemia), lymphoma, and other hematological malignancies
  curcumin against resistant leukemia showed inhibition in 
				growth and clonogenicity to curcumin treatment in dose and 
				time-dependent manner. in leukemia point of view, an in vitro 
				study shows that 25 μμ curcumin for 24 h treatment reduces the 
				activation of proteins like akt, pras40, 4e-bp1, p70s6k, raf-1, 
				and p27 in aml cell lines in a dosage-dependent manner. it also 
				had an impact on cell cycle and apoptosis-related proteins 
				cyclin d1, p21, bcl2, cleaved-caspase-3, and cleaved-parp, 
				causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in these cell lines. the 
				effects were stronger when combined with the akt inhibitor 
				afuresertib but weakened by the akt activator sc-79 which 
				confirms that all these effects are akt-dependent (zhou et al., 
				2021). another similar study tested doses from 0 to 80 μm of 
				curcumin on 697, reh, supb15, and rs4; 11 cells and found out 
				curcumin treatment induces a dephosphorylation of the 
				constitutive phosphorylated akt/pkb which leads to suppressing 
				cancer cell growth and apoptosis induction (kuttikrishnan et 
				al., 2019). 
				curcumin decreased the paraprotein load in the ten patients with 
				paraprotein >20 g/l, and five of these ten had a 12% to 30% 
				reduction in paraprotein levels while receiving curcumin 
				therapy. in addition, 27% of patients receiving curcumin had a 
				>25% decrease in urinary n-telopeptide of type i collagen. the 
				study suggested the therapeutic potential of curcumin against 
				mgus. vadhan-raj et al. evaluated the safety, tolerability, and 
				clinical efficacy of curcumin in 29 patients with asymptomatic, 
				relapsed, or plateau phase multiple myeloma. curcumin was given 
				either alone (orally at 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 g/day in two divided 
				doses) or in combination with piperine (10 mg in two divided 
				doses) for 12 weeks. curcumin and piperine were well-tolerated, 
				with no significant adverse events. furthermore, oral 
				administration of curcumin was associated with significant 
				downregulation in the constitutive activation of nfκb and 
				stat3, and it suppressed cox-2 expression in most of the 
				patients. these observations suggest the potential of curcumin 
				against multiple myeloma. in another study, curcumin showed an 
				ic50 value of 35.7 µm against kg1a 23.5 µm against kasumi-1 on 
				96 hr exposure and completely stopped colony formation at 20 µm 
				concentration. the mechanistic investigations reflected the role 
				of curcumin in activation of caspase-3, down-regulation of bcl-2 
				mrna expression and reduction in mitochondrial membrane 
				potential in addition to remarkable morphological changes like 
				cell shrinking and nuclear condensation, which are 
				characteristics of apoptosis. another drug-resistant leukemia 
				cell line hl60 responded to curcumin with 50% growth inhibition 
				at 30 µm concentration. cell cycle studies in this experiment 
				established apoptosis as the mechanism of action of curcumin and 
				arrest of the cell cycle in the s-phase was also reported in the 
				same study. clinically, curcumin administration (5 g for 6 
				weeks) possessed potent chemosensitizing effect in chronic 
				myeloid leukemia patients, where the patients receiving both 
				curcumin and imatinib exhibited better prognosis with decreased 
				no levels as compare to the patients receiving imatinib alone 
				(ghalaut et al. 2012). in animal study, curcumin treatment 
				significantly decreased tumor growth in the chronic myeloid 
				leukemia xenograft mice via release of exosomes enriched mir-21 
				in plasma (taverna et al. 2015). in cell line studies, curcumin 
				treatment upregulated apoptosis inducing factor, caspase-3, 
				cleaved parp-1 while downregulated bcl-2 resulting in induction 
				of apoptosis in lymphoblastic leukemia cells (mishra, singh, and 
				narayan 2016). curcumin incubation (10 lm, for 6 days) increased 
				the level of ros, induced genomic instability, mediated reversal 
				of p15 promoter methylation and induced apoptosis in raji cells 
				(sharma et al. 2014). curcumin treatment (40 mmol/l, for 48h) 
				downregulated the protein expression of nuclear nf- jb p65 as 
				well and its translocation alongside inhibited proliferation 
				of acute myeloid leukemia in kg1a and kasumi-1 cells (rao et al. 
				2015). also, curcumin treatment (25 lm, for 2448 h) arrested 
				cell cycle in the s-phase, increased the number of annexin 
				v-fitc(þ)/pi(-) cells and inhibited the proliferation of shi-1 
				cells. in addition, curcumin upregulated fasl and downregulated 
				nf-jb, erk, bcl-2, mmp-2 and mmp-9 expressions. further, 
				curcumin induced the activation of mapk, p38, caspase-3 and jnk 
				resulted in inhibition of shi-1 cell invasion (zhu et al. 2016). 
				curcumin treatment downregulated the expression of vegf and 
				decreased the phosphorylation of akt. curcumin mediated 
				increased mir-196b levels caused downregulation of bcr-abl 
				expression in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (taverna et al. 
				2015). curcumin incubation downregulated mcl-1 expression and 
				associated with apoptosis in human myeloma cell lines 
				(gomez-bougie et al. 2015). curcumin treatment simultaneously 
				inhibited raf/mek/erk and akt/mtor pathway activation resulting 
				in induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in 
				human leukemia thp-1 cells (guo et al. 2014). curcumin 
				incubation increased the generation of intracellular ros, 
				depletion of intracellular gsh, and activation of caspase 
				enzyme. chu-wen yang et al. investigated the effect and mode of 
				action of curcumin on monocytic leukemia thp-1 cells, derived 
				from human acute monocytic leukemia. the authors demonstrated 
				that curcumin-induced thp-1 cell apoptosis through the 
				activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinase/extracellular 
				signal-regulated kinase/activator protein 1 (jnk/erk/ap1) 
				pathways. yi-rong chen et al. reported that curcumin affects the 
				mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1/jnk  
				pathway by interfering with the signaling molecules like ap-1 
				and nf-κb as a possible mechanism of action. they speculated 
				that curcumin may affect the jnk pathway by interfering with the 
				signaling molecules at the same level or proximally upstream of 
				the mapk kinase kinases (mapkkks) level. yaowu zhang et al. 
				showed curcumin can induce apoptosis in osteosarcoma mg63 cells 
				through the mitochondrial pathway. they reported that the 
				effects of curcumin-induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells were 
				associated with caspase-3 activation and reduced the levels of 
				bcl-2 expression. jia rao et al. reported a similar function of 
				curcumin in aml cells. they showed that curcumin down-regulates 
				bcl-2 and induces apoptosis in daunorubicin (dnr)-insensitive 
				cd34+ aml cell lines and primary cd34+ aml cells. seong-su han 
				et al. reported that curcumin inhibited the proliferation of 
				bks-2, an immature b cell lymphoma, more effectively than that 
				of normal b lymphocytes and caused the apoptosis of bks-2 cells 
				in a dose- and time-dependent manner. the authors concluded that 
				curcumin downregulated the expression of survival genes early 
				growth response 1 (egr-1), cellular myelocytomatosis (c-myc), 
				and bcl-extra large (bcl-xl) as well as the tumor suppressor 
				gene p53 in b cells as its possible mechanism of action. shilpa 
				kuttikrishnan et al. investigated the anticancer potential of 
				curcumin in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. the authors concluded 
				that curcumin suppresses b-pre-all cells' growth and 
				proliferation by inactivation of the pi3k/akt signaling pathway. 
				guo-hua zhu et al. reported that curcumin significantly induces 
				apoptosis but also partially suppresses invasion in shi-1 cells 
				(acute monocytic leukemia cell line) in vitro. their results 
				from polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and western blotting showed 
				that curcumin increased the fasl mrna level; inhibited bcl-2, 
				nf-κb, and erk expression; and activated p38 mapks, jnks, and 
				caspase-3. zai-xin li et al. studied how curcumin affects the 
				proliferation of the raji cells of burkitt's lymphoma. their 
				biochemical studies showed that cell apoptosis increases through 
				upregulation of bid (bh3-interacting domain death agonist), 
				cytochrome c, and bax, while oncogene c-myc was downregulated 
				after curcumin treatment. taken together, their results 
				suggested that mitochondrial damage induction was the main 
				mechanism of action of curcumin which led to apoptosis of the 
				raji cells. in vivo effects of curcumin in the xenograft mouse 
				model showed its effective inhibition of tumor growth. all in 
				all, these results were suggestive of curcumin's growth 
				suppressing effect on burkitt's lymphoma cells both in vivo and 
				in vitro system.effect of curcumin on cervical 
				cancer | curcumin 
				administration (12,000 mg/day for 3 months) reduced the risk of 
				cervical cancer and is found to be safe and well tolerated 
				chemotherapeutic in phase i clinical trial (cheng et al. 2001). 
				in animal model, curcumin suppressed nuclear b-catenin, 
				decreased oncogenic mirna-21 and abrogated e6/e7 hpv expression 
				in orthotopic mouse model of cervical cancer (zaman et al. 
				2016). curcumin administration (1000 or 1500 mg/kg, for 30 days) 
				significantly downregulated the expression of vegf, cox-2, egf-r 
				and inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth in cervical cancer 
				xenografts model of nude mice (yoysungnoen-chintana, 
				bhattarakosol, and patumraj 2014). in cell line studies, 
				curcumin treatment (13 mm) upregulated the expression of 
				early-onset breast cancer 1, o6- methylguanine-dna 
				methyltransferase, mediator of dna damage checkpoint 1, 
				p-h2a.xser140 and p-p53 as well as induced translocation of 
				p-h2a.xser140 and p-p53 from cytosol to nuclei, resulting in 
				chromatin condensation and induction of dna damage in hela human 
				cervical cancer cells (shang et al. 2016a). curcumin activated 
				atf6, perk, ire-1aand elevated the levels of ros intracellularly 
				as well as induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of 
				cervical cancer cells (me180, c33a, hela and caski) (kim et al. 
				2016a). curcumin counteracts estradiol induced proliferation of 
				cervical cancer via induction of apoptosis in cervical cancer 
				cells (singh and singh 2011). incubation with curcumin (20 mm, 
				for 72 h) reversed the hypermethylation and reactivation of the 
				rarb2 gene in cervical cancer cell lines (jha et al. 2010). 
				curcumin (50 or 100 mm, 24 h) dose dependently reduced the 
				phosphorylation of erk, increased the activity of caspase 3 and 
				caspase 9, upregulated aif, bax, cytochrome while downregulated 
				bcl-xl, bcl-2 in cervical cancer cells. curcumin treatment 
				downregulated the expression of cyclin d1, inos and cox-2 in 
				hela, siha and ca ski cells, and acts as an anti-proliferative 
				agent (singh and singh 2009).effect of curcumin on thyroid 
				cancer 
				| in thyroid cancer cells curcumin is effective for decreasing 
				drug resistance. curcumin improves the processing and 
				transportation of nis on cell membranes, leading to a notable 
				increase in radioiodine absorption in laboratory tests. curcumin 
				may enhance radioiodine sensitivity by blocking the 
				pi3k-aktmtor signaling pathway (zhang et al., 2021). other than 
				that, zhang et al. (2022) looked at curcumins effects on 
				thyroid cancer cells from another aspect. in their study, 
				curcumin was found to exert selective cytotoxicity on thyroid 
				cancer cells but not normal epithelial cells and acted as an 
				autophagy inducer through activation of mapk while inhibition of 
				mtor pathways. hyperactivation of the akt/mtor axis was observed 
				in the majority of ptc samples we tested, and thyroid cancer 
				cell lines along with cancer tissue specimens sustained a low 
				basal autophagic activity (zhang et al., 2022). in cell line studies, curcumin treatment upregulated 
				e-cadherin while downregulated vimentin and mmps expressions 
				along with reduced metastasis, cell spreading and cell migration 
				in human papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. curcumin suppressed 
				tgf-b1 mediated transcription, activation and secretion of 
				matrix metalloproteinases. it also inhibited tgf-b1 induced 
				smad2 and smad3 phosphorylation in human papillary thyroid 
				carcinoma bcpap cells (zhang et al. 2016a). curcumin treatment 
				induced dna damage in thyroid carcinoma bcpap cells via 
				upregulation of h2a.x phosphorylation at ser139 and atm-mediated 
				activation of chk2-cdc25c-cdc2 pathway. moreover, curcumin 
				induced caspase mediated apoptosis in bcpap cells (zhang et al. 
				2016b). curcumin downregulated the expression of hif-1aand its 
				binding to hypoxia response element in k1 papillary thyroid 
				cancer cells. in addition, curcumin upregulated the expression 
				of e-cadherin, inhibited the activity of mmp-9 (zhang et al. 
				2013a) and weakened k1 cells migration resulting in 
				anti-metastatic effect (tan et al. 2015). curcumin treatment 
				reduced the phosphorylation of pi3k and akt pathway, and 
				downregulated the expression of mmp-1/7 and cox-2 leading to 
				inhibition of cell migration, growth and invasion of thyroid 
				cancer cells (ftc133) (xu, qin, and liu 2014). curcumin 
				instigate the production of ros, reduce mitochondrial membrane 
				potential and altered intracellular calcium concentration 
				thereby mediate apoptotic induction in papillary thyroid cancer 
				cell line k1 (song et al. 2012).
effect of curcumin on skin cancer 
				| curcumin 
				decreased the phosphorylation of irs-1, ilgf-1 receptor, akt, 
				4ebp1 and s6k in the mouse keratinocyte cells alongside exerted 
				significant anticancer activity against 
				7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (dmba)-tetradecanoyl 
				phorbol-13-acetate induced skin cancer in mice (kim et al. 
				2014). in in vitro studies, curcumin treatment is reported to 
				upregulate mmu-mir-205-5p expression, block proliferating cell 
				nuclear antigen, downregulate bcl-2 expression and sup- press 
				jak-2/stat3 pathway which in turn induction of apoptosis and 
				inhibition of proliferation and invasion (lelli, pedone, and 
				sahebkar 2017). curcumin treatment arrested the g2/m phase of 
				cell cycle as well as induced autophagy in human melanoma cells 
				(a375 and c8161). in addition, curcumin reduced the activation 
				of p70s6k, and downregulated akt and mtor expressions which 
				might offer plausible target in the treatment of human melanoma 
				(zhao et al. 2016a). in another study, curcumin decreased the 
				invasion of squamous cell carcinoma by suppressing stat3 
				signaling pathway in a431 cells (wu, lu, and cui 2015). curcumin 
				induced the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition 
				pore and melanoma cell death in wm-115 melanoma cells (qiu et 
				al. 2014). curcumin inhibited nf-jb pro-survival pathway, 
				upregulated the p53 tumor suppressor protein and downregulated 
				bcl-2 expression resulting in apoptosis and reversal of skin 
				cancer (chinembiri et al. 2014).
effect of curcumin 
				on brain cancer
				| curcumin was shown to 
				have inhibitory effects on telomerase and induced telomere 
				shortening and apoptosis in brain tumor cells. curcumin induced 
				growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest at g2/m in 
				medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cells. in various types of 
				cancers, curcumin was shown to selectively target cells that 
				express telomerase enzyme making these cells more vulnerable to 
				curcumin-induced cytotoxicity of cancer cells. importantly, the 
				above-mentioned study revealed that the complex and diverse 
				action of curcumin, and its efficacy could depend on the cell 
				types used. the long-term studies on brain tumor cells 
				highlighted the use of curcumin as an adjuvant for cancer 
				therapy. telomere shortening drives renal cell senescence and 
				leads to renal aging. khaw and co-workers have demonstrated that 
				curcumin suppresses telomerase activity in brain tumor cells 
				which is associated with reduction in htert levels. treatment 
				with curcumin induces a significant telomere shortening in brain 
				tumor cells suggesting its potential clinical application as 
				telomerase inhibitor and use of curcumin in adjuvant cancer 
				therapy. by contrast, in normal cells curcumin improves 
				viability by acting on telomerase when the cells have been 
				stimulated with toxic molecules. a study conducted on sk-n-sh 
				cells treated with curcumin improved cell viability. normally, 
				htert was inhibited by aβ142; shortened telomere could not 
				restore length, and then, there were plenty of apoptotic cells. 
				treatment with curcumin could bind to aβ142 and antagonize 
				neurotoxicity; thus, the expression of htert was upregulated, 
				shortened telomere restored length and the numbers of cells were 
				increased. long-term studies on brain tumor cells underscore the 
				use of curcumin in adjuvant cancer therapy. curcumin against brain cancer in vivo model of human 
				glioma u-87 cells in athymic mice on intraperitoneal dose of 
				curcumin (120 mg/kg/day) showed less than 50% decrease in median 
				tumor volume in subcutaneous xenograft while in the orthotopic 
				model, the average life span of group receiving similar dose 
				increased by 12% as compared to the control group. in female 
				scid mice xenograft model, human primary medulloblastoma cells 
				(daoy) were subcutaneously injected and after 30 days, the 
				animals were given oral gavage of curcumin (1 mg/kg) dissolved 
				in corn oil. the tumor growth inhibition in curcumin treated 
				group was significantly noticeable as compared to the control 
				group. the group of smo/smo transgenic medulloblastoma mice 
				receiving oral dose of curcumin was reported to have a median 
				survival time of 192 days as compared to the control group, 
				which had a median survival time of 144 days. this observation 
				is in agreement with earlier claims of ability of curcumin to 
				cross blood brain barrier. mechanistic insights in xenografted 
				human medulloblastom d425 cells in athymic mice showed 
				overexpression of p65 subunit of nf-κb and the curcumin treated 
				group showed tumor growth inhibition which can be partially 
				attributed to down regulation of p65 subunit. in another in vivo 
				investigation, human glioblastoma u87-mg cells-inoculated nude 
				mice were administered with 100 mg/kg per day of curcumin in 
				dmso in phosphate buffer saline through intra-tumoral 
				injections. after seven days, significant decrease in tumor size 
				was observed in curcumin treated group. microscopic examination 
				post acridine orange staining showed increased acidic vesicular 
				organelles in curcumin treated cells with intact nuclei, 
				pointing towards curcumin-induced autophagy being responsible 
				for cell deaths.effect of curcumin on 
				medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma 

 


medulloblastoma is the common malignant brain tumor in 
				pediatrics. in animal model, curcumin inhibited tumor growth and 
				increased the survival rate in smo/smo transgenic 
				medulloblastoma mice (lee et al. 2011). in cell line studies, 
				curcumin treatment arrested g2/m phase of cell-cycle, activated 
				gsk-3band suppressed wnt/b-catenin path- way resulting in 
				inhibition of proliferation in daoy medul- loblastoma cell line 
				(he et al. 2014). curcumin treatment upregulated the pten gene 
				expression and downregulated the expression of e2f1, cdk2 and 
				cyclin e1 gene resulting in growth arrest at g2/m phase in 
				medulloblastoma cells. in addition, curcumin treatment increased 
				caspase-3/7 activity, overexpressed bax while downregulated 
				bcl-2, bcl-xl and surviving expression, which leads induced 
				apoptosis of human medulloblastoma cells (bangaru et al. 2010). 
				curcumin treatment inhibits telomerase activity and gene 
				expression of htert resulting in telomere shortening in 
				medulloblastoma cell lines (a172, kns60, u251mg and ons76) (khaw 
				et al. 2013). curcumin phosphorylates cdc27, a component of the 
				anaphase promoting complex/ cyclosome, which is known to 
				ubiquitinate securing and cyclin b, resulting in proteolysis and 
				apoptosis of daoy medulloblastoma cell (lee and langhans 2012). 
				further, it was reported that, curcumin treatment induced 
				apoptosis and cell cycle arrest possibly through downregulation 
				his- tone deacetylase 4 and enhanced tubulin acetylation. 
				curcumin treatment inhibited the sonic hedgehog-glioma 
				associated oncogene-1 pathway via downregulating the protein 
				expression of sonic hedgehog ligand, and its most important 
				downstream targets glioma associated oncogene-1 and patched-1 
				receptor. furthermore, curcumin reduced the levels of b-catenin, 
				n-myc, c-myc, cyclin d1 and induced apoptosis in daoy 
				medulloblastoma cells (elamin et al. 2010).
effect of 
				curcumin on ovarian 
				cancer | curcumin exhibits the important anti-cancer 
				activity in ovarian cancer via the pro-apoptotic function. 
				curcumin inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and 
				promoted apoptosis, and first confirmed it was associated with 
				the regulatory network of circ-plekhm3/mir-320a/smg1. liu et al. 
				reported that curcumin could constrain ovarian cancer cell 
				proliferation and facilitate apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy 
				and akt/mtor/p70s6 pathway. yen et al. suggested that curcumin 
				could suppress ovarian cancer cell colony formation via blocking 
				the wnt/β-catenin pathway. these reports indicated the 
				anti-cancer property of curcumin in ovarian cancer treatment. in 
				the past research, curcumin had been found to improve the 
				radiosensitization of nasopharyngeal carcinoma through 
				regulating the circrna network. xu et al. suggested that 
				curcumin could suppress non-small cell lung cancer progression 
				by regulating circ-prkca. circ-plekhm3 was downregulated in 
				ovarian cancer, and its expression could be promoted by 
				curcumin. function analysis showed that circ-plekhm3 
				overexpression could aggravate curcumin function by suppressing 
				cell proliferation, triggering apoptosis and reducing 
				tumorigenesis in ovarian cancer. these data revealed that 
				curcumin might regulate ovarian cancer progression by promoting 
				circ-plekhm3. in addition, the anti-cancer role of circ-plekhm3 
				was confirmed in study, which was consistent with the previous 
				study. a previous report displayed the circ-plekhm3 acted as 
				mir-9 sponge to regulate ovarian cancer progression. mir-320a 
				mimic reversed the regulation of circ-plekhm3 on 
				curcumin-mediated ovarian cancer cell proliferation and 
				apoptosis, further confirming that circ-plekhm3 sponged mir-320a 
				to participate in ovarian cancer progression. the study also 
				validated the carcinogenic role of mir-320a in ovarian cancer, 
				which was consistent with previous reports. these data indicated 
				the importance of circ-plekhm3/mir-320a axis for curcumin in 
				ovarian cancer development. curcumin could up-regulate smg1 
				expression via modulating circ-plekhm3/mir-320a axis. curcumin 
				could suppress proliferation and promote apoptosis in ovarian 
				cancer, possibly via regulating circ-plekhm3/mir-320a/smg1 axis. 
				this research might propose a novel mechanism for understanding 
				the function of curcumin in ovarian cancer.
effect of 
				curcumin on liver cancer | yu and his colleagues 
				evaluated the role of curcumin in inhibiting the human hepatoma 
				smmc-7721 cells significantly by promoting apoptosis via 
				modulation of bax/bcl-2 (yu et al., 2011). apoptosis was 
				associated with increases in p53 levels as well as its 
				dna-binding ability, along with protein expression of bax. 
				phosphorylation of cdc27 (cell division cycle 27) is the main 
				mechanism of anticancer efficacy of curcumin by obstructing cell 
				growth and proliferation in an apoptotic pathway, leading to the 
				death of the cells (lee and langhans, 2012). according to li and 
				his colleagues, in human hepatoma cell lines such as hepg2 and 
				hcclm3, suppression of mir-21 improved anticancer action of 
				curcumin like cell growth suppression, apoptosis via upregulated 
				target gene, and timp3 expression, and the mechanism may refer 
				to tgf-β1/smad3 signaling pathway inhibition (li j. et al., 
				2020). curcumin inhibits cancer through modulating several 
				signaling pathways and molecular targets, including 
				tgf-β1/smad3, igf, pi3k/akt, wnt/β-catenin, and vascular 
				endothelial growth fact (vegf) (figure 7) (mohebbati et al., 
				2017). effect of curcumin on other cancer  | curcumin treatment significantly inhibited gastric 
				carcinoma. curcumin therapy of burkitts lymphoma cell lines in 
				combination with ionizing radiation shows that it boosts 
				lymphoma cells susceptibility to ionizing radiation-induced 
				apoptosis and improves cell cycle arrest at the g2/m phase. 
				curcumin and l-asp show synergism in patients with blood and 
				bone marrow malignancy (jiang et al., 2015). curcumin also 
				hinders the cellular growth of uterine leiomyosarcoma and 
				reduces the spread of castrate-resistant disease and human 
				leiomyosarcoma cells via modulating the akt-mammalian target of 
				rapamycin pathway for inhibition (wong et al., 2011). curcumin 
				extracts potential in decreasing tumors induced chemically was 
				investigated. it was documented that curcumin is useful in 
				reducing papilloma development throughout carcinogenesis and 
				progression. dietary curcumin can reduce the number of papilloma 
				that promoted skin tumor, which was explored by limtrakul et al. 
				(2001) as ras-p21 and fos-p62 oncogene expression was decreased 
				dose-dependently by curcumin.  in addition, curcumin prevents the proliferation of 
				uterine leiomyosarcoma via induction of apoptosis, autophagy, 
				erk 1/2 activity and fragmentation of dna in gastric carcinoma 
				cells (imran et al. 2016). curcumin treatment suppressed 
				jak-stat signaling thus reducing tumor cell growth in ovarian 
				(ovca 420 and ovca 429) and endometrial (rl95-2 and ishikawa) 
				cancer cell lines (saydmohammed, joseph, and syed 2010). 
				curcumin down-regulated the expression of il-6, il-11 and nf-kb 
				which leads to induce apoptosis of fibrosarcoma cells resulting 
				in anticancer activity against bone cancer (kondo et al. 2001; 
				kwak et al. 2006). curcumin induced cell cycle arrest in g2/ m 
				phase, apoptosis and cytotoxicity in squamous carcinoma cells as 
				well as reduced tumor volume in head and neck cancer (borges et 
				al. 2017). curcumin treatment reversed the migration and 
				proliferation of hepatic carcinoma by downregulating the 
				expression of hif-1a. in addition, curcumin reduced the level of 
				mmp-2 and mmp-9 as well as decreased the phosphorylation of p38, 
				which is associated with suppression of cancer invasion and 
				migration in hepatic carcinoma. additionally, curcumin 
				treatment exhibited anti-proliferative effect in mhcc97h liver 
				cancer cells through generation of ros, apoptosis and activating 
				toll like receptor -4/myd-88 pathway (imran et al. 2016; liang 
				et al. 2014). curcumin treatment significantly upregulated the 
				expression of p21/cip1 and p27/kip1 cdk, and downregulated the 
				expression of cyclin d1 resulting in decreased proliferation of 
				pancreatic cancer cells. apart from this, curcumin induced 
				apoptosis via downregulating the ratio of bcl-2/bax and 
				increasing the activation of caspase-9/3 in pancreatic cancer 
				cells. curcumin treatment inhibited pi3k/ akt pathway and 
				induced forkhead box o1 in panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells 
				leading to apoptosis (zhao et al. 2015). curcumin suppressed the 
				oral tumor volume, numbers of dysplasic lesions, papillomas and 
				squamous cell carcinoma (imran et al. 2016). interestingly, 
				curcumin treatment has potential for many cancer types like 
				esophagus cancer, testicular cancer, sarcoma and lymphoma 
				(kunnumakkara et al. 2017). curcumin has been reported to have 
				pharmacological efficiency towards multiple other cancer types 
				like gastric, colorectal, liver, and osteosarcoma. xiang zhou et 
				al. reported that curcumin, in combination with oxaliplatin and 
				5-fluorouracil (5-fu), exhibited synergistic inhibitory effect 
				in xenograft gastric tumor (bgc-823 cancer cells) via 
				downregulation of bcl-2 and cleavage of caspase-3 and parp 
				through upregulation of bax [81]. gizem calibasi-kocal et al. 
				reported the dose-dependent chemopreventive role of curcumin in 
				hct-116 and lovo cells (human colon cancer cell lines) possibly 
				through inhibition of nf-κb and/or activation of caspase-3 and 
				caspase-9. biqiong ren et al. demonstrated the antiproliferative 
				role of curcumin on liver cancer and reported its mechanism of 
				action through inhibition of the heat shock protein 70-toll like 
				receptor 4 (hsp70-tlr4) signaling pathway. duk su lee ds et al. 
				demonstrated curcumin-induced p53 upregulation, cell cycle 
				arrest at gap-1/synthesis (g1/s) and g2/s phase, and caspase-3 
				activation in human osteosarcoma cells. curcumin has been 
				reported to possess antiproliferative activity towards 
				fibrosarcoma, a rare malignant tumor of the fibrous connective 
				tissue around the bones. mr guimarães et al. reported that 
				curcumin was able to inhibit cytokine gene expression in 
				diseased periodontal tissue. they discovered curcumin-induced 
				inactivation of il-6, and il-11 in a dose-dependent manner. 
				 


how may 
				curcumin work against rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis?














the 
				potential of curcumin against arthritis was first reported in a 
				1980 study; curcumin was well-tolerated, had no adverse effects, and 
				exerted an anti-rheumatic activity identical to that of 
				phenylbutazone as shown by improvement in joint swelling, 
				morning stiffness, and walking time. curcumin has shown 
				potential therapeutic effects in rheumatoid arthritis  
				through mechanisms that involve the modulation of inflammation 
				and immune function. specifically, curcumin may reduce the 
				production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, regulate immune cell 
				differentiation and function, and influence signaling pathways 
				central to inflammation and autoimmunity (mohammadian 
				haftcheshmeh et al., 2021). studies have demonstrated that 
				administration of curcumin at 80 mg/kg for 4 months increased 
				levels of tgf-β and foxp3, and enhanced the population of treg 
				cells, while also inhibiting il-6 cytokine levels (wu et al., 
				2011; wang et al., 2015). curcumin has been noted for its 
				efficacy in reducing joint swelling and pain, improving physical 
				function, and decreasing inflammatory markers, enhancing overall 
				quality of life. in a targeted clinical trial, 
				pourhabibi-zarandi et al. (2024) investigated the effects of 
				curcumin supplementation on total antioxidant capacity (tac), 
				malondialdehyde (mda) levels, and disease activity in 48 women 
				with ra over an 8-week period. participants received either a 
				daily dose of curcumin or a placebo. the study, which employed a 
				double-blind, placebo-controlled design, revealed that curcumin 
				significantly increased serum tac levels and decreased tender 
				and swollen joint counts, pain on a visual analog scale (vas), 
				and disease activity score-28 (das-28) (all p < 0.001), 
				alongside a notable reduction in mda levels (pourhabibi-zarandi 
				et al., 2024). curcumin emerges as a 
				promising candidate due to its ability to modulate key 
				inflammatory and catabolic pathways involved in oa pathogenesis. 
				preclinical studies demonstrate that curcumin reduces the 
				expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix 
				metalloproteinases, thereby protecting cartilage integrity and 
				inhibiting disease progression. these outcomes suggest that 
				curcumin not only addresses symptomatic relief but may also 
				influence the underlying disease mechanisms. integrating 
				curcumin into oa management could offer a multifaceted approach 
				by targeting inflammation, protecting cartilage, and enhancing 
				patient quality of life. curcumin can reduce joint 
				inflammation and alleviate pain symptoms, mainly due to its 
				anti-inflammatory and cartilaginous protective effects. in 
				primary cultured chondrocytes, curcumin inhibited the mrna 
				expression of pro-inflammatory mediators il-1β and tnf-α, mmps 
				1.3 and 13, and adamts5, and upregulated the chondroprotective 
				transcriptional regulator cbp/p300 interacting transactivator 
				with ed-rich tail 2. curcumin reduces the synthesis of 
				inflammatory mediators, such as tnf-α, il-17, il-1β, 
				transforming growth factor-β (tgf-β), and cyclooxygenase-2 and 
				reduces the cartilage and synovial inflammation of rat models of 
				arthritis induced by lipopolysaccharide, collagen ii and 
				monoiodoacetic acid. curcumin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect 
				by inhibiting tlr4 pathway and its downstream nf-κb signaling 
				pathway. activation of nf-κb pathway not only down-regulates 
				pro-inflammatory factors, but also inhibits the expression of 
				matrix degrading enzymes. curcumin inhibited il-1β-induced mmp-1 
				and mmp-3 production by inhibiting ap-1 and nf-κb signaling 
				pathway activation. arthritis is an inflammatory autoimmune 
				disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovial 
				joint that can lead to severe joint injury. il-10 plays an 
				important role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. 
				curcumin has anti-inflammatory effect and can regulate tlr-4 
				receptor and its downstream pathway.65 curcumin can 
				down-regulate the levels of tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, il-12, il-15, 
				and il-8 in macrophages, and up-regulate the level of il-10. 
				curcumin effectively alleviates msu-induced inflammatory 
				response by inhibiting tlr4/nf-κb signaling pathway and nlrp3 
				inflammasome activity. curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory 
				drug. numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated its 
				beneficial effect on arthritis. clinical trials focused on the 
				treatment of knee osteoarthritis. in a clinical trial of 
				turmeric extract in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, 
				turmeric extract inhibited inflammation and improved clinical 
				symptoms, as well as reduced il-1β and oxidative stress. 
				turmeric extract was more effective than placebo for knee pain. 
				motahar heidari-beni et al produced an herbal formulation 
				consisting of turmeric extract, black pepper and ginger. in 
				patients with knee osteoarthritis, this compound raises 
				prostaglandin e2 (pge2) levels similar to naproxen. in a 
				randomized, pilot study, 45 patients diagnosed with arthritis 
				were randomized into three groups with patients receiving 
				curcumin (500 mg) and diclofenac sodium (50 mg) alone or their 
				combination. results show that curcumin administration showed 
				the significantly improvement in overall disease activity score 
				and american college of rheumatology compare with diclofenac 
				sodium. clinical trials of curcumin in the treatment of 
				arthritis have produced promising results.  currently 
				curcumin-containing dietary supplements are widely used for 
				joint health. in another recent study, 
				curcumin alone (0.5 g) and in combination with diclofenac sodium 
				(0.05 g) was found to be safe and effective in 45 patients with 
				rheumatoid arthritis. furthermore, the level of crp was 
				suppressed in these patients after curcumin administration. several studies have shown the anti-arthritic effects of 
				curcumin in humans with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis 
				(ra). in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 40 
				subjects with mild-to-moderate degree knee osteoarthritis were 
				randomly assigned to receive either curcuminoid (500 mg/day in 
				three divided doses; n = 19) with 5 mg piperine added to each 
				500-mg dose or a matched placebo (n = 21) for six weeks. there 
				were significantly greater reductions in the visual analog scale 
				(vas) (p < 0.001), western ontario and mcmaster universities 
				osteoarthritis index (womac) scores (p = 0.001), and lequesnes 
				pain functional index (lpfi) (p = 0.013) scores in the treatment 
				group compared with the placebo group.  this suggests that 
				curcumin may offer an alternative to nsaids for patients with 
				osteoarthritis seeking treatment but experiencing negative side 
				effects. this was supported by results from a pilot study 
				showing that a dose of 2 grams of curcumin had an analgesic 
				effect in subjects with acute pain but without a diagnosis of 
				osteoarthritis . at this dose, the activity was higher than that 
				associated with 500 mg of acetaminophen, while a lower dose (1.5 
				g, 300 mg of curcumin) gave only transient and often inadequate 
				relief of pain, indicative of suboptimal therapeutic plasma 
				concentrations.  this supports the use of 2 g (higher than 
				needed for inflammation) curcumin for relief of pain as a 
				potential alternative to nsaids. regardless of the mechanism by 
				which curcumin elicits its effects, it does appear to be 
				beneficial to several aspects of osteoarthritis , as suggested 
				by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis that concluded: 
				this systematic review and meta-analysis provided scientific 
				evidence that 812 weeks of standardized turmeric extracts 
				(typically 1000 mg/day of curcumin) treatment can reduce 
				arthritis symptoms (mainly pain and inflammation-related 
				symptoms) and result in similar improvements in the symptoms as 
				ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium. therefore, turmeric extracts 
				and curcumin can be recommended for alleviating the symptoms of 
				arthritis, especially osteoarthritis. a recent study out of japan evaluated its relationship with the 
	inflammatory cytokine known to be involved in in the
				
rheumatoid arthritis 
	process. scientists discovered that curcumin significantly reduced these 
	inflammatory markers. in fact its anti-inflammatory qualities are so strong 
	a 2007 study compared
				
curcumin and cortisone and found they were equal in potency. a few 
	studies have found that curcumin can reduce pain from rheumatoid arthritis 
	or osteoarthritis, sometimes as much as anti-inflammatory drugs. an
				
iranian clinical trial in 
				phytotherapy research in 2014 found 
	that curcumin taken for six weeks, improved symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, 
	compared to a placebo. most 
	pharmaceutical anti-inflammatories are contraindicated to use over the 
	long-term, but turmeric is not only safe but beneficial for your overall 
	wellbeing. curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties also make it a strong candidate 
	for treating inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis.
				

a 2014 study in the 
	clinical interventions in aging found that curcumin extracts "were as 
	effective as ibuprofen for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis." all current drugs approved for arthritis have anti-inflammatory
activity. anti-tnf (tumor necrosis factor) therapy has been approved for this
disease. curcumin has been shown to both suppress the tnf production, block
the action of tnf, and have
activity against arthritis.  
when inflammation is reduced, the added benefit is 
pain relief. a double-blind, crossover study showed that curcumin may be  effective 
in relieving pain and improvements in morning stiffness, walking time, and joint 
swelling. a preliminary intervention trial that compared curcumin with a 
	nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) in 18 patients with rheumatoid 
	arthritis (ra) found that improvements in morning stiffness, walking time, 
	and joint swelling after two weeks of curcumin supplementation (1.2 g/day) 
	were comparable to those experienced after two weeks of phenylbutazone 
	(nsaid) therapy (300 mg/day). in a more recent randomized, open-label study 
	in 45 ra patients, supplementation with a mixture of all three major 
	curcuminoids (0.5 g/day for eight weeks) was found to be as effective as 
	diclofenac (nsaid; 50 mg/day) in reducing measures of disease activity, 
	tenderness, and swelling joints. 
				

				several
studies 
				have shown
				

				curcumins ability to reduce pain, stiffness, and swelling 
				in joints afflicted by arthritis. the
				

				arthritis foundation suggests that those with arthritis who 
				wish to seek relief take capsules of curcumin powder, between 
				400 mg to 600 mg, three times a day. given that curcumin is a 
				potent anti-inflammatory compound, it makes sense that it may 
				help with arthritis. several studies show this to be true. in a 
				study in people with rheumatoid arthritis, curcumin was even 
				more effective than an anti-inflammatory drug (42). many other 
				studies have looked at the effects of curcumin on arthritis and 
				noted improvements in various symptoms.  an 
				in vitro
				and ex vivo study  
				found that curcumin has anti-platelet and prostacyclin 
				modulating effects compared to aspirin, indicating it may have 
				value in patients prone to vascular thrombosis and requiring 
				anti-arthritis therapy. in a randomized, pilot study, curcumin 
				administration (500 mg, b.i.d., p.o., for 8 weeks) reduced 
				disease activity score in rheumatoid arthritis without any 
				adverse events. in addition, the effect of curcumin was better 
				than the patients receiving diclofenac sodium (chandran and goel 
				2012). in animal model, curcumin administration (100 mg/kg 
				orally for two weeks) showed anti-arthritic activity by 
				augmenting the generation of somatostatin in the small intestine 
				of freunds complete adjuvant induced arthritic rats (yang et 
				al. 2015). curcumin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the severity and 
				progression of collagen induced arthritis in dba/1 j mice by 
				decreasing the production of b cell-activating factor belonging 
				to the tnf family in spleen cells and serum as well as reduction 
				of serum il-6 and ifnc(huang et al. 2013). it reduced the pannus 
				formation process that produced through articular cartilage of 
				collagen induced arthritic rats (kamarudin et al. 2012). in in 
				vitro studies, curcumin treatment (2.510 mmol for 14 days) 
				inhibited the osteoclastogenic potential of peripheral blood 
				mononuclear cells obtained from patients with rheumatoid 
				arthritis by decreasing stimulation of erk 1/2, c-jun n-terminal 
				kinase, p38 and downregulating nuclear factor of activated t 
				cells (nfatc1), receptor activator of nf-jb and c-fos 
				expression, and reduce bone deterioration during rheumatoid 
				arthritis (shang et al. 2016b). curcumin treatment efficiently 
				blocked phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate and il-1b-induced 
				upregulation of il-6 expression in mh7a cells and 
				fibroblast-like synoviocytes. in addition, it inhibited nf-jb 
				activation, induced erk1/2 dephosphorylation, exerted strong 
				anti-inflammatory activity and induced apoptosis in 
				fibroblast-like synoviocytes, which might use as a natural 
				remedy for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (kloesch et 
				al. 2013). mechanistically, curcumin blocks certain cytokines 
				and enzymes that lead to inflammation, and this sheds light on 
				the possibility of curcumin for the treatment of rheumatoid 
				arthritis. osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis, 
				which is characterized by pain, tenderness, bone spurs, 
				stiffness, and loss of function in the joints (farzaei et al. 
				2015). in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
				prospective study, chronic administration of curcumin (180 
				mg/day, p.o., for 8 weeks) significantly reduced knee pain in 
				osteoarthritic patients as compared to the placebo group 
				(nakagawa et al. 2014). curcumin treatment showed protection 
				against osteoarthritis by inhibiting the release of inflammasome 
				nlrp3, followed by downregulation of il-1b, tnf-a and cleaved 
				caspase-1 in surgical mouse osteoarthritis model (sun et al. 
				2017). mechanistically, curcumin reduced mmp-2, mcp-1, 
				l-selectin, advanced oxidation protein product levels, 
				suppressed the release of proteoglycans, expression of 
				cyclooxygenase, prostaglandin e2 and inflammatory cytokines 
				while increased cd47 levels in chondrocytes (liu et al. 2016; 
				chin 2016).




how may curcumin work against 
				gastrointestinal and inflammatory bowel disease such as crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, 
				gastritis, dyspepsia, gastric and peptic ulcers?



curcumin demonstrates substantial 
				anti-inflammatory effects by interacting with toll-like 
				receptors and regulating mediators, such as mapk and nf-κb, 
				making it a promising therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel 
				disease (ibd). clinical trials have shown that curcumin 
				effectively induces and maintains remission in ibd patients. for 
				example, studies report significant reductions in the 
				inflammatory markers esr and crp in patients with ulcerative 
				proctitis and crohns disease following curcumin administration. 
				additionally, maintenance therapy combining curcumin with 
				sulfasalazine or mesalamine results in lower recurrence rates 
				compared to a placebo, and case reports indicate that curcumin 
				alongside prednisone can achieve clinical and endoscopic 
				remission. another clinical trial demonstrated that curcumin 
				supplementation at 1500 mg per day for eight weeks significantly 
				improves clinical conditions and reduces inflammatory markers in 
				individuals with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. 
				dose-dependent studies reveal that curcumin lowers levels of 
				mapk, nf-κb, and mmp3 while increasing il-10 and reducing 
				il-1beta, and in vivo research supports its role in inhibiting 
				the nlrp3 inflammasome. these findings underscore curcumins 
				potential as a complementary therapy for ibd. six hundred milligrams of curcumin 
				five times a day for 12 weeks to individuals with peptic ulcers 
				could prevent ulcer development. abdominal pain along with other 
				symptoms has greatly decreased with curcumin within 12 weeks. 
				kim et al. (2005) found that orally administered ethanolic 
				
				c. longa extract decreased stomach acid, gastric juice 
				secretion, and ulcer initiation in male rats by inhibiting h2 
				histamine receptors, which is similar to the effects of 
				ranitidine. similarly, the antiulcer action of 
				c. longa 
				ethanolic extract was seen as it lowers ulcer index in addition 
				to stomach acidity significantly. c. longa extract also 
				suppressed hypothermic-restraint stress depletion of stomach 
				wall mucus and diminished the severity of necrotizing 
				agent-induced lesions. curcumin significantly protects against severe colitis by inhibiting activation of nlrp3 
				inflammasomes and production of il-1β, resulting in improved 
				weight loss, reduced disease activity index and increased colon 
				length. curcumin can inhibit the production of 
				pro-inflammatory factors which is beneficial to improve 
				intestinal inflammation in patients with ibd. curcumin can 
				effectively induce and maintain symptom relief in patients with 
				ulcerative colitis, reduce inflammatory markers and improve the 
				quality of life of patients. curcumin is derived from natural 
				products, with high safety, has the capacity for 
				anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and regulating autophagy and gut 
				microbiota. curcumin is a safe and effective adjuvant agent in 
				the treatment of ibd. in patients with ibd, curcumin has a 
				beneficial effect on clinical symptoms, endoscopic relief, 
				reduction of oxidative stress or inflammatory markers. 
				alternatively, curcumin can also play a beneficial role in a 
				more common intestinal disease. irritable bowel syndrome is a 
				functional bowel disorder that classically presents with 
				symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits 
				of diarrhea or constipation. the irritable bowel syndrome 
				symptom severity score (ibs-sss) was used to evaluate the effect 
				of curcumin on patients with ibs. curcumin can effectively 
				improve ibs-sss, abdominal pain and other symptoms, and improve 
				the quality of life of patients. research suggest that the 
				beneficial effects of curcumin on ibs may be due to its 
				anti-inflammatory effect. because of its scientifically 
				evidenced characteristics to interfere with a variety of signal 
				transduction pathways, transcription factors, and cellular 
				processes, curcumin can potentially be applied in the treatment 
				of many diseases (inflammatory disorders in particular). in this 
				context, curcumin has been used to treat gastrointestinal 
				diseases such as indigestion, flatulence diarrhea, and even 
				gastric and duodenal ulcers. kwiecien and colleagues summarize 
				in their review curcumins protective effects against esophageal 
				and gastric disorders. in addition, curcumin is potentially 
				efficacious against intestinal inflammatory diseases. burge and 
				colleagues discuss the beneficial effects of curcumin on the 
				microbiome, its antimicrobial properties, changes in cytokine 
				profiles, and alterations to immune cell maturation and 
				differentiation. the combination of all these molecular actions 
				makes curcumin a promising candidate to treat intestinal 
				inflammatory diseases like necrotizing enterocolitis, crohns 
				disease, and ulcerative colitis. crohns disease is a pro-inflammatory disease. all current drugs approved
for this disease have anti-inflammatory activity. anti-tnf therapy has been
approved for this disease. curcumin has been shown to both suppress the tnf
production and the tnf action. several clinical trials suggest that curcumin can 
	help people with this inflammatory bowel disease.
				

clinical gastroenterology and hepatology featured a study in 2015 
	which found that in people with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis who took 
	standard medication (mesalamine), the addition of a high-dose curcumin 
	supplement helped half of them achieve remission after four weeks; none of 
	those given a placebo benefited. curcumin taken orally has been shown to have
activity against inflammatory bowel disease. study results 
suggest that curcumin could have a protective role in ulcerative colitis via 
regulation of oxidant/anti-oxidant balance and modulation of the release of some 
inflammatory endocoids, namely tnf-alpha and no. 
				
curcumin maintenance 
	therapy for ulcerative colitis: randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 
	placebo-controlled trial.  the development of dss-induced 
colitis was significantly attenuated by curcumin. inhibition of p38 mapk 
signaling by curcumin could explain the reduced cox-2 and inos immunosignals and 
the nitrite production in colonic mucosa, reducing the development of chronic 
experimental colitis. in addition, curcumin seems promising with regards to remission in patients with quiescent ulcerative 
colitis. preliminary evidence suggests that curcumin might be useful as an 
	add-on therapy to control disease activity. one multicenter, randomized, 
	double-blind, placebo-controlled study has examined the efficacy of curcumin 
	enema (2 g/day) in the prevention of relapse in 82 patients with quiescent 
	uc . six-month treatment with curcumin significantly reduced measures of 
	disease activity and severity and resulted in a lower relapse rate than with 
	placebo in subjects on standard-of-care medication (sulfasalazine or 
	mesalamine). in another randomized controlled trial in active uc patients 
	treated with mesalamine, the percentage of patients in clinical remission 
	was significantly higher after a one-month treatment with oral curcumin (3 
	g/day) than with placebo.
				
curcumin in 
	combination with mesalamine induces remission in patients with 
	mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis in a randomized controlled trial. 
				another
				

				study conducted in the uk revealed that those with ibs who 
				took two capsules of turmeric every day over the course of eight 
				weeks experienced less abdominal pain and had more consistent 
				bowel movements. a recent study from the
				

				american gastroenterological association suggests that 
				curcumin may help ease ulcerative colitis, a form of
				

				inflammatory bowel disease that 
				causes ulcers in the digestive tract. turmeric has been known 
				for a long time to help with digestive problems. for example, it 
				helps very well with bad digestion of fats. but even if you 
				suffer from irritable bowel syndrome or crohns disease, 
				turmeric can mean a great deal to you. this is partly because it 
				prevents inflammation in the intestinal wall. curcumin offers a 
				promising therapeutic approach by reinforcing the mucosal 
				barrier through its anti-apoptotic and antioxidant properties. 
				inhibition of caspase-3 by curcumin reduces gastric acid 
				secretion and mitigates oxidative stress, thereby protecting the 
				gastric mucosa. curcumin also exhibits antisecretory activity 
				against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), enhancing 
				gastroprotective effects. studies demonstrate that curcumin and 
				bisdemethoxycurcumin decrease inducible nitric oxide synthase 
				(inos) expression without affecting tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
				(tnf-α), thereby reducing inflammation and acid secretion. in 
				rodent models, curcumin administration increases gastric juice 
				ph, reduces neutrophil activity, and lowers oxidative stress 
				markers, showcasing anti-ulcer efficacy. additionally, curcumin 
				has demonstrated anti-helicobacter pylori effects in mouse 
				models, evidenced by significant reductions in serum il-4, 
				ifn-γ, somatostatin, gastrin, lipid peroxide, myeloperoxidase, 
				and bacterial counts, alongside increased anti-h. pylori 
				antibodies. clinically, turmeric supplementation has shown 
				significant ulcer remission and symptom improvement. the 
				potential of curcumin as a complementary therapy for peptic 
				ulcer disease is emphasized by these findings, which demonstrate 
				that it can protect and repair the gastric mucosa through 
				multifaceted mechanisms. curcumin can also 
				be a solution for people with a stomach ulcer and has a 
				significant role in cases of gastric ulcers. an open, phase ii 
				trial was performed on 25 patients with endoscopically diagnosed 
				gastric ulcer. participants were provided 600 mg powdered 
				turmeric, five times daily. after 4 weeks, ulcers had completely 
				healed in 48% patients. the success rate increased over time, 
				with 76% being ulcer free after 12 weeks of treatment. no 
				significant adverse reactions or blood abnormalities were noted. 
				in a clinical study, five patients with a stomach ulcer were 
				given five times 600 mg of curcumin every day for 12 weeks. 
				almost half of them had no stomach ulcers after four weeks, and 
				by the end of the study, the gastric ulcer had disappeared by 
				76%. in a multi-centered, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
				trial, curcumin treatment (1 g after breakfast and 1 g after the 
				evening meal with mesalamine or sulfasalazine for 6 months) 
				appeared to be a safe and promising drug candidate for 
				maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis patients (hanai et 
				al. 2006). holt et al. (2005) carried out a pilot study to see 
				how curcumin therapy affected ibd patients who had earlier 
				received standard uc or cd therapy. curcumin with standard 
				treatment exerts more beneficial effects than placebo plus 
				conventional uc treatment in maintaining recovery, according to 
				hanai et al. (2006). bundy et al. (2004) examined that abdominal 
				pain or discomfort score was lowered significantly by 22% and 
				25% in the one- and two-tablet group volunteers, respectively, 
				and revealed the role of c. longa on ibs pathology. in animal study, curcumin administration reversed 
				inflammation of the colonic mucosa, restored colonic length, and 
				reduced colonic weight and colonic damage. in addition, curcumin 
				increased the number of t regulator (treg) cells while 
				suppressed the secretion of il (2, 6, 12 and 17) and tnf-a. 
				curcumin is known to downregulate the expression of 
				co-stimulatory molecules cd254 [rankl], cd54 [icam-1], cd205, 
				cd256 [rank], tlr4 and cd252[ox40 l] against 2, 4, 
				6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid induced colitis in mice (zhao et 
				al. 2016). in a recent experimental study, curcumin 
				administration demonstrated therapeutic potential through 
				downregulation of colonic tnf-a, myeloperoxidase (mpo), p-38mapk 
				and p-p38mapk expressions in mouse murine ulcerative colitis 
				model (khoury et al. 2015). curcumin treatment is known to 
				reduce interferon (ifn)-c, cox-1, cox-2, tnf-a, nf-jb and inos 
				expression. further, it was reported that curcumin treatment 
				reduces inflammation of colon due to inhibition of chemokinesis 
				and neutrophil chemotaxis (wan et al. 2014). moreover, curcumin 
				mitigated inflammatory bowel disease via influencing mapk, erk 
				pathways, increasing antioxidants, inducing free radical 
				scavenging and mpo inhibition (baliga et al. 2012). 
				mechanistically, curcumin treatment reduced ulcerative colitis 
				by inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis, suppressing the secretion 
				of inflammatory cytokines and inducing antioxidant effects. in a 
				pilot study, administration of curcumin (350 mg, t.i.d. for 1 
				month followed by 350 mg q.i.d. for another 2 month) reduced the 
				inflammatory response in crohns disease condition. in addition, 
				it reduced the erythrocyte sedimentation rates and crohns 
				disease activity index in patients (holt, katz, and kirshoff 
				2005). oral administration of curcumin (40 mg/kg, for 21 days) 
				reversed the visceral nociceptive response to graded intensity 
				of colorectal distension and pellet output associated with 
				chronic acute combined stress mediated depressive and anxiety 
				like behaviors in rats. mechanistically, curcumin treatment 
				increased the levels of serotonin, bdnf and pcreb in the 
				hippocampus, while these levels were reduced in the colonic of 
				chronic acute combined stressed rats (yu et al. 2015). the 
				5-ht1a receptor is known to be involved in the mode of action of 
				curcumin for the management of visceral hypersensitivity in rats 
				with irritable bowel syndrome. in addition, curcumin 
				administration causes remarkable decrease in visceromotor 
				response to colorectal distension in rats (farzaei et al. 
				2016b). adjunctive therapy of curcumin (500 mg/day for 4 weeks) 
				with anti-helicobacter regimen ameliorated the symptoms of 
				dyspepsia in peptic ulcer patients (khonche et al. 2016). in 
				animal study, curcumin administration reduced the restraint 
				stress and water immersion stress-induced gastric lesions by 
				increasing gastric blood flow and attenuating pentagastrin or 
				histamine-stimulated secretion of gastric acid. in addition, the 
				expression levels of inos, cox-2 and tnf-awas significantly 
				downregulated in gastric mucosa of curcumin administered rats 
				exposed to restraint stress and water immersion stress, 
				resulting in gastroprotective effect (czekaj et al. 2016). 
				curcumin (10, 50 or 100 mg/kg orally for three days) dose 
				dependently reduced lpo and gastric ulcer area and restored gpx, 
				cat and sod levels in gastric mucosa of naproxen treated rats 
				(kim et al. 2016b). curcumin treatment reversed stress mediated 
				gastric ulceration in rats by reducing the hemorrhage of gastric 
				mucosa, increasing gastric ph values and attenuating ulcer index 
				which is associated with downregulation of histone h3 
				acetylation at h þ , k þ -atpase promoter gene (he et al. 
				2015a). curcumin treatment decreased pepsin activity, total acid 
				output and ulcer index alongside reduced mda level, ameliorated 
				mucin, cat, no and sod in gastric mucosa of indomethacin-induced 
				ulcer in rats (morsy and el-moselhy 2013). additionally, 
				curcumin ameliorated indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer by 
				inducing angiogenesis and collagenization of gastric tissue via 
				upregulation of tgf-b, mmp-2, membrane type 1-mmp and vegf 
				expressions in ulcerated tissues (sharma et al. 2012). the 
				biological mechanism of curcumin to combat peptic ulcer is 
				mainly due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. 
				the gastroprotective effect is also due to inhibition of acid 
				release, amelioration of blood flow, angiogenesis and 
				collagenization of gastric tissue (sharma et al. 2012; yadav et 
				al. 2013).  clinically, curcumin administration (40 mg orally, 
				three times a day, for four weeks) reduced the production of 
				il-1b, il-8, cox-2 and tnf-ain gastric mucosa, and attenuated 
				inflammation in gastritis patients infected with h. pylori 
				bacteria (koosirirat et al. 2010). in a randomized clinical 
				trial, administration of curcumin (700 mg orally, three times a 
				day, for 4 weeks) reduced the level of mda, dna oxidative 
				damage, endoscopic and chronic inflammation scores and glutathione peroxides in gastritis patients (judaki et al. 
				2017). in animal model, curcumin treatment downregulated the 
				expression of chemokines such as cxcl1, ccl5, cxcl10, cxcl11, 
				ccl20 and chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 25 in stomach of mice 
				bearing helicobacter pylori induced gastric inflammation. in 
				addition, curcumin decreased secretion of il-1b, il-6 and 
				tnf-aduring h. pylori infection. further, curcumin 
				supplementation reduced the macromolecular leakage, myd88 
				expression and nf-jb activation in gastric cells (santos et al. 
				2015). study suggested that antimicrobial activity of curcumin 
				against h. pylori is responsible for the management of gastritis 
				in mice (de et al. 2009). the biological effect of dietary 
				polyphenol curcumin to reduce chronic gastritis is mainly due to 
				its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activities 
				(yadav et al. 2013), therefore, it can be recommended as a novel 
				drug for management of gastritis. one open-label study evaluated 
				the efficacy of curcumin in five patients with ulcerative 
				proctitis and in five patients with crohn disease.  
				significant decrease in symptoms as well as in inflammatory 
				indices (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and crp) were observed 
				in all patients with proctitis this study suggests the efficacy 
				of curcumin against ibd. another study evaluated the efficacy of 
				curcumin as maintenance therapy in 89 patients with quiescent 
				ulcerative colitis. the relapse rates were 4.65% in the 
				curcumin-treated group and 20.51% in the placebo group. in 
				another recent study, ingestion of oral curcumin at 500 mg/day 
				along with prednisone was associated with clinical and 
				endoscopic remission in a 60-year-old woman with a 17-year 
				history of left-sided ulcerative colitis and enteropathic 
				arthropathy (34). the patient had been examined for persistently 
				active colitis in december 2009. both a clinical and endoscopic 
				evaluation confirmed the diagnosis. previously, multiple 
				mesalamine preparations, sulfasalazine, and steroid enemas had 
				not been effective, and the patient had required multiple 
				courses of steroids for disease exacerbation. she refused 
				azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and anti-tnf treatment because of 
				possible adverse effects. in addition to 40 mg of prednisone, 
				500 mg of curcumin per day was given to the patient. after 
				receiving curcumin and prednisone treatment for 1 year, the 
				patients bowel movements had gone to two per day without blood, 
				she was no longer taking steroids, and she was feeling well. she 
				remained in clinical remission at further clinical evaluations 
				in april, july, and december 2010. a colonoscopy performed in 
				september 2010 showed no ulceration and biopsies consistent with 
				chronic inactive ulcerative colitis (34). thus, based on this 
				case study, curcumin represents a viable treatment alternative 
				or adjunctive therapy in the management of chronic ulcerative 
				colitis. a recent study assessed the effect of curcumin on the 
				levels of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 mapk), 
				il-1β, il-10, and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp-3) in the gut 
				of children and adults with ibd. results indicated suppression 
				in p38 mapk activation, reduction in il-1β, and enhancement in 
				il-10 levels in curcumin-treated mucosal biopsies. furthermore, 
				dose-dependent suppression of mmp-3 in colonic myofibroblasts 
				was observed after curcumin treatment. another study conducted 
				with eight healthy participants reported that turmeric has the 
				potential to increase bowel motility and to activate 
				hydrogen-producing bacterial flora in the colon.





how may curcumin work against 
				metabolic diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic 
				syndrome, and obesity?





effect of curcumin on metabolic syndrome 
				 | the role of curcumin in reducing oxidative stress and 
				inflammation has far-reaching implications when it comes to 
				overall metabolic health. the idea that curcumin can attenuate 
				systemic inflammation has implications for metabolic syndrome 
				(mets), which includes insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, 
				hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), 
				elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), elevated 
				triglyceride levels, and obesity, especially visceral obesity. 
				curcumin has been shown to attenuate several aspects of 
				metabolic syndrome by improving insulin sensitivity, suppressing 
				adipogenesis, and reducing elevated blood pressure, 
				inflammation, and oxidative stress. in addition, there is 
				evidence that curcuminoids modulate the expression of genes and 
				the activity of enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism that 
				lead to a reduction in plasma triglycerides and cholesterol and 
				elevate hdl-c concentrations. curcumin has been shown to have a 
				role in decreasing angiogenesis and adipogenesis by suppressing 
				ccaat/enhancer-binding protein alpha and ppar expression and by 
				lowering cholesterol levels. moreover, curcumin has the ability 
				to upregulate the gene expression of pancreatic glucose 
				transporter 2 (glut2), glut3, and glut4, thus stimulating 
				insulin secretion. in a randomized double-blind 
				placebo-controlled trial with a parallel-group design, 117 
				subjects with metabolic syndrome received either 1 g curcumin 
				plus 10 mg piperine to increase absorption or a placebo. 
				analysis revealed significant reductions in serum concentrations 
				of tnf-α, il-6, transforming growth factor beta (tgf-b), and 
				monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( mcp-1) following curcumin 
				piperine supplementation. the results of this study suggest that 
				curcumin piperine supplementation significantly decreases serum 
				concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in subjects with 
				metabolic syndrome. in addition, the study looked at the 
				cholesterol-lowering properties and found that curcuminoids were 
				more effective than the placebo in reducing serum ldl-c, 
				non-hdl-c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein a 
				(lp(a)), in addition to elevating hdl-c concentrations. the 
				effects of curcuminoids on triglycerides, non-hdl-c, total 
				cholesterol, and lp(a) remained significant after adjustment for 
				baseline values of lipids and body mass index. from the same 
				study, the authors also reported markers of oxidative stress. 
				there was a significant improvement in serum sod activities (p < 
				0.001) and reduced mda (p < 0.001) and c-reactive protein (crp) 
				(p < 0.001) concentrations in the group receiving the curcumin 
				with piperine compared to the placebo group. quantitative data 
				synthesis revealed a significant effect of curcuminoids vs. 
				placebo in reducing circulating crp concentrations. the authors 
				concluded that short-term supplementation with a 
				curcuminoid-piperine combination significantly improves 
				oxidative and inflammatory status in patients with metabolic 
				syndrome. curcuminoids with piperine could therefore be regarded 
				as natural, safe, and effective crp-lowering agents. 
				inflammatory cytokines were also measured in the above study. 
				mean serum il-1β (p = 0.042), il-4 (p = 0.008), and vascular 
				endothelial growth factor (vegf) (p = 0.01) were found to be 
				significantly reduced by curcumin piperine therapy. the authors 
				suggest that the findings indicate that curcumin piperine may 
				exert immunomodulatory effects via altering the circulating 
				concentrations of il-1β, il-4, and vegf. in a randomized 
				double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, 36 obese adults 
				received either 1 g curcumin and 10 mg piperine or a placebo for 
				30 days followed by a two-week washout period, after which they 
				received the other treatment. a significant reduction in serum 
				triglyceride concentrations was observed. effect of 
				curcumin on obesity |
				obesity is inflammatory disease.
studies have suggested that properties in curcumin may have a positive effect on blood sugar 
				and blood pressure and may also promote weight loss and prevent 
				obesity. curcumin shows significant potential in obesity 
				treatment, as evidenced by its ability to promote white fat 
				conversion and its positive effects on glycemic status and 
				insulin sensitivity. it can also reduce adipose tissue 
				inflammation associated with obesity by scavenging ros while 
				also blocking nf-κb (nuclear factor-κb) activation and reducing 
				target gene expression (cox et al., 2022; pérez-torres et al., 
				2021). curcumin has been reported to modulate numerous targets that have been 
linked to obesity and insulin resistance. a meta-analysis demonstrated that 
				curcumin intake was associated with significant decreases in 
				bmi, body weight, waist circumference, and leptin, along with 
				increases in lipocalin levels (akbari et al., 2019). a 
				randomized controlled trial demonstrated that curcumin 
				supplementation positively affected adipokines, including 
				lipocalin and leptin, in obese individuals and led to reductions 
				in body weight and adiposity in the curcumin group (1 g/day) 
				(panahi et al., 2016). in addition, mice were fed a very 
				high-fat diet (vhfd) supplemented with 0.7% curcumin for 14 
				weeks and exhibited decreased body weight and average fat 
				content compared to the control group (koboziev et al., 2020). curcumin has been shown to downregulate the expression of tnf in various tissues 
				and can suppress nf-κb activation induced by a wide variety of 
				inflammatory agents through inhibition of degradation of iκbα. curcumin can inhibit the activation of ikk linked to the activation 
of nf-κb, and this leads to the suppression of expression of inflammatory 
biomarkers such as cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) and vascular endothelial growth 
factor. 4) curcumin has been shown to downregulate the expression of 
various nf-κb-regulated proinflammatory adipocytokines including chemokines 
(such as mcp-1, mcp-4, and eotaxin)  
and interleukins (il-1, il-6, and il-8). curcumin also suppressed the expression 
of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 through the inhibition of the 
transcription factor early growth response (egr)-1 gene product that has been 
closely linked with insulin resistance and obesity. 5) curcumin has been reported 
to mimic most antidiabetic drugs in that it activates ppar-γ in hepatic stellate 
cells. 6) curcumin has been shown to downregulate activation of 
c-jun nh2 terminal kinase. 7) curcumin has been shown to inhibit the wnt/β-catenin 
pathway, which is closely linked to obesity. later studies have indicated that 
curcumin inhibits wnt pathway signaling through downregulation of the 
transcription coactivator p300. another potential mechanism by which curcumin 
could inhibit β-catenin signaling is through inhibition of glycogen synthase 
kinase (gsk)-3β, which directly causes the phosphorylation of β-catenin. 
curcumin was found to inhibit gsk-3β with as little as 66 nm ic50 (32). 
8) curcumin has been shown to induce the expression of hemeoxygenase (ho)-1 
through the activation of nrf2 in pancreatic cells and thus mediate the survival 
of these cells. 9) curcumin downregulates the secretion of insulin-like growth 
factor-1 but induces the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding 
protein-3. 10) curcumin interrupts leptin signaling 
by reducing phosphorylation levels of the leptin receptor (ob-r) and its 
downstream targets. 11) curcumin suppresses gene expression of ob-r in 
hscs. 12) curcumin has been reported to increase the expression of 
adiponectin, which negatively controls obesity. a study conducted by researchers 
				at
				

				tufts university found that curcumin, the predominant 
				polyphenol in turmeric, suppressed the growth of fat tissue in 
				mice and cell models and ultimately reduce weight gain. two 
				groups of mice were fed high-fat dietsone supplemented with 500 
				mg of curcumin per kilogram of weight. the curcumin group did 
				not gain weight as the high-fat-only group.  clinically, 
				chronic administration of curcuminoids (comprising curcumin, 
				bisdemethoxycurcumin and demethoxycurcumin) significantly 
				decreased serum pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance, oxidative 
				stress burden (sahebkar et al. 2013), serum triglycerides 
				(mohammadi et al. 2013), vegf, il-1band il-4 in obese patients 
				(ganjali et al. 2014). in animal study, curcumin treatment 
				reduced the level of triglyceride and ldl-cholesterol along- 
				side increased hdl-cholesterol, which is known to ameliorate 
				lipoprotein metabolism. curcumin administration (0.05% w/w of 
				diet) markedly decreased the plasma level of free fatty acid and 
				triglyceride in the hamsters fed with high-fat diet (10% coconut 
				oil and 0.2% cholesterol w/w) (ganjali et al. 2017). curcumin 
				administration (200 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.1% carboxy methyl 
				cellulose, for 10 weeks) significantly decreased body weight, 
				adipose weight, liver weight, plasma levels of triacylglycerol, 
				lipid ratios, hepatic fat accumulation while increased hdl in 
				fructose-fed rats (maithilikarpagaselvi et al. 2016). curcumin 
				administration alone (80 mg/kg/day, p.o., for 12 weeks) 
				significantly down-regulated the hepatic expression of sterol 
				regulatory element-binding proteins-1, sterol regulatory 
				element-binding proteins-2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme 
				a reductase, mevalonate kinase, 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase, 
				7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, lanosterol synthase, sterol- 
				c4-methyl oxidase-like (sc4mol), squalene synthase, proprotein 
				convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, ldl-receptor, acetyl- 
				coenzyme a carboxylase-1, atp citrate lyase, acyl-coa syn- 
				thetase, fatty acid synthase, fatty acid desaturase-1, fatty 
				acid desaturase-2, stearoyl-coenzyme a desaturase-1, glycerol-3- 
				phosphate acyltransferase, glucose-6-phosphatase and phos- 
				phoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 in high fat diet-induced obese 
				mice. in addition, curcumin administration upregulated the 
				hepatic phosphorylation of irs-1, irs-2 and akt at serine 473 
				resulting in reversal of obesity in mice (ding et al. 2016). 
				curcumin administration (200 mg/kg body weight) with high fat 
				diet for 10 weeks significantly decreased the hepatic erk and 
				p38 signaling pathway activation as well as reduced body weight 
				in rats (maithili karpaga selvi et al. 2015). curcumin (1 g/kg) 
				along with high fat diet containing 60% of total calories from 
				fat (5.1 kcal/g diet) administration for 16 weeks significantly 
				decreased hepatic lipids levels, lipid peroxidation. curcumin 
				(100 or 400 mg/kg) along with high fat diet for 8 weeks 
				effectively reduced serum fetuin-a levels and hepatic 
				triglycerides level in obese rats. curcumin is known to inhibit 
				nf-jb activation and macrophage infiltration in adipose 
				tissue. in addition, curcumin downregulated the expression of 
				the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1, tnf-aand mcp-1 while 
				upregulated the expression of adiponectin in adipocytes 
				(bradford 2013). in in vitro assay, curcumin downregulated the 
				expression of axin, gsk-3b, ck1-a, ap-2 (mature adipocyte 
				marker) and upregulated the expression of fz2 (wnt direct 
				receptor), wnt10b, lrp5 (wnt co-receptor), c-myc and cyclin d1 
				in 3t3-l1 cells. in addition, curcumin inhibited the 
				phosphorylation of mapk, jnk, p38 and erk thereby rescue the 
				differentiation of 3t3-l1 cells into adipocytes (ahn et al. 
				2010). curcumin treatment inhibited mitotic clonal expansion 
				process and downregulated the expression of ppar-c, kruppel-like 
				factor 5 and c/ebparesulting in reduced adipocyte 
				differentiation (kim et al. 2011). mechanistically, curcumin 
				administration inhibits nf-jb activation and macrophage 
				infiltration, reduces the expression of  plasminogen 
				activator inhibitor type-1, mcp-1, tnfa, very low density 
				lipoprotein (vldl), cytokines and leptin alongside induced ho-1, 
				fatty acid oxidation, apo-a1 and adiponectin level. in addition, 
				curcumin treatment reduces the incidence of obesity and its 
				associated risk factors, mainly due to its antioxidant and 
				anti-inflammatory activities (alappat and awad 2010).
effect of curcumin on polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos)
				| the latest systematic review and meta-analysis of 
				randomized-control trials investigated a significant improvement 
				in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, the homeostasis model 
				assessment measuring insulin resistance (homa-ir), and the 
				quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (quicki) in women 
				with pcos who took curcumin in comparison with a placebo group.  
				jamilian et al. found that administration of curcumin for 12 
				weeks in women with pcos had beneficial effects on glycemic 
				control, among other things. the researchers reported that 
				reduced fasting glucose (p = 0.002) significantly increased 
				insulin sensitivity (p = 0.02), and positive alterations in 
				serum lipids (i.e., a decrease in total cholesterol (p = 0.001) 
				and ldl cholesterol (p = 0.001) and an increase in hdl 
				cholesterol levels (p = 0.01)) in comparison to patients taking 
				a placebo; in addition, curcumin supplements decreased the 
				weight of women suffering from pcos. other researchers who have 
				looked at the effects of curcumin on glycemic status, lipid 
				profile, and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp) levels 
				in overweight/obese women with pcos found that serum insulin, 
				quicki (p < 0.05), and homa-ir (p = 0.067) were significantly 
				improved in the group treated with curcumin. in contrast, the 
				differences in lipid parameters and hs-crp levels were not 
				statistically significant in the curcumin-treated group. 
				curcumin may stimulate insulin-mediated glucose uptake through 
				the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinsase (pi3k)/akt pathway, which, in 
				turn, upregulates glucose transporter 4 (glut4) in the adipocyte 
				and skeletal muscle, leading to an increase in glucose levels. 
				additionally, curcumin may also enhance glut4 and glucose uptake 
				in adipocytes. curcumin has been shown to inhibit liver 
				gluconeogenesis through modulation of 5amp-activated protein 
				kinase (ampk), thus reducing blood glucose levels. moreover, the 
				lipid-lowering potential of curcumin may be a consequence of 
				curcumins ability to decrease the circulatory levels of lipid 
				peroxides and total serum cholesterol (tc), or to increase the 
				levels of high-density lipoprotein (hdl). there are some 
				potential mechanisms that may be responsible for the beneficial 
				influence of curcumin on lipid profile; for example, curcumin 
				may suppress the expression of niemen-pick c1-like (npc1) 
				protein in the intestine, which mediates the cholesterol 
				absorption of hepatocytes. curcumin also ameliorates 
				dyslipidemia and activates the lipid metabolism pathway, which 
				elevates lipoprotein lipase activity to decrease triglyceride 
				levels. the hypothesis about the beneficial impact of curcumin 
				supplementation on women with pcos is because curcumin may 
				support the improvement in complications of pcos by regulating 
				gene expressionthat is, by increasing the gene expression of 
				superoxide dismutase (sod) and glutathione peroxidase enzymes 
				(gpx)and cellular signaling. one of the first studies on the 
				effects of curcumin on postprandial glucose and insulin 
				response, which was conducted in 2010 by wickenberg et al. 
				showed the possible effects of curcumin on postprandial insulin 
				levels. curcumin is generally assumed to improve the bodys 
				antioxidant enzymes by impacting related gene expression in 
				patients with pcos. in a randomized and double-blinded clinical 
				trial involving 67 overweight or obese female patients with 
				pcos, the effects of curcumin on gene expression of peroxisome 
				proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (pgc-1α) (p = 
				0.011) and silent information regulator 1 (sirt1) were reported. 
				sirt1 contributes to the deacetylation of the pgc-1α gene, 
				thereby increasing the rate of thermogenesis and oxidation of 
				lipids, and is also an nad+-dependent histone deacetylase in the 
				pathway of insulin secretion [15]. these results would seem to 
				suggest that curcumin may improve hormonal profiles in patients 
				with pcos due to its support of ovarian function by reducing 
				inflammation and oxidative stress. interestingly, sohrevardi et 
				al. reported that the hormonal parameter of total testosterone 
				levels and the biochemical parameters of triglycerides, hdl, and 
				total cholesterol were significantly improved in the group 
				taking curcumin together with metformin after three months in 
				comparison to the group treated with only metformin. the 
				anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin may mitigate 
				hyperandrogenism due to its possible role in glucose and lipid 
				metabolism. moreover, curcumin has the ability to lower 
				circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) and interleukin 
				6 (il-6) concentration. proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α 
				have been found to be significantly higher in pcos patients 
				[25]. moreover, curcumin may exert anti-diabetic effects by 
				increasing the gene expression of ppar-γ, which has a 
				pleiotropic impact on glucose homeostasis and insulin 
				sensitivity and controls gene expression in lipid and glucose 
				metabolism. heshmati et al. [28] reported not only reduced 
				glucose and insulin plasma levels, but also significantly 
				reduced serum dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) levels (−26.53 
				μg/dl; p = 0.035) in patients with pcos who took curcumin 
				supplements for 12 weeks in doses of 1500 mg per day in 
				comparison to the placebo patients. to date, there are few 
				studies that have assessed the influence of curcumin on the sex 
				hormones in women with pcos. regarding proinflammatory 
				cytokines, mohammadi et al. [31] investigated the therapeutic 
				effects of curcumin on tnf-α, il-6, and c-reactive protein (crp) 
				in rats with pcos. the difference between the curcumin-treated 
				group and the non-curcumin-treated rats with pcos was 
				significant. the results showed decreased il-6 and crp, and 
				interestingly, they observed decreased expression of tumor 
				necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) in the granulosa layer and 
				follicular fluid of follicles and ovarian cysts in the pcos 
				group treated with curcumin.


how may curcumin work 
				against liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
				(nafld) or metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (mafld), cirrhosis, 
				and hepatitis?


effect of 
				curcumin on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) or 
				metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (mafld)  
| 
				curcumin and its related metabolites inhibit the formation of 
				oxygen radicals and exhibit ros-scavenging effects, thereby 
				reducing dna damage (amalraj et al., 2017). curcumin was found 
				to reverse the expression of p67phox and p-erk1/2 in 
				nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase 
				enzymes, alleviating liver injury in nash-hcc mice by reducing 
				oxidative stress (afrin et al., 2017). additionally, curcumin 
				attenuated hepatic steatosis induced by a high fructose diet 
				(hfhfr) in nafld mice, as evidenced by reversing the expression 
				of cyp3a and cyp7a (exogenous and endogenous metabolizing 
				enzymes) and normalizing serum biochemical parameters (tc, tg, 
				and nefa) in the fatty liver state. these effects contributed to 
				the restoration of hepatic metabolic capacity (yan et al., 
				2018).these findings suggest that curcumin exerts beneficial 
				effects on various aspects of oxidative stress in nafld. curcumin and related phenolics have been linked with the 
				inhibition of lipid peroxidation, free radical formation (e.g., 
				neutralization of superoxide, peroxyl, and hydroxyl radicals 
				(ross), nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite (rns)) and dna damage. curcumin may have 
				therapeutic potential in mafld patients. jalali et al. included 
				nine relevant randomized controlled trials (rcts) in their 
				meta-analysis in order to study the effects of curcumin 
				supplements on metabolic markers and anthropometric parameters 
				in patients with nafld. the use of curcumin in the 
				analyzed studies had a beneficial effect on both metabolic and 
				anthropometric parameters in patients with nafld. curcumin administration (60 
				mg/kg for 4 weeks) inhibited the bio- synthesis of unsaturated 
				fatty acids and fatty acids synthesis in ethanol treated mice. 
				in addition, ethanol induced hepatic steatosis was reversed by 
				curcumin treatment (guo et al. 2017). animal studies have shown 
				that curcumin administration reduced the ethanol-induced 
				increase in mda content, decreases the levels of aspartate 
				aminotransferase (ast) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and 
				increases the gsh levels. in addition, it is known to reduce 
				fatty liver, oxidative stress, inflammation and necrosis (nabavi 
				et al. 2014; ghorbani, hajizadeh, and 
				hekmatdoost 2016). in 
				randomized placebo-controlled trial, curcumin administration (70 
				mg/day for two months) significantly reduced the liver fat 
				content, triglycerides, ldl-cholesterol, serum levels of total 
				cholesterol, body mass index, alt, ast, glycated hemoglobin and 
				glucose in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as 
				compared to placebo group (rahmani et al. 2016). additionally, 
				curcumin upregulated the expression of adiponectin precursor and 
				reduced its methylation in experimental model of fatty liver 
				disease (park et al. 2016). in methionine and choline feed 
				deficient mouse model, curcumin administration inhibited the 
				activation of nf-kb and reduced the inflammatory recruitment in 
				steatohepatitis (leclercq et al. 2004). curcumin administration 
				downregulated the intrahepatic expression of procollagen type 
				i, cd11b, tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (timp)-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and a-smooth muscle-actin in 
				methionine and choline feed deficient mouse model of 
				steatohepatitis alongside reduced the oxidative stress in 
				cultured stellate cells (vizzutti et al. 2010).  curcumin 
				administration reduced the serum hepatic markers viz., ast, alt 
				and mda thereby attenuated lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine 
				induced liver damage in rats. in the same study, curcumin 
				administration reduced the nf-jb activation and tnf-a level in 
				liver and serum. furthermore, curcumin upregulated 
				nrf-2-dependent antioxidant defense genes like quinone (nqo-1), 
				nad(p)h dehydrogenase, glutamate-cysteine ligase and heme 
				oxygenase-1 which is responsible for the hepatoprotective 
				activity (xie et al. 2017). curcumin administration ameliorated 
				the barrier integrity of intestine, reduced ectopic fat 
				deposition in liver and modulated the gut microbiota which in 
				turn reversed hepatic steatosis in high fat diet fed rats (feng 
				et al. 2017). curcumin administration elicited hepatoprotective 
				effect via reversal of reduced gpx, cat and sod levels in 
				tartrazine induced liver injury. in addition, it reduced the 
				intracellular vacuolization, dilation of central vein and 
				sinusoids as well as necrosis in hepatotoxic rats (el-desoky et 
				al. 2017). recent experimental evidence suggests that curcumin 
				administration reduced gr1hi monocytes infiltration in liver, 
				downregulated the expression of mcp-1, tnf-aand tgf-b1 in mouse 
				model of ccl 4 induced liver fibrosis (huang et al. 2016b). 
				effect of curcumin on cirrhosis |  it was reported that curcumin 
				administration prevents bile duct ligation induced cirrhosis in 
				rats via inhibition of oxidative stress and downregulation of 
				tgf-b(reyes-gordillo et al. 2008). curcumin administration ameliorated the functional properties of 
				hepatocytes and downregulated the expression of nf-jb and inos 
				in liver of biliary duct ligated rats (barta et al. 2015). 
				effect of curcumin on hepatotoxic ailments 
				| curcumin is said to increase apoptosis in injured hepatocytes 
				while also reducing inflammatory effects, hepatic fibrogenesis, 
				and substantially liver injury. the hepatoprotective attribute 
				of curcumin might be due to direct free radical scavenging 
				mechanisms, boosting glutathione levels, and assisting in liver 
				detoxification. curcumin has hepatoprotective activity similar 
				to that of silymarin. from studies, it can be concluded that 
				curcumin  has hepatoprotective potential in various 
				including carbon tetrachloride (ccl4), acetaminophen (paracetamol) 
				and galactosamine. this hepatoprotective effect is mainly a 
				observed due to the antioxidant activity of curcumin along with 
				its ability to decrease the formation of proinflammatory 
				cytokines. administration of curcumin is resulted in decrease of 
				liver injury. aflatoxin-induced biliary hyperplasia, lipid 
				alterations, and necrosis were likewise cured by curcumin. 
				sodium curcuminate is a salt of curcumin that has choleretic 
				effects, boosting biliary excretion of bile salts, cholesterol, 
				bilirubin, and bile solubility, thus helping to prevent and 
				treat cholelithiasis. this could be related to the antioxidant 
				capacity of curcumins phenolic groups. tacrine is well-known 
				for its hepatotoxic and t-cell-destructive properties. curcumin 
				was over ten times more efficient than standard therapy, 
				ascorbic acid, in research involving human hepatocytes cells 
				that had been disrupted by tacrine (song et al., 2001).effect of curcumin on hepatitis | a recent 
				in vitro study demonstrated that curcumin treatment time and 
				dose dependently reduce the expressions of hepatitis b virus 
				surface antigen and e-antigen in hepatitis b virus transfected 
				hepg2.2.15 cell line. in addition, curcumin inhibited 
				replication of hepatitis b virus gene via down-regulation of 
				cccdna-bound histone acetylation (wei et al. 2017). study 
				revealed that curcumin treatment inhibits hepatitis b virus via 
				downregulation of the metabolic coactivator peroxisome 
				proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha 
				(pgc-1a). it has been reported that combination of 
				nucleotide/nucleoside analog with curcumin can synergistically 
				reduce the replication of hepatitis b virus (nabavi et al. 2014; 
				mouler rechtman et al. 2010). it was reported 
				that co-incubation of hepatitis c virus with curcumin and its derivatives 
				potently inhibits the entry of all major hepatitis c virus genotypes. curcumin affects the membrane fluidity 
				resulting in impairment of viral binding and fusion thereby 
				inhibits cell-to-cell transmission in human liver cells 
				(colpitts et al. 2014). co-administration of curcumin and 
				ifn-a profoundly inhibited hepatitis c virus replication in huh7 cells and 
				found to be effective against hepatitis c virus infections (kim et al. 2010). 
				moreover, curcumin exhibited anti-hcv activity by inducing ho-1 
				and modulating erk and nf-jb activities in huh7.5 cells 
				expressing the hepatitis c virus genotype 1 b subgenomic replicon (chen et al. 
				2012). mechanistically, curcumin shows hepatoprotective action 
				due to its antioxidant effects and inhibitory activity against 
				nf-jb that is known to regulate different pro-fibrotic and 
				pro-inflammatory cytokines. additionally, curcumin supple- 
				mentation reduced liver marker enzymes, cholesterol levels and 
				replication of hepatitis b and c viruses (nabavi et al. 2014).


how may curcumin work as 
				an antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, and antifungal?


curcumin has antiviral potential (von 
				rhein et al., 2016) even for hiv; inhibiting hiv-1 ltr promoter 
				directed gene expression with no effect on cell viability 
				(ashraf, 2018). curcumin had moderate effectiveness towards 
				
				plasmodium falciparum and leishmania organisms. 
				the ethanol extracts exhibit anti-entamoeba histolytica 
				activity while curcumin has anti-p. falciparum and 
				anti-leishmania effect in vitro. curcumin seems to have 
				its antiviral activity for epsteinbarr virus and hiv (taher et 
				al., 2003). an extract of c. longa in both aqueous and ethanol 
				is used in aquaculture as a treatment for bacterial infections (sahu 
				et al., 2005). curcumin exerts anti-parasitic action against 
				african trypanosomes, has schistosomicidal activities against
				schistosoma mansoni adult worms, and has anti-malarial 
				in addition to nematocidal effects. curcumin has shown a wide 
				range of antiviral activity against different viral models. 
				similar to these reports, our findings indicated that curcumin 
				inhibits sars-cov-2 d614g strain which contains the most 
				widespread amino acid change (d614g in the spike protein) 
				carried by more than 99% of the prevalent variants since the 
				beginning of 2020. according to previous reports, curcumin 
				exhibited moderate selectivity for pre-infection and 
				post-infection treatment strategies. contrarily, low selectivity 
				was obtained for prepost infection treatment and co-treatment 
				strategies. curcumin inhibited sars-cov-2 d614g strain by 
				pre-infection treatment of vero e6 cells. this effect has also 
				been observed with other enveloped viruses such as influenza, 
				dengue, zika, chikungunya, japanese encephalitis, pseudorabies, 
				and vesicular stomatitis virus, showing that curcumin treatment 
				affects the early stages of the replicative cycle, such as viral 
				attachment, internalization, fusion, or decapsidation. with 
				regard to sars-cov-2, spike protein binds to its human receptor 
				ace2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) through its 
				receptor-binding domain. previous studies have reported a 
				favorable binding affinity of curcumin to the spike protein and 
				its cell receptor, ace2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme). 
				according to the above, it could be suggested that curcumin 
				prevents the recognition of the target cell and subsequent 
				sars-cov-2 entry by direct interaction with cell factors or 
				viral proteins. this effect could be related to our results 
				obtained by co-treatment which suggest a possible virucidal 
				activity of curcumin against sars-cov-2 d614g strain. it has been demonstrated 
				that curcumin as a plant derivative has a wide range of 
				antiviral activity against a variety of viruses including 
				parainfluenza virus type 3 (piv-3), feline infectious 
				peritonitis virus (fipv), vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv), 
				herpes simplex virus (hsv), flock house virus (fhv), and 
				respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) assessed by mtt test showed 
				the potent antiviral activity of curcumin and its bioconjugates 
				against different viral pathogens for further studies. curcumin 
				showed the anti-influenza activity against influenza viruses 
				pr8, h1n1, and h6n1. the results showed more than 90% reduction 
				in virus yield in cell culture using 30 μm of curcumin. in h1n1 
				and also h6n1 subtypes, the inhibition of haemagglutinin 
				interaction reflected the direct effect of curcumin on 
				infectivity of viral particles and this has proved by time of 
				drug addiction experiment. additionally, unlike amantadine, 
				viruses developed no resistance to curcumin.  there are 
				several studies illustrate that curcumin can impede viral 
				replication and prevent injuries caused by several virus 
				infectious diseases in particular, for rna virus infections. in 
				vitro and in vivo results have shown that curcumin effectively 
				moderates infections and symptoms caused by the hepatitis virus, 
				respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), human immunodeficiency virus 
				(hiv/aids),  zika virus, chikungunya virus, epstein barr 
				virus, papilloma virus (hpv), enterovirus (enterovirus), 
				japanese encephalitis virus, influenza virus, dengue virus, and 
				coronavirus (such as sars-covid 19) in recent studies that have 
				calculated and simulated molecular docking models for viral 
				infections, the results showed that the curcumin molecule can 
				directly interact with proteins of ebola virus, influenza virus, 
				aids viruses, dengue virus, and human papillomavirus (hpv), etc. 
				the combination of curcumin with viral coat proteins, 
				virus-specific enzymes, or rna polymerase can affect and abolish 
				virus replication, infection, and damage to cells. antimicrobial activities for curcumin and rhizome 
				extract of c. longa against different bacteria, viruses, 
				fungi, and parasites have been reported. the promising results 
				for antimicrobial activity of curcumin made it a good candidate 
				to enhance the inhibitory effect of existing antimicrobial 
				agents. curcumin has shown antibacterial activity effectively 
				against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella paratyphi, 
				trichophyton gypseum, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. the 
				antibacterial activity of the aqueous extracts from turmeric is 
				believed to be due to the anionic constituents like nitrate, 
				sulphates, chlorides, and thiocyanate. antibacterial activity of curcumin was also studied 
				in endodontic bacteria streptococcus mutans, actinomyces 
				viscosus, lactobacillus casei, porphyromonas gingivalis, 
				prevotella intermedia, and enterococcus faecalis, and a 
				significant inhibition of bacterial growth was observed. many 
				studies have revealed that curcumin and turmeric extracts 
				inhibit the growth of microorganisms. curcumin has antibacterial 
				effects on both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, such as: 
				staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella, 
				escherichia coli, helicobacter pylori, etc., which often cause 
				human infectious diseases. in preclinical and clinical studies 
				for sepsis treatment, i.e. systemic bacterial infections, 
				curcumin can act on pi3k/akt, nfκb, tnf-α and tgf-β1 pathways to 
				attenuate the toxicity of lps on sepsis and curcumin also exerts 
				the protective role in the lungs, liver, and kidneys while 
				reducing the sequelae of tissue fibrosis after sepsis.  
				curcumin is very effective against several pathogenic gram +ve 
				bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus 
				epidermidis and enterococcus species that cause many infections 
				such as skin problems, pneumonia, meningitis, and urinary tract 
				infection. the study of curcumin against 14 strains of candida 
				including 4 atcc strains and 10 clinical isolates showed that 
				curcumin is a potent fungicide compound against candida species 
				with mic values range from 250 to 2000 μg/ml. in another study, 
				anti-candida activity of curcumin was demonstrated against 38 
				different strains of candida. a recent study revealed that, 
				curcumin exhibited in vitro antibacterial activity against most 
				prevalent organisms like enterococcus faecalis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces viscosus, 
				lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans and aggregatibacter 
				actinomycetemcomitans (mandroli and bhat 2013). moreover, 
				curcumin demonstrated its effectiveness against 
				bacillus 
				subtilis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli, 
				helicobacter pylori, staphylococcus intermedius, sarcina 
				lutea, sarcina lutea and neiserria gonorrhoeae (tyagi et al. 
				2015; marathe et al. 2011). curcumin treatment reduced growth of 
				gut microbiota like bifidobacterium, e. 
				faecalis, bifidobacterium. pseudocatenulatum g4, bifidobacterium. 
				longum bb536,e. coli k-12, lactobacillus acidophilus and 
				lactobacillus casei thereby inducing the susceptibility to 
				infectious disease (marathe et al. 2011). curcumin inhibited the 
				growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. 
				curcumin effectively reduced the infectious disease caused by 
				various species of staphylococcus aureus (tong et al. 
				2015;teowetal.2016). mechanistically, curcumin interfere with 
				quorum sensing, virulence and biofilm initiation, and inhibits 
				bacterial cell by suppressing its dynamic assembly. curcumin 
				demonstrated its effectiveness against parasites like 
				
				trypanosoma, plasmodium and giardia. in parasites culture, 
				curcumin treatment induced dna damage via its prooxidant 
				activity and inhibited histone acetyltransferases in 
				
				plasmodium falciparum resulted in cytotoxicity, which can 
				be targeted for treatment of malaria (cui, miao, and cui 2007), 
				revealing its therapeutic potential against cerebral malaria as 
				adjunctive therapy (mimche, taramelli, and vivas 2011). curcumin 
				induced dna damage and apoptosis and effectively inhibited the 
				growth of giardia lamblia (perez-arriaga et al. 2006). 
				moreover, curcumin administration mediates anti-parasitic 
				activity against trypanosoma, a parasite which is 
				responsible for sleeping sickness and chagas disease (marathe et 
				al. 2011). the biological effect of curcumin to reduce these 
				infections is mainly due to its pro-oxidant and apoptotic 
				activities, therefore, it can be recommended as a novel drug for 
				management of giardia, trypanosoma and plasmodium 
				infections. curcumin treatment upregulated the transcription of 
				chitin synthase-1, chitin synthase-3 and pkc in 
				sporothrix 
				schenckii thus reduced virulence in infected mice (huang et 
				al. 2016a). curcumin induced photodynamic inactivation of the 
				fungus candida albicans in murine model of oral 
				candidiasis (dovigo et al. 2013). also, curcumin exhibited 
				therapeutic potential against oropharyngeal candidiasis in a 
				mouse model (karaman et al. 2011). in fungal cell cultures, 
				curcumin inhibited the growth of wide range of pathogenic fungus 
				that includes aspergillus clavatus, aspergillus terreus, 
				aspergillus tamarii, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus flavus 
				imi190443,  aspergillus nomius atcc 15546, aspergillus 
				fumigatus atcc 16913, paracoccidioides brasiliensis b339, 
				paracoccidioides brasiliensis mg04, paracoccidioides 
				brasiliensis 17, paracoccidioides brasiliensis 608, 
				paracoccidioides brasiliensis pb18, paracoccidioides 
				brasiliensis pb01, paracoccidioides brasiliensis mg05, 
				sporothrix schenckii atcc 10212, cryptococcus neoformans atcc 
				32608, candida dubliniensis (cd28), candida dubliniensis (cd22), 
				candida glabrata atcc 2001, candida parapsilosis atcc 20019, 
				candida krusei atcc 20298, candida tropicalis atcc 750 and 
				candida albicans atcc 18804 (martins et al. 2008). curcumin 
				(500 mg/l) also exhibited antifungal effects against 
				
				phytophthora infestans, pu. recondite and rhizoctonia 
				solani (kim, choi, and lee 2003). curcumin demonstrated 
				fungicidal activity against the clinical isolates of candida 
				species like candida tropicalis, candida kefyr, candida 
				krusei, candida guilliermondii, candida glabrata, candida 
				parapsilosis and candida albicans at mic value of 
				32128 mg/ml (zorofchian moghadamtousi et al. 2014). the 
				suggested anti-fungal mechanisms of curcumin includes the 
				leakage of intracellular component through the flappy membrane, 
				disruption of fungal plasma membrane, generation of oxidative 
				stress, induction of early apoptosis, inhibition hyphae 
				development, upregulation of chitin synthase and pkc etc. (lee 
				and lee 2014; sharma et al. 2010). these evidences on the 
				mechanistic action of curcumin could be employed in improving 
				the treatment strategies for fungal infections. a recent study 
				has shown that the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects 
				conferred by curcumin protect from human cytomegalovirus 
				infection in balb/c mice (lv et al. 2014). among various 
				phytochemicals evaluated for antiviral activity against 
				norovirus, curcumin exhibited most potent anti-noroviral 
				effects. in a cell culture infection model, curcumin exposure 
				for 3 days was found to reduce norovirus infectivity by 91%. 
				thus, curcumin might be a promising anti-noroviral candidate to 
				prevent foodborne illness (yang et al. 2016).  curcumin 
				demonstrated promising anti-influenza activity against influenza 
				viruses pr8, h1n1 and h6n1 by interfering with viral 
				hemagglutination activity (chen et al. 2010; dao et al. 2012; ou 
				et al. 2013). in dengue infected bhk-21 cells, curcumin 
				administration reduced the number of plaques produced, 
				intracellular accumulation of viral proteins and increased the 
				level of lys48 ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in dengue virus 
				(padilla-s et al. 2014). in in vitro assays, curcumin 
				demonstrated potent antiviral effect against human enterovirus 
				71 (ev71). curcumin inhibited viral rna synthesis and expression 
				of viral protein, thereby decreasing production of viral progeny 
				(qin et al. 2014). proteomics analysis indicated that curcumin 
				(15240 lm) pretreatment exert antiviral activity by 
				downregulating heat shock cognate 71 and inhibited the 
				replication of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (jeong et al. 
				2015). on the other hand, curcumin exhibited remarkable 
				antiviral effects against herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) by 
				blocking the recruitment of rna polymerase ii and expression of 
				viral immediate-early genes (kutluay et al. 2008). in another 
				study, curcumin and its metallo derivatives, viz. 
				gallium-curcumin and cu-curcumin also exhibited remarkable 
				anti-hsv-1 activity in vitro (zandi et al. 2010). moreover, 
				curcumin administration conferred significant protection against 
				intra-vaginal hsv-2 infection (bourne et al. 1999). curcumin 
				inhibited both hiv-1 (ic 50 -100mm) and hiv-2 protease (ic 50 
				-250mm) thereby suppressed the replication of viral genes and 
				prevent multiplicity of hiv (sui et al. 1993). curcumin mediated 
				inhibition of hiv protease and integrase (ic 50 40 mm) resulted 
				in anti-retroviral activity (mazumder et al. 1997; mazumder et 
				al. 1995). curcumin induced anti-hiv activity can be attributed 
				to degradation of tat via proteosomal pathway and inhibition of 
				tat protein acetylation by p300/creb-binding 
				protein thereby sup- pressed hiv-1 multiplication (ali and 
				banerjea 2016; balasubramanyam et al. 2004). curcumin 
				demonstrated strong anti-hpv activity in cervical and oral 
				cancer cells through downregulation of hpv oncogene expression 
				(e6 and e7) of highly oncogenic hpv, hpv-16 and hpv-18 (divya 
				and pillai 2006; mishra and das 2015; prusty and das 2005). 
				curcumin downregulated the transcription factor, ap-1 in hela 
				cells which is critical for transcription of hpv-16 and hpv-18 
				(prusty and das 2005). curcumin mediated downregulation of viral 
				oncogenes is attributed to its ability to modulate apoptosis and 
				prevent nfkb and ap- 1 translocation thereby suppressing the 
				transcription of hpvs (divya and pillai 2006; prusty and das 
				2005). curcumin exhibited potent antiviral effect against 
				coxsackie virus by inhibiting viral replication, rna expression 
				and protein synthesis via ubiquitin-proteasome system mediated 
				protein modification or degradation (si et al. 2005; si et al. 
				2007). mechanistically, curcumin treatment downregulated jund 
				protein, reduced production of infective viral particles, 
				downregulated genomic transcription and translation, inhibited 
				viral oncoproteins e6 and e7 expressions, suppressed the 
				akt/sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (srebp)- 1 
				pathway, increased p53 level, inhibited hemagglutination, 
				inhibited proteases, integrase and tat protein acetylation 
				(zorofchian moghadamtousi et al. 2014; mazumder et al. 1995; 
				balasubramanyam et al. 2004; dutta, ghosh, and basu 2009). the 
				extensive research on antiviral activities of curcumin against 
				different viral pathogens nominates this compound as a potent 
				antiviral drug candidate. curcumin, a polyphenolic compound from 
				turmeric, has shown promising antimalarial potential through 
				multiple mechanisms. preclinical studies indicate that curcumin 
				inhibits the histone acetyl transferase (hat) enzyme and 
				generates reactive oxygen species (ros) within the malaria 
				parasite, leading to cellular damage and reduced parasitemia. 
				notably, curcumin effectively targets chloroquine-resistant 
				plasmodium falciparum with an ic₅₀ of 
				approximately 5 µm and significantly decreases parasitic loads 
				and increases survival rates in plasmodium berghei-infected 
				mice. additionally, curcumin enhances the efficacy of 
				traditional antimalarial drugs, like α,β-arteether, resulting in 
				100% survival and protection against recrudescence when 
				combined. mechanistically, curcumin mitigates cerebral malaria 
				by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α, il-1β, 
				il-6, and ifn-γ, thereby preventing bloodbrain barrier 
				disruption and neuronal injury. furthermore, combinations of 
				curcumin with bioavailability enhancers, like piperine, have 
				shown enhanced antimalarial effects by increasing ros 
				production, which is cytotoxic to plasmodium parasites. 
				curcumin, the primary curcuminoid in turmeric, has long been 
				recognized for its antimicrobial properties, complementing its 
				well-documented anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. 
				curcumin combats bacterial infections through multiple 
				mechanisms, including the inhibition of ftsz, a crucial enzyme 
				for bacterial cell division, and the disruption of bacterial 
				cell membranes due to its amphipathic nature. these actions 
				render curcumin effective against both gram-positive and 
				gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli and 
				staphylococcus aureus. additionally, curcumin impedes 
				biofilm formation in pathogens, like pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
				enhancing the efficacy of conventional antibiotics and offering 
				a promising strategy against antibiotic-resistant strains. 
				beyond antibacterial effects, curcumin exhibits antiviral 
				activity, demonstrated by its ability to interfere with viral 
				entry and replication processes in herpes simplex virus type 1 
				(hsv-1), thereby reducing viral load and infection severity. 
				curcumin also shows potential against helicobacter pylori, 
				effectively lowering bacterial counts and mitigating 
				infection-related inflammation in preclinical models. curcumin 
				exhibits substantial antimicrobial properties, making it an 
				effective natural agent against a variety of pathogens including 
				bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites (jena et al., 2020). the 
				primary bioactive metabolite, curcumin, along with other 
				metabolites in the rhizome, disrupts the integrity of microbial 
				cell membranes, leading to cell content leakage and death. this 
				mechanism is particularly effective against bacteria and fungi, 
				compromising their essential structures and functions 
				(tran-trung et al., 2023). additionally, curcumin interferes 
				with viral replication processes and inhibits biofilm formation, 
				a defense mechanism that makes pathogens resistant to 
				conventional treatments (shenge et al., 2021).

effect of curcumin on 
				covid-19 |  current research results 
				show that curcumin can inhibit sars and covid 19 infections via 
				molecular binding, and currently curcumin is also applied in 
				clinical trial on covid 19 infection. curcumin, known to 
				activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (ppar-γ), 
				plays a crucial role in modulating the cytokine storm associated 
				with covid-19, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent 
				(ciavarella et al., 2020). ppar-γ, a nuclear receptor, is 
				instrumental in regulating inflammatory and immune responses. 
				the engagement of ppar-γ by curcumin may represent a strategic 
				approach to mitigate the severe inflammatory reactions observed 
				in covid-19 patients. research has demonstrated curcumins 
				efficacy in activating ppar-γ, leading to reduced inflammation 
				across various pathological conditions (de oliveira et al., 
				2022). additionally, bormann et al. (2021) highlighted 
				curcumins potential against sars-cov-2, where an aqueous 
				extract from curcumin was shown to completely neutralize the 
				virus in vitro at a dilution of 1:32, without causing cytotoxic 
				effects in calu-3 and vero e6 cells. moreover, at a 
				concentration of 14 μg/ml, curcumin significantly reduced 
				sars-cov-2 rna levels in the supernatant of these cells. these 
				studies suggest that curcumin and the extracts from c. longa 
				l. might interfere with the interaction between the 
				sars-cov-2 spike protein and its ace2 receptor on host cells. 
				furthermore, curcumins therapeutic potential extends to 
				influenza a virus (iav). in a dose-dependent study by dai et al. 
				(2018), in vitro treatment with 150 and 50 mg/kg of curcumin 
				resulted in decreased lung injury and reduced iav replication. 
				this finding was corroborated by han et al. (2018), who 
				administered curcumin to mice at doses of 30 or 100 mg/kg 
				post-iav infection, observing enhanced survival rates and 
				diminished viral load in lung tissues.curcumin presents a 
				multifaceted therapeutic potential by modulating these 
				inflammatory pathways. it inhibits the nlrp3 inflammasome, 
				thereby reducing the excessive inflammatory response. 
				additionally, curcumin regulates treg and th17 cell populations, 
				lowering inflammatory markers and mitigating immune 
				dysregulation in covid-19 patients. preclinical studies 
				demonstrate curcumins ability to inhibit sars-cov-2 entry into 
				cells, impede viral replication, and reduce inflammatory 
				mediator production, which collectively diminish disease 
				severity. clinical trials further support these findings, 
				showing that curcumin supplementation improves oxygen levels, 
				reduces hospital stays, and accelerates recovery in covid-19 
				patients. moreover, combination therapies involving curcumin and 
				other agents, such as piperine, have been shown to enhance 
				clinical outcomes and reduce mortality rates. recent research 
				also highlights specific curcuminoids, like me08 and me23, for 
				their antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting their 
				potential in targeting both the virus and the hosts 
				inflammatory response. these integrated actions of curcumin 
				underscore its potential as an effective adjuvant therapy for 
				covid-19, addressing both viral replication and the detrimental 
				hyperinflammatory response. curcumin, a natural compound with 
				anti-inflammatory effect, could as an adjuvant drug in covid-19 
				treatment. curcumin has been revealed to be linked to the viral 
				s1 protein, which is required for sars-cov-2 entry in an in 
				silico approach; thus, it may inhibit cytokine storm in the 
				severe stage of covid-19 (pawitan, 2020).  curcumin can inhibit sars-cov replication. several studies suggest that curcumin can 
				inhibit sars-cov-2 replication. evidence has already emerged 
				regarding the action of curcumin in sars-associated corona virus 
				(sars co-v) by directly interacting with viral proteins, 
				disrupting the viral envelope, inhibiting viral proteases and 
				modulating nfkb, nrf2 and high mobility group box 1(hmgb1) 
				pathways in vitro. sars-cov-2 (covid-19) has nearly 79% 
				resemblance to sars co-v and hence the postulation. curcumin can block the 
				interaction between the spike glycoprotein and 
				angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) and inhibit the nsp15 
				protein, therefore blocking replication of the virus or 
				inhibiting viral protease. these observations were supported by 
				a study by han et al. who demonstrated that curcumin strongly 
				inhibited tgev proliferation and viral protein expression in a 
				dose and time-dependent manner, and treatment with curcumin 
				caused a reduction in both viral particles (ic50 of 8.6 μm) and 
				protein levels in porcine kidney cells. this study suggested 
				that curcumin may inhibit the adsorption of tgev or that it 
				possesses excellent virucidal activity.  compared to the placebo group, 
				curcumin could reduce the frequency of th17 cells, treg and 
				their related inflammatory factors in both mild and severe 
				covid‐19 patients. in addition to anti-inflammatory effect, 
				curcumin can also play an antiviral role by inhibiting 
				sars-cov-2 entry into cells and inhibiting viral proliferation. 
				curcumin has a variety of pharmacological effects and high 
				safety, which makes it an adjunctive drug for the treatment of 
				covid-19. in a clinical trial, orally administered curcumin with 
				piperine as adjuvant therapy in covid-19 treatment could 
				substantially reduce morbidity and mortality, and improve 
				clinical symptoms.  curcumin effectively neutralized 
				sars-cov-2 at subtoxic concentrations in vero e6 and human 
				calu-3 cells. furthermore, curcumin treatment significantly 
				reduced sars-cov-2 rna levels in cell culture supernatants. this 
				data uncovers curcumin as a promising compound for complementary 
				covid-19 treatment. curcumin concentrations contained in 
				turmeric root or capsules used as nutritional supplements 
				completely neutralized sars-cov-2 in vitro. due to the antiviral 
				as well as anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin, the compound 
				might have a positive effect on covid-19 progression. curcumin 
				potently neutralizes sars-cov-2 in vitro at low subtoxic 
				concentrations. the good safety profile of curcumin and its 
				immunomodulatory as well as the antiviral effect make curcumin a 
				promising candidate for complementary treatment of covid-19. 



				how may curcumin work against depression, major depressive 
				disorder, and anxiety?

















curcumin, renowned for its 
				anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, has a wide range 
				of characteristics that are important to depression pathogenesis 
				and presents a promising therapeutic option for alleviating 
				depressive symptoms. by inhibiting the nlrp3 inflammasome, 
				curcumin reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
				thereby mitigating the inflammatory processes associated with 
				depression. preclinical studies demonstrate that curcumin 
				administration reverses depressive-like behaviors in stressed 
				rodents by restoring neurotransmitter levels, including 
				serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and modulating the 
				serotonergic system through 5-ht receptors. additionally, 
				curcumin enhances the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) 
				pathway, promoting neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, 
				which are critical for mood regulation. clinical trials support 
				these findings, with curcumin supplementation showing reductions 
				in inflammatory markers and improvements in depressive symptoms. 
				these integrated actions of curcumin underscore its potential as 
				a multifaceted adjunct therapy for depression, targeting both 
				inflammatory pathways and neurochemical imbalances to enhance 
				mental health outcomes.the extract prevented the decrease in serotonin, noradrenalin, 
				and dopamine concentrations while increasing serotonin turnover, 
				cortisol levels, and serum corticotrophin-releasing factor 
				levels (xia et al., 2007). the consequences of orally 
				administered curcumin seem on behavior under chronic stress or 
				depression condition in the rat model. curcumin administration 
				showed a similar impact to imipramine, a known antidepressant 
				drug, and it has been indicated by various authors to be a 
				feasible alternative source in depression condition (mohammed et 
				al., 2019; qi et al., 2020). curcumin has anti-inflammatory, 
				antioxidant and neurotrophic properties, suggesting it has 
				strong potential for relieving depression. curcumins 
				anti-inflammatory effect is one reason for its improvement in 
				depression. in addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, 
				curcumin also inhibits the release of monoamine oxidase, 
				serotonin and dopamine, and regulates the hypothalamus pituitary 
				adrenal axis, neurotrophic factors, and hippocampal neurogenesis 
				and neuroplasticity. administration of curcumin decrease mrna 
				expression of proinflammatory cytokines il-1β, il-6, and tnf-α, 
				through down-regulation il-1β/nf-κb signaling,105 inhibit the 
				nlrp3 inflammasome activation. curcumin improves il-1β-induced 
				neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the p38 pathway in a 
				meta-analysis of nine clinical trials, curcumin may improve 
				symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with depression. 
				in randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adjuvant 
				curcumin (doses increased from 500 mg/day to 1500 mg/day) showed 
				a significant difference between curcumin and placebo at weeks 
				12 and 16. the core issue of depression has been identified as 
		inflammation, and
				
curcumin has been found to be comparable to prescription antidepressant 
	drugs. in
				

				one  study published in 
				phytotherapy research, 
	scientists studied 60 patients with serious depression over a six-week trial 
	and found that turmeric was as effective at treating depression as prozac.  
	this randomized control trial took 60 volunteers diagnosed 
	with major depressive disorder and compared the effect of
				
curcumin to fluoxetine (prozac). researchers discovered that the 
	principal curcuminoid in turmeric is not only as effective as prozac in 
	managing depression, but it doesnt carry with it all the dangerous side 
	effects as anti-depressive drugs do. one-third of the participants in the 
	study were given 20 mg of fluoxetine (which is sold under the prescription 
	names prozac and sarafem), one-third were given 1,000 mg of curcumin (the 
	active ingredient in turmeric), and one one-third were given a combination 
	of both.  "curcumin, an active ingredient of 
				curcuma longa
				(zingiberaceae), has shown potential antidepressant-like activity in animal 
	studies, the researchers wrote. the objectives of this trial were to 
	compare the efficacy and safety of curcumin with fluoxetine in patients with 
	major depressive disorder (mdd). they concluded that curcumin was well 
	tolerated by all the patients. all three groups showed approximately equal 
	improvement in their depression, whether they were taking the turmeric, the 
	antidepressant or a combination of both.this study provides first clinical 
	evidence that curcumin may be used as an effective and safe modality for 
	treatment in patients with mdd without concurrent suicidal ideation or other 
	psychotic disorders. curcumin, a natural compound derived from the herb 
				curcuma longa, exhibits a wide range of pharmacological 
				properties and thus has been considered as a potent 
				antidepressant drug. curcumin may exhibit multiple 
				antidepressant activities: (a) modulating the neurotransmitter 
				levels including da, ne, 5‐hiaa and inhibiting the expression of 
				monoamine oxidase enzymes; (b) reducing the inflammatory 
				response by regulating the production of pro‐inflammatory 
				markers; (c) repairing neurodegeneration and enhancing 
				neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity typically increased bdnf 
				levels; (d) improving the activities of antioxidant enzymes; (e) 
				decreasing the nitric oxide levels; (f) regulating mitochondrial 
				disturbances; and (g) moderating hypothalamus‐pituitary‐adrenal 
				(hpa) disturbances. the multiple mechanisms of curcumin provide 
				a unique advantage in the medication of depression, especially 
				in the term of adverse effects. a new
				
study, published online ahead of print in the 
				journal of affective 
	disorders, finds that the spice curcumin, a derivative of turmeric, may 
	be an effective treatment for depression. the study was a randomized, 
	placebo-controlled trial (the gold standard methodology for medication 
	studies). the researchers found that curcumin was better than a placebo 
	treatment, and those with atypical depression were far more likely to 
				improve. the use of curcumin appeared especially effective for those with 
	atypical depression. atypical depression, despite its name, is relatively 
	common (around 40% of mdd cases). the atypical moniker refers to its 
	particular features: excessive sleep, weight gain, mood improvement in 
	response to positive events, heavy, immovable feelings in the limbs, and 
	interpersonal rejection sensitivity. atypical depression is considered to 
	have a more chronic course, with worse outcomes overall, so the potential 
	for a viable treatment with fewer side effects than current medications 
	provides hope for an improved prognosis. previous
				
studies have shown evidence that curcumin could be an
				
effective
treatment for
				
depression and found minimal side effects. this study adds to the 
	literature by comparing several doses of curcumin as well as a 
	curcumin/saffron combination treatment. a study published in 
				brain research examined the effects of 
		curcumin administration to laboratory rats after exposure to a chronic 
		stress protocol. researchers found that curcumin supplementation had a 
		beneficial effect on
		reducing stress-related symptoms of depression.
    	a study in psychopharmacology showed curcumin
				
increased serotonin production and had an antidepressant effect on 
	laboratory mice exposed to several lab tests. in a six-week, randomized, 
	single-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 60 mdd patients, supplemental 
	curcumin (~880 mg/day of curcuminoids) alone yielded a similar response rate 
	to the antidepressant, fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor [prozac]; 
	20 mg/day) in terms of depressive symptoms. a 2009 review published in 
				scientific world journal 
		hypothesizes that curcumin from turmeric may provide benefits for 
		depression by
				
assisting with the regulation of brain neurotransmitters like 
	dopamine and serotonin and inhibiting the monoamine oxidase enzyme, which 
	plays a role in breaking down these neurotransmitters.  the 
	neurotransmitters are also what prozac treats, helping serotonin be used 
	effectively by the brain.  major depressive 
		disorder (mdd) is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with abnormal 
		neurotransmission; it is primarily treated with drugs that improve the 
		bioavailability of neurotransmitters like serotonin, noradrenaline, and 
		dopamine in the brain. characteristics of mdd also include alterations 
		in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, increased neuroinflammation, 
		defective neurogenesis, and neuronal death. a few clinical studies have 
		examined the effect of curcumin alone or with conventional 
		antidepressant drugs in mdd patients. a recent meta-analysis of six 
		randomized controlled trials found that supplementation with curcumin 
		significantly reduced depression symptoms. moreover, in a randomized controlled study in 100 participants taking 
	escitalopram (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor [lexapro]; 5 to 15 mg/week), 
	supplemental curcumin (1,000 mg/day) for six weeks increased the 
	antidepressant effect of the medication. curcumin also induced a reduction 
	in plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers and an increase in plasma 
	concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor compared to placebo 
	(antidepressant drug alone).
				
a 
				study involving 56 people with major depressive disorder 
				revealed that 500 mg of curcumin taken twice a day for eight 
				weeks could ease mood-related symptoms.  in a controlled 
				trial, 60 people with depression were randomized into three 
				groups. one group took prozac, another group one gram of 
				curcumin and the third group both prozac and curcumin. after 6 
				weeks, curcumin had led to improvements that were similar to 
				prozac. the group that took both prozac and curcumin fared best. 
				according to this small study, curcumin is as effective as an 
				antidepressant. depression is also linked to reduced levels of 
				brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and a shrinking 
				hippocampus, a brain area with a role in learning and memory. 
				curcumin boosts bdnf levels, potentially reversing some of these 
				changes. there is also some evidence that curcumin can boost the 
				brain neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine. a study 
				published in the journal acta poloniae pharmaceutica found that 
				curcumin compared favorably to both drugs in reducing depressive 
				behavior in an animal model. depression and anxiety are 
				different neurological disorders, but depressive patients often 
				experience symptoms like anxiety disorder, such as irritability, 
				nervousness, and problems in concentrating and sleeping. 
				depression and anxiety disorders have its own pathophysiology as 
				well as behavioral and emotional symptoms. in a double blind, 
				cross-over clinical trial, curcumin administration (1 g/day for 
				30 days) significantly reduced anxiety like behavior. chronic 
				curcumin administration (500 mg, twice daily for eight weeks) is 
				associated with elevated urinary level of substance p and 
				thromboxane b2 as compared to the placebo group. in addition, 
				curcumin administration ameliorated the plasma endothelin-1 and 
				leptin which is associated with greater reductions in ids-sr30, 
				a major depressive episode (lopresti et al. 2015). in a 
				randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, curcumin 
				treatment (500 mg twice daily) for 4 to 8 week provides partial 
				improvement in people with major depressive disorder (lopresti 
				et al. 2014). a recent meta-analysis data suggest that, curcumin 
				supplementation appears to be efficacious, safe and 
				well-tolerated anti-depressant and anxiolytic in patients (ng et 
				al. 2017). in animal study, curcumin treatment is reported to 
				attenuate depressive phenotype during chronically stressed 
				condition via several mechanisms viz., reduction in adrenal 
				gland to body weight ratio, reduction in serum corticosterone 
				level, reduction in adrenal cortex thickness as well as 
				upregulation of bdnf and cox-2 expression and reduction in 
				(pcreb/ creb) levels in brain. curcumin administration increased 
				the level of synaptophysin and bdnf in amygdala alongside 
				reduced depressive like behavior in chronically stressed rats 
				(zhang et al. 2014). curcumin treatment is known to inhibit the 
				release of glutamate in synaptosome and induce activation of 
				glun2b n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar) subunits resulting 
				in antidepressant like action (zhang et al. 2013c; lin et al.). curcumin administration significantly reduced anxiety 
				like effect in ovariectomized (morrone et al. 2016) and stressed 
				rats (haider et al. 2015). the general mechanism of action of 
				curcumin treatment includes, inhibition of brain monoamine 
				oxidase (mao)-a/ b activity, modulation of serotonin receptor, 
				amelioration of brain dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline 
				levels, increase the neurotrophic factor, enhance neuronal 
				growth, increase neuroprotection, reduce neuroinflammation, 
				apoptosis and oxidative stress (lopresti 2017; choi et al. 
				2017). 
 




how may 
				curcumin work as an antioxidant?




the chemical structure of curcumin 
				gives it a powerful antioxidant capacity, which is 2.75 times 
				that of vitamin c and 1.6 times that of vitamin e.  
				curcuma longae rhizoma is highly regarded for its 
				robust antioxidant properties, largely attributed to its active 
				metabolite, curcumin (burapan et al., 2020). primarily, curcumin 
				directly scavenges different forms of free radicals such as 
				reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (maithilikarpagaselvi et 
				al., 2020). beyond direct scavenging, curcumin significantly 
				enhances the bodys antioxidant defenses. additionally, curcumin 
				modulates several critical signaling pathways associated with 
				oxidative stress and inflammation. curcumin promotes the 
				dissociation of nrf2 from its inhibitor, keap1, allowing nrf2 to 
				translocate to the nucleus where it enhances the transcription 
				of genes encoding antioxidant proteins and phase ii 
				detoxification enzymes (khin aung et al., 2022). curcumin ameliorates lipid metabolism disorders by exerting 
				antioxidant activity and reducing the accumulation of ros. curcumin can scavenge a 
				variety of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, 
				nitric oxide (no), and superoxide radicals, and exerts its 
				antioxidant effects by preventing lipid peroxidation (ak and 
				gülçin, 2008). additionally, curcumin enhances the activity of 
				endogenous antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase 
				(sod) and cat, thereby boosting the antioxidant capacity of 
				cells. intracellular ros are primarily regulated by the 
				endogenous antioxidant defense system. curcumin reduces the 
				expression of pro-inflammatory factors by inhibiting the 
				activation of nuclear factor κb (nf-κb), thereby mitigating the 
				inflammatory response and oxidative stress. furthermore, 
				curcumin inhibits ros production, enhancing the antioxidant 
				capacity of cells (das and vinayak, 2012). curcumin is 
				intricately involved in oxidative stress pathways, as 
				demonstrated by its ability to inhibit kelch-like ech-associated 
				protein 1(keap1), modulate the nf-e2-related factor2(nrf2) 
				signaling pathway, and promote the transcription of the 
				antioxidant response element (are). this upregulates the 
				expression of various antioxidant enzymes (e.g., nqo1, ho-1, and 
				gst), which clear free radicals in the body, thereby enhancing 
				cellular antioxidant activity and mitigating oxidative stress. 
				these properties make curcumin a promising candidate for the 
				treatment of several oxidative stress-related diseases 
				(ashrafizadeh et al., 2020; niture et al., 2010; rahban et al., 
				2020). therefore, supplementation with antioxidants like 
				curcumin to scavenge free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, 
				thereby protecting cells from damage, holds significant 
				importance and potential for disease treatment. together, these 
				mechanisms allow curcumin to exhibit significant pharmacological 
				effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor 
				activities, while also providing a theoretical basis for its use 
				in clinical applications.curcumin can help the body rid itself of hydroxyl radicals, 
				singlet oxygen, superoxide radicals, nitrogen dioxide, and no. 
				curcumin pretreatment was proven to reduce ischemia-induced 
				mutations in the heart (dikshit et al.). the efficiency of 
				curcumin on endothelial heme oxygenase-1 (inducible stress 
				protein) employing bovine aortic endothelial cells was 
				discovered in an in vitro investigation that resulted in 
				increased cellular resistance to oxidative stress. curcumin can 
				also help caenorhabditis elegans live longer by lowering 
				intracellular ros and lipofuscin levels during aging (liao et 
				al., 2011). previous research into the potential of c. longa to 
				sustain hippocampal cells of male wistar rats from lead-induced 
				damage and reduces lipid peroxidation caused by toxic heavy 
				metals. resveratrol and curcumin alleviate and synergistically 
				repair oxidative stress to the tissues by enhancing antioxidant 
				response through free radical scavenging (al-basher et al., 
				2020). in one of the earlier studies, the anti-inflammatory and 
				antioxidant capability of curcumin was detected to be 
				synergistically enhanced with quercetin, and a synergistic 
				protective effect was also demonstrated in diazinon-induced rats 
				(abdel-diam et al., 2019). the anti-inflammatory impact of 
				berberine and curcumin may decrease oxidative stress, liver 
				inflammation, and lipid metabolism (feng et al., 2018), and the 
				berberine combination also reduced inflammatory and oxidative 
				stress responses in the cortex and hippocampus of rats (lin et 
				al., 2020). antioxidant 
				and anti-inflammatory properties are the two primary mechanisms 
				that explain the majority of the effects of curcumin on the 
				various conditions. the anti-oxidative action of curcumin is 
				mediated through inhibition of stress-induced elevated levels of 
				8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and 8-nitroguanine, regulating the 
				activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes and upregulation 
				of nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2) 
				that induces haemoxygenase-1 (ho-1) the anti-oxidant activity of 
				curcumin is predominantly due to the hydroxyl group. curcumin 
				(5,10,20 and 30 µm) stimulates the expression of nrf2 in a 
				concentration- and time-dependent manner, which in turn 
				increases ho-1 expression and ho-1 activity, which is a 
				redox-sensitive inducible protein that protects from various 
				forms of stress in cultured renal epithelial cells from rats. it 
				stimulates are (antioxidant responsive elements) binding 
				activity in nrk cells from rat kidney. sreejayan et al. showed 
				that curcumin at a dose of 25 µm reduced nitrite production from 
				incubated solution of sodium nitroprusside in phosphate-buffered 
				saline. the scavenging of nitric oxide (no) by curcumin was 
				concentration-dependent (50% at 20.4 and 100% at 50 µm). 
				curcumin was shown not to interact with nitrite detection assay 
				or directly interact with nitrite. all forms of curcumindemethoxy 
				curcumin, bisdemethoxy curcumin and diacetyl curcuminhad no 
				scavenging property irrespective of the methoxy or the phenolic 
				group.curcumin has also been shown to improve systemic 
				markers of oxidative stress. there is evidence that it can 
				increase serum activities of antioxidants such as superoxide 
				dismutase (sod). a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 
				randomized control data related to the efficacy of 
				supplementation with purified curcuminoids on oxidative stress 
				parametersindicated a significant effect of curcuminoids 
				supplementation on all investigated parameters of oxidative 
				stress including plasma activities of sod and catalase, as well 
				as serum concentrations of glutathione peroxidase (gsh) and 
				lipid peroxides. it is noteworthy to point out that all of the 
				studies included in the meta-analysis utilized some sort of 
				formulation to overcome bioavailability challenges, and four out 
				of the six used piperine. curcumins effect on free radicals is 
				carried out by several different mechanisms. it can scavenge 
				different forms of free radicals, such as reactive oxygen and 
				nitrogen species (ros and rns, respectively); it can modulate 
				the activity of gsh, catalase, and sod enzymes active in the 
				neutralization of free radicals; also, it can inhibit 
				ros-generating enzymes such as lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase and 
				xanthine hydrogenase/oxidase. in addition, curcumin is a 
				lipophilic compound, which makes it an efficient scavenger of 
				peroxyl radicals, therefore, like vitamin e, curcumin is also 
				considered as a chain-breaking antioxidant. curcumin can 
				be served as a free radical scavenger in the body and also 
				promotes the endogenous antioxidant glutathione (gsh) synthesis 
				to protect cells or tissues from free radical injury. in vitro 
				cell and animal experiments also show that curcumin can enhance 
				the activity of superoxidase dismutase (sod) and increase gsh 
				levels in cells and serum as well. in preclinical studies and 
				clinical trial, when the body organs or tissues become ischemia 
				due to the temporary interruption of blood circulation, such as 
				stroke, myocardial infarction, surgery, or transplantation, 
				etc.. after restoring blood flow, those ischemic reperfusion 
				tissues often produce excessive free radicals and cause 
				oxidative stress and injury. administration of curcumin can 
				scavenge free radicals; thereby, reducing the damage of free 
				radicals to tissue cells, which also reduces damage caused by 
				excessive inflammation of tissues. remarkably, investigating the role of 
				natural substances such as curcumin or derivatives with high 
				antioxidant potential that counteract oxidative stress seems to 
				be an effective preventive measure against free radical-linked 
				aging. due to its chemical structure, curcumin has proved to be 
				an excellent scavenger of ros and reactive nitrogen species and 
				is able to attenuate or prevent the exercise-induced oxidative 
				stress and inflammation, by modulation of gsh, catalase, and sod 
				enzymes and inhibiting of ros-generating enzymes such as 
				lipoxygenase / cyclooxygenase and xanthine hydrogenase/oxidase. 
				this has strengthened our conviction that curcumin is the golden 
				nutraceutical with proven potential in preventing/delaying the 
				onset of age-related diseases. curcumin displays potent 
				biological and pharmacological effects on renal health. aging is 
				an independent risk factor increasing the likelihood of 
				developing cardiovascular diseases which is due primarily to the 
				arteries remodeling and the development of vascular endothelial 
				dysfunction. another promising anti-aging potential of curcumin 
				supplementation was shown in healthy middle-aged older men and 
				postmenopausal women. indeed, 12 weeks curcumin administration 
				has improved resistance artery endothelial function by 
				increasing no bioavailability and reducing vascular oxidative 
				stress. this suggests the critical role of curcumin to maintain 
				health vascular endothelium with aging, a fundamental element in 
				the prevention of atherosclerosis and arterial diseases. another 
				study provides additional support about the role of curcumin 
				associated with aging in patients at risk of cardiovascular 
				diseases through reducing serum ldl-cholesterol and triglyceride 
				levels. determining the long-term benefits of curcumin in patients 
					with cardiovascular diseases or at risk to develop 
					cardiovascular disorders seems like a promising research 
					avenue. the accelerated aging induced by oxidative stress 
					results in sex-specific differences in longevity and 
					susceptibility to age-related neurodegeneration. in a 
					previous research, curcumin was shown to prolong lifespan of 
					fruit fly model (drosophila 
					melanogaster) through enhancing sod activity. 
					these findings were corroborated by other data where 
					curcumin induced sex-specific in vivo responses to oxidative 
					stress. this includes protection from hydrogen peroxide and 
					alterations in behavior of 
					drosophila melanogaster. this may rely on gene 
				expression and support the anti-aging role of curcumin in 
				gender-dependent manner. curcumin belongs to the class of 
				hormetic agents that stabilize nrf2 and enhance expression of 
				ho-1. curcumin triggers nrf2 pathway, which has a pivotal role 
				in activating antioxidant enzymes, such as thioredoxin 
				reductase, hsp70, sirtuins. furthermore, another study finding 
				reported that curcumin increased the activity of several 
				antioxidant enzymes including protein thiol, non-protein thiol, 
				gpx, and sod in dogs fed with curcumin on day 30 compared with 
				control dogs. in addition, curcumin consumption stimulated the 
				antioxidant capacity in the serum of dogs and consequently 
				reducing ros levels. curcumin improved animal health, with 
				particular emphasis on the stimulation of the antioxidant system 
				and evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect. this suggested that 
				curcumin exerts beneficial effect on both growth, health and 
				consequently slowing down aging.
				curcumin supplementation accompanied with regular physical 
				exercise could potentially slowing down aging and/or preventing 
				oxidative stress-induced age-related functional and structural 
				changes and the age-related disorders. collectively, these 
				findings reinforce the antioxidant potential of curcumin on 
				organ health function in the context of aging. further 
				investigations are warranted to unravel the exact molecular 
				targets and signaling pathways responsible for the antioxidant 
				effects of curcumin in different human populations.
how may curcumin work 
against retinal diseases such as uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, and 
				age-related macular degeneration?















effect of curcumin on uveitis |
				curcumin administration attenuated the degenerative and 
				inflammatory conditions associated with eye like uveitis.  
				corticosteroids are normally used for treatment of uveitis. 
				however, the adverse effects associated with these drugs limit 
				their use. one study evaluated the efficacy of curcumin against 
				chronic anterior uveitis. curcumin was administered orally to 
				patients with chronic anterior uveitis at a dose of 375 mg three 
				times a day for 12 weeks.  all patients who received 
				curcumin alone exhibited improvement, the group receiving 
				anti-tubercular therapy along with curcumin had a response rate 
				of 86%. furthermore, follow-up of all patients for the next 3 
				years found recurrence rates of 55% for the first group and 36% 
				for the second group.  the efficacy of curcumin on 
				recurrences after treatment was comparable to that of 
				corticosteroid therapy. furthermore, lack of any adverse effects 
				with curcumin was an advantage over corticosteroid therapy. 
				thus, the study demonstrated the therapeutic role of curcumin 
				and its efficacy against recurrent anterior uveitis.effect of curcumin on 
				diabetic retinopathy | retina, because of its high 
				content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa), high oxygen and 
				glucose uptake is, vulnerable to oxidative stress. inflammation 
				is another underlying factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic 
				retinopathy . oxidative stress leads to formation of ros, which 
				is hypothesized to cause the development of neuropathy, 
				nephropathy, myocardial infarction and retinopathy. 
				autooxidation of glucose, shift in redox balance, decrease in 
				the concentration of reduced glutathione (gshros scavenger), 
				vitamin c, beta carotene and vitamin e and impairment of 
				antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione 
				reductase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase are considered as 
				the possible sources of oxidative stress in diabetes. retina of 
				diabetic rats shows elevated superoxide and hydrogen peroxide 
				(h2o2) levels along with lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage 
				to dna because of ros. the other pathways that lead to diabetic 
				retinopathy are polyol pathway that depletes nicotinamide 
				adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) essential for 
				regeneration of gsh, advanced glycosylation end product (age) 
				and its receptor rage that get deposited in the retinal 
				capillary cells leading to more ros and activation of nfkb and 
				caspase-3-induced apoptosis and damage to cellular constituents, 
				protein kinase c (pkc) pathway, which gets activated by 
				increased ros and diacylglycerol as a result of hyperglycaemia 
				that increase vessel permeability and blood flow, stimulate 
				neovascularization, endothelial proliferation and apoptosis by 
				regulating the action of vascular endothelial growth factor 
				(vegf), insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) and transforming 
				growth factor-β (tgf-β). ros also activates hexosamine pathway 
				by inhibiting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), 
				which further activates age pathway and the damage thereafter. 
				ros causes dysfunction of mitochondria, which leads to 
				superoxide production and free radical damage and mutations in 
				mitochondrial dna that leads to mitochondrial dna damage in 
				retina in diabetes. also, ros-induced damage to mitochondria 
				suppresses antioxidant-mediated effective scavenging of ros. 
				exposure of pericytes and endothelial cells shows an increase in

				involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.effect of curcumin on 
				age-related macular degeneration | curcumin protected 
				against h2o2-induced cell death in a concentration of 10 µm when 
				pre-treatment time was less than 812 h. curcumin reduced and 
				maintained intracellular ros levels in age-related macular 
				degeneration-rpe cells at varied concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 µm) 
				for 12 h in h2o2-exposed cells. treatment with curcumin showed 
				increase of anti-oxidant genes ho-1, sod2 (superoxide dismutase 
				2) and gpx1 (glutathione peroxidase 1) and reduces the 
				expression of vegf, pdgf (platelet-derived growth factor) and 
				igfbp 2 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2) using

				pre-treatment with curcumin inhibited jnk pathway that involves 
				a series of inflammatory pathways leading to cell death in 
				rpe-age-related macular degenerationcells. thus, curcumin may 
				potentially be an ideal drug in restoring the function in 
				age-related macular degeneration patient-derived rpe cells. park 
				et al. studied the protective effects of curcumin in 
				a2e-accumulated arpe-19 cells that were exposed to blue light to 
				induce cytotoxicity. a2e and iso-a2e are main pigments of 
				lipofuscin that accumulate in rpe and cause rpe cell death in 
				age-related macular degeneration.  






how may curcumin work 
as an anti-inflammatory?
















the extensive interaction of curcumin 
				with multiple inflammatory pathways not only highlights its 
				efficacy as an anti-inflammatory agent but also its potential in 
				the treatment of various inflammatory-related conditions. the 
				anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin are largely attributed 
				to its impact on crucial biochemical pathways that regulate 
				inflammation in the human body (rahaman et al., 2020). curcumin, 
				a major active metabolite in curcuma longae rhizoma, 
				effectively blocks this process by preventing iκb degradation, 
				thereby reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
				such as tnf-α, il-1, and il-6 (edwards et al., 2020). 
				additionally, curcumin modulates other significant inflammatory 
				pathways including the cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) and lipoxygenase 
				(lox) enzymes that catalyze the production of major inflammatory 
				mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes (cho et al., 
				2009). curcumin also influences the mitogen-activated protein 
				kinases (mapks) and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (pi3k)/akt 
				pathways, both known for their roles in cellular responses to 
				inflammation (guo et al., 2023). curcumin activity for inflammation after giving oral 
				administration was comparable to that of cortisone or 
				phenylbutazone. curcumin reduced inflammatory swelling, this 
				effect resulted from inhibiting biosynthesis of inflammatory 
				prostaglandins from arachidonic acid and neutrophil function 
				during inflammatory states. a large number of studies have proved that curcumin 
				has a variety of biological activities, among which 
				anti-inflammatory effect is a significant feature of it. the physiological and pathological 
				mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, 
				atherosclerosis, covid-19 and other research focus diseases are 
				not clear yet, and they are considered to be related to 
				inflammation. the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin can 
				effectively improve the symptoms of these diseases. the 
				anti-inflammatory property of curcumin is by inhibition of 
				tnf-dependent nfkb (tumour necrosis factor-dependent 
				transcriptional nuclear factor kappa b) and pathways that 
				produce reactive oxygen intermediates. curcumin downregulates 
				cox-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) that are predominantly seen at the 
				sites of inflammation that mediate pain and inflammatory 
				process. curcumin is effective against inflammation and edema. 
				curcumin is acceptable at large doses (12 g/day) in humans, 
				according to phase i clinical studies and has been shown to have 
				medicinal potential against a variety of human ailments, 
				particularly diabetes, cancer, arthritis, cardiovascular 
				disease, crohns disease, and neurological disease.  
				curcumin was evaluated for its anti-inflammatory potential in a 
				rat model for the treatment of osteoarthritis. results suggested 
				that curcumin significantly reduced the expression of cytokine 
				levels in synovial fluid targeting the tlr4/nf-κb signaling 
				pathway. the effect of curcumin on inflammatory indices was 
				evaluated in a randomized control study. results of the study 
				indicated an outstanding reduction in inflammation through 
				reduction in tnf-α, concluding that curcumin plays a key role in 
				inflammation suppression in hepatic patients with nonalcoholic 
				fatty liver disorders. the findings of another study revealed 
				that curcumin reduced the expression of il-6, tnf-α, and the 
				nf-κb signaling pathway and reduced the rate of cell apoptosis 
				resulting in the healing of injured kidney cells. apart from 
				individual therapy, curcumin in combination therapy has shown 
				significant anti-inflammatory action. in this regard, 
				hyperlipidemia-induced inflammation was targeted by the combined 
				delivery of curcumin and rutin in wistar rats. results of the 
				study showed an increase in hdl and a decrease in triglyceride 
				level after treatment with curcumin and rutin combined therapy. 
				it is concluded that curcumin has potential in treating 
				inflammation and can be used as a therapeutic medicament. curcumin inhibits pro-inflammatory enzyme 5-lox 
				(5-lipoxygenase) that are involved in the biosynthesis of 
				leukotrienes and lipid mediators of inflammation. it also 
				downregulates inflammatory cytokines like tnf, il-1 
				(interleukin-1), il-6, il-8, inos (inducible nitric oxide 
				synthase) and interferon-ϒ. curcumin at a dose of 360 mg/dose 
				for 34 months in humans reduced clinical relapse in those with 
				quiescent inflammatory bowel disease and decreased the use of 
				concomitant medications. this 

				inflammation theory  explains how immune-system errors are 
				linked to more illnesses. medical researchers are becoming 
				increasingly convinced that the most primitive part of the 
				immune system (inflammation), may play a crucial role in some of 
				the most devastating afflictions of modern humans, including 
				heart disease, cancer, diabetes and possibly alzheimer's. 
				
				study findings suggest that in the past, gene 
				variants rose in frequency in the human population to help 
				protect us against viruses, bacteria and other pathogens. but 
				now in our modern world, the environment and exposure to 
				pathogens has changed, and the genetic variants that were 
				originally meant to protect us, now make an autoimmune reaction 
				more likely. these results are consistent with the hygiene 
				hypothesis in which our cleaner environment is thought to 
				contribute to the increasing prevalence of inflammatory 
				diseases.    

while short-term inflammation in the body is a necessary component of a 
	functioning system, helping to fight off pathogenic invasion and repairing 
	tissue and muscle damage, chronic inflammation is widely attributed with 
	almost every disease known to the western world. this includes heart 
	disease, cancer and a whole host of neurological disorders. curcumin reduces 
				inflammation by lowering histamine levels and by 
				increasing the production of natural cortisone by the adrenal 
				glands. extensive research over the past 30 years has shown that 
				curcumin plays an important role in the prevention and treatment 
				of various pro-inflammatory chronic diseases including 
				neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, 
				autoimmune and malignant diseases. oral administration of curcumin in instances of acute 
				inflammation was found to be as effective as cortisone or 
				phenylbutazone, and half as effective in cases of chronic 
				inflammation. its anti-inflammatory properties may be attributed 
				to its ability to inhibit both biosyntheis of inflammatory 
				prostaglandins from arachidonic acid and neutrophil function 
				during inflammatory states. oxidative stress has been implicated 
				in many chronic diseases, and its pathological processes are 
				closely related to those of inflammation, in that one can be 
				easily induced by another. in fact, it is known that 
				inflammatory cells liberate a number of reactive species at the 
				site of inflammation leading to oxidative stress, which 
				demonstrates the relationship between oxidative stress and 
				inflammation. in addition, a number of reactive oxygen/nitrogen 
				species can initiate an intracellular signaling cascade that 
				enhances pro-inflammatory gene expression. inflammation has been 
				identified in the development of many chronic diseases and 
				conditions. these diseases include alzheimers disease (ad), 
				parkinsons disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, cerebral 
				injury, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, cancer, 
				allergy, asthma, bronchitis, colitis, arthritis, renal ischemia, 
				psoriasis, diabetes, obesity, depression, fatigue, and acquired 
				immune deficiency syndrome (aids). clinical trials have also 
				shown that curcumin can reduce inflammatory mediators. the 
				regulatory effect of curcumin on immune cells is beneficial to 
				its treatment of inflammatory diseases. curcumin mainly acts on 
				dendritic cells, t helper 17 cell, t regulatory cell. curcumin 
				inhibits th17 differentiation, and regulate treg/th17 rebalance 
				is by inhibit the il‑23/th17 pathway.29,30 oxidative stress is 
				closely related to inflammatory processes. curcumin reduces ros 
				production due to its effect on nicotinamide adenine 
				dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase and increasing the 
				activity of antioxidant enzymes, and is related to nrf2-keap1 
				pathway. curcumin reduces inflammation through its antioxidant 
				activity. curcumin has significant anti-inflammatory effects, 
				and a large number of preclinical or clinical researches have 
				studied its effect on inflammatory diseases, among them, 
				inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, psoriasis, depression, 
				atherosclerosis and covid-19 are the focus of research hotspots. 
				current evidences suggest that curcumin is effective in reducing 
				levels of inflammatory mediators, and that curcumins 
				anti-inflammatory properties may have a beneficial effect on 
				these diseases. tumor necrosis factor α 
				(tnf-α) is a major mediator of inflammation in most diseases, 
				and this effect is regulated by the activation of a 
				transcription factor, nuclear factor (nf)-κb. whereas tnf-α is 
				said to be the most potent nf-κb activator, the expression of 
				tnf-α is also regulated by nf-κb. in addition to tnf-α, nf-κb is 
				also activated by most inflammatory cytokines; gram-negative 
				bacteria; various disease-causing viruses; environmental 
				pollutants; chemical, physical, mechanical, and psychological 
				stress; high glucose; fatty acids; ultraviolet radiation; 
				cigarette smoke; and other disease-causing factors. therefore, 
				agents that downregulate nf-κb and nf-κbregulated gene products 
				have potential efficacy against several of these diseases. 
				curcumin has been shown to block nf-κb activation increased by 
				several different inflammatory stimuli. curcumin has also been 
				shown to suppress inflammation through many different mechanisms 
				beyond the scope of this review, thereby supporting its 
				mechanism of action as a potential anti-inflammatory agent. the high 
	concentrations of curcumin contained in turmeric act to target multiple 
	steps in the inflammatory pathway, blocking inflammatory markers at the 
	molecular level and thereby significantly lowering long-term inflammation in 
	your body.
	whether we are healing from an injury or an autoimmune disease, inflammation 
	is a common health challenge. nutritionists, functional medicine gps and 
	physiotherapists commonly use curcumin for its anti-inflammatory qualities. 
	and its no wonder considering
				
six major scientific trials all found curcumin to possess a potent 
	anti-inflammatory action, which is completely non-toxic in nature. recent findings suggest dietary 
				interventions, including curcumin supplementation, as a strategy 
				to combat inflammaging. interestingly, the age-modulatory 
				properties and healthful effects of curcumin have been 
				illustrated in different cellular and animal models, including 
				c. elegans, drosophila, and mice. as it was clearly discussed 
				above, curcumin was found to extend both healthspan and 
				lifespan, mainly blocking the most relevant proinflammatory 
				pathway nf-kb. in addition to the well-documented 
				evidence supporting the numerous biological properties of 
				curcumin in inhibiting nf-κb signaling dependent inflammation. 
				indeed, curcumin was shown 
				to modulate the senescence-associated secretory phenotype 
				(sasp), which characterizes senescent cells and contributes to 
				fuel the inflammaging. interestingly, the short-term 
				treatment of cells with low concentrations of curcumin decreased 
				the level of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-8 in 
				normal young cells. moreover, lower doses of curcumin have 
				increased the production of sirtuin, i.e., nad-dependent 
				deacetylases, and sirtuin 1 reduced inflammation by inhibiting 
				nf-κb signaling. curcumin inhibits and regulates tissue 
				production and secretions of pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as 
				interleukin-4 (il-4)

				tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α). conversely, curcumin 
				can increase anti-inflammatory
				
				cytokine production, such as il-10 and soluble
				
				intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (scam-1). in 
				preclinical studies, curcumin can reduce the degree of 
				inflammation of animal skin and prevent or reduce the
				
				respiratory tract inflammation caused by viral or bacterial 
				infections. in clinical trials, the curcumin treatment improves 
				pain symptoms caused by
				
				osteoarthritis and tissue inflammation and delays the 
				degradation of
				
				articular cartilage, which improves the mobility and quality 
				of life in patient. furthermore, curcumin also recovers the 
				effect of nicotine,
				
				acetylcholine, serotonin,
				
				barium chloride, and histamine on the reduction of
				
				intestinal peristalsis. it 


is 
				believed that curcumin exerts its effect in dose-dependent and 
				cell-context manner on the protein activity involved sasp. 
				particularly, increasing evidence suggests that repeated 
				stimulation of innate immune responses over time results in the 
				development of inflammaging. in these settings, both an 
				increased burden of senescent cells during aging and a 
				hyper-stimulation of macrophages over time can play key roles of 
				inflammaging process. recent reports of randomized controlled 
				trials conducted from 20082020 have demonstrated that curcumin 
				was able not only to modulate the antioxidant status but also 
				restore quantity, quality, and functional-metabolic status of 
				immune cells. this lends support to other data showing partial 
				anti-inflammatory, immunotropic and antioxidant activity of 
				turmeric extract in vitro and in vivo. further implication of 
				curcumin in modulating aging-related inflammation through 
				lowering crp level in dose-dependent manner in rats model was 
				reported. moreover, mda and no levels were increased 
				significantly in animals fed with curcumin. this has 
				strengthened our belief that curcumin slows down the aging 
				process by suppressing age-related inflammatory indices. a
				

study 
	evaluating several pharmaceutical anti-inflammatories found that aspirin and 
	ibuprofen are the least potent, while
				



curcumin is among the most potent anti-inflammatory and 
	anti-proliferative agents available. inflammation is
				
thought to be one of the major factors in all kinds of diseases, and 
	turmeric contains loads of curcumin, a powerful anti-inflammatory substance. it's been shown 
	to  alleviate joint pain, and can even help with
				
heartburn and
				
indigestion. researchers are also looking at curcumin for its
				
anti-aging properties. 
				turmeric is safe and non-toxic and has been studied for 
				anti-inflammatory properties, inhibiting various molecules that 
				contribute to inflammation such as lipooxygenase, cox-2, 
				leukotrienes, prostaglandins, nitric oxide, interferon-inducible 
				protein, tumor necrosis factor (tnf), and interleukin-12 
				(il-12).  one study compared the effectiveness of curcumin  the 
				active ingredient in turmeric  and a popular non-steroidal 
				anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) called phenylbutazone. at the end 
				of the six days, those taking the curcumin and the nsaid enjoyed 
				a significantly better anti-inflammatory response than placebo. 
				curcumin in inflamed organs (liver, lung, brain and kidneys) 
				reduces the expression levels of nlrp3, il‐1β, il‐18 and 
				caspase‐1 and inhibits the inflammasome. curcumin activated nrf2 
				and inhibited nf‐kb. in the liver, curcumin directly targets 
				3'utr‐rtxnip with the help of mir200a and inhibits nlrp3 
				inflammasome. curcumin reduces the severity of neurotoxicity by 
				inhibiting the formation of txnip/nlrp3 complex associated with 
				er stress through the regulation of ampk. curcumin in 
				lps‐stimulated mouse macrophages inhibits the activity of nlrp3 
				inflammasome by inhibiting potassium excretion, mitochondrial 
				instability, asc oligomerization and speckle formation. in 
				addition to the above, ros, autophagy, sirtuin‐2 and acetylated 
				alpha‐tubulin are the targets used by curcumin in inhibiting the 
				inflammasome. in the lungs, curcumin effectively prevented the 
				increasing notch1. in addition to inflammasome components, 
				curcumin effectively inhibits tlr4 and myd88 expression and ibb 
				phosphorylation. curcumin has a regulatory effect on several 
				molecules in the intracellular signal transduction pathways 
				involved in inflammation.   



















				researchers discovered that curcumin has anti-inflammatory 
				properties by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory transcription 
				factor (nf-κb). curcumin also inhibits the binding of activator 
				protein 1 (ap-1) binding factors, but the sp1 binding factor 
				remained unaffected. curcumin inhibits the activation of nf-κb 
				by phorbol ester and hydrogen peroxide, in addition to tnf-α. 
				furthermore, curcumin suppresses the nf-κb activation pathway 
				after the convergence of multiple stimuli but before human i 
				kappa b alpha phosphorylation.  curcumin is equally 
				efficacious as cortisone or phenylbutazone when given orally in 
				acute inflammation. curcumins therapeutic effect in sepsis 
				appears to be achieved by activation of peroxisome 
				proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppar-γ), which leads to 
				inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine along with expression 
				and release of tnf-α (jacob et al., 2008).  majority of the 
				benefits seemed to be due to the anti-inflammatory and 
				antioxidant properties of curcumin, while the quercetin in the 
				molecule was negligible. interestingly, anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin have been 
				shown to encompass the inhibition of mcp-1. other 
				anti-inflammatory effects involved the downregulation of 
				inflammatory mediators such as cox-2 activity, lipoxygenase, 
				inos, mapk, jak and inhibition of tnf-α production, il-1, -2, 
				-6, -8, and -12, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif). a 
				recent study has shown that curcumin not only stimulated the 
				antioxidant system and reduced oxidative reactions in dogs but 
				also reduced leukocyte counts, which suggests mild 
				anti-inflammatory effects achieved in dogs fed with at a dose of 
				30 mg of curcumin/dog/day, these substantiate previous findings, 
				where it was observed that nursing lambs fed with curcumin had 
				lower total leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. a similar 
				effect was reported in rats treated with 50 and 400 mg/kg 
				curcumin, indicating a remarkable improving effect on health and 
				the immune response. this points toward the importance of 
				curcumin in reversing the inflammatory responses and enhancing 
				the immune system performance, both playing a critical role in 
				ameliorating health and consequently slowing down aging (see 
				figure 2).curcumin has also been shown to 
	inhibit mediators of the inflammatory response, including cytokines, 
	chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors, and enzymes like 
	cyclooxygenase (cox), lipoxygenase (lox), and inducible nitric oxide 
	synthase (inos). nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-κb) is a transcription factor 
	that binds dna and induces the transcription of the cox-2 gene, other 
	pro-inflammatory genes, and genes involved in cell proliferation, adhesion, 
	survival, and differentiation. the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin 
	result from its ability to inhibit the nf-κb pathway, as well as other 
	pro-inflammatory pathways like the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)- 
	and the janus kinase (jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 
	(stat)-dependent signaling pathways. inhibition of dextran sulfate sodium 
	(dss)-induced colitis by curcumin in mice has been associated with a 
	downregulation of the expression of p38-mapk and pro-inflammatory cytokine 
	tnf-α and a reduction of myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity, a marker of 
	neutrophil infiltration in intestinal mucosa. curcumin has also been shown 
	to improve colitis by preventing stat3 activation and stat3-dependent 
	induction of cell proliferation in mouse colon. moreover, curcumin was shown 
	to attenuate the immune response triggered by collagen injections in a mouse 
	model of rheumatoid arthritis, partly by blocking the proliferation of t 
	lymphocytes in mouse splenocytes. in addition, curcumin has been found to 
	reduce the secretion of tnf-α and il-1β and the production of cox-2-induced 
	prostaglandin g2. in one study, curcumin inhibited the secretion of matrix 
	metalloproteins (mmps)  responsible for the degradation of the synovial 
	joints  in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes and in human articular 
	chondrocytes. curcumin has also been found to alleviate neuro-inflammation 
	in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury, reducing macrophage and 
	microglial activation and increasing neuronal survival. a placebo-controlled 
	trial in 40 men who had surgery to repair an inguinal hernia or hydrocele 
	found that oral curcumin supplementation (1.2 g/day) for five days was more 
	effective than placebo in reducing post-surgical edema, tenderness and pain, 
	and was comparable to phenylbutazone therapy (300 mg/day). scientists now 
				believe that chronic, low-level inflammation plays a major role 
				in almost every chronic, western disease. this includes heart 
				disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, alzheimer's and various 
				degenerative conditions. therefore, anything that can help fight 
				chronic inflammation is of potential importance in preventing 
				and even treating these diseases. curcumin is strongly 
				anti-inflammatory. in fact, its so powerful that it matches the 
				effectiveness of some anti-inflammatory drugs, without the side 
				effects. it blocks nf-kb, a molecule that travels into the 
				nuclei of your cells and turns on genes related to inflammation. 
				nf-kb is believed to play a major role in many chronic diseases. 
				the key takeaway is that curcumin is a bioactive substance that 
				fights inflammation at the molecular level.  a 1999 study 
				published in the journal phytotherapy research found that the 
				primary polyphenol in turmeric, the saffron colored pigment 
				known as curcumin, compared favorably to steroids in the 
				management of chronic anterior uveitis, an inflammatory eye 
				disease. a 2008 study published in critical care medicine found 
				that curcumin compared favorably to the corticosteroid drug 
				dexamethasone in the animal model as an alternative therapy for 
				protecting lung transplantation-associated injury by 
				down-regulating inflammatory genes. an earlier 2003 study 
				published in cancer letters found the same drug also compared 
				favorably to dexamethasone in a lung ischaemia-repurfusion 
				injury model. a 2004 study published in the journal oncogene 
				found that curcumin (as well as resveratrol) were effective 
				alternatives to the drugs aspirin, ibuprofen, sulindac, 
				phenylbutazone, naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, 
				dexamethasone, celecoxib, and tamoxifen in exerting 
				anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activity against tumor 
				cells. curcumin down‐regulates the expression of inflammatory 
				enzymes, such as cox2 and inos, inhibits the expression of the 
				5‐lox pro‐inflammatory enzyme and chemokines and reduces the 
				expression of crp and inflammatory cytokines of tnf‐α, il‐6 and 
				il‐8. oral curcumin supplementation may potentially play a role in 
				inhibiting the covid‐19 inflammation along with other drug 
				regimens by affecting these pathways and molecules and due to 
				applying anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant and anti‐apoptotic 
				properties without specific side effects. the spice worked as well as the 
drug, but without the negative side effects.  




				because of the crucial role of inflammation in most chronic diseases, the 
potential of  curcumin 
has been examined in neoplastic, neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary and 
metabolic diseases. the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of
				curcumin 
have been examined in animals and in humans.
 clinically, chronic curcumin administration (375 mg, t.i.d., p.o., for 
				622 months) reduced the symptoms associated with idiopathic 
				inflammatory orbital pseudo-tumors in patients (lal et al. 
				2000). in a study of curcumins anti-inflammatory 
				properties, satoskar et al.  evaluated the effects of this 
				polyphenol on spermatic cord edema and tenderness in 46 men 
				(1568 years old) who had just undergone surgical repair of an 
				inguinal hernia and/or hydrocele. after surgery, patients were 
				randomly assigned to receive curcumin (400 mg), placebo (250 mg 
				lactose powder), or phenylbutazone (100 mg) three times a day 
				for 6 days. curcumin proved to be superior by reducing all four measures of 
				inflammation. curcumin binds to toll-like receptors (tlrs) and 
				regulates downstream nuclear factor kappa-b (nf-κb), 
				mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk), activator protein 
				1(ap-1) and other signaling pathways. curcumin can down-regulate nf-κb through acting on peroxisome 
				proliferator-activated receptor gamma (pparγ). curcumin can also 
				play anti-inflammatory effects by regulating the janus 
				kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 
				(jak/stat) inflammatory signaling pathway. curcumin could 
				directly restrain the assembly of nlrp3 inflammasome, or 
				inhibits the activation of nlrp3 inflammasome by inhibition of 
				nf-κb pathway, which may be one of the mechanisms of curcumin 
				for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. in the studies 
				of inflammatory cells and animals, curcumin decreased levels of 
				pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), 
				inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), no, regulated upon 
				activation normal t cell expressed and secreted factor(rantes), 
				granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g‐csf), and monocyte 
				chemotactic protein‐1 (mcp-1). 



				how may curcumin work against cardiovascular heart disease like 
				coronary atherosclerosis, hypertension, stroke, elevated ldl 
				cholesterol and triglyceride levels?






				effect of curcumin on cholesterol and triglyceride levels 
				| curcumin's 
				protective effects on the cardiovascular system include lowering 
				cholesterol and triglyceride levels, decreasing susceptibility 
				of low density lipoprotein (ldl) to lipid peroxidation, and 
				inhibiting platelet aggregation.  evidence from several 
				randomized controlled trials indicates that curcumin 
				significantly reduces blood lipid levels, including total 
				cholesterol, ldl cholesterol, and triglycerides in patients at 
				risk for cardiovascular disease (saeedi et al., 2022). curcumin was found to 
				reduce serum total cholesterol (tc) and triglyceride (tg) levels 
				and improve oxidative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde (mda) 
				and increasing sod, glutathione (gsh), and cat levels in the 
				kidneys of rats with passive heymann nephritis (phn). these 
				effects may be mediated through modulation of the nrf2/ho-1 
				signaling pathway (di tu et al., 2020). curcumin pretreatment in 
				hyperlipidemic rats reduced hepatic lipid damage by 40% and 
				renal lipid damage by 56%, suggesting that curcumin restored 
				immune homeostasis and redox balance in peripheral organs 
				disrupted by hyperlipidemia (manzoni et al., 2020). curcumin may 
				ameliorate hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance in high-fat 
				diet-fed hamsters by lowering triglycerides, ffas, total 
				cholesterol, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin 
				resistance (homa-ir). studies have shown that absolute and 
				relative abdominal fat weight, plasma ldl cholesterol 
				concentration, and plasma and hepatic triglyceride levels were 
				significantly reduced in broilers fed a diet supplemented with 
				2,000 mg/kg of curcumin (xie et al., 2019). the gene expression 
				levels of acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase (acc) and acly were 
				significantly reduced in broilers fed a diet supplemented with 
				2,000 mg/kg of curcumin. these findings suggest that curcumin 
				plays an important role in reducing abdominal fat deposition by 
				lowering liver and plasma lipid levels and modulating the 
				expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis, such 
				as acc and acly (xie et al., 2019). in clinical researches, 
				curcumin is demonstrated to have the antihypertensive effects 
				while lowering blood pressure it can also increase myocardial 
				trophic blood flow. curcumin increases vldl cholesterol 
				
				trans-protein plasma, causing increased levels and 
				mobilization of α-tocopherol from adipose tissue that 
				protects against oxidative stress that occurs during 
				atherosclerosis. it was suggested that oral intake of 500 mg/day 
				curcumin for a week leads to a significant reduction in serum 
				lipid peroxide (33%) and total serum cholesterol (12%) levels 
				while increasing hdl cholesterol (29%). one study evaluated the effects of curcumin 
				in reducing the serum levels of cholesterol and lipid peroxides 
				in ten healthy human volunteers. curcumin (at 0.5 g/day) 
				administered to the volunteers for 7 days reduced serum lipid 
				peroxides by 33% and total serum cholesterol levels by 11.63%, 
				and increased hdl cholesterol by 29%. because of these 
				properties, curcumin was suggested to act as a chemopreventive 
				agent against atherosclerosis. curcumin can reduce the viscosity of blood 
				and thrombosis formation via hindering the synthesis of 
				thromboxane a2 (txa2) and regulating calcium signals to prevent 
				platelet activation and aggregation. curcumin may affect 
				bleeding during menstruation and in repair of the endometrium, 
				because it can inhibit platelet aggregation. therefore, it is 
				not proper to use during menstruation as it may cause excessive 
				menstrual blood volume and prolonged menstruation. in addition, 
				curcumin can inhibit the activation of nf-κb, akt, and erk to 
				protect and activate vascular endothelial cell from 
				incapacitation, which reduces arterial sclerosis, thrombosis, 
				and abnormal blood pressure. clinical studies have shown that 
				curcumin reduces the recurrence rate in patients with coronary 
				artery obstruction disease and who have had installed vascular 
				stents within coronary artery.  turmeric extract demonstrated decreased susceptibility of ldl to 
				lipid peroxidation in addition to lower plasma cholesterol and 
				triglyceride levels. higher doses decreased lipid peroxidation 
				of cholesterol and triglyceride levels. curcumin's effect on 
				cholesterol levels may be due to decreased cholesterol uptake in 
				the intestines and increase conversion of cholesterol to bile 
				acids in the liver. curcumin 
				may help reverse many steps in the heart disease process. 
				perhaps the main benefit of curcumin when it comes to heart 
				disease is improving the function of the endothelium, which is 
				the lining of your blood vessels. its well known that 
				endothelial dysfunction is a major driver of heart disease and 
				involves an inability of your endothelium to regulate blood 
				pressure, blood clotting and various other factors. several 
				studies suggest that curcumin leads to improvements in 
				endothelial function. one study found that its as effective as 
				exercise while another shows that it works as well as the drug 
				atorvastatin. in addition, curcumin reduces 
				inflammation and oxidation (as discussed above), which play a 
				role in heart disease as well. one study randomly assigned 121 
				people, who were undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, 
				either a placebo or 4 grams of curcumin per day, a few days 
				before and after the surgery. the curcumin group had a 65% 
				decreased risk of experiencing a heart attack in the hospital. a
				



study in 
				nutrition research in 2012, postmenopausal 
	women who took curcumin for eight weeks had an improvement in arterial 
	function, comparable to that seen in women who engaged in aerobic exercise. 
				another
				
study in 
				phytotherapy research in 2013 found that 
	curcumin reduced triglycerides, while a
				
study in 2014 found that curcumin significantly reduced ldl 
	(bad) cholesterol and triglycerides in people with metabolic syndrome. curcumin 
	also helps the endothelium (the lining of blood vessels) to function 
	at its optimum level, similar to the effect found during intense exercise. 
				effect of curcumin on hypertension |  hypertension is a 
				condition in which the pressure on blood vessels is greater than 
				the normal pressure. a clinical study demonstrated that turmeric 
				(standardized to 22.1 mg of active curcumin) supplementation (3 
				capsules daily for three months) attenuated hematuria, 
				proteinuria and systolic blood pressure associated with 
				refractory or relapsing nephritis in patients without any 
				adverse events (khajehdehi et al. 2012). in animal study, 
				curcumin administration downregulated the expression angiotensin 
				i receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells. in addition, 
				curcumin reduced angiotensin ii-induced high blood pressure in 
				c57bl/6j mice associated with downregulated expression of 
				angiotensin i receptor and decreased vasoconstriction in the 
				mesenteric artery (yao et al. 2016). further, curcumin 
				administration upregulated enos expression, decreased superoxide 
				enzyme level and downregulated p47phox nadph oxidase expression 
				in vascular tissues, which is known to be responsible for 
				2kidney-1clip induced hypertension in rats (boonla et al. 2014). 
				in another study, curcumin treatment increased the expression of 
				enos, decreased oxidative stress, restored glutathione redox 
				ratio in aortic tissues along with decrease in plasma protein 
				carbonyls, mda and urinary nitrate/ nitrite levels in cadmium 
				intoxicated mice resulting in anti- hypertensive effect 
				(kukongviriyapan et al. 2014). in conclusion, curcumin 
				supplementation effectively reduce hypertension via blocking 
				angiotensin i receptor, reducing circulating 
				angiotensin-converting enzyme, inducing vasodilation and 
				mediating nephroprotection. stroke, sometimes called a brain 
				attack, occurs when blood circulation to a part of the brain is 
				blocked or ruptured. in animal studies, curcumin pre- and 
				post-treatment significantly improved cat, glutathione 
				peroxidase (gpx) and sod, while reduced tnf-a, il-6, mda and 
				xanthine dehydrogenase levels in forebrain tissue. in addition, 
				curcumin treatment significantly reduced apoptotic index induced 
				by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion/reperfusion in rats 
				(altinay et al. 2017), increased the numbers of brdu-positive 
				cells, brdu/doublecortin-positive cells, activated notch 
				signaling pathway and stimulated neurogenesis during stroke (liu 
				et al. 2016). curcumin pretreatment (200 mg/kg, i.p., for 7 
				days) significantly decreased mda, no, tnf-a, il-1b, caspase-3, 
				while increased sod and gpx levels in the spinal cord of 
				ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. further, curcumin 
				administration reduced oxidative stress, inflammation and 
				apoptosis in spinal cord as well as reversed locomotor deficit 
				in rats (gokce et al. 2016). curcumin administration upregulated 
				eukaryotic initiation factor 4 a, adenosylhomocysteinase, 
				isocitrate dehydrogenase, ubiquitin carboxyterminal hydrolase 
				l1, while downregulated pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase 
				expressions in the cerebral cortex of rat (shah et al. 2016a). 
				curcumin treatment (50 mg/kg, i.p., for five days) downregulated 
				tnf-a, il-6, ac-p53 and bax, while upregulated bcl-2 and sirt1 
				expression in brain. in addition, curcumin increased 
				mitochondrial cytochrome clevels, mitochondrial complex i 
				activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, while decreased 
				cytosolic cytochrome clevels in brain resulting in reversal of 
				mitochondrial dysfunction in transient middle cerebral artery 
				occlusion/reperfusion stroke model of rat (miao et al. 2016).
				effect of curcumin on atherosclerosis | 
				curcumin has an anti-atherosclerosis effect, possibly through 
				its anti-inflammatory properties.  
				anti-hypercholesterolemic, anti-atherosclerotic (gao et al., 
				2019), and protective capabilities against cardiac ischemia and 
				reperfusion (wang et al., 2018) of curcumin have been proven in 
				preclinical and clinical trials. curcumin has been found to 
				attenuate hypertension-induced vascular oxidative stress and 
				improve endothelial dysfunction, offering protective effects 
				against both hypertension and atherosclerosis (boonla et al., 
				2014). curcumin is recognized for its potential therapeutic 
				effects on cardiovascular disease, attributed to its 
				anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-thrombotic properties. 
				this metabolite can alleviate inflammation, oxidative stress, 
				endothelial dysfunction, and platelet aggregation, likely by 
				targeting molecular pathways such as nf-κb, nrf2, ampk, and 
				ppar-γ (keihanian et al., 2018; pourbagher-shahri et al., 2021). 
				historically, curcumin has been utilized to treat various 
				cardiovascular conditions (li et al., 2020), and recent studies 
				suggest it may be particularly effective in managing 
				dyslipidemia due to its ability to modulate lipid metabolism 
				(peng et al., 2021). curcumin has been shown to inhibit il-6 and tnf-α 
				expression by increasing ppar-γ activity and attenuating 
				oxidative stress, reducing no production, and ultimately 
				inhibiting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells 
				(vsmcs), while also reducing intracellular ros accumulation (li 
				et al., 2017).  curcumin has anti-cvd potential 
				by improving the lipid profile of patients, and it might be 
				administered alone or as a dietary supplement to traditional cv 
				medicines (qin et al., 2017). curcumin is also seen in many 
				studies to protect against coronary heart disease (li h. et al., 
				2020) and also possesses anticoagulant properties. curcumin limits the risk of 
				lipid peroxidation, which triggers inflammatory responses that 
				may lead to cardiovascular disease (cvd) and atherosclerosis, 
				due to its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen forms. moreover, 
				curcumin and statins influence the same mediators of plasma 
				lipid changes. according to studies, one of the ways by which 
				curcumins effects can be induced on cardiac aged cells is 
				combining its administration with exercise (aziz et al., 2022). 
				assessments on heart tissues of rats who received the 
				combination of these two shows that os marker sirt-1 is 
				significantly decreased after this method which might be the 
				result of mda and nadph oxidase 4 (nox4) induction. furthermore, 
				these alterations are more significant when compared to the 
				group which only received curcumin (aziz et al., 2022). heart 
				dysfunction due the accumulation of aged cells in cardiovascular 
				tissues can be also a great target for curcumins advantageous 
				effects. large elastic artery stiffness is one of the factors 
				that might be seen during aging. part of the reason behind the 
				increasing stiffness of large elastic arteries as we age is due 
				to changes in their structure. these changes involve more 
				collagen i being deposited, less elastin present, and 
				alterations to these proteins caused by ages (fleenor et al., 
				2013). fleenor and colleagues used curcumin supplementation on 
				both old and young rats for 4 weeks and assessed aortic pulse 
				wave velocity (apwv) in these mice as a predictor of elastic 
				artery stiffness and arterial nitrotyrosine abundance as a 
				marker for os. they observed that the old mice which received 
				curcumin had lower apwv levels that were similar to those of 
				young control mice (p < 0.05) and the amounts of nitrotyrosine 
				was also lower in curcumin treatment group (fleenor et al., 
				2013). curcumin supplementation also restored no-dependent 
				dilation and lowered superoxide levels resulting in ameliorating 
				the impairments in endothelial-dependent dilation to levels not 
				different than young mice (fleenor et al., 2013). in 
				atherosclerosis point of view, curcumin decreases lipid 
				peroxidation and thereby, decrease damage in the thoracic and 
				abdominal aorta (quiles et al., 2002). experimental studies on atherosclerosis concluded 
				that the positive effects of curcumin on atherosclerosis were 
				associated with the dose of curcumin. additionally, curcumin has 
				the ability to prevent endothelial dysfunction and smooth muscle 
				cell proliferation and migration. these properties 
				of curcumin are responsible for skewing macrophage polarization 
				from m1 to m2, regulating tlr4/mapk/nf-κb pathways in 
				macrophages (which induce m2 polarization) and secreting 
				interleukins (il-4 and/or il-13). moreover, curcumin may 
				indirectly maintain cell homeostasis by regulating the 
				expression and activity of lipid transporter, which is 
				responsible for cholesterol uptake and efflux. zhou et al. 
				suggested that curcumin could be used as a therapeutic 
				supplement in atherosclerosis due to its ability to modulate 
				macrophage polarization through the inhibition of the toll-like 
				receptor (tl4)-mediated signaling pathway. this indicates that 
				curcumin is related to anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective 
				effects. zhang et al. investigated the potential suppression of 
				atherosclerosis development by curcumin in apoe-knockout mice by 
				inhibiting tlr4 expression in an animal model. mice were fed a 
				high-fat diet supplemented with curcumin for 16 weeks and 
				compared to a control group (without curcumin supplementation). 
				the results indicated that, in vitro, curcumin at least 
				partially inhibited tlr4 expression, inhibited nf-κb activation 
				in macrophages, and, indeed, influenced the inflammatory 
				reaction. the causal role of curcumin in inhibiting tlr4 
				expression was also demonstrated by meng et al. [46], who 
				indicated that its mechanism may be related to the blocking of 
				nadph-mediated intra-cellular ros production. comprehensively, 
				the treatment of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular 
				diseases with curcumin was shown to be effective in many 
				studies. curcumin reduces the 
				activation of m1 macrophages. curcumin regulates the polarization 
				and plasticity of macrophages by affecting tlr4/mapk/nf-κb 
				pathway, which is beneficial to reduce atherosclerosis. in 
				apoe−/− mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with 0.1% curcumin 
				significantly decreased tlr4 expression in atherosclerotic 
				plaques and reduced the development of atherosclerosis. in 
				addition, curcumin supplementation can inhibit the activation of 
				nf-κb in aorta and the levels of il-1β and tnf-α in aorta and 
				serum.122 activation of the nf-κb pathway leads to activation of 
				nlrp3 inflammasome. inhibition of nlrp3 inflammasome improves 
				atherosclerotic lesions in apoe−/− rats,123 and 
				anti-inflammatory therapy targeting il-1β reduces the recurrence 
				rate of cardiovascular events. curcumin can inhibit 
				nf-κb-mediated nlrp3 expression, thereby inhibiting vascular 
				smooth muscle cell migration, and alleviating hypertension, 
				vascular inflammation and vascular remodeling in spontaneously 
				hypertensive rats, which is beneficial to cardiovascular 
				diseases including atherosclerosis.125 in apoe−/− mice, 
				atorvastatin calcium and curcumin synergistically inhibited 
				adhesion molecules and plasma lipid levels, reducing foam cell 
				formation and inflammatory cytokines secretion by blocking 
				monocyte migration to the intima. curcumin has significant 
				efficacy in the treatment of atherosclerosis in animal models. 
				clinical evidence in non-atherosclerotic populations suggests 
				that curcumin can reduce lipid levels and inflammatory 
				responses, as it did in a mouse model. a meta-analysis of 20 
				randomized controlled trials with 1427 participants suggested a 
				significant decrease in plasma concentrations of triglycerides 
				and an elevation in plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
				(hdl-c) levels.   in another randomized controlled 
				trial, administration of curcumin for 6 months increased the 
				level of adiponectin in serum, decreased pulse wave velocity and 
				reduced the level of leptin, uric acid, triglyceride, total body 
				fat, visceral fat and insulin resistance alongside lowered the 
				atherogenic risks in type 2 diabetic population (chuengsamarn et 
				al. 2014). in animal study, curcumin administration reported to 
				possess anti-atherosclerotic activity by downregulating the 
				expression of lipocalin-2 in apolipoprotein e knockout mice (wan 
				et al. 2016). curcumin supplementation downregulated monocyte 
				chemotactic protein-1, p-selectin, vascular cell adhesion 
				molecule-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and mmp (1, 2 and 
				9) expressions, exerting anti-atherosclerotic activity. it 
				oxidized ldl and lowered lipid levels in the serum of 
				hypercholesterolemic rabbits (um et al. 2014). another 
				mechanistic study revealed that curcumin supplementation 
				suppresses the expression of cd36 and ap2 in macrophages of 
				atherosclerotic mice (hasan et al. 2014). in murine macrophage 
				line raw264.7, curcumin reduced ox-ldl- induced tnf-a, il-1b, 
				il-6 production and apoptosis along with upregulation of 
				atp-binding cassette transporter (abca1) and cd36 expressions, 
				thereby inducing lipid disposal and removal. studies have shown 
				that endothelial dysfunction is a common cause of heart disease, 
				occurring when the endothelium is no longer able to regulate 
				blood pressure, clotting and a number of other factors. 
				therefore, by improving endothelial function, curcumin lowers 
				your risk of heart disease. in addition to helping out the 
				endothelium, curcumin also reduces inflammation and oxidative 
				damage, two factors that are also common contributors to heart 
				disease. one study on 121 peopleall of whom were undergoing 
				coronary artery bypass surgeryfound that the group taking 4 
				grams of curcumin for a few days before and after the surgery 
				were much less likely to experience a heart attack. other 
				studies have revealed that the anti-inflammatory action of 
				turmeric helps prevent artery disease. valdez points out that 
				recent studies suggest curcumin can protect the heart from 
				ischemiaan inadequate blood supply to an organ or part of the 
				body, particularly the muscles within the heart. a study 
				published in the journal drugs in r & d found that a 
				standardized preparation of curcuminoids from turmeric compared 
				favorably to the drug atorvastatin (trade name lipitor) on 
				endothelial dysfunction, the underlying pathology of the blood 
				vessels that drives atherosclerosis, in association with 
				reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress in type 2 
				diabetic patients. curcumin capsules were found to enhance the 
				functioning of endothelium lining in the hearts blood vessels. 
				any abnormality in the endothelial functioning can cause blood 
				pressure or cause blood clotting. this dysregulation then leads 
				to heart disease. recent research literature on curcumin 
				supplement intake suggest its treatment potential on par with 
				the drug atorvastatin or regular moderate exercise. moreover, 
				the already proven benefits of curcumin/turmeric in terms of 
				their anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation properties has a 
				benign influence on the heart as well. even coronary artery 
				bypass surgery patients were found to have a significant 
				decreased risk of suffering a relapse heart attack upon starting 
				a curcumin capsule regimen. curcumin administration (4 g/day 
				beginning from 3 days before the surgery and continued up to 5 
				days after surgery) significantly attenuated myocardial 
				infarction associated with coronary artery bypass grafting via 
				antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (wongcharoen et al. 
				2012). in animal study, curcumin sup- plementation (10, 20 or 30 
				mg/kg) significantly reduced oxidative stress, apoptosis and 
				infract size via stimulating janus kinase 2/signal transducer 
				and activator 3 of transcription (jak2/stat3) signaling pathway 
				thus protects myocardium in ischemia reperfusion rats (liu et 
				al. 2017). in another study, curcumin administration (150 mg/kg) 
				downregulated the nf-jb expression, upregulated ppar-cand bcl-2 
				expression, thereby attenuated apoptosis and inflammation in 
				rats with myocardial infarction injury (lv et al. 2016). 
				curcumin is reported to protect hypoxia-induced cardiomyocytes 
				apoptosis via downregulation of specific protein 1 (sp1) and 
				upregulation of mir-7a/b expression in mice (geng et al. 2016). 
				it is known to reduce fibrosis by activating cardiac 
				nad-dependent deacetylase sirtuin (sirt)-1 expression during 
				myocardial infarction in mice (xiao et al. 2016). curcumin 
				treatment inhibited the activity of mmps, reduced mda level, 
				restored extracellular matrix degradation and decreased 
				deposition of collagen in ischemic/ reperfused myocardium of 
				rats. in addition, curcumin supplementation downregulated 
				phospho-smad2/3 and tgfb1 expression while upregulated mothers 
				against decapentaplegic homolog 7 expression in the infarcted 
				myocardium, which might prove to be effective for the management 
				of heart attack (wang et al. 2012). in in vitro study, curcumin 
				attenuated apoptosis and induce autophagy by upregulating bcl-2 
				and downregulating the expression levels of beclin-1, bax, sirt1 
				and bcl2/adenovirus e1b 19 kda protein-interacting protein 3 
				(bnip3) in hypoxia reoxygenation-induced h9c2 myocytes (huang et 
				al. 2015b). these findings revealed that curcumin reverses 
				myocardial infarction and heart attack via its antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties.
				 


how may 
				curcumin work against kidney disease?


curcumin has demonstrated significant 
				immunomodulatory roles in kidney disease across various studies, 
				reflecting its potential in both acute and chronic renal 
				disorders. in acute kidney injury (aki) models, kaur et al. 
				(2016) observed that treatment with curcumin notably decreased 
				plasma myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity, thiobarbituric acid 
				reactive substances (tbars) levels, and superoxide anion 
				generation, while increasing glutathione levels. this suggests 
				curcumins efficacy in reducing oxidative stress markers 
				significantly in rat models (kaur et al., 2016). additionally, 
				topcu-tarladacalisir et al. (2016) reported that oral 
				administration of curcumin at a dose of 200 mg/kg in wistar 
				albino male rats decreased levels of caspase-3, malondialdehyde 
				(mda), mpo, tnf-α, and various interleukins, showing protection 
				against cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction 
				(topcu-tarladacalisir et al., 2016). in chronic kidney disease 
				(ckd), ali et al. (2018) demonstrated that curcumin improved 
				renal function by reducing plasma levels of cystatin c, 
				sclerostin, and adiponectin, while enhancing renal antioxidant 
				enzymes such as glutathione (gsh), superoxide dismutase (sod), 
				nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2), and catalase 
				(cat) (ali et al., 2018). hu et al. (2016) found that curcumin 
				mitigated cyclosporin a-induced kidney disease in mice by 
				decreasing cpg methylation in the klotho promoter, thus 
				increasing klotho expression and inhibiting transforming growth 
				factor-beta (tgf-β) signaling (hu et al., 2016). noonin and 
				thongboonkerd (2024) extended these findings by treating hk-2 
				cells with 625 ng/ml curcumin, which alleviated 
				high-glucose-induced stimulation of renal fibroblast activation 
				through the reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species 
				(ros) and tgf-β secretion (noonin and thongboonkerd, 2024). 
				stankovic et al. (2020) further supported these results by 
				demonstrating that curcumin reduced oxidative stress and 
				enhanced antioxidant defenses in a rat model of nephrotoxicity 
				induced by maleate treatment (stankovic et al., 2020). curcumin treatment 
				significantly reduced plasma mpo activity, thiobarbituric acid 
				reactive substances (tbars) level, superoxide anion generation 
				while increased gsh levels in rat ischemia reperfusion model of 
				acute kidney injury. in addition, curcumin reduced plasma 
				potassium level, plasma uric acid level, microproteinuria and 
				blood urea nitrogen along with induced nmda receptor antagonism 
				during acute kidney injury resulting in nephroprotective effect 
				(kaur et al. 2016). curcumin administration (200 mg/ kg, p.o.) 
				significantly reduced the level of mpo, il-1b, il-6, il-10, 
				tnf-a, mda and caspase-3 resulting in protective effect against 
				cisplatin induced renal dysfunction in male wistar albino rats 
				(topcu-tarladacalisir, sapmaz-metin, and karaca 2016). curcumin 
				administration downregulated the expression of nad(p)h oxidase 
				subunits (p22phox, p47phox and p67phox), cytochrome p450 2e1 
				(cyp2e1) and nitrotyrosine renal protein. in addition, curcumin 
				decreased inflammatory cytokine like ifnc, il-1band tnf- a. 
				besides, the expression of glucose regulated protein 78, mapks, 
				p-erk1/2, p-jnk and c/ebp homologous protein (chop) were 
				downregulated. in the same study, curcumin administration 
				reduced apoptosis signaling proteins (cleaved caspase-12 and 
				cleaved caspase-3) in low-dose streptozotocin with high-fat diet 
				induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis kidney disease in mice 
				(afrin et al. 2017). curcumin ameliorated kidney function via 
				reducing plasma adiponectin, plasma sclerostin, plasma cystatin 
				c while increasing renal cat, sod, nrf2, gsh in adenine induced 
				chronic kidney figure 4. modulation of growth factor pathways 
				and intracellular signaling components by curcumin in its 
				anticancer effects. curcumin treatment blocked the effect of 
				shh-gli1, wnt/b-catenin, atks and ar pathways as well as its 
				downstream signaling components which lead to reduce cancer 
				incidence, cancer progression, treatment resistance and disease 
				relapse (ali et al. 2018). moreover, curcumin administration 
				reduced renal mesangial matrix expansion, reduced renal 
				hypertrophy, downregulated fibronectin and collagen iv 
				expressions, decreased the levels of nlrp3 protein, cleaved 
				caspase-1 and il-1bin the renal cortices of db/db mice (lu et 
				al. 2017). curcumin treatment reduced fibrosis of kidney by 
				decreasing the methylation of cpg in the klotho promoter, 
				resulting in induction of klotho expression and inhibition of 
				tgf-bsignaling in cyclosporine a induced mouse model of kidney 
				disease (hu et al. 2016). in earlier study, curcumin 
				administration reduced superoxide production, 
				nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 level, 
				carbonylation of protein, nitrotyrosine -protein level, 
				autophagy and mitochondrial fission while increased gsh/ gssg 
				ratio which leads to reversal of nephrotoxicity induced by 
				maleate treatment in rats (molina-jij on et al. 2016). 
				experimental data have conclusively proved that, curcumin 
				treatment reduces fibronectin and collagen iv expressions, 
				suppresses tgf-bsignaling and exhibits antioxidant, 
				anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic potential thereby 
				ameliorating kidney functions. 


how may 
				curcumin work against skin disorders such as psoriasis and 
				dermatitis?


curcumin has 
				anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and immunomodulatory effects, 
				and can inhibit t cell activation, proliferation and production 
				of pro-inflammatory factors by acting on mapks, ap-1, nf-κb 
				pathways.  in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 
				psoriasis stimulated in vitro, curcumin can effectively inhibit 
				t cell proliferation, proinflammatory cytokines and 
				multifunction, and inhibit t cell production of ifn-γ, il-17, 
				granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) and 
				il-22. curcumin down-regulation pro-inflammatory cytokines then 
				inhibits the proliferation of imiquimod-induced differentiated 
				hacat cells. vascular endothelial growth factor transgenic mice 
				can be used as a model to study psoriasis. because in the 
				transgenic rat model of keratin (k) 14-vegf, the inflammatory 
				skin condition has psoriasis-like cellular and molecular 
				characteristics, including characteristic vascular changes and 
				epidermal changes. cytokine levels of tnf-α, ifn-γ, il-2, il-12, 
				il-22 and il-23 were reduced to normal level after curcumin 
				treatment. this may be due to the curcumin inhibits currents of 
				kv1.3 channel and thus inhibits proliferation of t cells, or 
				curcumin influence mapks, ap-1 and nf-κb signaling pathways in 
				the psoriasis mice. furthermore, research shows that curcumin is 
				capable of relieving tpa-induced inflammation by directly 
				down-regulating ifn-γ production. in an imiquimod-induced 
				psoriasis model,  curcumin could alleviate inflammation 
				symptoms; lower tnf-α, il-17a, il-17f, il-22, and il-1β mrna 
				levels; and lower cc chemokine receptor 6(ccr6) protein 
				expression.  curcumin has a variety of mechanisms for 
				psoriasis, curcumin can keep dendritic cells in immaturity, to 
				accelerate the anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype 
				polarization, inhibiting proinflammatory factor and t cell, 
				restrain the vascular endothelial growth factor, effect on 
				psoriasis susceptibility genes, and so on, has great potential. 
				curcumin is derived from natural plant ingredients, which has 
				good safety and can be used for a long time without causing 
				serious toxic and side effects.  considerable evidence, both in animals 
				and humans, indicates that curcumin may be effective against 
				psoriasis. one study investigated whether the anti-psoriatic 
				activity of curcumin in patients is due to suppression of phk 
				activity. the authors of this study concluded that drug-induced 
				suppression of phk activity is associated with resolution of 
				psoriatic activity and that the anti-psoriatic activity of 
				curcumin may be achieved through modulation of phk activity was also found to reduce wound-healing time, 
				increase collagen growth and increase blood flow to the skin. 
				curcumin effectively 
				reduced the level of phosphorylase kinase in the skin of 
				psoriatic subjects. in addition, the effectiveness of curcumin 
				to reduce phosphorylase kinase level was more pronounced than 
				calcipotriol (thangapazham, sharma, and maheshwari 2007). 
				clinically, oral curcumin administration (20 mg, p.o., b.i.d.) 
				reduced the level of serum il-22 and alleviated psoriasis 
				vulgaris (antiga et al. 2015). in animal study, curcumin 
				administration (40 mg/kg, for 20 day) exhibited significant 
				reduction in ear thickness, ear weight, ear redness and lymph 
				node weight in the keratin 14-vegf transgenic mouse model of 
				psoriasis. furthermore, curcumin treatment downregulated the 
				serum levels of il-2, il-12, il-22, il-23, ifn-cand tnf-ain 
				psoriatic mice. curcumin administration inhibited kv1.3 channel 
				and suppressed the cytokines expression and t cells 
				proliferation resulting in reduction of psoriasis phenotype 
				(kang et al. 2016). curcumin treatment decreased incrassation 
				and skin inflammation in mouse ear induced by imiquimod. 
				curcumin application promoted epidermal tcr cd-cell 
				proliferation and downregulated c-c chemokine receptor type 6 
				expression in the ear skin of imiquimod-induced psoriasis (sun, 
				zhao, and hu 2013). curcumin reduces psoriasis-associated 
				inflammation as well as hyper- proliferation of keratinocyte 
				that suggest its role in development of antipsoriatic drug 
				(aggarwal, surh, and shishodia 2007).
				
				this study on curcumin and skin found it is highly beneficial 
				for scleroderma, psoriasis and skin cancer.  dermatitis, 
				also called as eczema, is a group of disease that describes the 
				inflammation of skin. the polyphenol curcumin has been 
				traditionally used by asian countries to manage dermatitis 
				(gupta, kismali, and aggarwal 2013a). in a randomized, 
				double-blind, placebo-controlled study, curcumin administration 
				(6g/day, p.o., t.i.d, during radiotherapy) was reported to 
				reduce the dermatitis severity in breast cancer patients (ryan 
				et al. 2013). in animal model, curcumin treatment reduces the 
				inflammation of mouse epidermis by reducing the activity of 
				epidermal cox and lipoxygenase (lox). the biological effect of 
				curcumin to reduce dermatitis is mainly due to inhibition of cox 
				and lox activities. a phase ii, open-label, simons two-stage 
				clinical trial sought to determine the safety and efficacy of 
				oral curcumin in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. 
				twelve patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were enrolled in 
				the study and were given 4.5-g curcumin capsules every day for 
				12 weeks, followed by a 4-week observation period. curcumin was 
				well-tolerated, and all participants completed the study. 
				patients who responded to the treatment showed 83% to 88% 
				improvement at 12 weeks of treatment.


how may 
				curcumin work against endocrine disorders such as osteoporosis, 
				hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism?


curcumin therapy protected the 
				mitochondrias ability to maintain balanced redox reactions, 
				reduced oxidative stress within the mitochondria, and enhanced 
				the mitochondrias membrane potential and efficiency (dai et 
				al., 2017). it seems that this function of curcumin is possible 
				through causing an induction in the levels of phosphorylated 
				protein kinase b (akt) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase 
				kinase-3β (gsk3β) (dai et al., 2017). other than that, 
				gsk3β-nrf2 signaling is also another way that curcumin works 
				through to reduce os. investigating osteoblast dysfunction due 
				to os indicates that curcumin could effectively counteract 
				oxidative stress, leading to a reduction in the bodys natural 
				production of reactive oxygen species, supporting the survival 
				of bone cells and enhancing the formation of new bone cells. by 
				blocking gsk3β and activating nrf2, the damaging impacts of 
				oxidative stress can be significantly minimized, underscoring 
				the importance of the gsk3β-nrf2 signaling pathway. 
				additionally, curcumin was found to reverse the inhibitory 
				effects of oxidative stress on the gsk3β-nrf2 signaling pathway 
				(li et al., 2020). curcumin administration 
				ameliorated microarchitecture of tibia bone through 
				down-regulation of mmp-9 expression, inhibition of 
				osteoprotegerin (opg)/rank ligand/rank signaling and the 
				activation of microrna-365 in dexamethasone treated mice (li et 
				al. 2015a). it has been indicated that mir-365 act as an 
				upstream regulator of mmp-9 during osteoporosis. mechanistically 
				curcumin treatment ameliorated bone deteriorations through the 
				activation of mir-365 via suppressing mmp-9 (li et al. 2015a). 
				one study revealed that, curcumin administration increased the 
				ratio of osteoprotegerin to receptor activator for nf-kb ligand, 
				ameliorated the proliferation of osteoblasts and activated the 
				wnt signaling thereby alleviated osteoporotic symptoms induced 
				by glucocorticoid in rats (chen et al. 2016). curcumin treatment 
				(100 mg/kg for 2 month) increased bone mineral density, 
				downregulated the ratio of bax/bcl-2, downregulated cleaved 
				poly-adp-ribose polymerase (parp) and cleaved caspase-3, 
				upregulated p-erk1/2 expression as well as reduced femoral 
				osteoblast apoptosis in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis rat 
				model (chen et al. 2016). recently, report suggests that 
				curcumin reversed hind-limb suspension-induced bone loss in rats 
				via upregulation of vitamin d receptor expression and 
				attenuation of oxidative stress (xin et al. 2015). in in vitro
				studies, curcumin treatment ameliorates the viability of 
				saos-2 cells, reduces apoptosis, improves the mitochondrial 
				membrane functions and its potential, upregulates gsk3b and 
				protein kinase b (akt) phosphorylation. these evidences of 
				curcumin administration supporting its potential for management 
				of osteoporosis (dai et al. 2017). curcumin reduce the risk of 
				osteoporosis via several mechanisms including reduction of 
				apoptosis, amelioration of mitochondrial membrane function, pkb 
				phosphorylation, microrna-365 activation and osteoblasts 
				proliferation. upregulated expression of hepatic glutathione 
				reductase, gpx-1 and cat were mitigated by concomitant 
				administration of curcumin and vitamin e in 6-propyl-thio-uracil 
				induced hypothyroid rats. in addition, curcumin and vitamin e 
				supplementation reduced the enhanced activity of mnsod-2, gpx-1 
				and suppressed activity of glutathione reductase in 
				mitochondrial fraction. it was concluded that curcumin and 
				vitamin e supplementation modulate hepatic antioxidant gene 
				expression during hypothyroidism (subudhi and chainy 2012). 
				curcumin administration significantly reduced the level of lpo 
				in cerebellum and cerebral cortex of 
				6-propyl-2-thiouracil-induced hypothyroidism in rats. in 
				addition, curcumin reversed the decreased level of translated 
				products sod1 and sod2 in rats with hypothyroidism (jena et al. 
				2012). interestingly, an earlier study suggested that, vitamin e 
				and curcumin administration restore the activity of serum 
				transaminase, altered rectal temperature and hepatic 
				histoarchitecture in rats with hypothyroidism induced by 
				6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (subudhi et al. 2009). hyperthyroidism 
				in animal study, curcumin administration reduced lipid 
				peroxidation in the cerebral cortex of l-thyroxine induced 
				hyperthyroid rats. interestingly, curcumin reduced the activity 
				of sod, sod1 and sod2 in cerebral cortex, while enhanced the sod 
				and sod1 activity in the cerebellum of hyperthyroid rat (jena, 
				dandapat, and chainy 2013). in another study, curcumin and 
				vitamin e administration reversed the reduced levels of hepatic 
				sod and cat. besides, curcumin administration upregulated the 
				expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 and glutathione reductase 
				in rat liver. in the same study, co-treatment of curcumin along 
				with vitamin e alleviated oxidative stress and liver damage in 
				l-thyroxine induced hyperthyroid rats (subudhi and chainy 2010). 
				further, l-thyroxine induced hyperthyroidism and its associated 
				increase in activity of alt and ast in rat serum were reduced by 
				curcumin and vitamin e treatment resulting in hepatoprotection 
				(subudhi et al. 2008). these finding suggest that, curcumin 
				administration exerts neuromodulatory and hepatoprotective 
				activity during hyperthyroidism mainly due to its antioxidant 
				effect.


how may 
				curcumin work against respiratory disorders such as asthma, 
				pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and allergies?


the immunomodulatory properties of 
				curcumin in combating chronic allergic diseases target several 
				molecular mechanisms. curcumin affects transcription factors 
				like nf-κb, mapks, pi3k/akt, wnt/β-catenin, and nrf2, which play 
				pivotal roles in controlling inflammatory responses 
				(kunnumakkara et al., 2017). it inhibits macrophage 
				degranulation, reduces ige-mediated allergic reactions, 
				diminishes eosinophil infiltration, and modulates cytokine 
				production and immune cell operations (haftcheshmeh et al., 
				2022). a key clinical trial by wu and xiao (2016) demonstrated 
				that a daily administration of 500 mg of curcumin over 2 months 
				elevated il-10 levels while reducing tnf-α, il-8, and il-4 
				production (wu and xiao, 2016). similarly, abidi et al. reported 
				improvements in airway obstruction in asthma patients treated 
				with the same daily dose of curcumin for a month, showcasing its 
				potential in enhancing lung function and reducing allergic 
				symptoms (abidi et al., 2014). in an in vitro study, zeng et al. 
				(2023) assessed curcumins impact on ige-mediated allergic 
				responses by activating rbl-2h3 cells with ige-antigen 
				complexes. this activation induced cellular swelling, which was 
				significantly ameliorated by curcumin at 10 μm, resulting in 
				reduced release of β-hexosaminidase, il-4, and tnf-α in a 
				dose-dependent manner (zeng et al., 2023). this confirms 
				curcumins role in suppressing ige-mediated degranulation of 
				rbl-2h3 cells. the study utilized specific in vitro models and 
				provided clear data on dose responsiveness and the minimal 
				active concentration, which are critical for understanding 
				curcumins pharmacodynamics. curcumin inhibited the degranulation 
				and release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells caused 
				by compound 48/80. in an animal model, curcumin dramatically 
				reduced the mast cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylactoid 
				reaction. curcumin enhanced intracellular camp levels and 
				inhibited both nonspecific and selective mast cell-mediated 
				allergy reactions (choi et al., 2010). curcumin significantly 
				reduced ige/ag-induced psa (passive systemic anaphylaxis), as 
				measured by serum-dependent leukotriene c4, dependent 
				prostaglandin d2, and histamine levels, indicating that it might 
				be useful to produce drugs for allergic inflammatory illnesses 
				(li et al., 2014). curcumin can suppress expression of cd80, 
				cd86, and class ii antigens by dendritic cells and blocks the 
				release of inflammatory cytokines like il1β, il-6, and tnf-α 
				from lps-stimulated dendritic cells. chronic obstructive 
				pulmonary disease (copd) is a progressive airflow limitation 
				disease associated with persistent inflammation of respiratory 
				system, especially in the airways and lungs. copd is caused by 
				long-term exposure with noxious particles, gases, such as air 
				pollutants or smoke. the preclinical studies in animal model, 
				there are anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin can reduce and 
				alleviate respiratory inflammation and oxidative stress caused 
				by exposure to soot or other air pollutants. curcumin also 
				reduces allergic asthma by inhibiting the pparγ/nf-κb signaling 
				pathway in respiratory mucosa to prevent copd. when lower 
				airways and lung parenchyma with severe acute lung injury or 
				inflammation by drugs or infection may cause plasma 
				extravasation, which leads to lung infiltration filled with 
				interstitial fluid and leukocytes. during the recovery from 
				severe lung infiltration, some patients will develop fibrous 
				tissue hyperplasia and pulmonary fibrosis, resulting in a 
				significant reduction in lung gas exchange area and efficiency. 
				for example, clinical application of chemotherapeutic drugs or 
				radiotherapy can cause acute lung injury and lead to pulmonary 
				fibrosis and curcumin treatment can attenuate the severity of 
				pulmonary fibrosis. there are several inflammatory cytokines 
				related with pulmonary fibrosis, include tnf-α, tnf-β1, il-6, 
				and il-4, ros, mmps, and tgf-β, and treated with curcumin can 
				inhibit those cytokine expressions. today's most famous 
				coronavirus, patients with sars virus and covid-19 infection 
				will often have sequelae of severe pulmonary fibrosis after 
				healing from viral infection, and curcumin also can act on the 
				spike protein to interrupt the covid-19 infection. many clinical 
				studies on pulmonary fibrosis have pointed out that curcumin or 
				turmeric can significantly reduce the expression of 
				inflammation-related factors in cells and tissues, effectively 
				moderates excessive inflammation in the acute phase of lung 
				injury or infection, and prevents pulmonary fibrosis in the 
				later stage. asthma is a chronic lung 
				disease involving the inflamed, swell and narrowed airways that 
				produce extra mucus, which causes breathing difficulties. 
				clinically, curcumin administration (500 mg/day for 30 days) 
				ameliorated the mean forced expiratory volume one second values 
				resulting in alleviation of airway obstruction alongside 
				improved haematological parameters in asthmatics (kunnumakkara 
				et al. 2017). in animal study, intranasal curcumin 
				administration attenuated the pulmonary fibrosis and 
				inflammation of airway by downregulation of mmp-9, eotaxin, 
				timp-1 and a-smooth muscle actin expressions in the lung tissue 
				of ovalbumin-induced chronically asthmatic mice (chauhan, 
				dash, and 
				singh 2017). in another study, curcumin administration reduced 
				inflammatory markers like il-4 and inf-c levels in lung tissue 
				alongside reduced asthma symptoms by activation of wnt/b-catenin 
				signaling pathway in ovalbumin challenged mice (yang et al. 
				2017c). further, curcumin administration suppressed the 
				activation of jnk54/ 56, erk 42/44 and p38 mapk resulting in 
				inhibition of cox-2 expression and prostaglandin (pg) d2 
				release, which is known to reduce airway obstruction, 
				inflammation and asthma progression in ovalbumin challenged 
				mouse model of asthma (chauhan et al. 2016). evidence suggested 
				that lipopolysaccharide exposure causes increase in level of 
				ige, il-4, il-5, histamine and mpo resulting in exacerbation of 
				airway inflammation in rats and these effects were efficiently 
				reversed by curcumin administration (kumari, dash, and singh 
				2015). curcumin treatment is reported to attenuate the 
				production of ige, accumulation of inflammatory cells and 
				hyperplasia of goblet cell alongside ameliorated the secretion 
				of mucus and hyper-responsiveness of airway in asthmatic mice. in 
				addition, curcumin administration increased the activity of ho-1 
				and nrf-2 while reduced p-ijb and nf-jb levels in the lung 
				tissue of ovalbumin challenged female specific pathogen-free 
				balb/c mice (liu et al. 2015). their mechanism of action is 
				associated essentially due to its anti-oxidative and 
				anti-inflammatory activities in asthma. at molecular and 
				cellular levels, curcumin treatment reduces asthma symptoms 
				mainly due to inhibition of histamine release, attenuation of 
				ige, inhibition of cox-2 enzyme and suppression of jnk54/56, erk 
				42/44 and p38 mapk activation (chauhan et al. 2016;he et al. 
				2015c).  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a 
				progressive inflammatory lung disease that causes obstruction in 
				airflow and difficulty in breathing. in animal study, curcumin 
				administration is known to ameliorate right ventricular 
				hypertrophy index and right ventricular systolic pressure via 
				activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) 3/ 
				jak2/stat signal transduction in lung tissue of rat with chronic 
				obstructive pulmonary disease (lin, chen, and liu 2016). 
				curcumin treatment downregulated macrophage inflammatory protein 
				(mip)-2a, il-8 and mcp-1 expressions while upregulated histone 
				deacetylase 2 expression, ameliorated methylation of h3k9 and 
				reduced h3/h4 acetylation in type ii alveolar epithelial cells 
				during cigarette smoke exposure induced chronic obstructive 
				pulmonary disease in rats (gan et al. 2016). further, it was 
				reported that, curcumin administration reduce tnf-a, il-6, il-8 
				level, macrophages count, neutrophil numbers and total cell 
				numbers alongside reversed ultrastructural damage and emphysema in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of cigarette smoke exposure 
				combined intratracheally administered lipopolysaccharide induced 
				chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in rats. additionally, 
				curcumin downregulated alveolar epithelia p66shc and p-p66shc 
				expression, which is associated with protection of alveolar 
				epithelial injury (zhang et al. 2016c). we conclude that 
				curcumin suppresses the progression of chronic obstructive 
				pulmonary disease by inhibiting the inflammation of airways. 
				these findings suggest that curcumin could be used to protect 
				chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in human and animals. 
				pneumonia is an inflammatory condition caused by 
				bacteria, viruses or fungi in one or both lungs. in animal 
				model, curcumin treatment reduced pneumonia in female c57bl/6j 
				mice caused by staphylococcus aureus via inhibiting the 
				pore-forming activity of a-hemolysin, an extracellular protein 
				secreted by bacteria that is known to induce the lung infection 
				(wang et al. 2016a). further, curcumin significantly reduced s. 
				aureus-mediated lung edema, barrier disruption, vascular leakage 
				and pneumonia. in addition, curcumin administration 
				significantly reduced neutrophils infiltration and attenuates 
				plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activation, resulting in 
				reduction of chemokines and cytokines in staphylococcus 
				aureus-infected mouse model of pneumonia (xu et al. 2015). thus, 
				continued studies of the potent anti-inflammatory, 
				anti-microbial, anti-oxidant agent, curcumin, will likely use to 
				reverse or slow the progression of pneumonia, ultimately, 
				leading to novel treatments for pulmonary dysfunction in 
				critically ill patients (avasarala et al. 2013). allergies, also 
				known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions in which 
				the immune system reacts abnormally to a foreign substance. in a 
				randomized, double-blind study, chronic curcumin administration 
				(500 mg/day, p.o., for consecutive 2 months) significantly 
				alleviated rhinorrhoea, sneezing and nasal congestion in 
				patients by reducing nasal airflow resistance. in addition, 
				curcumin administration suppressed tnf-a, il-4 and il-8, while 
				increased the production of soluble intercellular adhesion 
				molecule and il-10 (wu and xiao 2016). curcumin administration 
				(2.5 or 5 mg/kg, for four days) suppressed the level of ige in 
				the serum of asthmatic mice. further, it reduced the level of 
				secretory phospholipase a2, cox-2, nitric oxide, il-4 and il-6 
				in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. in addition, curcumin 
				administration downregulated the expression of p38, cox-2, p-erk 
				and p-jnk in the lungs tissue of ovalbumin challenged mice 
				(chauhan et al. 2016). study revealed that curcumin treatment 
				significantly reduce histamine release and downregulate tnf-a, 
				il-1b, il-6, il- 8, p-erk, p-p38, p-jnk, p-ikbaand nf-kb p65 
				expressions in mast cells. besides it decreased the levels of 
				ige, histamine, tnf-a, src kinases, fyn, lyn and syk in the 
				serum of mice with allergic rhinitis induced by ovalbumin (zhang 
				et al. 2015b). curcumin supplementation significantly attenuated 
				lipopolysaccharide induced allergic asthma by reducing airway 
				inflammation and decreasing ige level, histamine release and 
				oxidative stress in mice (kumari, dash, and singh 2015). 
				further, curcumin administration inhibited intestinal 
				mastocytosis, expression of th2 cytokines, intestinal 
				anaphylaxis and activation of nf-jb in ovalbumin. these findings 
				suggest that, the anti-allergic mechanism of curcumin is 
				essentially due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative 
				activities. at cellular and molecular levels, curcumin treatment 
				reduces allergic symptoms mainly due to attenuation of ige, 
				inhibition of histamine release, inhibition of cox-2 enzyme, 
				stimulation of nrf- 2/ ho-1 pathway etc. (chong et al. 2014; 
				kurup and barrios 2008; lee et al. 2008).

why may curcumin extracted 
				from turmeric root provide health benefits?





natural plant products 
				have been used throughout human history for various purposes. 
				having co-evolved with animal life, many of the plants from 
				which these natural products are derived are billions of years 
				old. natural polyphenol compounds derived from these plants, such 
				as curcumin, have many favorable biological properties. plants manufacture chemicals that repel 
				predators, herbivores, parasites and diseases, and these chemicals 
				are produced as secondary metabolites as a 
				natural defense mechanism. in particular, curcumin, a 
				polyphenolic compound, is synthesized in the rhizome root of 
				
				curcuma longa, or turmeric. this process involves several 
				enzymatic steps within the plant. it starts with phenylalanine 
				ammonia-lyase converting phenylalanine into cinnamic acid, a 
				critical step in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, of which 
				curcumin is a part. cinnamic acid then undergoes a series of 
				enzymatic reactions in which p-coumaric acid acts as a key 
				intermediate compound, forming curcumin precursors known as 
				curcuminoids. these precursors, including curcumin, 
				demethoxycurcumin, and bis-demethoxycurcumin, are further 
				modified through a series of enzymatic reactions. these 
				reactions lead to the formation of molecules commonly known as 
				curcumin, the main active compound responsible for turmerics 
				therapeutic activity and characteristic yellow-orange color. 
				this biosynthesis and accumulation process occurs in the 
				rhizomes of the turmeric plant, where it serves various 
				functions, including protection against oxidative stress and 
				defense against pathogens. many of 
				these natural chemicals have pharmacological or biological 
				activity, and these medicinal plants have played a pivotal role 
				in the health care of many cultures, both ancient and modern. 
				medicinal plants and their bioactive ingredients, in particular 
				polyphenols, have been implicated in various biological 
				activities, including, but not limited to, immunomodulation, 
				anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular protection, antioxidant, and 
				anticancer potential. like most of these pharmacologically-active metabolites, 
				curcumin is involved in self-defense. over time, plants with higher levels of
organic compounds that deter attackers become more successful, because of their
advanced protection. in nature's never-ending interaction between predator and prey,
insects evolve the ability to digest plant toxins, while plants evolve stronger chemicals to deter their enemies. monitoring
this evolution between plants and insects represents an important field of
ecological research. scientists have discovered that many phytochemicals manufactured
in plants and roots not only prevent insect attack or fight plant infections, but also provide 
human health benefits.
many cultures create their own botanical pharmacies as
the lore of medicinal plants and remedies is handed down through generations of
healers. medicinal plants have been used as a traditional treatment agent for 
				numerous human diseases since ages in many parts of the world. 
				in rural areas of the developing countries, they continue to be 
				used as the primary source of medicine. with the advent
of sophisticated laboratory testing, biologists are finding that the many
indigenous plants and roots from around the world provide medicinal
value, and their metabolites are candidates for research. pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, phytotherapeutics and herbal medicines are found thanks to 
				ethnobotany and developed by researching and analyzing compounds 
				derived from plants. turmeric derived from the 
				curcuma longa plant 
				contains the polyphenols curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and 
				bisdemethoxycurcumin, and it has caught the attention of 
				researchers due to its extensive use as a culinary ingredient 
				(the bright yellow color of curry is attributed to turmeric) in 
				most asian countries and the many reports of its antioxidant, 
				antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. curcumin 
				(diferulolylmethane) is extensively utilized in a variety of 
				settings including cosmetic and herbal supplementation, and its 
				medicinal properties have been investigated for more than 50 
				years. curcumins structure is similar to other natural 
				polyphenolics (chemicals containing multiple "phenol" groups) 
				produced by plants in response to infectious attack. these 
				natural polyphenols often have potent antioxidant and 
				anti-inflammatory properties as well as immune support health 
				benefits. every medicinal molecule in all of 
botany is made out of carbon dioxide. co2 is the key source of carbon used by 
plants to synthesize everything from curcumin to resveratrol. every healing 
nutrient in basil, oregano, cinnamon, turmeric, garlic and pomegranate fruit is 
made out of carbon dioxide. curcumin, a powerful anti-cancer nutrient found in 
turmeric, is made from carbon dioxide, with 21 carbon molecules manufactured 
from atmospheric carbon dioxide. curcumin has been 
studied for antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities, mediated
through the regulation of various transcription factors, growth factors,
inflammatory cytokines, protein kinases, and other enzymes. curcumin exhibits
activities similar to recently discovered tnf blockers (humira, remicade and
enbrel), vascular endothelial cell growth factor blocker (avastin), human
epidermal growth factor receptor blockers (erbitux, erlotinib, and geftinib),
and her2 blocker (herceptin).  
 with 
				antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties, 
				curcumin has received much attention in several 
				neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimers (ad), huntington 
				(hd) and parkinsons diseases (pd). extensive research over 
				several decades has sought to identify the mechanisms of 
				molecular action of curcumin. it regulates inflammatory 
				cytokines, growth factors, growth factor receptors, enzymes, 
				adhesion molecules, proteins related to apoptosis and cell-cycle 
				proteins, such as cyclin, and modulates its molecular targets by 
				altering their gene expression, signaling pathways or through 
				direct interaction.
				
considering the recent scientific bandwagon that
multi-targeted therapy is better than mono-targeted therapy for most diseases,
				curcumin is a phytonutrient that can be considered an ideal "spice for life". more than 5000
papers published within the past two decades have revealed that curcumin has
extraordinary potential in promoting health through modulation of numerous molecular
targets. the importance of curcumin can be estimated by the fact that 
				thirty-seven cases of clinical trials of curcumin  were 
				completed by december 2017 and fda (food and drug 
				administration) clinical phase 4 trials have been completed.


why hasn't
the pharmaceutical industry patented curcumin?




pharmaceutical
corporations tried registering patents for curcumin and
				turmeric because of the much heralded scientific 
evidence and the long history of its healing properties. 
				however, that same 
evidence and history of
				curcumin   being used medicinally for centuries was the reason the united
states patent and trademark office rejected and revoked the rights 
for turmeric patent 5401504 
on the grounds that the claims were
not new: "uspto
unequivocally rejected all six claims made on august 13, 2001 while ruling that turmeric's
medicinal properties were not patentable."  university of texas md 
anderson cancer center states 
				


"in
the case of curcumin, a natural compound, no company can reap the benefits if
				turmeric shows itself to be an effective anti-cancer drug."   
				and because curcumin is not economically interesting,
				


"it is almost impossible to get financial support to conduct a 
				clinical trial with a substance that cannot be patented. the 
				greatest challenge will be to find sponsors for clinical 
				research on curcumin, as this promising plant-derived compound 
				cannot be exploited economically."



what is the history of curcumin  and turmeric?






turmeric | turmeric has been used for thousand 
				years as a dietary spice, food preservative, and coloring agent. 
				records date back to 600 bc in an assyrian herbal book, references by 
				the renowned greek physician dioscorides. turmeric also has been 
				included for centuries in preparations of traditional indian and 
				chinese medicine to treat various conditions such as allergy, 
				anorexia, asthma, biliary disorders, bronchial hyperactivity, 
				cough, diabetic wounds, liver disorders, rheumatism, rhinitis, 
				sinusitis, sprains, and swellinge. 
				in the old hindu texts of traditional medicine of ayurveda 
				(meaning knowledge of long life), turmeric is recommended for 
				its aromatic, stimulant, and carminative properties. it is featured 
				in the suśrutasaṃhitā, the foundational text of traditional 
				indian medicine, as an ingredient to alleviate the effects of 
				poisoned food. the recorded use of 
				turmeric dates back nearly 4000 years to the vedic culture in 
				india, where it was used as a culinary spice and had some 
				religious significance. according to sanskrit and unani medical treatises, 
				turmeric has a long history of medicinal use dating back to the 
				vedic period 1500 to 500 bc. the use of turmeric is most salient in 
				the various island cultures of the pacific, where it spread with 
				the austronesian expansion there starting around 3000 bc, 
				reaching as far as polynesia and fiji. susrutas ayurvedic compendium, 
				dating back to 250 bc, recommends an ointment containing 
				turmeric to relieve the effects of poisoned food. researchers in 
				india recently identified mineral remnants of turmeric on the 
				cooking pots of ancient indus river remains, one of the first 
				urban civilizations. these ancient civilizations have vast trial 
				and error experience with many different herbal remedies and 
				food preparations and they selected curcumin for medicinal use 
				based on efficacy. the name turmeric 
				derives from the latin word terra merita (meritorious 
				earth), referring to the color of ground turmeric which 
				resembles a mineral pigment. the arabic word for turmeric is 
				
				"kurkum", which originally meant saffron, and is written in the bible 
				as "karkom". medieval arabic 
				literature called turmeric zaʿfarān hindī  
				which means "indian saffron".  turmeric reached the coast of china in 
				the seventh century ad, east africa a century later, west africa 
				by 1200, and jamaica in the eighteenth century. in traditional 
				chinese medicine, it is used to treat diseases associated with 
				abdominal pain, and as a major constituent of jiawei-xiaoyao-san 
				medicinal formula to manage dyspepsia, stress, and 
				depression/mood-related ailments. in chinese 
				medicinal literature, turmeric first appears in the xinxiu 
				bencao. arab traders were 
				instrumental in the westward spread of turmeric, similarly to 
				pepper and other spices of the time. in 1280, marco polo 
				described turmeric in the china leg of his travels; "there is 
				also a vegetable which has all the properties of the true 
				saffron, as well the smell as the colour, and yet it is not 
				reall saffron. it is held in great estimation, and being an 
				ingredient in all their dishes, it bears, on that account, a 
				high price." -
				

				the travels of marco polo, the venetiancurcumin | curcumin 
				is a golden yellow compound found in turmeric root and was first isolated in 1815 by two german 
				scientists, vogel and pelletier, who reported on the yellow 
				coloring-material from the rhizomes of the east indian plant
				curcuma longa and named it 
				curcumin. in 1842, 
				they identified curcumin as the most abundant molecule and the 
				primary curcuminoid in turmeric. in 1870, curcumin was extracted by ivanow-gajewsky;
				
on 
				certain substances obtained from turmeric. i. curcumin | 1881. 
				in 1910 the chemical structure of curcumin 
				was established as a diferuloylmethane 1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione, by
				

				miłobȩdzka j., kostanecki s., lampe v. 
				later, lampe introduced another method in 1918. this multi-step 
				process began with ethyl acetoacetate and carbomethoxyferuloyl 
				as the primary reagents. 

an early mention of curcumin in 
				modern medical literature was its first clinical trial, 
				appearing in the lancet in 1937, one of the most prestigious 
				medical journals; 
turmeric (curcumin) in biliary diseases. the article, describing curcumin applications 
				to humans, was written by albert oppenheimerthen an assistant 
				professor at the american university of beirut, lebanon, who 
				applied curcumin orally for the treatment 
				of 67 patients suffering from various forms of subacute, 
				recurrent, or chronic cholecystitis. the positive therapeutic 
				response recorded then, was the basis for future interest in 
				curcumin and its healing properties, especially its 
				anti-inflammatory properties, which were among the first 
				studied. 

in an article published in nature in 
				1949, schraufstatter and bernt first reported that curcumin 
				exerts effective antibacterial properties;
				

				antibacterial action of curcumin and related compounds. 
				in 1964, 

				h. j. j. pabon developed a more efficient and 
				straightforward synthesis with improved yields. his method 
				involved reacting acetyl acetone with boron trioxide, 
				substituted aromatic aldehydes, primary amine, and alkyl borate. 
				with minor modifications, pabons synthetic approach has been 
				widely adopted by researchers worldwide, forming the basis for 
				most curcumin syntheses. curcumin's  
				biological properties were described as responsible for most of 
				the therapeutic efficacy of turmeric in the 1970s when the first 
				research on curcumins health benefits was carried out. in 1985, 
				kuttan et al first confirmed its anticancer effects;
				

				potential anticancer activity of turmeric (curcuma longa) | 
				cancer letters. in these 
				and in later studies it was shown that curcumin has multiple 
				therapeutic potentialities (di mario et al., 2007; adhvaryu et 
				al., 2008; chandran and goel, 2012; yanpanitch et al., 2015; 
				gera et al., 2017; salehi et al., 2019a). although 
				the current database indicates over 12,000 publications on 
				curcumin, until 1990 there were less than 100 papers published 
				on this nutraceutical. 
in 2007, 
				payton et al showed that curcumin's form exists in 
				solution as a keto−enol tautomer. numerous 
				studies have indicated that curcumin is a highly potent 
				antimicrobial agent and has been shown to be active against 
				various chronic diseases including various types of cancers, 
				diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and 
				autoimmune diseases. furthermore, this compound has also been 
				shown to be synergistic with other nutraceuticals such as 
				resveratrol, piperine, catechins, quercetin and genistein. 
				curcumin's 
				molecular identity is characterized by unique polyphenolic 
				elements, specifically two feruloyl groups linked via a 
				methylene chain. this molecular configuration plays a crucial 
				role in its biological and chemical properties. for generations, 
				curcumin has been a key component in the traditional medicinal 
				practices of various asian cultures. its use in ayurvedic and 
				traditional chinese medicine, along with other herbal systems, 
				has been extensive. curcumin has been applied to treat a wide 
				range of ailments, from inflammation and pain to more specific 
				conditions such as jaundice, menstrual issues, bleeding, dental 
				pain, bruises, and cardiac pain. in the realm of 
				contemporary science, curcumin has sparked considerable interest 
				due to its potential health benefits. studies have delved into 
				its effectiveness against chronic illnesses like cancer, 
				alzheimers disease, heart diseases, and inflammatory conditions. this interest is fueled by its properties as an 
				antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory, and its possible role in 
				cancer prevention. scientists are examining how curcumin 
				influences various cellular processes by interacting with 
				multiple signaling molecules, including growth factors, 
				cytokines, and the genes involved in cell life cycle and 
				division. the high degree of reverence
