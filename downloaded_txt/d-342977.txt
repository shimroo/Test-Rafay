welcome to the only museum of its kind, the national great blacks in wax museum!















since its opening, the museum has become a prominent, nationally recognized institution. it has also evolved into a powerful compendium of wax figures. the museum houses approximately 150 figures of people from the past, like dr. martin luther king jr. and rosa parks, and from the present, like president barack obama.




    our history
  
















































beyond the walls this black history month! 



we have three exhibits that are available for public viewing in feburary 2025!



the national great blacks in wax museum is bringing history to life beyond the museum walls and throughout the nation. “these exhibits are more than just displays—they are living history, reminding us of the past and inspiring the future,” says dr. joanne martin, co-founder of ngbiwm. check out the current traveling exhibits.
