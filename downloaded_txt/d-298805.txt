what people say about us"veritas academy is equipping my son with a classical christian education delivered by excellent teachers in coveted student-teacher ratios. he is being given the foundations to go forward in life.  we believe veritas is a true practical blessing to our family."jeff winters"we received so much more from veritas academy than we ever expected. our daughter started with veritas in 5th grade and graduated in 2014. we loved the teachers, office administrators, and headmaster. our daughter received an excellent education and made great friends, while also having the freedom afforded to homeschool families."robin snyder"veritas academy is the perfect set-up for schooling. we like attending school three days a week and working at home two days a week. the teachers and administrators are superb: competent and dedicated; the environment is wholesome; politically correct indoctrination is absent; class sizes are small."jennifer valley"veritas academy has been a huge blessing for our family. my oldest daughter is in her second year, and we are thrilled with the excellent teachers. she is receiving an excellent education, and we can't wait till our other children are old enough to attend!"

 ruthie abrusci"i want to thank all the teachers that never gave up on me. teachers personally care about each student and their educational achievement. whether staying after school to give additional instruction or providing motivation, they will go above and beyond to help you succeed.”veritas graduate"veritas has been a second home to me. i can’t adequately explain all that i’m going to take from my experiences. i would not be standing here without the love and support of many at veritas.”veritas graduate"veritas has been a blessing.  i have come to the realization that this is the best place to receive an education.  the environment that veritas creates is one that challenges you academically.”veritas graduate"veritas academy has played a positive and integral role in the lives of each of our children. it provided the perfect transition from home education, to the world beyond, by connecting them with a broader community of like-minded students and families. it prepared them academically for each of their diverse interests at the next level. more importantly, it provided them with helpful, caring, flexible, and joyful faculty role models with high standards of critical thinking and integrity.”marc slaughter"this has been my observation of most of the classes at veritas with each of our five children who have attended the school: they are learning critical thinking with depth of content.”jeff weiland
