endospores – anaerobic spores- dormant invisible in cosmetic products as bio-burden do not affect the formulations’ nor disintegration nor spoil them, but carry the bio burden spores as pathogens that cause serious even deadly infections, when applied to human skin and human hair.

campo research is a novel cosmetic ingredients marketing arm of the group, and is involved in the novel drug discovery and natural product drug discovery programe of the group. campo research markets novel plants’ and biotechnology plants’ active metabolites.
campo’s specializes in solar uv filtering and absorbing enzymes “uvzymestm” and “phyto-pseudo-p53” expressed from plants instead of micro-organism (bacterial expression) and high-termal stable and chemical reaction stable enzymes “uv-extremo-zymestm” and novel phytoextremo-pseudo-p53tm (extremo-p53tm) expressed from biotechnology plants (phytoexpression) with methanococcocus’ and thermus aquaticus’ gene material instead of the micro-organisms.
campo uvzymestm and uv-extremo-zymes are direct (all natural plant extracts) answers to otc topical sunscreens, personal care, soaps, and decorative color cosmetics manufacturers to capitalize on the uv exposure index and the increaseing solar uv radiation levels.
campo has various classes of heat stable and chemical reaction stable plant-extracted enzymes for cosmetics and topical otc pharmaceuticals.




a breakthrough in skincare technology




with an already well-established worldwide reputation for the quality of its extensive research & development work on newly sourced natural active ingredients, campo research is proud to introduce natural, functional active-cosmetic ingredients: songyi mushroom extract, pearl/nacre moisturizer, kinetin (isolated from unripe corn seed and young coconut juice), beta-glucan (isolated from the songyi mushroom), beta-sitosterol, natural plant based broad spectrum preservative known as “campo plantservative”, and licorice glabridin.
the songyi mushroom extract, widely used in japan for its whitening properties, is a natural and unique bio-herbal extract. it consists of amino acids, powerful antioxidants minerals and vitamins well known for their synergistic effect in the skin’s anti-ageing (sod) process.
it rejuvenates and helps create a new, healthier, younger looking skin. it will lighten the face and the whole body skin without causing cell death to any melanin pigment cells during the skin-whitening and rejuvenation process. the uptake of songyi mushroom extract enzymes (e) by the skin helps maintain normal biological balance in the endocrine system, enhances the colorless melanin pigment of the skin, and helps nourish and maintain its fair, youthful appearance by balancing skin tone, and removing blemishes, pigment and acne spots, sunburn pigmentation and hyper-pigmentation.
among more than 1000 active ingredients from campo research catalogue, there are innovative natural ingredients from exotic plants from china, india, australia and tropical forests like fruits enzymes, coffee oil uv-a&b (for sunscreen), neem oil, plantservatives, mushroom extracts (for skin whitening), natural colours, kinetin (anti-wrinkle and anti-oxidant), licorice glabridin, alpha-lipoic acid and dmae.
