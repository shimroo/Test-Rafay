svg railway station clock

                the simplest way to display a railway station clock on a website is via svg. 
                neither javascript â already contained within the svg file â nor plug-ins are needed. 
                an svg file and a simple html tag are enough. 
                you can find out more here …








segment display

                before the dot-matrix display marched to victory,  
                segment displays 
                could be found everywhere in everday life. 
                these days their use is limited to areas where the point is to be able to read numbers quickly (e.g. clocks, meters and gauges). 
                this segment display realized using javasript and a <canvas> element comes with source code, 
                can be designed online and be used freely for your own projects.

background patterns for websites

                during the early days of the web
                background patterns 
                were a popular means of sprucing up the pages on a website. 
                back then every webmaster had their own collection of more or less tasteful backgrounds. 
                the patterns presented here stem from that time and can be tried out right away.

station clock

                who doesnât know what itâs like to wait for a train? 
                the time refuses to go by yet the eyes stay glued to the second hand on the 
                station clock.
                slowly, steadily, the hand travels around the clock, then comes to a halt on the 12. 
                for a brief moment time seems to stand still, 
                but then the minute hand leaps forward and the second handâs rotation starts all over again. 
                why this occurs and how you can display a completely individual station clock on your website can be read 
                here…

cuckoo clock

              	its origins lie in the dark depths of the black forest. 
								written mention was made of it for the first time in the mid-15th century, 
								and to this day historians dispute who built the first black forest cuckoo clock. 
								abroad the cuckoo clock has become a symbol for germany. 
								small factories based in the black forest continue to deliver their hand-made clocks all over the world.
              
 



























the hour aglow

	              the set theory clock, also known as the berlin clock, 
	              makes use of the principle of set theory to depict the time. 
	              the time of day is displayed in a 24-hour format and 
	              can be determined by simply adding and multiplying the glowing lights.
	            

	              letâs see, at the moment itâs glowing .
	            
 

web application loan calculator

	              the idea for the loan calculator web application 
	              â an ria (rich internet application) to be more precise â 
	              arose during an extensive it project. 
	              the users enter loan queries in a web front end. 
	              these are first handed over to a java back end, 
	              then transferred from there to another server via corba (common object request broker architecture). 
	              the loan is now calculated and travels the same route back. 
	              a process like this takes its time, of course, 
	              and errors of a technical or content nature can occur at any stage
	              which must be communicated to the user. 
	              but in the end, why not let javascript calculate a loan in the browser?
