 tweet february 10, 2025zz ward’s “love alive” brings blues back to the spotlight      more indie invaders / posted by: kingsofar watch out for zz ward and the song “love alive.” zz ward delivers a bluesy, soulful track that fits seamlessly into playlists like blues roots, women of blues, modern blues rock, vintage vibes, indie blues & folk, and southern gothic. one of the most profound lessons zz ward learned from growing up listening to the blues greats was to be authentic to your story. when the la-based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist began to write new music, she found herself in the midst of one of the biggest life changes a person will ever experience: motherhood. “i didn’t plan to make a blues album about motherhood, it just sort of happened naturally,” zz shares. “i’ve always written to get through things in life. suddenly, i was faced with a new job that’s 24/7 with no breaks, and that’s what i wrote about. but when you get tested, you discover who you are, and this album comes from a feeling of empowerment.” “put the gun down” was zz’s first single from her 2012 debut, til the casket drops. it broke into the aaa radio charts top 10 and stayed there for 10 weeks, followed by the single “365 days,” which hit #2 on the charts. til the casket drops also climbed into the billboard top 40 alternative chart. her sophomore album, the storm (2017), peaked at number 1 on the billboard blues charts, highlighted by singles featuring grammy-award winners fantastic negrito (“cannonball”) and gary clark jr. (“ride”), which was also the end title song for pixar’s feature film cars 3. this past summer, zz was personally picked by slash to open for his own blues album tour.
