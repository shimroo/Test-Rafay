about us





our unique family-owned and operated hotel has had the pleasure of hosting the island’s visitors since 1987. the waterside inn offers one-of-a-kind accommodations and prioritizes due diligence in the areas of guest relations and cleanliness – we aim to be exceptional and hold ourselves to the highest industry standards. nestled amongst rose gardens and breathtaking sunsets overlooking the chincoteague bay, our property makes the perfect location for visitors looking to engage with the beauty and charm of the island!
 the private marina located at the waterside is the perfect spot to view a rocket launch from wallops island or to cast a line in hope of snagging your favorite catch. we are a short walk or trolley ride to historic downtown chincoteague where you can shop, dine, or take in a movie at the island theatre. for those looking to visit the island’s wild ponies, our property is roughly 200 yards from the chincoteague carnival grounds where the annual pony swim and round-up festivities are held and only a 10 minute drive from the assateague island national wildlife refuge.
 
whether you are visiting for business or pleasure, let us be your chincoteague island destination!

what our customers are saying






★★★★★

“on my way home, i swung by chincoteague and stayed here. as it was off-season and on a weekday, i got a great deal on the room price. the hotel was clean and well maintained. check-in went well; the woman at the desk was helpful and friendly. the view of the sunset, from my top floor room and hot tub, was amazing.”

“i planned a vacation for my family to chincoteague for two nights. i did hours of research to find exactly what i thought would fit us best, and i stumbled across waterside. i booked a non-refundable two-night stay. we drove through the day and into the night, and showed up after the office has closed. the front desk worker saw us pull up and pulled back around to show me where they left my key and room information. we settled into our room at almost midnight, so i couldn’t see anything outside. when i awoke at 6:30am to seagulls and waves crashing, i was in absolute awe of what i saw. i had only paid for a parking lot view, but our room was right on the channel, just feet from the fishing pier. the staff were friendly and accommodating. they remembered me and helped me when i needed it. the room was perfect for my family of four, and i spent 75% of my time there overlooking the channel, eating amazing local food. this is the place to stay for sure, and i can’t wait to return.”
