news















trainplayer software brings model railroading out of the 
						basement and onto your screen!
if you design, build, or 
						operate a model railroad -- or you ever thought about 
						doing so -- or you just like to run trains -- then 
						you're in the right place!  trainplayer offers 
						thousands of great layouts you can run, simple but precise tools 
						so you can design and build your own, and an integrated 
						system for operations.  running trains couldn't 
						be easier -- our software is fully granddad-approved, 
						designed for people who like trains more than  
						computers.
try the 
						free 
						demo, see for yourself.  for an overview, see
						our 
						products below.

jun 2024: version 8.3: locations

making ops easier!  
						overhaul of handling track locations on the layout, 
						elimination of stations.  



						revised and expanded documentation for advanced ops, 
						with illustrated tutorials.  larger text on all 
						dialogs and alerts.  numerous small fixes and 
						enhancements.  

						see the 8.3 
						features page for details and free download.


sep 2022: version 8.2: dynamic toolbars


a 
						whole new look!  our new interface is 
						based on improved toolbars -- easier to see, easier to 
						navigate, still fully customizable, altogether more 
						modern and fun to use.  

and lots more!  new in
						paint shop: a shaded-cylinder decal for 
						perfect boilers and tankcars, plus a "wireframe" decal 
						for transferring details from one paint job to another.  
						new in anyrail: now import a working 
						transfer table.  new in scripting: 
						more functions and fixes.

						start here: 8.2 
						features page.  there you can read about the 
						new features and download your free* upgrade (if you are 
						a user) or free demo (if not yet).

						*not quite free: if you haven't yet upgraded to paint 
						shop, there is a charge for that.  it's optional, 
						but a nifty device to have. 


aug 2021: version 8.1, revamp of linked layouts

						have trains jump smoothly from one layout to another, 
						now with more features and fewer bugs!  this 
						feature was first introduced in 2005 (version 2.1), and 
						has finally been revamped.  now you can: drag 
						trains by hand across links; not worry about duplicate 
						car numbers; jump from one location to another on the 
						same layout; couple and uncouple during jumps; even 
						develop scripts to automate action across multiple 
						linked layouts!



						 watch the action-packed three-layout video on the
						8.1 feature page.  
						free download.



jan 2021: 
 version 8.0, featuring 
						paint shop!

						a great new pastime for the car modeller!  bring 
						any car or engine into paint shop, apply paint and 
						decals -- hundreds of logos, roadnames, detail parts to 
						choose from.  unique tools for color gradients, 
						masking, erasing, enhancing.



 

 

 


check it out on the
						8.0 feature page.  
						free to download and try out.
