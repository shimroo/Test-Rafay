+ the eighties live +
i'm an 80s kid and still love the retro dance/club music from mostly the late eighties ('86-'89) and early nineties as that's when i was old enough to finally venture out and see the wonders that awaited me at the clubs of the day. some of which i spent many hours in were d2r, d2r south (which is now el rodeo *sigh*), blue planet, power tools, red square, bayou mama's, peter's wildlife, the yucatan liquor stand (you can scam, lick her stand heheheee), 2826, j' larkin's (in clear lake... ahhh i miss that club) and many more houston eighties clubs.
so, in celebration of the music (and maybe relive my youth lol), i have created this site to post the listing of some of my favorite tunes in order to help those searching for names of songs and groups, and for more things to come.
be sure to visit our 80s club music page on facebook to hear songs on the record rack - our streaming jukebox of your favorite retro tunes: club 6400 on facebook
