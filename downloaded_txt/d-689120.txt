need a ride? the vpta can help!
the vermont public transportation association (vpta) helps to increase mobility for all vermonters as the statewide information resource. we work to support individuals with safe, efficient and affordable transportation utilizing updated technologies and flexible options that help support fellow vermonters getting to work, school, medical appointments, and wherever life takes them.
we provide information and support about public transit to the general public and policy makers and contract with government agencies to administer transportation services throughout the state. our goals are to increase awareness of public transportation, educate riders on available resources, and help older and vulnerable vermonters with their transportation needs. we are dedicated to providing quality public transportation, because when people have the opportunity to do things that enrich their lives, the entire community thrives.
