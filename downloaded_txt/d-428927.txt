	 modern miracles 
    


it's become routine but i will never get over having lived to see pictures actually being sent to earth from mars. just astounding.

	 sad day
    


today would have been my dad's 86th birthday if he had lived to see it. i bought garden plants because that's what i did for his birthday for the last twenty years of his life. my soul brother mark herschler's new song seems to be the only thing i have to say today. reminds me of how much i miss my happy valley family as well. it's been that kind of day.

	 amazing art
    


well, not as colorful, yet this is just as cool as the guy who does the sidewalk art.

	 nice ice
    


probably not the best picture to post when everyone is so sick of winter, but hey, sometimes the cold can be beautiful. niagara falls frozen again in the last polar vortex. hoping this is the last gasp of this endless winter. [photo credit - more photos at link]

	 places i have been
    


the majestic diner on ponce de leon in atlanta is  famous for its cheese grits. it's a real classic in its genre. the first time i ever had grits was there. it was one of only two times that i really enjoyed eating grits in all the years i've now lived in the south.

	 so sweet
    


possibly the most heartwarming ad for alcohol i've ever seen and i've watched every budweiser ad ever aired. it even beats that coke ad with the football guy.
