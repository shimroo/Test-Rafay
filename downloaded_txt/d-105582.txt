our graduates speak...



“i am very thankful to the instructors and staff at nsc for their intimate guidance and support. the numerous resources available truly enabled me to unlock many opportunities i didn’t believe were possible. i’ll forever cherish all the lessons learned and memories i’ve made here.”
tam, associate of applied science in early childhood education 

“as an older learner from a non-traditional background, it was great to be around other students like me at nsc. while we each came from different backgrounds, what we had in common was our belief that education would unlock opportunities for us and for our communities.”
david, graduate & king county judge 

“i assist 2000+ port of seattle employees in strategic business planning with knowledge and tools i learned directly from the nsc international business program, such as business strategy, accounting, and project management. the nsc ib program has helped open doors in my career.”
mary, bachelor of applied science in international business
