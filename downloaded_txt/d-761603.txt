introducing troop 764

boy scout troop 764 was chartered by st. luke’s presbyterian church in dunwoody, georgia in 1976 and is a member of the hightower trail district, atlanta area council.







troop meetings

the troop holds its meetings every monday night at 7:30 pm in the scout hut at st. luke’s (1978 mount vernon road).
the scout hut is housed in the basement of sheppard hall and was the vision of brid igleheart, whose two sons ryan (1996) and austin (2002) became eagles in the troop.







camping

the troop schedules campouts every month throughout the school year. past campouts have focused on backpacking, shooting activities, biking, hiking, and canoeing. each summer we also attend a weeklong summer camp at camp woodruff in the north georgia mountains.
