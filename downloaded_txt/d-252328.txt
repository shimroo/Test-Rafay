beautiful lake texoma is an ideal striper lake. the spawning habits of the striper make it unique as a natural spawning lake. because striped bass eggs must remain suspended in a current until hatching, (about 48 hours), the above-average salt content of the lake’s water makes it the only freshwater lake where the striper can reproduce naturally.
