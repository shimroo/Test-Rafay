it never ends: paul feig (director of a simple favour) defends blake lively against instagram trolls


after a "fan" commented on prime video's instagram post about "another simple favour" to ask whether the final version would be "paul feig's cut or blake's cut", paul feig (director of both "a simple favour" and "another simple favour") hit back with his own comment, saying,¬†‚Äúit‚Äôs my cut. there is no other cut. blake has been nothing but supportive and a dream to work with. she is the best and an amazing collaborator and i‚Äôm her biggest fan. just wanted to clear that up.‚Äùfeig's support of lively has been consistent since the beginning of the ever-evolving legal mess between lively and her former co-star and director justin baldoni that began on the set of "it ends with us". in december, he quote tweeted a nyt tweet containing the article, "we can bury anyone: inside a hollywood smear machine" and added, "i‚Äôve now made two movies with blake and all i can say is she‚Äôs one of the most professional, creative, collaborative, talented, and kind people i‚Äôve ever worked with. she truly did not deserve any of this smear campaign against her. i think it‚Äôs awful she was put through this.‚Äùhe also previously shut down rumours swirling earlier this year that "another simple favour" would be shelved due to lively's ongoing legal battle with baldoni (ontd post here). rolling stone 1, 2"another simple favour" will premiere at the opening night of sxsw on march 7.
