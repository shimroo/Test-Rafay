opinions throughout history  
this exciting new series offers a wide range of insights into long-standing issues that americans are most concerned about, and those that have encouraged vigorous debate among politicians and citizens at large. using carefully chosen original documents that cover a wide time span, opinions throughout history weaves a thoughtful and easy-to-understand analysis of how public opinion is formed and evolves, starting the discussion at an historical, seminal moment, and ending with where we stand today.
