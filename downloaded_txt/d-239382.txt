  10 basic steps toward christian maturity














        introduction: the uniqueness of jesus
      

jesus christ is the subject of more than 300 old testament prophecies. his birth nearly 2,000 years ago, and events of his life had been foretold by many prophets during a period of 1,500 years.

        step 1: the christian adventure
      

to believe in jesus christ as the savior of the world is to believe in a living person. people often ask, “what is the meaning of belief?” the amplified new testament expresses the full meaning of the term believe as “adhere to, trust in, and rely on.” the gospel of john has been called the gospel of belief.


        read more
      











        step 2: the christian and the abundant life
      

the christian life is a personal, intimate relationship between you and christ. this life begins in faith (ephesians 2:8-9) and can only be lived by faith. faith is another word for trust. we trust our lives to christ's keeping because he has proven himself trustworthy by his life, his death, his resurrection, and his abiding presence - his unconditional love.

        step 3: the christian and the holy spirit
      

in this lesson, you will study biblical evidence proving that the holy spirit is a real person who loves and cares for you. you will also discover why he came and how he can make a difference in your life.


        read more
      











        step 4: the christian and prayer
      

grow in your understanding about why prayer is so important to the christian life.

        step 5: the christian and the bible
      

in this lesson you will study the various names of the bible, survey its construction, and gain insights that will make your own bible study more meaningful.


        read more
      














        step 6: the christian and obedience
      

have you ever wondered what god's will is for your life? have you needed to make a difficult decision and wondered what god wanted you to do in that situation?


        read more
      











        step 7: the christian and witnessing
      

jesus christ's last command to the christian community was to make disciples. this command, which the church calls the great commission, is the responsibility of every man and woman who professes faith in christ as lord.


        read more
      











        step 8: the christian and giving
      

as christian stewards, we must realize that in christ “we live and move and have our being” (acts 17:28). the objective of this lesson is to surrender everything we have to god because we can rest in his ownership of all.


        read more
      














        step 9: exploring the old testament
      

this lesson focuses on the origins of man and sin and the results of the fall. as you study, relate the events of our earliest history to the condition of our present world and how it affects you today.

        step 10: exploring the new testament
      

the gospel of matthew is the link between the old and new testaments. matthew wrote to the jews to prove that christ is their promised messiah and the eternal king of kings and lord of lords.
