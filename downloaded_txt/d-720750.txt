best tattoo shop in the twin cities and probably the entire state, hands down. - john a.







my tattoo artist was lindsay and she did a beautiful job. this was a memorial tattoo and meant a lot to me, she handled the design and process better than i could have hoped for. i loved the entire process, she was so attentive and kind, i felt so comfortable. i highly recommend her and i will definitely keep her in high regard for future projects. her work on instagram is beautiful, plenty of updates on there.  - alina h.







best place in the whole twin cities for tattoos. the artist at uptown are the best. - jack







got 2 tattoos from brandon & truly i could not be happier. not only is the tattoo gorgeous but brandon took the time to make sure i was comfortable. absolutely going back for my next tattoo. - athena i.







girlfriend got a tattoo here and the artists were genuinely nice and informative. lots of cool artwork all around the shop. they play awesome tunes and the energy is very good - hanson







the best tattoo shop in minneapolis. period. and newly remodeled (december 2018)! nic, dan and crew are deeply experienced, serious artisans. i've had dan kytola do four pieces - his work ethic, attention to detail and passion are intense. definitely worth the investment!  - tim b.







this shop is awesome! super clean. nic is a great artist and has a soft touch. i would highly recommend this shop!! - paula







i spent days going over reviews of different shops\artists and their work. i finally went to uptown tattoo and realized how much time i wasted. other shops might have 1-2 great artists - this place has 6! everyone here does great work. which artist you choose depends on what style you are looking for. new remodel is great - place is clean and welcoming. everyone from the desk to the artists were professional and really cool. thanks to dan for my first large ink! great work - great conversation! - steve p.







awesome artists, excellent work, sweet remodel! i've been having work done here for 20 years and will continue to. - mike h.
