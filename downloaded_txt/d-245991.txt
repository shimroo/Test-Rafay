the tangram life puzzle





here is an excerpt from my latest photo post on instagram:
maybe i can't see the forest for the trees? i have to come to the conclusion that i have to add additional pieces to the tangram life puzzle. i miss fizzle’s palapa online community. i have to check out zen business. do you have a favorite digital town hall? i will join a new business network in the near future. it is called booster friends. where do you go for business mixers? i am starting my well-being journey on march 20, the persian new year, nowruz. these are my phrases for the year:🧠🤝🧡 value each other (veo advisor)🎧⚡️🎙 value 4 value (podcasting 2.0 certified)📦💪🏻💰 purchasing power w/ a membership club (livegood affiliate)i will also come up with my three words for the year in the near future...today i am celebrating 1 year as an affiliate (”independent distributor”) with livegood. i have a team of about 40 individuals (affiliates and members). my goal is to reach the next rank, gold, during this year. i strive to introduce 100 individuals (affiliate members, regular members, and retails customers) to this new type of e-commerce.i will continue to purchase products from other direct selling companies, e.g., microsilver products from lr health & beauty systems, and i am open to become a retail customer to other companies.i have been involved in several network marketing during the years, and i have learned plenty from the mlm (multi-level marketing) industry. the good, the bad, and the ugly… for example my activities in a chocolate company, had some bittersweet memories. i did a search on the net now, and found this piece of document. i am taking into account my experiences from a cashback company and a travel company, as i am looking into this new company.check out ben glinsky’s commentary on ”golden handcuffs” in the business world. (livegood firestarter-friday training zoom, march 8. ceo, ben glinsky starts his positive rant, around the 20 min. mark). as an ending note, please listen to:18 years of podrunner (music mix, 180 bpm - “post haste”)tea party and media, episode 13 of tea party media pocast
