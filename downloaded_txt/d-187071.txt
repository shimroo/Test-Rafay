recycling glass better in the lowcountry since 1992
























fisher recycling is able to produce higher volumes of clean glass than other waste haulers in the tri-county area because we have a better collection method. did you know that most of the glass that people think they are recycling at work and home actually ends up going into landfills? this is a growing problem for the environment, and our family-owned business is on a mission to change this for the local community! we truly want to give the commercial and residential glass that we collect a second life, and are proud to say that we can recycle 100% of it because we are keeping it out of the single stream and clean for reuse.we’re asking local businesses to partner with us.23% of commercial waste is glass, so partnering with fisher recycling to divert your company’s glass from the landfills truly does make a difference. a complimentary waste audit will help us develop the best, most cost-effective recycling solution for your business. you can also sponsor community drop sites for residential glass to make an even bigger impact and gain recognition.

the fisher family loves to innovate! in 2005, we founded glasseco surfaces. this product line completes the local recycling loop by processing some of the glass collected by fisher recycling and reusing it in stylish custom countertops and other hard surfaces.
