the remarkable story of ricky simpson...

kent moedl steadman (1942 - 
2008) 








 


kent moedl steadman (1942 - 
2008) was born january 17, 1942, during a snow storm at his great-aunt maryâs in 
sandy, ut. in much the same way as he entered, kent left this world at the age 
of 66, when his heart gave out while playing in the snow with his grandson at 
his home in burien, wa. kent received his master's of arts from brigham 
young university in utah. he was a highly respected art teacher at fresno city 
college for 23 years. after retirement, kent continued to serve as a mentor and 
teach others about the art of love, intelligence, creativity, and compassion. 
born with a disability that he overcame through art and music, kent understood 
the joy of being different. a troubadour and vagabond, many will remember his 
music, which he believed to be the true expression of the soul. kent was a 
pioneer on the internet with his site, http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/, where he 
shared his philosophy with many people. his playful sense of humor always 
charmed and uplifted his friends and loved ones. he was preceded in 
death by his father, f. moedl steadman; mother, leah steadman; brother, f. bruce 
steadman. he is survived by his wife, wendy steadman; brothers, stan, dave, 
randy, and lee steadman; children, shannon, amber, leah and brian; grandson, 
quentin camp. we honor his life with music, art, friends, and 
family.
to all in the orbit community,we would like to extend our 
thanks to you for the years your support has brought love and joy into kent's 
life. he devoted his life to finding the unique and extraodinary and on this 
journey you were his friends, and in many ways a second family. to those of you 
who've sent your condolences and shared your words of encouragement with us. 
your thoughts have brought much needed solace to our hearts.love, 
the steadman family
