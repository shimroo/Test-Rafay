we recommend using permitted lodgingthe vacation rental business has been a hot topic on maui for over 20 years.  my former bed and breakfast, hale ho'okipa inn, was one of the very first permitted b&b's on maui.  it was a big deal to grapple with a whole new industry that was here to stay. maui county council and planning department met the challenge and crafted ordinances with rules and regulations governing home-sharing vacation rentals.please book with permitted b&bs (bed and breakfasts), tvrs (transient vacation rentals), or strhs (short term rental homes). it is a lot of effort and energy to get and maintain a license.i have listed only a few accommodations on each page.there are many wonderful choices and the county website will confirm permitted possibilities. scroll down and find information in the faq section.enjoy your stay and check them out for updates and availability.
