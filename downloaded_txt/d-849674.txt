 neuro-linguistic programming  is an amazingly effective transformational technology that has been known to produce rapid and profound change in people's behavior, beliefs and identities. a skilled nlp practitioner does this by gently and truthfully challenging a client's "structure of reality" and helping the client discover useful and constructive alternatives. the personal change that happens is facilitated by innovative, full-body neurological re-patterning techniques - and love.

as a well know nlp trainer once said: "nlp by itself has no heart. it's the practitioner that brings the heart and compassion to the session with a client." with this attitude of allowing, heart and compassion, the techniques and principles of neuro linguistic programming become powerful tools and agents for transformation that can change old and chronic problems into new  solutions that are as good as, or better than the old habitual choices and patterns.
