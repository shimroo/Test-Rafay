every bead tells a story...



shop
welcome to beth grant glass. i'm a glass bead artist based in orangeville, in the beautiful headwaters area of ontario. i use the lampwork beads i make to create one-of-kind pieces of sterling silver jewellery as well as other gift items such as pate and cheese knives and bookmarks.
when i'm in my studio working, you can watch me creating beads! this is a fascinating process and well-worth the walk down the long hallway to the room at the back of dragonfly arts on broadway, in downtown orangeville, where my studio is located. better hurry! i'm giving up my studio at the end of this year (2024) but my work will continue to be available at dragonfly in limited quantities.
as you look around my website you will see that for me  'it's all about the colour!'. my beads are inspired by my adventures in canada and beyond and i have set up my website to demonstrate this relationship (be sure to watch the banner at the top of this page!). if you click on the bead collections button you will enter my world of beads!  to watch a video of me in action please visit the studio & showroom.  have fun looking around!!!!

latest update
it's been an amazing run! i will be giving up my studio at dragonfly at the end of the year (2024) and moving on to other adventures. my work will continue to be available in limited quantities in the shop while supplies last. joan is keeping the equipment at the back so i may be inspired to make a few beads at some point! thank you for your support over the years.
the online shop is closed due to the canada post strike.
