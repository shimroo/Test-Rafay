reiki









some people receive a massage just to relax and feel good, while others get a massage for medical purposes. massage not only stretches and loosens muscles, but also promotes other positive changes in the body; it increases circulation, improves joint flexibility, decreases anxiety and stress, and reduces pain in the muscles and joints – and simply feels great!
