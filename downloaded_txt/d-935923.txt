                                      in wrightwood have taken advantage of 
                                      recent heavy snowfall to conduct training 
                                      with their snowcat. this invaluable piece 
                                      of fire apparatus allows us to rescue a 
                                      victim in need when mother nature doesn't 
                                      allow access for a traditional fire engine 
                                      or ambulance. with more snow expected this 
                                      winter the snowcat could be put to use in 
                                      a real emergency

                                      it's that time of the year for santa ana 
                                      winds







extra vigilance and safety is urged
                                      at this time!
the constant threat of wildland fires 
                                      is a way of life and this past season's 
                                      low precipitation greatly increases the 
                                      potential. 

                                      santa ana winds are associated with some 
                                      of the area's largest and deadliest 
                                      wildfires, including the state's largest 
                                      fire on record, the cedar fire, as well as 
                                      the laguna fire, old fire, esperanza fire, 
                                      panorama fire and the witch fire.
 



what are santa ana winds?
                                      santa ana winds are strong, extremely dry 
                                      offshore winds that affect coastal 
                                      southern california and northern baja 
                                      california in autumn and winter. they can 
                                      range from hot to cold, depending on the 
                                      prevailing temperatures in the source 
                                      regions, the great basin and upper mojave 
                                      desert. the winds are known for the hot 
                                      dry weather (often the hottest of the 
                                      year) that they bring in the fall, and are 
                                      infamous for fanning regional wildfires.

                                          businesses in seven southern

                                          the firefighters who bravely fought 
                                          the fires of 2007 prevented even 
                                          further economic loss by keeping the

                                          they have to cope with other economic
