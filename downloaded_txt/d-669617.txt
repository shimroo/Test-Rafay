specializing in investment grade single-tenant and multi-tenant
properties   

we are constantly told that we are by far, the nations top must-go-to site for principal
developers, 
owners, 1031 & 1033 buyers and investors dealing in the nations top institutional & 
investment-grade commercial real estate investments

we are changing the way commercial real estate is
selling
more & more sellers think exclusive listing agreements belong in the 

feel sometimes like you're swimming in an ocean full of sharks?  


to read about some of the traditional and what we think are out dated shark tacticsthat we see
every day in the commercial real estate
brokerage community.  these may surprise you ! 



owners have nothing to lose by using us and much to gain.  sellers enjoy a confidential, direct &
powerful 
sales with a well-known expert in the industry without a requirement of any listing agreement.  we
bring 
strictly screened,  direct principal buyers to owners.  our confidential selling techniques
prevent employees, 
management, and customers from becoming alarmed or threatened by a common public campaign to sell
a property.  
	

what do developers, owners, and sellers think of us? . . .


may, 2005 from a walgreens, eckerd, and cvs developer:  " que, you are the man!!! and to think - i
was 
one of the first to talk to you when you were just a crazy man with an idea!! congratualtions! "



" i have been on your mailing list since july 2002. you were my purchasing agent in a property in
texas that 
closed in late 2002. i had also sold 3 properties in 2002 and know i could have done better,
faster with you. i 
will list and purchase with you the next time.  i like your web site and it is the place on the
internet to look for 
or sell properties " 

"what a great idea!"
i want to take this opportunity to thank you very much.  with time running short in our 1031 & the
45 day 
crisis at hand, the deal you found for us was completed under the wire.  it fits in with my
situation perfectly.  
once again thanks and i look forward to our next encounter
"good morning que. just wanted to say thank you for the interest you have been able to draw to my
properties. 
as you know there are a lot folks out there who say a lot and do very little. i believe you are an
exception to that. 
keep up the good work!"
" i think you have an excellent idea for marketing real estate here"
"thanks for selling our properties.  looking forward to many more with you"
"it's refreshing to see someone working so quickly without pressuring us for a listing!"
"you seem to be the only one generating interest in our properties.  much more than even our local
brokers"
"thanks for selling 2 of our properties to your 1031 buyer.  the balance of our available
properties are in the 
mail to you today"
"i love this way of being notified about your new buyers"
"you have a great idea with your home page and selling commercial real estate"
"you may know this already, but is appears that your great service is miles ahead of the
competition and a 
welcomed system for selling our properties"
"this is a fabulous idea and i want to use it all to our best advantage"
"i am still a novice at this internet game. this is a great idea you have going"
"your program is very interesting and informational"      



1031 buyers love our speed in which we can recommend properties to fit their replacement needs and

time constraints.  our buyers and investors enjoy our array of inventory - much of which are
confidential 
offerings they would otherwise have no knowledge of.  buyers also enjoy a us as a credible source
who 
can deliver controlled properties rather than hot air.

what do other 1031 buyers and other investors think of us? . . .


"hey there que, i am now the proud owner of a *** in dallas, and after today i should own a new
*** in las vegas.  
to whom do i give the credit for finding these gems?  why of course, you, who knows and sees
everything (well 
almost anyway).  thanks again for our second 1031 with you"

"our reit is thankful for your bringing to us a new addition to our portfolio.  looking forward to
continued business"

"thanks for all the work you have done for our 1031 exchange.  we have closed on the new drug
store you brought 
to us and would like to remain in contact with you"

site

				
are you in a large 1031 exchange (sales price over $3 million) and have very little
debt to replace?
ask us to recommend a bond net zero-cash flow property occupied by an investment grade tenant for
you that will allow 
you to dump your cash into a replacement property, satisfy your exchange, and then quickly pull
out up to 90% of your 
cash - with no refinancing fees!  you will then be free to use the cash any way you like with no
exchange requirements 
since you have already satisfied the exchange requirements.these are also excellent vehicles to
shelter tax gains and 
popular investment among  trusts, pensions and estate planners
