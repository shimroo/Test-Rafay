the source of the story … 













one day, while meditating, i heard a faint, otherworldly sound, as if coming from deep within me.  as i focused on this sound, it carried me far beyond myself until there was only awareness—awareness so vast that it embraced everything.  



  











and then, this little phrase appeared in my mind:  once upon a time, i was. and with that came a radical idea: to express the mystical view of creation—the cosmic play—in the form of a children’s book. becoming me was conceived.



  











i brushed this idea aside, assuming it was too complex for children, too childlike for adults, too spiritual for atheists, and too unconventional for religious. then one day, years later, i could no longer resist it. i listened again, teased out the rest of the story and, within one week of finishing it, had found a publisher and was introduced to christopher gilvan-cartwright, a marvelous painter who had been working on similar themes. becoming me was born.



  











the response to becoming me took me by surprise. it has been endorsed by scientists, psychologists, and leaders of many faiths. it has been featured by the secular philosophy for children program and taught on the official religious education curriculum in uk schools. rather than seeming odd, it seems familiar. it is loved by children and adults. and people from vastly different traditions say it reminds them of what they know, deep down, to be true. 



  











i have performed becoming me (with music)) at interfaith, environmental, and healthcare conferences, and teach seminars on its deeper philosophy. it has been the subject of religioius sermons and sunday school classes, and it has been given as gifts for weddings and confirmations, to console people grieving, and best of all, to welcome babies into the world. 



  











i hope becoming me will remind you of some essential truths:  that we are not separate, that we are held in love, and indeed, we are love. and that life—no matter how difficult it may seem—is always an opportunity for play, discovery, and wonder.
