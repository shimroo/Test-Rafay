  why gas fireplaces need an annual inspection

gas fireplaces need an annual inspection to keep up to date. this is a very important practice, which many overlook, myself included. because gas fireplaces burn clean and are very easy to care for, some assume they don't need cleaning. while it is true that gas fireplaces are both efficient and low maintenance, it's a known fact that any appliance can become a nuisance if neglected. that is why you need an annual inspection of your gas fireplace. by cleaning your fireplace and chimney, you can put your mind at ease when you start your unit this season.
every fireplace or insert should be cleaned annually. this is due to the hard work a fireplace puts in with each use when heating your home. it's best to get your fireplace checked each spring; that way, you will have a flawlessly functioning fireplace all year round, but whatever schedule is easiest for you will work for the fireplace, too.

phil was a great help. he set me up with and soap stone wood stove for my new home. the installation went smoothly. there was a delay with the estimate before hand but everyone gets busy at times. overall i’m quite pleased with the product and installation.-chris d.

great support and customer service. for a new brick light post in front of our house, we needed to match 20 year old existing brick. kevin was very helpful, exploring options and finding an exact match from their yard at a very reasonable price. project turned out great, including matched brick for a step on our patio.  prompt and responsible, very helpful.-todd m.
