true pressurized filtration
world's leading hydro cyclonic filtration system
coast spas is proud to offer the world's leading and exclusive hydro-cyclonic filtration system, a revolutionary technology that is an integrated system that sets the standard for hot tub filtration. our innovative filtration system works by creating a powerful whirlpool effect that circulates and traps debris, dirt, and other contaminants, leaving your hot tub water crystal clear and sparkling clean. this not only provides an exceptional hot tub experience for you and your guests, but it also helps to save on maintenance and upkeep costs by reducing the need for frequent cleaning and chemical treatments. in addition, our cyclonic filtration system is designed to be low-maintenance, with easy-to-remove filters that can be quickly and easily cleaned or replaced as needed.

commercial grade filtration
closed pressurized filtration systems clean water better than traditional residential spa filter systems. they also prevent contaminants from re-entering the bathing area when your pumps are off. that’s why resorts and hotels must use them in their hot tubs and pools, and why we only use them at coast spas, making us stand apart in our industry. in addition, our exclusive hydro cyclonic filtration system has a patented design to cleanse your water 80% faster and 20% more efficiently than traditional systems.
