we have a passion for the weather. we love to study clouds, gauge winds, count raindrops, predict storms, and track every single life-affecting detail. this boundless enthusiasm for all things meteorological began brewing in 1976 when wind & weather opened its doors on the beautiful north coast of california. over three decades later, we're drenched in industry knowledge and experience, and recognized as a world-trusted supplier of weather instruments.
