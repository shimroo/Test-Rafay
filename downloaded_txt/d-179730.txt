our history



with more than 70 years of product enhancement and customer support, and a fleet that has accumulated more than 40 million flight hours, you might say we know a thing or two about industry leadership. from speed to range to safety to innovation, we’re constantly refining what it means to fly a mooney. while staying true to the vision established by al mooney from the very beginning. a passion for speed, strength and safety defines mooney’s philosophy.








manufacturing



the people of kerrville, in the texas hill country, take extraordinary pride in their craftsmanship and work ethic. building on expertise that spans decades, they lovingly ply their craft in metal, precision welds, leather, and paint, followed by inspection and flight-testing to deliver an aircraft that has not only a sound structure but also a passionate soul. even with state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment and techniques, it takes several thousand man-hours to produce just one mooney. if a mooney feels like a more personal, intimate flying experience, there’s a simple explanation for that: it is.








engineering & design



mooney has a dedicated team of engineers, industrial designers, and professionals who research, design, build, and test innovative aircraft with a simple goal: to make mooney the best next-generation ga aircraft in the world. simply put, we operate like a start-up that just happens to be 70 years old. never mind that mooney holds more than 130 world speed and altitude records, as well as an impressive safety record. to us, that’s just a good start. call us overachievers, but once you fly a mooney, no further explanation is necessary.
