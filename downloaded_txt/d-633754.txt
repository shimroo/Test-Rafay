the big question – how do i feel like the ‘real’ parent?



                for our second ‘big question’ webinar, we wanted to explore a topic that comes up a lot for our members. the word ‘real’ can feel particularly emotive in the donor conception community where the loss of a genetic connection to a child, usually an expectation for parenthood, can make people question their role and even their legitimacy. parents worry that it will be thrown back at them by their children, picturing a scene where a child says “you’re not my real mum/dad” and struggling to know how to respond.
all this made us decide to pose ‘how can i feel like the real parent?’ as the next question in our webinar series.
we’ve invited jana rupnow to help us try to answer the question, and to reflect on how parents and prospective parents can navigate the complex thoughts and emotions around this topic.
jana is an international author, speaker and counsellor, based in the us. she has a wealth of knowledge about donor conception, built over the years by hearing from both parents and donor conceived people themselves. in 2018 she published her best-selling book ‘three makes baby’ (available in the dcn bookshop as we consider it such a valuable resource).
since 2010, jana has helped thousands of people facing the psychological and social challenges of infertility as well as those preparing for third-party family building and adoption. she knows what it’s like to be in a non-biological family herself, as both an adoptee and adoptive mum. she has personal experience of infertility as she and her husband had male-factor secondary infertility. this led to them adopting their daughter from china which means she also has experience of being a culturally diverse family. all of this puts her in a great position to consider the topic with us.
the conversation will explore themes such as:
•	why does that word ‘real’ hold such power?
•	what role does biology play in feeling like a parent?
•	how do we define ‘mum’ or ‘dad’?
•	how can couples feel equally ‘real’ as parents when their genetic connection to the child may be different 
you can also join in the conversation. we’ll be open to written comments and questions from members, either when you register or live during the event.
we’ll be recording the conversation and will put the video in the members’ area on the website shortly after the event. anyone registered for the webinar will get notified when the recording is available.
finally, as if all that wasn’t enough, one lucky attendee will be selected to receive a free signed copy of jana’s book.

getting started



                event for prospective parents thinking about using egg, sperm or embryo donation.
if you’re thinking about using donor conception, you probably have lots of questions. this event is the perfect place to start getting answers. join us and hear from:
* __an embryologist__ from a uk clinic giving a really informative overview of the medical side of things. we always get fantastic feedback about this session, which provides an essential foundation with lots of time for questions.
* __donor conceived people__ talking about their experiences. how do the children feel? we know this is something lots of prospective parents wonder about. this event provides a rare opportunity to hear from them in person and ask questions. not to be missed!
* __parents__ talking through their decision-making and describing family life once children arrive. nothing beats hearing from people with real life experience.
𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿? this event is suitable for everyone at the start of their donor conception journey, for same-sex and heterosexual couples and for those planning to become single parents. it’s a friendly, inclusive chance to meet others at a similar stage in a relaxed environment at this in-person event.
𝗔𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹: the full day costs just £75 per person or £130 per couple when booked before 8 march (£90 and £160 after that date) and the 11am start time makes it easy to get to waterloo and home in a day. this event is a donor conception network event so you can rest assured that all information will be impartial and based on our experience as a charity working with donor conception families for the past 30+ years. 
𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗲?
you can find the full programme with timings below.
𝗙𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗸
the ticket price includes tea, coffee and cake but not lunch; this helps us keep costs down and means you can choose and order whatever you’d like separately. you can find the pub’s menu here: https://www.thehercules.co.uk/food/menus. you are also free to have lunch elsewhere (or bring your own) of course but we hope you’ll stay with us during the break as it will be a great opportunity to chat with other attendees and our dcn team.

making it real



                workshop for professionals working with donor conception families and prospective parents. 
do you work with donor conception families or with patients using donor eggs, sperm or embryos? our ‘making it real’ workshop is specially designed for you, to enhance your knowledge and understanding of this route to parenthood and help you offer families the support they need. 
“𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘭𝘺 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘡𝘰𝘰𝘮 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘐 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘵𝘰!”
“𝘐 𝘸𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘥𝘦𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘭𝘺 𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘧𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭𝘴 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘧𝘪𝘦𝘭𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘭𝘢𝘱𝘴 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘢 𝘰𝘧 𝘥𝘰𝘯𝘰𝘳 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯.”
this workshop will deepen your own understanding of the ways in which creating a child using eggs, sperm or embryos from a third party, including with surrogacy, is different from standard fertility treatments. we look at how to help prospective parents consider the lifetime implications of this route for the child and the family. we also look at how to support families as children grow up and circumstances (and interest levels) change.
𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀
* friday 9 may 2025
* 9:15am – 4:45pm
* zoom – online
* £130 or early bird price £100 if booked before 1 march
𝗙𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱:
1. hear the experiences of parents and donor conceived adults – how do these families fare in the long term?
2. consider the place of the donor, the donor’s family and any genetic siblings or half-siblings in donor conception families (especially important post-2023).
3. learn how dna testing is revolutionising the making of genetic connections and the implications for families.
4. listen to dc network’s long view of life for donor conception families
5. feel better supported in your role in the fast changing world of donor conception.
𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗽 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱:
* the support needed by donor conception families before, during and after treatment, especially as choices are being made about clinics and countries.
* the popularity of genetic testing companies and the impact of the removal of anonymity in the uk – what’s changed now that the donor register has opened?
* the services and resources offered by dc network – and how these complement and build on information provided and counselling undertaken in clinics and elsewhere
* the social and emotional issues of using donated gametes
* the implications of the use of dna and genetic testing websites
* the experiences of patients and clients in greater depth.
𝗔𝗹𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗱?
please note that the content of this workshop will be very similar to those run in previous years. if you attended before, you are welcome to attend the day again or you may like to take this opportunity to recommend it to colleagues so they can experience it for themselves.
attendance at this workshop will inform your policy and practice in helping you support your clients and patients in making decisions that are right for their future. if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us on 020 7278 2608 or at enquiries@dcnetwork.org.

workshop: telling & talking (solo mum and two-mum families)



                this workshop is for parents of donor-conceived children aged 0-7 years. 
not sure how to begin a conversation with your child about their donor conception story? maybe you’re unsure about whether telling is the right thing to do? or perhaps you’re concerned about who to tell and not tell in your life? our telling & talking workshop is designed specifically with your needs and questions in mind. it provides a safe and confidential space for you to explore the benefits of telling and how to get started.
this workshop is equally appropriate whether you had treatment in the uk or abroad, with a known, identifiable or anonymous donor or if your treatment involved surrogacy.  you may be wondering how to start talking to your child about their donor-conceived origins, or you may have already begun this process and would like to explore what may come up in the future.
as a single or lesbian woman, we recognise that your experiences are different from the time your pregnancy becomes public knowledge, and that attending our workshop even before your baby is born might be helpful for you. all of our single women and lesbian couples’ workshops have a small number of places for pregnant women.

dcn spring conference 2025



                we’re really excited to announce that tickets are on sale for our annual dcn members’ conference in north london on sunday 27 april 2025. 
the event is a wonderful opportunity to connect with others and to hear from knowledgeable and inspiring speakers.
__programme for the day__
we have a full day planned and it’s been exciting putting the programme together. you’ll hear from parents and donor conceived adults speaking about their feelings and experiences. we have invited debbie kennett to talk about home dna testing. debbie is an expert and author on genetic genealogy. she’ll explain about what home dna testing is, how people are using it and the impact and implications for donor conception families.
we’re excited to have dr vasanti jadva from university of london presenting her research, aiming to shed light on the complexity of searching for donor connections and the different feelings that people can have towards those they are connected to.
aside from the main presentations, you’ll have the option to join a small group to focus discussion on specific topics (more details about that session will come in a few weeks). the breaks and final hour will provide some relaxed time for conversations and connections with other members, making the day social as well as informative and supportive.
𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁?
* parents of donor conceived children: if you’ve had children this is a chance to meet other parents, to share experiences and get support. this is a family event so we provide childcare and activities for children up to 12 to make it possible for you all to attend the day.
* dc teens and adults: this is an opportunity for children 13-17 and dc adults 18+ to join us for the day and meet with others.
* professionals in the field: please do join us for an informative and thought-provoking event.
𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗱 𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗿𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗲𝘁?
if you haven’t had children yet, you’re welcome to join us at this conference but do be aware that the content is aimed mostly at parents. also, we’d like you to be aware that there will be babies and children present. if you do decide to book, we’ll make sure we connect you with any other prospective parents who are there on the day, but you might find our [getting started](https://www.dcnetwork.org/events/getting-started/) event on 29 march more suitable and valuable.
𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼
you can find more details about the conference in the following documents:
* [information summary](https://www.dcnetwork.org/app/uploads/2025/01/general-information-london-conference-2025.pdf)
* [childcare and activities for children](https://www.dcnetwork.org/app/uploads/2025/01/babies-children-teens-london-conference-2025.pdf)
* programme for the day: we’re still finalising the exact timings but will load a programme soon
* childcare and children’s activity places are limited so book soon
* booking deadline is 22 april
* cancellations befor 11 april will be refunded in full but we aren’t able to refund after that date
𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮 𝗗𝗖𝗡 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿?
this event is for dcn members and is one of the many benefits of membership. you can join us for just £7 per month (less if you are a lower income household) and as a member, in addition to being able to book tickets for the conference, you’ll also get access to online chats, whatsapp groups, exclusive events, and much more. [join here](https://www.dcnetwork.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&id=7).
𝗠𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮 𝗮𝘁 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀: it’s really important to us that our conferences and events provide a safe, confidential space for us to discuss what can be very personal matters. we therefore do not allow journalists or media to attend unless they are joining in a personal capacity as a parent or prospective parent via donor conception or are a donor conceived adult. everything discussed within our events is confidential and may not be reported or shared outside of the event.
