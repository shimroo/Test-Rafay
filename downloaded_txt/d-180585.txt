legacy

the heinz center aims to restore nonpartisan environmentalism by informing and convening decision makers. we provide opportunities to discuss scientific and economic information from businesses, universities, government agencies and non-profit organizations.â the center is a living memorial to the late us senator john heinz (r-pa). since 1995, we have worked to honor his legacy: a passion for the natural world; a commitment to science as the foundation for sound policy; and an enthusiasm for cooperation across the partisan aisle.

rebuilding a national environmental consensus

the heinz center aims to rebuild a nonpartisan, conservationist majority in washington. building on our historic role in research and ecosystem management, today we concentrate on a small number of environmental issues that are a) important; and b) susceptible to a coalition approach. we supply policy makers with scientific and economic information aimed at non-specialists, coverage of pertinent policy developments, and convenient downtown facilities for private discussions.
