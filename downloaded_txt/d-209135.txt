with great sadness, we share the news of the passing of our friend and teacher shelomo ben
  avraham, the originator and principal contributor of mechon
  mamre. his kindness and deep knowledge of rambam's mishneh torah
  inspired many students to follow in his path. he is sorely
  missed.
mechon mamre
here you will find the hebrew bible (tana"kh) and the rambam's
  complete restatement of the oral law (mishneh torah): 
  together these give god's full guidance for both jews and
  gentiles in all times and places detailing what god expects us to
  do and not do.  through the study and observance of these
  two guides to torah (god's instructions) we can all live richly
  rewarding lives and avoid painful errors.  both our online
  and offline bible and mishneh torah texts have been carefully
  prepared, and they are as accurate as found in the very finest
  printed editions.  (additional materials are also provided,
  but they are not the heart of this site.)
note about the site format: you can change font size, text width, and
	background color by clicking on the  menu at the top of any page.

we are developing additional online and offline resources for
  learning torah.  although all material on our site is
  copyrighted freeware, we do hope you will make a donation, if you
  can.
since most of the content of this site is available in
  zips, we ask that you not use a robot to download this whole
  site:  it is not only unnecessary, but costs us needless
  outlays for the added load on our server, makes the server slower
  for others who are online, and it would take years to read the
  whole site even for speed readers.

  we try to answer all real mail within a day or two.
  the hundreds of letters we get each month have helped us improve the
  site greatly, and we thank you for your on-going help: god
