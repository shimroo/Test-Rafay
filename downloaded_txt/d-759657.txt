fresh beginnings

i’ve had this site for quite a while now and have yet to put it to any real good use. i think, to be honest, that it’s because i wasn’t quite sure which direction i wanted to take with it. i write, right? so, do i want it to be my eventual writer’s home? i’m also a very busy mom of two. do i want it to be all about my family and what we are up to? i read (a lot!). do i want to review books?
there are so many things i could do with my little corner of the internet!
i think that until i have an idea for mooreinspired.com’s clear-cut purpose, it will be for all of the above. luckily, i have some very good friends who can help me later if i need them. so, read what you want to, take from the site what you need, and forgive me if the scattered-ness of it offends those of you who battle a touch of ocd.
muchas smooches,
jodi
