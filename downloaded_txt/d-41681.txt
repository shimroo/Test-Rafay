what does rural health mean to you?
dayle sharp: rural health is caring for a population who have limited access to healthcare while becoming an integral part of the community to make a meaningful impact.
audrey snyder: rural health represents equitable access to quality healthcare, ensuring that residents in rural areas receive the resources and support they need for self-care, primary care, and specialized services. it is about bridging gaps, empowering communities, and fostering well-being through tailored, accessible healthcare solutions.
elizabeth crooks: rural health allows me to bring state of the science nursing care to people who live in some of the most beautiful and remote communities in the u.s. i am fulfilled by the challenge of promoting the health and wellbeing of our rural residents while respecting their unique culture and worldview.
mary isaacson: to be a nurse in a rural setting is an honor and a privilege; as a hospice and palliative care nurse, it can also be sacred. as a rural health nurse, i am invited into personal moments and spaces, where working together we harness the community’s strengths to improve health and wellbeing.
