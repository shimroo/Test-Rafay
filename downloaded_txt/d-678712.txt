albert einstein: i used to wonder how it comes about that the electron is negative. negative-positiveâthese are perfectly symmetric in physics. there is no reason whatever to prefer one to the other. then why is the electron negative? i thought about this for a long time and at last all i could think was âit won the fight!â

new ideas?
we welcome ideas for new products from individuals. sometimes we stand in the forest and can only see trees - while there is so much more out there. we solicit your help and your imagination for new and novel items. remember, the best ideas center around dna. if you have a suggestion, please let us know at lundberg@thednastore.com.
 


unusual:
signatures of famous scientists are always unique and hard to find.  we have one for sale, though, that challenges the idea of 'hard to find' - that is: a manuscript by maurice wilkins, written in his own hand - or a letter written by emmas darwin.



different:
sometimes you just have to have fun with things. 

a fun little video on some of our products.
