prophetic study by larry wilson 










most christians are unaware of coming events about to
change planet earth forever!

an urgent message for you!
planet earth is rapidly approaching disaster. famine, resource depletion, sexual immorality, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, climate chaos, racial inequities, and polarization are happening so quickly, the world is unable to respond. politicians and scientists claim they have the answers, but their results prove how little they really know. earth is heading into a swirling vortex and the final implosion is just before us. nothing can stop the feeling of impending doom.
there is an answer!
the book of revelation reveals that jesus has a plan to dramatically rescue us from the nightmares we face! the climax of the great tribulation will be the revealing of jesus christ, the only savior of mankind. even though many christians believe the saints will be raptured to heaven before the great tribulation begins, the bible reveals a much different story. in fact, one of god’s purposes for the great tribulation is to test the living and determine who really is a saint! if salvation comes through faith in jesus, then a test of faith and loyalty will prove who has faith in jesus. (see revelation 6:9-11.)
learn how events will unfold & how to prepare
if you have an interest in the book of revelation, feel free to request a free download of our most popular book. you may not agree with everything presented in it, but hopefully, it will shed light on information you may not have previously considered. like it or not, believe it or not, the end of life as we know it is almost here and we want you and your family to be prepared!
wake up america seminars is not endorsed by or affiliated with any religious denomination. we believe, among other things, that salvation comes through faith in jesus christ and that the bible is the word of god. of course, a lot of christians say the same thing, but wait until you read how these two beliefs are about to be challenged!
unfortunately, after a lengthy battle with als, larry wilson passed away on january 11, 2021. read about it in the larry wilson farewell letter. read the letter from larry’s family here.
