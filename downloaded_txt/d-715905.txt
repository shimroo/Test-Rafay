question of the day: are married women better off emotionally than single women?





the benefits of marriage are plenty. many women marry for the benefit of feeling love. while others marry for the benefits. history showed us how men married women to get the dowry that was transferred upon the marriage. now, it seems we marry to show the world that someone wanted to take us off the market. yet, have you ever wondered what your life would be like if you never took the committment?


one way to see what life is like on the other side of the relationship spectrum is to look at your friends. are your friends still partying like it is 1999 or do they sit at home waiting for the cable guy to come by for a tune up?
