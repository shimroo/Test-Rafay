things you should know





2degrees offers a range of broadband options including fibre, wireless 4g and 5g, vdsl and adsl, depending on your location.
fair use policy applies to unlimited wireless broadband.
broadband speeds can be impacted by your modem’s performance, the number of devices connected to your modem, server location, your device settings, and your wifi setup.
wireless broadband speeds can be impacted by the distance between your modem and a cell site, the level of usage of a particular cell site by others, and network capability.
to help you pick the right plan for your needs, please use our handy address checker on the page above. if you’re looking for independent information* on the type of broadband connections available at your address, please refer to the broadband map nz (* this information is not acquired, maintained, or verified by 2degrees mobile limited.  we accept no responsibility for the accuracy of the information provided therein).
you can also check your personal broadband data usage through our app or online at my 2degrees. depending on your usage, you can then decide if you want to switch plans.
if your plan includes a modem from us, it will be capable of delivering the speeds we advertise for the plan you’ve chosen. but we cannot make the same guarantees if you choose to bring your own modem.
if you choose to add a landline to your broadband plan, you can bring your existing landline number with you. this applies even if you are switching from a copper line connection to a voip connection. alternatively, you can also ask for a new landline number to be assigned to your 2degrees account.
wireless broadband uses different technology than fibre broadband. for any 3rd party service that requires broadband such as medical alarms, security alarms or any service that requires a fixed landline, we recommend you check with your provider to ensure it is compatible with wireless broadband before signing up to this service.
we have specific responsibilities for the marketing of broadband via codes set by nz telecommunications forum. you can find more about these codes here. if you don’t think we’ve done a great job, or met these responsibilities, you can find our complaints process here.
you can also raise a matter with the telecommunications disputes resolution (tdr) who are an independent body who help manage complaints – tdr.org.nz
