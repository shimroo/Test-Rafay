                                    mike and his team was fantastic to deal with. from start to finish he provided great assistance e.g. contract negotiation, linking us up with property managers solicitors etc. having dealt with other real estate agents, i could see mike clearly stand out of that crowd. very few trustworthy agents out there and he is definitely one of them!
