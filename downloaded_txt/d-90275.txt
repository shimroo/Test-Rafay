    discussion by pastors don elmore and mark downey, hosted by william finck on his program christogenea saturdays on why we shouldn't celebrate christmas.  


    the beginning of this audio also includes a short discussion on the remembrance of the battle of blood river that our fellowship at fgcp.org continues to honor every december.   join us in our annual remembrance:   text and video of pastor downey's presentation of the sermon "battle of blood river"


"there are those who would reduce blood river to secular history, but the holy spirit will not permit me to ignore the divine ramifications and the miraculous destiny that our lord has planned for his people, israel. this is the extraordinary story of god delivering the boers of south africa in a one day battle against the fierce and unrelenting zulu's in 1838." pastor mark downey

proclaiming the good news!

greetings in the wonderful and mighty name of jesus christ.this internet outreach is dedicated to the vision of establishing a christian foundation for the good news of the gospel of the kingdom of jesus christ in the united states. the so called churches in this country, as elsewhere in the world, are corrupted with the trappings of jewish fables and false doctrines detrimental to the true israel people of scripture; that is, the anglo saxon, celtic, scandinavian, germanic and kindred peoples that comprise the twelve tribes, to whom the holy bible is exclusively about.kinsman redeemer ministries is a calling to white people to gather together and worship the one true god; to rightly divide and discern god's word; to proclaim the righteousness of the laws of god and his judgements; to live the truth, the way and the life according to god's will.this ministry "will fear no evil" and will declare the realities of race, government and theology. the calling for those with ears to hear and eyes to see is physical, mental and spiritual. god almighty is calling the lost sheep of the house of israel in this hour, to gather in unity and singleness of purpose to rid our land of the antichrist enemies of god.behold, the supernatural power that awaits implementation through your active participation. as an introduction to the god inspired ministry of kinsman redeemer, please read or listen to the messages by god's servant, pastor mark downey. then, if you are motivated by the holy spirit, enjoin yourself to one of the few uncompromising christian ecclesias in america, whereby if we do not act, will become the ever-darkening nation of hopelessness.after reviewing these messages... if this website has made an impression on your thinking... giving you biblical food for thought and helped you to better understand what life on this planet is all about, then by all means do not hesitate to support the ongoing efforts to expand and promulgate the truth. your support and prayers for the ongoing of this ministry is most appreciated.

    we have such a deep rich history with 20 centuries of beautiful hymns that has been passed down to us, from generation to generation.  hymnody is the study of our hymns and should be periodically touched on in conferences. one of my research books had this in the preface: “in each era, creative people have offered their gifts to the lord, shared by congregations and passed on. so as we worship, we are entering an ongoing song, composed long before our time and continuing into eternity.” randy peterson "be still my soul"

contents:
music history
early influential hymnodists
 interesting background stories on some well known hymns

 the-case-of-christian-identity.mp3


by pastor mark downeydecember 31, 2017scripture reading: acts 14:21-22the following is a letter pastor mark wrote as an expert witness for a christian identity prison case up in michigan.  they've been fighting it for years, and hopefully this will dissolve once and for all.  those in michigan should start making plans to attend the trial in august.dear professor,let me thank you for allowing me to participate in this case as i've been pondering the ramifications, not just in the prison systems, but for pastors, authors and expositors of christian identity. there are adversaries who can obviously twist what we're about with impunity in a few prisons with the hopes that these political opinions transform into laws and then those laws are shown in courts to be applicable to people like myself, which would have an unprecedented prejudice against law abiding identity christians and perhaps trickle down to mainstream christian churches. in fact, this strategy is already in motion and i'll discuss it when i get to the splc. this case is important because it is blatant discrimination and the perpetrators would love for there to be a domino effect to silence us forever.

 eyes-that-see-2.mp3


sermon notes by pastor mark downeyscripture reading:  isaiah 44:9 “they that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.”“oh say can you see” is the first line in the star spangled banner, and francis scott key meant for it to mean patriotic pride after a ferocious all-night battle in the war of 1812, their flag was still visible “by the dawn's early light.” the spirit of 1776, in the form of a flag, reflected what white christian americans were willing to die for, namely our freedom to worship jesus and not be ruled by tyrants. “and when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, hail, king of the jews!” mt. 17:29. when jesus was abducted in the middle of the night by a mob of shameless hypocrites, the cross of calvary is still seen by those who have eyes to see its glory after the dawn of 2000 years. this translation of the kjv is a mockery as well, in that jesus was not king of the jews, that is, the non-israelite edomite pharisees, but rather king of the judahites and thus israel.

 god-guns-government.mp3


sermon notes by pastor mark downeyscripture reading: luke 22:35-38 “and he said to them, when i sent you without purse and wallet and sandals, did you lack anything? and they replied, no, nothing. then he said to them, but now he having a purse must take it, and likewise a wallet, and he not having a sword must sell his coat and buy one. for i say to you that it is necessary for this scripture to be fulfilled in me, that also ‘he was reckoned with the lawless.’ for what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment. and they said to him, “lord, look! here are two swords!” and he said to them, it is sufficient.”forgive me for the alliteration (a series of words starting with the same letter) in our title. perhaps a sequel could be baal, bongos and babylon. the titanic ship of babylon keeps getting closer and closer to the iceberg of god. the admiralty jurisdiction wants to confiscate all life preservers and life boats with the artificial storms of marxist dialectics. there will be some who jump ship into the great whore that sits upon many waters (rev. 17:1, 15). they would rather surrender their souls to the final beast empire of prophecy than walking on water as peter did momentarily. i'm waxing a bit poetic, but can you feel the crescendo of our times hitting the boiling point of christians in the saucepan? the antichrists probably think of us as the frog, but don't want us jumping out of their century long conspiracy to boil us to death. they want voluntary compliance; for us to beg them to please turn up the heat. but be warned, the first breath you take after you surrender will not be the breath of life, but the polluted air of zombies. after so many years of senseless gun-related shootings, they envision the white christian american to march down to their local police station and tell the chief, “please take my gun”. hardly any of these sensational shootings make any sense and most have an uncanny pattern of coincidences, always aided and abetted by the mainstream jewish media. they very seldom tell the whole truth about a shooting and suppress revealing information that would suggest others were involved besides the lone nut. however, god goes so far as to say, “and in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth” rev. 18:24.

 harvey-reichstag.mp3


sermon notes by pastor mark downeyscripture reading: exodus 18:19-23 this is not a sermon about a person named harvey reichstag, but rather the conjunction of the worst ever us natural disaster (according to accuweather.com) and the worst ever political arson fire. the recent hurricane in texas and the german parliament building set ablaze have a common denominator. in 2011 i wrote a sermon called “katrina? you ain't seen nothing yet!” six years later, we're seeing something. we're seeing a storm of devastation nearing 40 inches of rain and $200 billion in damages. in fact, we are seeing a slew of hurricanes. both the hurricane(s) and the arson are not what they appear to be. both exploitations are borne of political expediency for propaganda purposes. both have an impact on national security. both have a calculated future because of the evil inherent from the events. both have an inevitable clash between christianity and jewish communism. both foment extraordinary extremism. both have biblical implications. that may not be specific enough yet to draw some corollaries. so please allow me to explain if you can handle the truth. i say that because most people have been programmed to automatically close their minds to anything having to do with race, god and government; the latter two falsely euphemized as church and state. but, the walls of our minds were meant to be overcome. the truth shall make you free from the barriers of disinformation.

 the-race-traitor-blossoms-2.mp3


sermon notes by pastor mark downeyscripture reading: ii timothy 3:3-5let's start with a word study. contained in today's scripture reading we find two words in bold type, when combined, constitute the race traitor. the opposite of unholy is holy and the greek word for holy (as in “holy nation” in i peter 2:9) is hagios (#g40) and physically means pure. the greek word for unholy is anosios (#g462) and the judeo church has deracinated (removed the racial import) and given it an implied generic meaning of impious or wicked. what these impious race traitors in churchianity ignore in the same strong's concordance citation is a reference to #g3741 hósios, which says, “reverence for what should be hallowed – properly, utter disregard of what is sacred, i.e. willful (arrogant) disrespect of the things of god”. christ told peter, “get behind me, satan! you are a stumbling block to me, because you are not thinking about the things of god, but the things of men” mt. 16:23. in other words, the things of man, which have an utter disregard for the things of god, are satanic and they affect us adversely. you are an adversary or satan of god if you're a traitor to israel, because the people of god are the things of god that matter the most. things have a cause and effect, blessings and curses. so naturally, the race traitor curses us and that's what paul is warning us about; when the treason against true israel happens, there will be “terrible times” and they may be pious, “having a form of godliness, but denying its power”, but in reality, they are “unholy” and “traitorous”.

christian identity - what is it?"for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god: the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth."deuteronomy 7:6as the word identity implies, it is the condition of being the same as something described or asserted. christian identity establishes who the true israel is today according to the holy bible and world history. there is more than adequate and convincing proof that the anglo-saxon, celtic, scandinavian, germanic and kindred peoples are the racial descendents of the tribes of israel.read more...
