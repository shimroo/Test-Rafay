center for healthy living
paths to a healthier you

	no matter your weight loss goals, we have a program that can help. our
	 center for healthy living offers a very successful
	surgical weight loss program that has been helping patients since 2003. we also offer
	medical weight loss - you can learn more by selecting it from our menu.

weight loss the way that's best for you

our surgical weight loss team understands the health risks and lifestyle
		 challenges associated with obesity and have been able to assist individuals
		 in preventing, improving, or even eliminating health conditions such as
		 type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or obstructive sleep apnea. our
		 team of surgeons have performed over 3,000 bariatric surgeries with a
		 constant focus on quality outcomes.


​we also have a robust medical weight loss program that focuses on behavior
	 modification, nutrition and exercise.​

customers place their trust in our program and our team takes that seriously
	 which led to our program's independent decision to seek accreditation
	 by the metabolic and bariatric surgery accreditation and quality improvement
	 program (mbsaqip). accreditation requires a rigorous review process in
	 which a center must prove that established standards of practice are being
	 followed for patient safety. our accredited center reports all bariatric
	 cases and outcomes to a mbsaqip database.

our program also is designated as a blue distinction center for bariatric
	 surgery which allows customers to choose a high-quality program.

we have a very active facebook page, too. visit us there!
please view our brief video introduction to the surgical weight loss process
	 with general surgeons rod tompkins, m.d., and timothy wheeler, m.d., before
	 completing the form. our video can answer many questions you may have.
