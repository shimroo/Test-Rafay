tickets to all performances at the north shore center for the performing arts in skokie are available exclusively through our box office or online at www.northshorecenter.org, which uses ticketmaster, our certified ticketing platform.
ticket scalpers purchase tickets the same way that you can purchase them yourself, and then they generally charge exorbitant mark ups. buying from ticket brokers or the secondary market does not necessarily give you better seating or a better deal, even when they’re following federal regulations.
in addition to paying much more than necessary, if there is a problem with your order (such as counterfeit tickets or lack of ticket arrival), and you purchased tickets from any site other than northshorecenter.org or ticketmaster.com, the north shore center for the performing arts in skokie cannot help you. furthermore, in the event of show time changes, cancellations, etc., we will not be able to notify you of any important show-related items that may occur. if you have questions about purchasing tickets, please call our box office at 847-673-6300.
