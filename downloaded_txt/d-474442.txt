these pages were built using word 360, assembled using web 
expressions 3, and in some cases, html has been tinkered with manually.  
the stats were done using some old spreadsheets (from antti hentuu, a good 
friend of the twilight 2000 community -- i hope i'm spelling his name 
correctly!) in excel 360, with the information gotten with good old research and 
storytelling.

it should be noted, or even obvious, that the 
twilight 2000 stats on the site are in a state of enourmous flux.  
this is because i am updating basically redoing everything little by little, correcting 
stats and updating the information, as well as adding on new stuff and new 
versions of old stuff.  therefore, newer stats do not necessarily gibe with 
older stuff.  i'm sorry for the confusion and possible irritation, but it 
can't be helped.
note: nothing in these pages is for sale by me, not even 
things marked with a dollar sign. do not email me and ask me to sell them to 
you! do not email me and ask me where you can get them!  such emails will 
not be answered, and will be thrown out with the spam.  the items in 
question are for a role-playing game, twilight 2000.  i know most people 
drop directly into web pages on this site from a search engine, but if you do 
come to this home page, read this first before 
emailing me.
links in blue are active; links in black with stars beside 
them are inactive and will be put in later.  (maybe.)
