the flathead lake real estate market
overall: flathead lake real estate would be considered mostly developed with vacation homes for sale, high end custom lakefront homes, cabins, condos and few unimproved land or property sites available for sale . the flathead lake real estate market has reflected the inventory over the years with “hot years” showing only a handful of flathead lake homes for sale, and also slow sales years with high inventory of over a 150 homes for sale.
about flathead lake
flathead lake, mt is one of the 300 largest natural lakes in the world and the largest natural freshwater lake west of the mississippi river and as such is attracting real estate investors, vacation home buyers and waterfront enthusiasts to its shoreline.
according to studies done at the flathead lake biological station in yellow bay (located just south of bigfork, mt), the water in flathead lake is among the cleanest in the world. every new years folks take to the lake for the annual polar bear plunge in woods bay on the eastshore and the plunge in polson bay on the south shore.
the lake, located in nw montana and about 8 miles south of kalispell, is about 191 square miles in surface area with an average depth of 164 feet and a maximum depth of 370 feet. the varied shoreline meanders over 160 miles around all of the waterfront property with the towns of bigfork, lakeside, somers, rollins, elmo, big arm and polson on its shores. wild horse island in big arm bay near rollins is managed by montana dept. of fish, wildlife and parks, and is open for day use to enjoy the 2,100 acres of land. a few lucky people have private ownership of lake property on wildhorse island. hikers will see bighorn sheep and wild horses. there are many public access points on flathead lake, with most at one of the beautiful montana state parks dotting the shore line.
