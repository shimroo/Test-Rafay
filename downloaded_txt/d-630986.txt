i've jumped into the bioinformatics and personalized medicine rabbit hole





well, the quest to dive back into the sciences through clinical genetics continues.  i had an informational interview with a prominent human geneticist and she told me that research funding is tight so no immediate postdoc positions are available in her lab.

at that point, i realized that there will be no easy path to getting my next position.  discouraged but determined, i started pounding the pavement in earnest today.  i did some networking and am focusing my energies towards studying bioinformatics and personalized medicine.

the story of behind this strategy is as follows:  i want to study the genetics of breast cancer in african and african-american populations.  currently there is a wave of technology rising around whole genome sequencing.  if i could sequence the entire genome of one person, i would have the keys to all the genetic information that would allow me to understand if they have any genetic predispositions (ie an increased chance of having a specific trait or quality based on their dna) towards responding to treatments or towards having a certain disease.  basically when you sequence one person's genome (diploid for your scientists out there), you get information on about 6 billion bases of dna.  that's about 1 terabyte of information (1000 gigabytes).  now think of the number of people / genomes that you need to study in order to understand trends in a specific population of patients.  yes, that's a lot o' information.  there's a need for someone to organize and bring this huge amount of data into the context of its biological implications and applications.  i want to be that person.

so right now, i'm studying programming languages (bioperl, biopython, and r) so that i will be able to communicate to programmers how to think about the data that they are organizing.  additionally, i'm looking for post-doctoral positions that will allow me to learn how to do this for a living and am applying for clinical genetics programs as well.

wish me luck!

ps.  i'm sure that is sounds crazy to move into this very unfamiliar territory right now.  however, in my life, i've seen that people who learn difficult skills, that the majority of the population is not motivated to learn, are highly desired.  did that come out right?  basically i'm saying that when you bust your brains to learn something hard, your skills will always be desired and appreciated.  plus i'm a wannabe computer wonk.  this is my chance to go prime time!  here we go!

the career wheel





before i finished grad school i spent ~2 years trying to figure out what i wanted to do.  my interests cycled as if they were on a wheel.  now i'm finding that my interest cycle along the wheel below:




each area has it's challenges.  i don't have a great deal of experience in philanthropy, however i'm pulled towards job ads that offer nonprofit consulting opportunities in this area.  science education is something that i've always pursued as a volunteer and entrepreneurial effort.  but i don't give it the time it needs to become a full career.  science policy is also interesting but trying to get a job in the government requires significant effort--get ready to write-a 4 to 5 page resume and endure the mother of all bureaucracies.  i will do this but i'm not looking forward to it.  finally, research means low pay with no thanks.  it's self driven and you have to live with constant failure.  by the time i finished my grad program i was out of patience with science.

now that i've had a year away, i think that i may have found a compromise.  clinical molecular genetics is a laboratory-based , professional field that focuses on the discovery of and testing  for dna mutations that dictate disease. you can read more about it here.  there are training programs across the country (click on the second to last link at the bottom of the page).  there are commercial and academic job options as well as residency programs and board certification.  the more i read about it the more i want to do a post-doc that will enable me to enroll in this program (most programs are not individually funded).  

could it be that the idea of being a scientist is seducing me again like an attractive woman showing her leg to make a car stop by the road?  i think i'm being seduced again but i may be able to do this on my own terms.

i think that the problem that i had with doing a post-doc originally was that they could be open-ended in terms of finding a job.  most academic faculty positions at research universities have a 300:1 applicant to job ratio.  this is a real statistic!

at the time, the science controlled me--i wasn't controlling the science nor did i feel in control of my future until my degree was in my hands.    

it's funny how a one year stint in corporate america has me longing for the lab!  now that i've had some time away, i'm going to do some thinking and outline of a research program that i would run, incorporating a clinical genetics residency in the mix.  let's see where this rabbit hole will take me--i'm curious to find out!

i'm baaaaack!





greetings community,wow! it's been over a year since i posted.  well to catch you up, 6 months after i graduated and published my paper (yay!), i took a job with a management consultant firm.  after a year of ups and many downs, i left them a little under two weeks ago.i could go into detail about last year, but i feel like it was really a lost year.  i was working so much i felt like my soul was slipping away.so now i'm going through a career transition and am trying to determine the next best step.  during this time, i'm working with a group in my church to help me with this decision.  this includes taking 5 minutes to journal about what's going on in my life and with the transition.here are the rules:1. i have permission to write badly (:2. if i get stuck, i can answer the question "today i learned. . . "so for today's journal entry i'm going to start with the question that i've sought to answer to since the spring semester of my senior year in high school:  what am i going to be when i grow up?when i went to college, my interests included music and child psychology.  however, it was a physiology class that made me fall in love with science.  just being able to learn exactly how my body worked was enough for me to catch the science bug.because of my grades, i was recruited by the ronald e. mcnair program to conduct research the summer after my physiology class.  by that time i decided that i would transition from a general major to biology.  but after my summer of research and learning about biochemistry in chem 101 i quickly changed my major to biochemistry.it didn't matter that this was one of the harder majors at my school.  it didn't matter that i had to take extra chemistry classes and make up for a lost year of school.  i loved what i was learning and took every opportunity to do research in the summers and during the school year.  my future was set.  i would become a professor and conduct research at a tier 1 university.  i finally knew what i was going to do!it seemed that i found my groove in the sciences.  i couldn't wait to go to grad school and so i did.  less than 1 month after graduating college, i dove head first into grad school.  i really didn't want to spend the summer at home and i longed for the big city.  ironically, i was also afraid of the big city and was blessed to be able to stay with my sister while i learned how to live in chicago.life in grad school was ok at first.  i took classes the first year and felt a little fatigue from just coming out of the same environment (note to college seniors--definitely take at least a year off before grad school).  after my first year, i joined a lab and got to work.  fast forward 4 years--i decided to end a dead end project and was struggling to get out of a bout of depression.  6 months later, my boss told me that the lab was closing due to lack of funding and i'd have to start over in a new lab.at this point, the adviser for my program told me that i could leave and pursue science policy.  i previously expressed an interest in this field to my boss and i think it was taken as "she doesn't want to be a professor--abandon ship!"  during the previous years, i found that i wanted more than sitting at a lab bench all day, closeted away from society.  i wanted more interaction with world events, and my experiments weren't working.  i started doubting if i had the patience to be a scientist.  that's when i learned about the aaas science policy fellowship.  it's a fellowship that enables phd's to apply their knowledge in governmental agencies.but that didn't mean that i wanted to walk away now.  i sweat blood, tears, and time in this program, i was going to walk away with what i came for.  so with a swift kick in the butt by a good friend (he basically set up an appointment with a professor without telling me!)  i started my search for a new lab.when i found a position in a lab studying cancer biology with yeast genetics , i thought everything would be fine right?  wrong.  i still struggled to get out of bed everyday.  i had to start from scratch and was not motivated by the idea of finishing.  i know that sounds weird but when you are at the bottom of a well and the opening looks like a pinhole, it's easy to only see the darkness that surrounds you.i would take another year before i decided, "it's time to go".  that meant that what i was working on had to change because it wasn't going anywhere.  and so i re-examined all of our papers, came up with an idea, pitched it to my boss and got to work.  through much trial and error, i ended up with two projects that were paper-worthy, wrote and defended my thesis, and graduated!!!  what a wonderful feeling!  after my defense, when the same adviser who told me that i could leave said, "congratulations doctor!" , i knew that i was finally done.  i felt so free and euphoric.  it was the same feeling of euphoria that i had the day after barak obama won the election.  it was great!so here i am, in september of 2009.  i have to find a job!  i already made peace with not becoming a professor (it took a while to shake free of the brainwashing that started while in college).  but what next?  government!  i applied for government jobs, i started networking like crazy.  i wrote essay upon essay and . . .nothing.  at the same time, i happened to see that the consulting firm that i interviewed with a year before was hiring again and i knew one of the people who worked there.  after a referral and three interviews i was in!  i had a job in a really bad economy.i was definitely grateful.  this was literally my first professional job outside of school.  i had to make some major adjustments.  who would have thought that waking up early everyday would be so hard?  after 14 years of getting up whenever i wanted, it was a challenge.  i adapted, i worked to conform to this corporate jungle.  i lost sleep, i worked like crazy.  i let people talk to me like a child, etc. . . thinking back, i think that i let people get to me too much.  i didn't know how to play the game.  and when i had to go to the er to investigate stress-related chest pains, i knew that this life was not sustainable.and so here i am, working to figure it out so that i get it right this time.  i know that that sounds harsh but i really want to get it right.  i want a career that doesn't feel like one.  i am glad that i got my ph d, and worked in the corporate world.  i have a solid base of knowledge in the sciences and professional skills.  now i'm off to figure out how  to use what i've learned to figure out what to do next.i'm looking at the non-profit sector.  throughout my college and graduate careers, i've given back as a mentor, teacher, volunteer, and community leader.  these roles are part of who i am.  i think that i've been hesitant to embrace them because i don't want to be broke all the time. i know how that feels and i don't want to go back there.  but, i think that i'm going to have to take some kind of pay cut to do what i love.  so let's hope that it's temporary.the positions that i'm looking at right now fall into different areas:non-profit with maybe some science and some marketingtechnology transfernon-profit consulting analystnon-profit with or without sciencedevelopment officer / fundraiseralumni relations associateprogram managermostly scienceclinical genetics fellowpostdoc-ugh! maybe i need to be a bit more positive here and think about what type of postdoc that i want to becorporatish (when i don't have the luxury of being picky)medical affairsmarketing i'm also building my network and talking to people about career options that i may not know of.  any suggestions?well, time to get started with my search.  today, i'm working on updating my resume and writing a cover letter for a few positions that i found this weekend.  wish me luck!chi(:

quick update





hi  friends,i write to you on the day after my graduation!  i didn't realize how much had happened since my last post so let me update you:on july 9th: i submitted my thesis to my committee--that was the longest part of this whole process.  it took me about 1.5 months to complete this draft.  one thing that helped was that i had up to 25 people help copyedit the text for typos.  some were scientists and non-scientists, and they all helped me!  special shot out to brunsli!  thanks everyone.  i also used cashboard to keep track of time while i wrote each day.  it was really helpful and made me realize that 5-6 hours of writing(0nly)  is really a lot of work because that was a full day of work!  i have a new respect for lawyers who may log 7-8 hours a day!  they work hard!  my unrequested advice:  start early an just do it!on july 16th:  i successfully defended my thesis!  it was so weird because i'd been waiting for this day for so long and it just came and went so fast!  this and the next day, where one of the happiest days of my life!  i was so stressed and tensed up until my committee chair said those words, "congratulations doctor!" i felt so free, it was the best!on aug. 3:  i submitted my thesis to the library.  i made edits recommended by my committee, by the library and continued to get rid of typos!  i have to say that completing the thesis is the longest form of labor that you will ever go through.  i felt like i was having a baby for 2 months!  after their final review, i only had to change the page numbers on my "list of figures" page.  whew! after that, they ok'd me for graduation!and yesterday, friday, august 28th, 2009, i received my ph. d. in pathology and officially became dr. chi (:  my entire family came to celebrate (mom, dad, 2 brothers, 2 sisters, their husbands and children my boyfriend john and friends throughout my life).  i had a reception afterwards and just celebrated!  i have to thank god for trusting me and enabling me to pull this off.  i can't believe it but i am a dr.!  yaaaaayyyy!so i'm sure you're asking, "what now?"  well, the future is wide open.  while i'm interested in the study of epigenetics, i've come to realize that benchwork is not in my future.  so while i pursue postdocs in epigenetics, i'm also applying for fellowships in science communication and journalism as well as science policy.  we'll see, i'm back so now i can keep you up to date!cheers!dr. chi (:

thesis update:  slow progress





yesterday i worked on a portion of my thesis where i'm writing a review for my intro. i wanted to finish reading all the reviews for a particular topic but missed it by 7 pages!  luckily i've been taking notes along the way so i won't have to re-read.today's goals include:1. finishing that review2. then read and take notes on recent papers that weren't covered by older review articles.3. and organize my notes into a working paragraph for the article4.  if i have time, i will pull papers on the last topic of my introi'm thinking that i want to add another section but i just may revise what i have to include all of the data.  the type of review that i'm writing is a discussion of three different checkpoint adapter proteins.  since i've been reading so many reviews that have described each adaptor in detail i'm worried about out being redundant.  so i think that i will make this review relevant by comparing and contrasting studies and addressing remaining questions for the field.when i convert this review article into an intro thesis chapter, i'll have to add more paragraphs that will tie it into my other studies which means more writing for the intro! i need to go faster, time will just pass and if you aren't careful you'll be panicking like i am now!wish me luckchi(:

goodbye winter weight





hi all,just posting to let you know that i'm starting a new blog to track weight loss.  it's mostly for my own selfish purposes.  i want to use it to keep a food journal and and track my progress.  i'm using the weight watchers (ww) method because it worked when i used the program two years ago.there are some great blogs out there that really help me restart my ww program without having to pay again (trust me, once you learn it the first time, all you need is a refresher).  however, if you've never gone the program and are interested, i suggest you use it until you have the techniques mastered for yourself.  as i was saying, there are a lot of great blogs with ww tools: there's a daily points target calculator, a calculator for determining food points and a food points list, that are among the many tools that will help me along the way and i'll be listing them throughout my new blog.hopefully this will be a nice reminder that will help me get back on track when it comes to maintaining a healthy lifestye with sustainable eating habits.  you can check out my new blog here.cya!chi (:

ahhhh vacation. . .





happy memorial day everyone!it's been a while since my last post.  since my birthday i've received permission to write and defend my thesis, i've given a talk at a research conference and am two weeks behind my dissertation schedule.what has kept me sane?  to tell the truth, i've met someone who is really supportive, considerate and nice--especially to me!  and my relationship with him has taught me something--i'm a workaholic.  i live in a culture where you can do your science 24/7.  at my school, some faculty raise their eyebrows if you mention that you were doing something other than your work.  i think in general, you have to be careful of how you discuss your personal life because it then becomes the reason for why your experiments didn't work or why you haven't written your paper.  so unfortunately, i allowed this culture to ellicit guilt for not working--at any time!  to adapt, i would go to work for hours but not really work.  you know those internet escapes: email, facebook, the daily show with john stewart on hulu.  in the last few months i've been working on purging the guilt and putting some boundaries in my life.the last sentence was easy to write but has been very hard to do.  i try to do things like working on my dissertation for one hour at a time.  in the past i would go to the library all afternoon and do a 15 minute task in two hours.  i feel like, i have all this time--but i really don't.  i have a lot of time and even more tasks to do.  i've learned that being vigilant to when your mind wanders is key to knowing when to take a break.  i've also turned off all audio and visual alerts to my email.  email in academia is like crack, it's great to receive one and no one tells you when you can and can't read it!  so far so good but i'm still behind, why?it's because i don't feel that adrenaline-based motivation.  you know that feeling of excitement  you get when you know you have a deadline in 12 hours and haven't started.  in the past i've tried to start things early and felt at a loss for ideas.  but when that deadline looms, the ideas flow right?  wrong! i often end up thinking that if i took my time when writing application essays for fellowships, grants, abstracts. . .you name they would be more refined.  it also gives me less time to refine my writing. don't get me wrong, i've successfully completed tasks and  received funding.  but the more i think about my future, the more i just want peace in my life.  when i started grad school i knew that i wanted to be a faculty member at a tier 1 institution, running a lab and mentoring students.  today, when i grow up, i just want to be happy.   and that means living and appreciating every mundane minute as it comes instead of living for the next "event".   that means, its time to grow up and "trade-up" adrenaline-based drive for self-inspired motivation.lately i've been thinking of becoming a science journalist.  in reality, i'm really on the fence.  i love learning about science, but doing the science can be grueling.  i know that i have it in me to run a lab some day, but i'm really tired and need to revamp the way i live my life if i want to take on this time-intensive occupation.  on the other hand, i love mentoring and i love watching conclusive results come in after i've performed experiments that i've thought of on my own.  science journalism allows you to stay in touch with the hot science that works but it also appeals to my affinity for meeting new people and dwelling within the "real world".   i also feel like there's a voice inside me that can communicate science to the lay public, and i want to share it with others.  plus, writing research articles and my dissertation is boring!  no one told me that it would be this boring, ph.d.'s definitely do not receive enough credit for going through this mentally draining exercise.right now, i'm volunteering for opportunities to write for the public and am networking with other science writers.  i've also learned that blogging about my hair counts as writing!  well, at least i can create clips to use in internship applications.  i'm also reading "a field guide for science writers" and let me tell you, science journalism is no walk in the park!  it's very competitive and you have to treat it like running a small business--but being an entreprenuer has always been of interest to me.  what is great is that i can volunteer and gain writing experience to build my confidence as a writer, and at the same time be a post-doc and see if i like academic research as well.  the future is looking brighter and is filled with possibilities--now all i have to do is write that pesky dissertation. i have so say that i'm getting more and more paranoid about my grammar now that i'm thinking about writing as a career.  oh well, if i don't decide to be a science journalist at least my writing will get better!  anyway, i'll be blogging my dissertation progress as well as the daily events of life in chi-town, so stay tuned!  for now, check out this braid out!  did i forget to say that i love my sl's?  i truly do!
