the growing importance of cyber insurance for businesses in singapore







the growing importance of cyber insurance for businesses in singapore



nicole miles 

october 17, 2024




in today’s digital world, businesses in singapore rely heavily on technology to run their operations. from storing sensitive data to processing financial transactions, much of a company’s information is handled digitally. this reliance on technology comes with increased exposure to cyber risks, making cyber insurance essential for businesses.
rising cyber threats in singapore
cybercrime is a growing concern in singapore, with cyberattacks becoming more frequent and sophisticated. the cyber security agency of singapore (csa) reported that cybercrime accounted for nearly half of all crimes in the country in recent years. these attacks can be devastating for businesses, leading to financial losses, legal liabilities, and reputational damage.
smes are particularly vulnerable. without the resources to invest in extensive cybersecurity measures, they become prime targets for cybercriminals. the rise of remote work has further complicated matters, increasing the attack surface as employees access company systems from various locations.
given these rising threats, cyber insurance is no longer a luxury but a necessity for businesses of all sizes in singapore.
key coverage areas of cyber insurance
cyber insurance policies typically offer coverage for a range of risks, including:
data breach response: 
covers the costs of notifying affected individuals, offering credit monitoring services, and investigating the breach.
legal fees and settlements: 
provides coverage for legal expenses, settlements, and court judgments arising from a cyber incident.
business interruption: 
compensates for lost income if a cyberattack disrupts business operations.
ransomware attacks: 
helps cover ransom payments and data restoration costs after a ransomware attack.
reputation management: 
covers public relations costs to mitigate damage to a company’s reputation.
third-party liability: 
covers liabilities if a cyberattack on your business causes losses for others, such as customers or partners.
cyber insurance gives businesses the ability to recover more quickly from a cyber incident, minimizing financial damage and ensuring continuity.
why cyber insurance matters for singaporean businesses
financial protection: 
cyberattacks can result in significant financial losses, including lost revenue, legal fees, and potential fines. cyber insurance acts as a safety net, helping businesses recover without crippling their finances.
compliance with regulations: 
singapore’s personal data protection act (pdpa) imposes strict data protection requirements on businesses. failing to comply can result in hefty fines. cyber insurance can cover legal defense costs and penalties related to non-compliance, offering critical protection for businesses that handle sensitive data.
enhanced resilience: 
cyber insurance policies often come with access to cybersecurity experts and resources, helping businesses respond to incidents more effectively. this support can reduce the impact of an attack and speed up recovery.
maintaining customer trust:
a cyberattack that compromises customer data can severely damage a business’s reputation. cyber insurance helps businesses manage these incidents more effectively, demonstrating to customers that they are committed to protecting their data.
conclusion
in conclusion, as cybercrime becomes more prevalent, cyber security insurance is increasingly vital for businesses in singapore. it offers crucial financial protection, helps ensure compliance with data protection laws, and provides businesses with the resources they need to respond effectively to cyber incidents. investing in cyber insurance is a proactive step toward safeguarding the future of your business in an increasingly digital world.

tips on how to improve cyber security



nicole miles 

july 18, 2023




 
cyber security is a huge component, and since companies carry risks at different levels, their approach to cyber security varies. insurance companies appreciate that some businesses carry greater risks, so they don’t offer blanket cyber insurance.
businesses also have to take measures to make it harder for hackers to access the data. here are some tips on how to boost cyber security.

zero trust

zero trust is a concept that is based on two things.

never trust.
always verify.


for years, companies operated on trust. there was a general belief that everyone had the best interest of the business at heart. however, as cyber security became a threat, businesses realized it is no longer a question of who to trust. it was about protecting sensitive data.

zero trust helps address the elephant in the room, where is the sensitive data and how is the business protecting it?
cyber security addresses zero trust in four specific paths.

that only the right users can get into the system.
that they only have the right access.
that they only get to the right data.
that access to data is only for the right reason.


so, users are given different controls to access authorized data. this creates different layers in the system and a range of barriers. besides limiting access to information in the organization, the layers also create roadblocks should there be a cyber attack.

use cyber security monitoring tools

most businesses use the latest technology in their systems. clients can shop online and pay without coming into the store. they have systems that can keep track of sales and stock, so you know when to restock, and which items sell quickly. it’s amazing.
unfortunately, some businesses have failed to use the latest tools to monitor their systems. 

some of the tools and tests you can use to monitor the state of your cyber security include;

encryption tools.
vulnerability scanning tools.
penetration testing.
network intrusion detection.
firewall tools.
packet sniffers.


when you monitor your systems regularly, you will notice potential threats before hackers access your system.

threat management

cyber attackers do not just wake up one morning and compromise your system. sometimes, there are telltale signs that something is wrong. you will need to be proactive and find suspicious things going into your system.
for example, if phishing has been a problem, you need to educate the staff on the risks of opening links without verifying if they are authentic or not. you’ll need to find out if your company is a target and then fix the issue.

have an incident playbook

what happens when there is a cyber attack? many companies waste a lot of time (which they don’t have) panicking about a possible data breach. however, this only happens when you consider hacking an unexpected event.
when you approach an insurer and request cyber insurance protection, you need to know the steps you need to take before making a claim. cyber security insurance affects so many people, and you need to know how to act to mitigate the impact on your business, property, and clients.

your employees need to know the steps they should take as soon as they discover a problem with the system. should they call management first, or should the it department be notified first so that they can confirm the breach?
the worst time to come up with a mitigation plan is when everyone is pointing fingers at one another over who knowingly or unknowingly invited cyber attackers into the system.
an incident playbook will ensure everyone follows the same protocol when your business is targeted by cyber attackers. you can deal with the fallout later.

cyber attacks take different shapes, and they keep evolving. you may need to keep adjusting cyber management techniques, depending on how ambitious the attackers get. however, what you cannot do is sit back and hope your system doesn’t get on their radar.

as long as you have a website and carry out online transactions, you are at risk and it’s time to get protected.

how businesses become a target of cyber crime



nicole miles 

july 5, 2023




 

the cost of cyber crime has been on a rise, with the 2022 costs estimated to be 8.4 trillion us dollars. this is a direct reflection that cyber attacks are increasing, and businesses remain a target.

some businesses are more vulnerable to attacks than others. if you are a business owner, you need to know the weaknesses that malicious elements use to access data. here are some of the areas where businesses become targets of cyber attacks.

unsecured devices

startups have one thing in common, cash flow issues that force business owners to forego cyber security protection, at least for a little while until business picks up. unfortunately, the longer companies go without protecting their devices, the greater the exposure to cyber crimes.

businesses with unsecured devices invite cyber attacks in several ways.

when employees use their phones, tablets, laptops, home computers, and other personal devices to access the company’s systems. this may work if the company is looking to improve efficiency and cut costs, especially when the employees are away from their desks. unfortunately, there may be a bigger price to pay.
when company devices are used to surf the web without firewalls. employees sometimes feel the restrictions are a little over the top, but firewalls are critical barriers that keep cyber attackers away from the company’s systems.

when hackers gain access to the company’s systems through unsecured devices, it doesn’t matter how much data is breached. the costs may be too high, and it is not limited to financial losses only.

a small business will struggle to build a reputation if all it is known for is its vulnerability to cyber attacks.

valuable data

businesses attract the interest of cyber attackers when they have valuable data. small businesses are a haven of consumer data, including names, phone contacts, addresses, and financial details. this data helps hackers to use the details for identity theft and fraud.

untrained employees

one of the conditions many cyber insurance companies give businesses is training employees on how to avoid falling victim to cyber attacks. unfortunately, many new businesses overlook cyber crime during staff training.

this is how some employees easily get duped by tactics, such as phishing because they assume they are receiving legitimate emails. some use their free time to shop online using company devices, further exposing the business to cyber crime.
all these activities are normal in many smes, and cyber criminals know this. so, they target these companies because it is easier to infiltrate the company systems. 

limited it department

when you visit a large enterprise, you may be shocked at the number of people managing the it systems. the team in the it department is robust, constantly searching for weaknesses and monitoring data. it only takes one fault for hackers to penetrate the system.

small and medium-sized businesses sometimes don’t have the resources for a huge wage bill. so, to keep their costs low, the it department may be non-existent, or if it is present, it may only have one staff member.
this is problematic because this requires vigilance, and there is so much that one person can do to monitor all the company systems.

the use of legacy software

many small businesses rely on legacy software for internet security. it is affordable and, to some degree, it works. unfortunately, legacy software is outdated and hackers have devices ways to go around it to access data.
additionally, legacy software is tied to a specific operating system and it uses a specific coding language. for example, if you move from windows 10 to 11, some of the legacy software will not work on the new system.

legacy software also has:

few security measures.
regular updates, which create room for attacks.
no limits on the types of devices that access their network. you can use legacy software on unsecured devices.

most startups use legacy software because it offers some protection and it is cheap. unfortunately, companies may pay a higher price if there is a data breach.
fortunately, when requesting cyber insurance, your business will be guided on ways to prevent cyber attacks, and the measures to take, besides insurance to protect data and company property.

what you should know about reusable masks



nicole miles 

october 12, 2022




 


we all need to protect ourselves

the covid-19 pandemic brought attention to the benefits of using face masks. however, some people in east asia wore reusable face masks long before the pandemic. for some, it was a way to keep the cold away, while others wore masks to control the spread of flu in their homes. 

many singaporeans were not using reusable masks. in the first few months of the pandemic, only 24% of singapore residents wore masks. however, a survey carried out in april 2021 showed at least 90% of singaporeans wore masks. a large majority use a reusable mask singapore. 

advantages of using a cloth face mask

when debating between disposable and reusable masks, you need to look at the advantages of each. the singapore reusable mask is washable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective. you can also wear it fashionably by buying reusable face masks of different colours and styles. some people are more comfortable in cloth masks because they find the fabric breathable. 

how to wear and remove reusable face masks

masks are effective only when they are handled correctly. unfortunately, many reusable masks do not fit right around the nose and chin. some people get reusable masks that are too small because those fit snugly. however, this can be quite uncomfortable and will ultimately shorten the life of the mask since the fabric will be overstretched. 

today, some of the reusable masks come with adjusters to help ensure it fits perfectly. if you cannot get a reusable mask that is a perfect fit, then you can get an adjuster. 

when removing your reusable mask singapore, you need to ensure your hands are clean. if you handle your mask regularly, especially when you are away from the public and need a break from wearing a mask, wash your hands first. 

you may not be able to fully avoid coming into contact with microbes because they are everywhere. cleaning your hands will help ensure you keep the microbes off your mask and face. remove your face mask by holding the ear loops. 

you should then fold the mask with the outer part folded inwards. this will help keep the microbe on the outer part of the mask from the inner part of the mask.

storage of the reusable mask

if you intend to wear the mask again, put it in the pouch or zip lock bag. 

avoid handling your mask when still wearing it. this is why you need to ensure the singapore reusable mask fits well. when comfortable, you can wear the mask for longer, and you will not be tempted to keep touching the mask. 

how to wash a reusable face mask

it is best to wash the reusable mask in singapore daily. however, if this is not possible, store the used masks in a bag. after washing the masks:

keep them in a clean, sterile pouch.if possible, have more than three reusable masks, especially if you are out in public frequently.avoid using one mask for more than a day before washing because this exposes you to the viruses and bacteria you are avoiding. 

final notes

the singapore reusable mask is made from different types of fabric. cotton is often preferred because it is comfortable. however, some are made from blends to take advantage of the properties of the different types of fabric. choose one that you find most suitable. however, when you notice the fabric has worn out, avoid wearing the face mask since it will not provide you with the protection you need.

how to choose the faucets for kitchen and bathroom sinks



nicole miles 

december 22, 2021




 


consider these factors when buying a faucet

if buying a faucet was easy, you would walk into a store and pick any that catches your eye. unfortunately, it is so easy to buy the wrong faucet if you do not consider several things about your household and the suitability of the different types of faucets. 

as you choose the best faucet for your kitchen and bathroom sinks, you need to consider;who will be using the faucet?

the location of the faucets.
the type of sink
your budget.
your faucet can last years before you need to repair or replace it. unfortunately, if the faucet is unsuitable, you may find yourself shopping for a replacement sooner than you expect. 

who is using the faucet?

do you have children? do you have the elderly in your home? what about someone with special needs? as you analyze the different faucets, ask if any of the family members will have difficulty operating them.

if your child, parents, or any other family member will find it challenging to work with the faucet, even if it is your first choice, you need to consider an alternative. usability and safety should be your priority.

for example, if your child is yet to develop his motor skills fully, you need to choose a tap that he can easily use without your help. if a family member has poor eyesight, you may need to get a faucet with handles that can help them differentiate the hot water lever from the cold water.

alternatively, you can go for touchless faucets since the temperature and pressure are already set. you also won’t need to worry about hygiene. 

the location of the faucets.

the location of the faucet will determine how tall or short the spout will be. if it is a kitchen sink, do you have a cabinet above the sink that will interfere with a long spout? do you want a faucet that makes it easier for you to clean and fill pots away from the sink? if so, a pull-out faucet is most suitable for your kitchen.

if the faucet is for your bathroom, consider how well the faucet will fit in with the rest of your bathroom fixtures, the faucet is supposed to complement the lighting, mirror, and other accessories. 

the type of sink


the sink is probably one of the things that will greatly influence your choice of faucets. kitchen and bathroom sinks are available in different shapes and sizes.  

a faucet with a long spout is unsuitable for a shallow and small sink because the water will splash beyond the sink. a small faucet is unsuitable for a large sink. not only is it not proportionate to the size of the sink, but the water can easily flow out because of the lack of balance. 

your budget

faucets are available at a range of prices. some of the traditional faucets tend to be cheaper than the more recent innovations. when budgeting for a faucet and other accessories, you need to consider other additional costs, such as installation.

some of these taps are easy to install without the help of a professional. however, some are more technical. if you cannot afford to pay someone to handle the installation, it may be best to get an easy-to-install faucet. 

these are some of the main considerations you need to have when choosing a faucet for your kitchen and bathroom faucets. once you get the best faucet, you can now choose the best finishing, which your home decor will influence.

why a local custom embroidery company is the best choice



nicole miles 

december 2, 2021




 

all about embroidery printing
when searching for the best supplier for custom embroidery printing in singapore for your company’s promotional items, you will undoubtedly request quotations from multiple companies. your choice will undoubtedly be influenced by the company’s expertise and the affordability of the printing services. sometimes, a company based out of the country may appear better suited, but there are reasons why you should go for an embroidery printing company in singapore. 
it is easy to monitor the progress.
if you cannot afford any delays, then you need to ensure your custom embroidered items are delivered in time. unfortunately, it is difficult to monitor a company that is providing the service from afar. you can easily go to a local company to ascertain that the embroidering printing is taking place and that delivery will be done within the expected period. 
face-to-face meetings are important for complex projects.
coming up with a design for custom printing can be complicated, considering the dos and don’ts. companies in singapore that offer embroidery printing services also offer advice on designs. for example, complex designs are hard to interpret when embroidered. 
however, how can you tell if a design is simple enough, too simple, or complex? having professionals at hand to guide you will come in handy. 
additionally, a face-to-face meeting allows you to raise your concerns easily. open communication will ensure you get a good design that will look awesome in custom embroidery print.  
avoid shipping delays
once a company based out of the country ships the custom embroidered products, they have no control over what happens between then and the moment you receive the products. shipping delays are common, and there are various reasons for this. 
unfortunately, if you have prepared to launch a product on a specific date and need the promotional items, any delays will affect your plans. a local company will be more reliable. in cases when you have bulk orders, you may even start receiving partial deliveries as you prepare. at least you will be confident that you have promotional items to give out. 
request samples before mass production
an embroidery printing company in singapore may be willing to physically deliver a sample of your order so that you can give the go-ahead for mass printing. you may miss this stage should you choose to place your custom embroidery printing order with a company that is based abroad. 
online samples can be deceptive. for example, the colour may not be the true representation of the finished product. unfortunately, when you give the go-ahead after seeing the online sample, there is no going back. you may be stuck with an embroidery print you don’t like. 
it is easier to get accountability.
even after approving an embroidery print sample, several things could go wrong. the stitches may be altered, the wrong thread used, or the company may delay the delivery. it will be easier to put a local company to task for any eventualities regarding your order of custom embroidered products. 
conclusion
there are many advantages to using local companies offering embroidery services. not only is this beneficial to your business, but the local economy as well. ultimately, local embroidery printing companies pay taxes and support the greater economy because you supported them.

how to get the best style from your custom cargo pants



nicole miles 

october 20, 2021




 

cargo pants trivia

did you know that cargo pants were first developed in 1938 by and for the british armed forces? since then, the pants have been adopted by members of various professions, including paratroopers and actors. cargo pants are considered practical, and due to their baggy nature, they are ideal when one is interested in a casual look. 
however, recent productions of cargo pants offer flexible, customizable options to make the pants an everyday option for official and casual wear. if you love custom made cargo pants, you can work on various parts to make them fit right. 

slim the sides 

skinny custom cargo pants are not ideal. however, you better err on the slim side than having too much excess fabric. for best results, aim for at least an inch of excess fabric at the hips to allow you some space to move easily. in essence, your custom made cargo pants can be as loose or as tight as your chino pants. 

taper the pants from the hips to the ankles

the era of huge cargo pants is gone. like the chinos and jeans, custom cargo pants that are slimmer at the ankles are more appealing. you can custom-make your cargo pants to reveal the shape of your legs by tapering the cargo pants from the hips downwards. 
this makes your cargo pants stylish and gives you greater flexibility on what you choose to wear with the pants. for example, you can achieve a casual, formal look by pairing your cargo pants with a shirt and a blazer when it has a slim fit. 

let your footwear influence the length of the pants.

before customising your cargo pants, it would be best to have an idea of the shoes you would wear. your shoes will enhance the appeal of the custom cargo pants. so before deciding the length of the pants, consider how well they will look with different footwear. 

for example, if you wish to pair your custom made cargo pants with boots, you don’t want the pants to be too long because they will cover your boots. since tucking in the pants is out of the question, you can adjust the length to sit at the same length as the boots. 
if you opt for drawstrings at the hem and wish to pair the pants with heels, you can choose to have your pants be any length you wish, between the knees and ankles. 

determine a reasonable number of pockets

one of the defining features of the cargo pants is the pockets. the extra pockets on each leg are plenty enough. you don’t need to consider adding more pockets. however, to avoid looking ridiculous with bulging pockets, especially if you have opted for slimmer custom cargo pants, you should avoid overloading the pockets. 
conclusion
you can explore various styles to make your custom made cargo utility pants as unique as you wish. you may choose to alter the waist and any other part to suit your style. however, before undertaking any alterations, it is best to have an idea of the style you find most suitable.

the hbd flats in singapore provide affordable housing and are favoured by millions of singaporeans interested in the benefits offered by this housing project. unfortunately, the average size of the bathroom in some of the public housing facilities are less than 3sqm. 

although this seems too small to accessorize attractively, bathrooms of any size can be made to be more aesthetic. there are bathroom accessories for spaces of different sizes, so even though a larger bathroom may seem elegant, a small bathroom can be equally appealing without being overcrowded.

in the following article, trine bretteville discusses ways to enhance your small bathroom, while leaving it clutter-free.

affordable accessories to use in small bathrooms
“bathroom layouts can be challenging, but a small bathroom can be particularly challenging. if your bathroom is short on space and you need some small bathroom ideas to make it work, then you have come to the right place.
every day here at roomsketcher, we see hundreds of bathroom designs, floor plans and remodeling projects, from all around the globe. we work with customers just like you to help you create floor plans and to visualize your design ideas in 3d. one of the projects that we see people struggle with the most is small bathrooms.” read more here

undoubtedly, it is much easier to get accessories for a big bathroom because you can use several items that complement one another. smaller bathrooms are a little more complicated because you don’t want to use too many accessories. sometimes three fixtures may even be too much. the trick with small bathrooms is to go with the minimalist approach, and at the same time, use accessories that give the perception that the room is larger than it is. for example, you can use wall mirrors to reflect more lighting, wall-mounted toilets to create more space, and opt for a shower instead of the bathtub.

the author of the following article in home-designing.com discusses some of the ways you can accessorize a bathroom if you are looking for a modern style.  

bathroom accessories for a modern bathroom design
“we all spend a lot of time in our bathrooms, so it’s only right that we should make them into a simply gorgeous place to be. unique bathtubs, sleek vanity units and modern toilet designs come in all shapes and sizes, to suit spaces and budgets both large and small. aside from the essential facilities, bathrooms can be accessorised with chic dispensers and storage. lighting is an integral piece of the puzzle when designing a bathroom retreat too, as light can entirely change the mood of a space.” read more here

the amount of natural light coming through your bathroom is critical for your bathroom’s aesthetic appeal in modern bathrooms. wide windows and wall mirrors are commonly used in the design of modern bathrooms. a glass medicine cabinet placed on the wall, whether vertically or horizontally, is a great addition. if possible, including a sliding door to the outdoors to increase ventilation and to introduce the concept of nature into the design. if you love greenery, you can create a garden in the bathroom, by having potted plants or if you have space, create a green area in your bathroom.

in the following article, evans gives a list of at least 10 places where you can buy bathroom fixtures in singapore.

places to buy bathroom accessories in singapore

nicole miles 

november 7, 2020




 
the kitchen faucet is an essential purchase since it is the outlet through which you access water for cleaning, drinking, and cooking. your daily hygiene, especially when working in the kitchen, relies on the water flowing from the kitchen faucet. modern faucets have evolved greatly from the traditional taps. they now come in various designs and styles to fit your kitchen design. they are also more user friendly, so you get to choose the one you feel works best for you. browse some well-known and classic kitchen faucet styles here: https://www.kohler.com.sg/browse/kitchen/categories/kitchen-faucets

the writer of the following article in aurastone.com.sg looks at the various types of faucets in the market.

types of kitchen faucets
 
“the tap is the gateway to the liquid of life, i.e. water. from cleaning, cooking and drinking, we turn on the tap for our daily hygiene and refreshment activities. yet, it is also one of the most overlooked and taken for granted feature of the sink. what good is a sink without a kitchen faucet and tap?
remember the traditional taps that require some energy to turn them on and off? well, today’s modern taps have evolved to become sleeker and more user-friendly. these days, you just need to flick the lever to adjust the water flow and temperature.” read more here

the kitchen faucet is today both functional and aesthetic. the type of tap you choose will either enhance your kitchen’s appeal or look out of place because it is the wrong type. the faucet you buy should allow you to sufficiently control water flow, and possibly water temperature. some of the kitchen faucets you are likely to find when shopping for one include the single handle, dual handle, pull down, pull out, and motion detector faucets. these are not only different in design, but in price as well. so, other than looking at the style most suitable for your kitchen, you need to pick one that fits your budget.      

in the following article, the writer discusses some of the things you need to have in mind when buying a kitchen faucet.

key features to consider when buying a kitchen faucet
“faucets come in all shapes and sizes. here are a few things to consider when finding the faucet that’s right for you.
style
avoid a tiny faucet on a big, bold sink, and vice-versa. also make sure that the style, such as contemporary or classic, matches that of the sink. look for a faucet that directs water into the center of the bowl. for a large sink consider a tall gooseneck or one with a pull-out spray. if the faucet’s too short it may not reach far enough. make sure your new faucet matches the correct hole drillings in your sink, 4″ centers, 8″ centers, or single hole.” read more here

the kitchen faucet you choose should be practical. you need to look at your kitchen’s layout and appliances to determine if the faucet you want will be the right fit for the kitchen. other than looking at the faucet size against the kitchen sink, you need to look at the type of handles, kind of mounting, and the technology used. some of the kitchen faucets in the market are also dripless and can last years without resulting in water loss. some water taps are also great at conserving water, so in the long run, such faucets help you to keep your water bills low.

the following article by lwk kitchens in houzz.com.sg discusses some of the overlooked features of kitchen faucets but are critical when buying one.

why the type of metal matters when choosing a kitchen faucet
“the tap plays a key role in every kitchen. with each household member using it for different purposes throughout the course of an average day, you want one that not only looks great, but is high-quality, long-lasting and can suitably meet all of your different needs. with designs available in all shapes, colours and sizes, read on to check out some of the different options ‘on tap’, plus other points to consider when making your decision.” read more here
 when shopping for a kitchen tap in singapore, you’ll discover taps made from different metals. 

sometimes, your kitchen décor will influence the faucet metal you choose. for example, a stainless-steel faucet will look out of place in a kitchen with a rustic finish. instead, a brass, copper or bronze faucet might be more befitting. silver taps have a softer appeal compared to stainless steel and are the perfect faucet for a kitchen that is both modern and traditional. 

additionally, it is easier to keep brushed stainless steel taps cleaner than shiny taps.
there is a lot you need to consider when choosing a kitchen faucet. before you go out to look for a kitchen faucet, you need to have a list of features for the ideal tap. this will make the selection process easier because you will be overwhelmed by the different types and designs of taps you’ll find in the market.

the writer of the following article in qanvavast.com appreciates that you cannot look at the kitchen faucet without looking at the sink. you need to pay close attention to the type of sink you buy, almost as much as you do the kitchen faucet. 

advantages and disadvantages of various kitchen sinks

the process of selecting a kitchen tap and sink is more involving than simply choosing what you like. it is best for you to analyze the pros and cons of the various kitchen faucets and sinks to determine which one is ideal. if you are not buying the sink and faucet combos, you need to make sure than the faucet you choose looks great with the sink before buying it.

nicole miles 

april 21, 2020




do you have problem in carrying out normal routine tasks? are you planning to go for knee replacement surgery and in a fix whether to go for it or not? here is the answer, the article will help you in making up your mind. knee replacement surgery is not an easy decision for a person. it involves finances as well as intense pain. however, one-time pain of the surgery is better to have painless life ahead.
currently, there are two types of knee replacement surgery procedures being operated in singapore, both depend upon the kind of lifestyle one have has and would like to keep in future. more information can be found at providence’s knee surgery page here. 
total knee replacement
this process involves the replacement of the complete knee joint, also the ligament of the knee. this type is considered to be most effective and people undergoing are expected to have long life ahead. the success rate of this type is also pretty high and patient after surgery also feel less to no pain in their knees. when patients are asked, they feel better after surgery, however have to undergo longer time for recovery and coming back to routine life. however, many say they never feel having natural knee since touch of artificial knee remains there.
partial knee replacement
as the name indicates, the partial knee replacement only replaces some portion or part of the knee which is mainly damaged and causing pain. it is similar to a dentist when he cares for the aching tooth by repairing only a part or patch. doctors tend to reserve the patients who wish to go for partial knee replacement procedures without going for maximum damage to the knee. during the procedure, surgeons only require incision in some portion which is damaged and avoid doing major surgery to the entire knee. there are some benefits of undergoing partial knee replacement, which are:
the recovery time is less, which means faster recovery. it causes less pain. the level of complication after surgery is less in case of partial knee replacement when compared with complete knee replacement.
patients who undergo partial knee replacement feel their knees in normal position even after replacement. it is due to the ligaments, both at posterior and anterior positions which provides support and stabilize the knee in their position. the only disadvantage with partial knee replacement is that it may not last for long, whereas durability of knee replacement is more in case of total knee replacement. knee continue to regenerate in case of partial, thus it can cause pain again in the knee after some time of the surgery.
whether to go for total knee replacement or partial knee replacement, surgeon decides depending upon the situation of the knee, its condition, and how much pain one can bear. also it is also dependent upon the condition of the knee whether patient can prolong it with partial knee replacement or is needing complete replacement. so, to adopt either one of these, it is better to consult orthopedic surgeon.

arthritis of the knees – rheumatoid and osteoarthritis



nicole miles 

january 8, 2020




rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis affect different joints of the body, including the knees. when coming up with a diagnosis, doctors look at the characteristics of the symptoms to determine if the patient has rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. the doctor will want to know your age when you first noticed the signs, how fast the symptoms develop, the notable changes on the joint, how long the morning stiffness lasts, and other systemic symptoms on the rest of the body.  knee arthritis treatments are available and should be used where needed. 

in the following article, the writer explores the different types of arthritis, with emphasis on rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. 
comparing
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis 
arthritis
is inflammation of one or more of your joints. pain, swelling, and stiffness
are the primary symptoms of arthritis. any joint in the body may be affected by
the disease, but it is particularly common in the knee.
knee
arthritis can make it hard to do many everyday activities, such as walking or
climbing stairs. it is a major cause of lost work time and a serious disability
for many people. the
most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but
there are more than 100 different forms. while arthritis is mainly an adult
disease, some forms affect children. read more here 
the
differences between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are so distinct,
that it is quite easy to tell them apart. for example, rheumatoid arthritis can
manifest itself at any time, while osteoarthritis begins later in life. if you
have rheumatoid arthritis, the degeneration of your joint is rapid, so you’ll
notice symptoms evolve pretty fast, while osteoarthritis develops slowly. if
the morning joint stiffness lasts for a short while in the morning, usually
less than an hour, and returns later in the evening, you most likely have
osteoarthritis. 

in the following article, the writer discusses osteoarthritis, its impact on the knees, and the treatment. 
the
impact of osteoarthritis on your knees 
osteoarthritis (os-tee-o-arth-ri-tus) is the most common form
of arthritis,
and the knee is one of the most commonly affected joints. everyone’s joints go
through a normal cycle of damage and repair during their lifetime, but
sometimes the body’s process to repair our joints can cause changes in their
shape or structure. when these changes happen in one or more of your joints,
it’s known as osteoarthritis. read more here
the
knee has the largest, and possibly the most important joint in the body. it
facilitates your movements, and ease with which you can sit and stand. osteoarthritis
can affect one or both knees. pain in the knee is one of the symptoms, and it
is usually excruciating at the end of the day, or when you move your knee. you
may also struggle to take the first steps in the morning due to the stiffness
around your knee. this, however, doesn’t last longer than an hour. you will
also discover that you cannot comfortably move as fast as you once did, or adequately
stretch your legs. 

in the following article, the writer discusses the treatment options for knee arthritis. 
the
treatment of osteoarthritis of the knees
when it comes to treating osteoarthritis (oa) in your
knees and hips, you may have more options than you realize. in march 2014,
the osteoarthritis research society international (oarsi), a nonprofit
organization dedicated to promoting osteoarthritis research and treatment,
updated its recommendations for the treatment of osteoarthritis targeted to
different patient characteristics. a group of 13 experts from around the world
reviewed the latest research on oa treatments as the framework for the
revised guidelines. oarsi published its first guidelines in 2008. read more here
to
effectively manage arthritis, you need to combine drug treatments with
alternative treatments to help improve the effectiveness of the drugs. exercising,
weight management, acupuncture, balneotherapy, and the use of canes and
crutches will help to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis. depending on the
severity, your doctor may recommend various medications, including
anti-inflammation drugs and topical creams. in some cases, especially in older
patients, joint replacement may become necessary.

rba history



nicole miles 

december 7, 2018



the royal society of british artists was established in 1823 by a small group of artists who wished to break away from the royal academy. one of their main concerns was to establish an alternative exhibition venue to the academy and these efforts were rewarded when enough money was raised to commission john nash to design and build the society’s first gallery in suffolk street.


further confirmation of the important position that the society held in 19th century britain was the granting of the royal charter by queen victoria in august 1887.
since its foundation, the society has had some 36 presidents, including distinguished names such as james mcneili whistler, walter sickert and more recently peter greenham ra. the society’s current president is cav. romeo di girolamo. for a list of past presidents
the society has developed a strong commitment to issues of education and in september 1995 supported the foundation of a new fine art course which is based around figurative art, run by northbrook college in worthing. the unique course which culminates in the awarding of a ba. (hons) in fine art, is enriched by visiting rba members.
