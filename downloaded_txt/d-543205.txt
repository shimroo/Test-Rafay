the dynamoney asset product is valuable to our broker network. not only do they cover the traditional vehicle/yellow goods or office equipment purchase, but they also specialise in solar and medical equipment finance. the team at dynamoney understand the struggles that some businesses face with the constantly evolving lending requirements of traditional financiers.
