dreams


dreams are like a letter from our higher self to your conscious mind. they awaken us to higher  resources of knowledge within ourselves.













 




find your purpose


fulfilling your true potential means that you need to awaken the gifts, talents and insights that are inside of you.














 




meditation


the easiest way to move through life with understanding and insight is by meditating daily.


















 




death


life in our body is like school. once we have learned our lessons we are free to go home.














 




be your own guru


everyone must find their own way. betty gives tangible tools to help us help ourselves.













 




inner journey


love is truly the way to change any situation. the inner journey changes you and the world.

















					prosperity					

 






 success is a pattern of thinking and can become a conditioned process within us just like any other habit. allowing positive thought patterns to flow through your mind can create a sense of wealth, abundance, harmony and completeness – and your outer reality – will be transformed accordingly.

					spiritual awakening					

 






when we fail to experience god and religion as love (in its best sense), we are subject to experience a loveless world with all sorts of pains that go along with that perceived perception. we create god in terms of our own fears and insecurities, instead of allowing ourselves to be recreated in the vision or idea of love. learn from betty how to experience god as love.

					trances from betty					

 






betty was a channel. her channel provided guidance messages through betty via her trances. we have transcribed trances and also have recorded audio of her trances. each one is amazing with invaluable information and insights into the human condition.

					relationships					

 







to grow in intimacy you have to first value yourself as a partner before you can express intimacy with someone else. sharing intimacy is your ability to let another person “in” to fully know and appreciate all aspects of yourself; not just the pretty, together looking parts of yourself but also the weak, fearful and, yes, the ignorant aspects of yourself.

        what fans say    
 



i have spent more money than i care to recall on therapy and self-help books – that didn’t help. i can’t tell you how exquisitely and how painlessly significant the dream book has become to me! it is the best source of wisdom and guidance i have ever known. the book is especially adept at giving children an extremely efficient tool for dealing with their nightmares too! ask anyone who knows me – they will tell you how profoundly this book has changed my life for the better!

betty bethards' book about death has always helped and comforted me when friends or family members died. "there is no death" makes sense to me because betty had a near death experience and was given messages from those who "died." i attended many of betty's monthly lectures over the years and she generously gave me, and others, insight about life and death. betty was a wonderful person and i am deeply grateful for her lessons on meditation and personal growth, which she freely shared. what an inspiring teacher!

i am not much of a reader but there is no death book i couldn’t put down. most incredible awakening is that i am no longer afraid of dying. so many details of what she has experienced. i strongly recommend.

my wife and i went to betty’s lectures and conferences for many years in many locations. betty’s teachings were my first exposure to spiritual learning. i never found a religion that worked for me, so it was wonderful to find that i could learn about spirituality without the religious part. betty just had a way of teaching spirituality that was simple, fun, and easy to understand and relate to.

i greatly appreciate the book, there is no death, and having it give me a different outlook on something that is not talked about or looked at so negatively. great read. as i read on, all these people i love and care about came to mind and thought they also needed to read it so i gave it to them as gifts.

i knew betty bethards. her book is the most accurate dream reference i know of. i had a much older copy that ended up getting worn out and in terrible shape because i used it so much. betty is authentic. i recommend her dream book highly.

we have almost all of betty's books and recorded lectures which are as relevant today. the three of the main tools that betty taught were meditation, affirmations, and dream work and i still use them to this day. betty was a treasure, and the knowledge she shared with us is very powerful. i cannot imagine what my life would be like now had i not worked with betty. betty is no longer with us, but most of her teachings are. take advantage of them!

i have studied to be a medium for a long time having discovered my gifts through your teachings. it scared me at first but i trusted and kept going. i don’t charge people for readings; i believe i’m paying it forward. your teachings, betty, have changed my life. thank you for what you have taught and for all you have brought to the world.  oh and btw, i have been referencing your dream book since the mid-80s and have bought over 40 copies to give to friends and family.

i have literally had the first edition of the dream book since 1984 and have loved it since opening it. i have consulted it hundreds of times over the years not only for myself but for my friends too. when i saw that there was a new edition of it, i promptly ordered it. there are many new symbols in this new edition, which is fabulous! it’s easy to read and a very helpful tool for interpreting dreams. you won’t be disappointed with this amazing book.
