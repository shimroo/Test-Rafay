welcome to our lab!
how do children learn from others? what enables humans to make inferences about other peopleâs mental states? and how does this ability develop over time?at the social learning lab, we study these very questions by investigating how children learn about the world through social interactions. to do our work, our lab uses diverse methods (e.g., behavioral experiments, fmri) with human subjects of all ages.
