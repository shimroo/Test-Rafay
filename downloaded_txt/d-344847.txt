reliable and responsive...

pcf property management has been a reliable and responsive property manager for our two rental properties for over a year.  they have consistently communicated with us on all matters related to our properties, and they have gone above and beyond to meet our needs, for example, when we had a tenant turnover recently, pcf was able to quickly and efficiently complete a variety of repairs and renovations, including painting, flooring, plumbing, and a new deck installation.  this allowed us to move in new tenants within two weeks of the old tenants moving out.  pcf also fairs pricing and an easy to use portal system for tracking expenses and income.  we are particularly grateful to bob talbot who always been available to answer our questions and make sure that our needs are met in a timely fashion.  overall, we are very happy with pcf and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and responsive property manager.

reliable and responsive...

i have been a tenant at one of their rental properties for about a year now.  the’ve done a really good job with everything so far.  their maintenance department has a good response time and handles issues well.  and their website makes bill paying very easy. a much better situation than all the previous property management companies i’ve had to deal with.  just got our lease renewal letter (it was originally only a one year lease) and no significant price hike.  i plan to stay in my current rental for at least a few years, and i hope that the next place that i move into is managed by pcf..

frequently asked questions

we are always here to answer any questions you have.  below are a few common inquiries we receive from prospective clients.  if you need additional information or have any other questions, please don’t hesitate to call.






what are your management fees?










property management fees may vary depending on the type of property, location, number of units, condition, and occupancy status. we will be happy to review your property and provide a proposal that will outline all services and fees associated with the management of your property. the management fee percentage is based on gross receipts collected each month. therefore, our fee is aligned with the collection of rent.






what areas do you serve?










at pcf management inc., we proudly offer residential property management services throughout central maryland, catering to clients in various counties including:

howard county
anne arundel county
carroll county

conveniently located in historic ellicott city on main street, our home office serves as the hub for our operations, allowing us to efficiently manage properties across the region. whether you're a property owner or a tenant, you can count on us to provide exceptional service and support every step of the way.






what kind of properties do you manage?










our focus is on residential single family, townhomes, and condominiums. we are selective in the properties we manage and want to make sure we are a good fit for the client based on the client’s goals and objectives. the homes we manage must be in compliance with the local and state laws.






how do you handle evictions?










our eviction process, procedures, fees, and time frames are all based on maryland statutes and landlord/tenant laws. per our lease, rent is due the 1st and late after the 5th of the month. you can find a detailed summary of maryland eviction law here: https://ipropertymanagement.com/laws/maryland-eviction-process 
pcf partners with a law firm to make sure that all judgements and convictions are handled in a timely and legal way. judgment and eviction costs are expensed and back charged to the tenant.






how do you handle hoa/condo association violations?










we take proactive steps to handle any hoa violations that may arise, working directly with your tenant to address issues within their control. additionally, we manage the distribution of parking and pool passes as outlined in your lease agreement.
if your property receives a violation that necessitates your involvement, our maintenance department will promptly notify you. please note that while we facilitate communication and resolution, pcf does not pay your hoa dues. owners are responsible for setting up recurring payments directly with their hoa/condo association.

pcf initiates owner disbursements on the 6th of each month, once your tenant's payment has been settled and cleared by the bank. your disbursement will be securely transferred to your designated bank account via direct deposit.

pcf will obtain owner approval on all repairs and maintenance issues. if there is an emergency we will respond immediately 24/7 and provide an update once resolved.






reporting for six month inspections?










at pcf, we conduct regular six-month inspections of your property to verify that your tenant is maintaining the premises according to the lease agreement. following each inspection, you will receive an email containing a comprehensive report with attached photos, as well as any pertinent notes we deem necessary to communicate. should any maintenance issues be identified during the inspection, you will promptly receive a meld request outlining the specific issue for your attention and approval.
