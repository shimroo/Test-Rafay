due to an issue with our debit card transaction processor, all debit card posting files are delayed. debit cards will continue to process normally, there is simply a delay in the transactions posting to your account. once these files are received by our institution, we will process them immediately. thank you for your understanding and patience.

welcome to marshall county federal credit union
marshall county federal credit union began as “marshall county school employees credit union”. in 1974 eight members started this credit union off on its financial journey by depositing $5 each into a share account. today, the credit union’s assets have grown to almost $25 million and its membership is in excess of 2500. in the mid ’80’s small employer group expansion led to our name change and set the tone for our future growth in the addition of marshall county government entities and small business.
