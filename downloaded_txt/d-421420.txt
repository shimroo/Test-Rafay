discover inspiring vintage art photos
we started selling vintage photos in 1997.  from the start we have used the internet as a primary platform for displaying the collection.  we were one of the first european online photo dealers to do so.  
today, after almost 15 years anamorfose has one of the largest online vintage photo collections.  there are about 4.000 photos online divided in 84 online photo exhibitions by about 64 photographers.  we maintain an inventory of about 10.000 photos in our archive that spans more than 50 years photo history in a full range of styles and subjects. 
the vintage photos are available for guidance in establishing or developing a photo collection as well as buying or selling.
