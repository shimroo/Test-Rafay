doll making tips
when it comes to doll making, we've been there, done that, now serving 164 tips in 16 categories ranging from all links to wigs.











old slip
you can use old slip, but it will take some work you will have to thin the slip with slip thinner, and get a creamy slip. the only problem is once the slip is thinned it has to be poured all in one day as you cannot go back and work the slip another day.

											when is the best time to pour your mold?
									 	

when you pour is important
using seeley`s extended range french bisque you can pour late at night, empty the mold and let it sit over night. in the morning the piece is ready to come out of the mold and ready to clean when you are your freshest.

											is there a tip on cutting out material?
									 	

read first
mark your pattern piece with a note or star or the word stop to alert you to read directions first. maybe you have to sew on the line, not cut.

											how can i be sure to cut velvet true to pattern?
									 	

working with difficullt fiber
when working with slippery material, use clear tape to tape the pattern and material together. this works well on slippery material.

											how can i repare greenware?
									 	

using tibs
using tisha's incredible brushes (tibs) has more than one benefit. because the greenware has not been soft fired, if i break the eye opening, i can repair it like new again. using a wet brush, put any large piece back in place. add drops of slip and allow to dry to a leather hard stage. use a feather knife or other sharp object and reshape. build up until it matches the thickness of the greenware. it may take a few tries, but if you have to throw away the piece you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain.
