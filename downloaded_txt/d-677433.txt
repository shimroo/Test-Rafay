striped bass and bluefish
saltwater sportfishing off the northeast coast of massachusetts. 
summer job fishing charters offers private charters, charter fishing (sportfishing) for striped bass (striper's), bluefish and mackerel in the northeast, including the merrimack river and plum island in newburyport, massachusetts.
 

a little weather was not going to stop kyley!

 
  
it's time to book your 2025 fishing charter.
 usually i catch the first schoolies around the first week of may. last year we had a nasty cold snap that slowed the season by 2 weeks. the first "keepers" should be here by the end of the 1st week of june.
 
i know that some of you are as obsessed with fishing as i am because my phone is ringing. also i see that you guys are doing what i am doing, trolling the fishing web sites & facebook pages for any new info on our beloved striped bass! if you are planning a charter, please consider  a fishing trip on summer job. give me a call or send an email and we will set you up for a great day on the water.
check out our fish photos pages! 
 
i have the new for hire decal, now i need a mackerel for the new photo!
