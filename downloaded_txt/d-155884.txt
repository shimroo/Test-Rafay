the center for gifted education is a research and development center providing services to educators, policy makers, graduate students, researchers, and parents in support of the needs of gifted and talented individuals.
located in williamsburg, virginia, the center has established an international reputation for excellence in research, curriculum development, and service. several major grants, including funding from the jacob k. javits gifted and talented students education act, have provided significant support for the work of the center. in 2012, the jack kent cooke foundation awarded the center the funds needed for a summer residential camp for low-income, high-ability children for four consecutive years. in 2015, william & mary alumni, mike and nancy petters, through the petters family foundation, provided additional financial support to the program. in 2016, the petters family foundation has committed to fully fund the program for the next four years. camp launch is only the beginning of the center for gifted education’s goal to bring educational equality to all gifted students.
