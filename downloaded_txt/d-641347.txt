to simplify navigation in this blog,  jump to metastatic melanoma blog posts, which will display my most recent cancer-related updates.
i was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in december 2013.  this is a serious disease, but one that is treatable. my intention is to explore all reasonable methods of treatment and to combine as many of these as is practicable.
i received in-patient medical treatment at providence cancer center, in portland, oregon. in addition, i am following naturopathic guidance for diet and supplements.
i joined a writers group for men with cancer, sponsored by oregon health sciences university. eddy and i participated in a oregon health and science sponsored classes on mindfulness based stress reduction, based on the work of jon kabat-zinn and taught by kimberly carson.
