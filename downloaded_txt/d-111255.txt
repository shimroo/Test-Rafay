it 
                      is important to note 
                      that beginning in 313 
                      a.d., christian teachings and practices began to dramatically 
                      change. prior to 313 a.d. the christian attitudes and practices 
                      listed above were standards advocated by most christians 
                      within their own christian communities. christians 
                      did not attempt to force those attitudes or practices on 
                      non-christians. christians did feel free to include them 
                      as part of the gospel, the good news, they preached to non-christians 
                      -- not as a judgmental rebuke but as joyful witness to the 
                      freedom of their own life in christ.
