a catholic church in the heart of oconomowoc
st. jerome is where generations gather to connect, grow, and serve.
																				you matter to us. you matter to god.

																				jesus said, “i came that they may have life, and life abundantly” (john 10:10).
																				that’s why we want st. jerome to be a place where your family and friends
																				long to be―where they will find rest, renewal, and a welcome full of love.
																				even in the depths of our own brokenness god can use each one of us to be a gift to someone else, and it all starts with mass.
