louisiana state board of private investigator examiners










                            board meeting postponed  
                            the september 17th board meeting has been postponed.  an update will be posted when a new date is determined.
                        




                            *** notice ***
                            license fee changes starting september 2024
                        


                            due to the rising cost of doing business and to continue to provide the level of service required by the state, the board recently sought a modest increase to its licensing and exam fees.  the board does not receive any financial support from the state; therefore, it must generate its own revenue.  the last rate increase was in 2007.

                            during the last legislative session, act no. 478 was signed into law and will go into effect september 1, 2024.  the act will increase the cost of each license by $50. 

                            the following list shows the fees that were changed and the new amount:

                            licensing fees – total fees

agency                 $389.25
journeyman      $389.25
individual           $239.25
apprentice        $239.25

                            renewing fees

agency                $300.00
journeyman      $300.00
individual           $150.00
