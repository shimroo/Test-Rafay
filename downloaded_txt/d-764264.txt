update: here's a very simple, short animation of how the remodel is going! remodel animationall comics here on afc are now on an irregular release schedule. work and home remodeling are making it difficult to script and shoot at the same frequency as you are accustomed to. i hope to get at least one episode of something posted per week. after the house remodeling is complete (2009), i hope to return to my previous release schedule. sorry!
