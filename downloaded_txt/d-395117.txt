jack dirkin, one of the best  golf swings?





now, more than ever before, we see near-perfect "textbook" golf swings being televised from the world's professional golf tours.  names such as tiger woods, adam scott, ernie els, charl schwartzel, louis oosthuizen, rory mcilroy and michelle wie come to mind when we think about the game's best swings.  but there are many similarly great swings from the amateur ranks that are unknown simply due to their limited exposure.  one of them is jack dirkin.  but even if jack follows tiger's march to the pga, it'll be well over another decade before you get to see his swing on a pro tour.  that's because jack is only 5 years-old!  is it crazy to think that a 5 year-old possesses one of the best golf swings in the world?  take a look at his swing below and let me know what you think!

the first back-to-back female champion at augusta national?





kelly xu became the first female champion ever at augusta by winning last year's inaugural drive, chip and putt championship at the age of 9.  she now has the opportunity to be the first back-to-back drive, chip and putt champion as the only returning champion this year.  you can watch her attempt to complete this historic feat on april 5, 2015 live at augusta or on tv at 9am et on the golf channel.  the golf channel is also broadcasting profiles of some of the competitors during their shows "golf central" and "morning drive".  while i haven't seen it, i know that there's one on kelly because i was on the penmar golf course when they filmed it!  below is my "behind the scenes" video.  look out for this special talent!

think hockey when playing golf





watching my la kings' amazing march to the stanley cup this year was a revelation to me.  not about hockey nor the will of champions, but about the golf swing.  i noticed that the hockey slap shot is quite similar to a full golf swing.  the key is that a properly executed slapshot requires that the hands are slightly ahead of the puck at impact.  this is the same principle that applies to the golf swing.  it's no wonder that so many hockey players are great golfers, including happy gilmore!

they are so similar that i find it helpful to visualize a slap shot when i setup and swing a golf club.  i imagine that the golf club is just a disproportionate hockey stick with a longer shaft and shorter blade.  first, i picture that the leading edge of my golf club is the blade of a hockey stick and i align it square to the target.  second, i make sure that my hands are slightly ahead of the ball with the shaft leaning back to the ball like a slapshot.  lastly, i pretend that i'm anže kopitar blasting a slap shot past the goalie into the net for the win!

golf tips - the proper golf grip ii





the golf swing is such a finicky thing.  one day you may be striping the ball as pure as adam scott and the very next day you may be $hanking it like a rank beginner.  wtf?  since the golf swing requires so much precision, the reason is often a breakdown of swing fundamentals.  even an infinitesimally small change can throw a monkey wrench into a golfer's swing.  the fact that these changes are frequently unnoticed by the afflicted golfer in turn leads to disbelief and frustration.

i think that the most important, but also the most overlooked fundamental is the grip.  i've already posted butch harmon's proper grip technique, but i recently came across another excellent video on the topic below.  it covers some important elements that butch does not.  after viewing and fully understanding both of these videos, there's no excuse for not gripping the golf club correctly every time!
