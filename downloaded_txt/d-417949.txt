five decadesof southern rock


after more than five decades together, 38 special continue to bring their signature blast of southern rock to over 100 cities a year. and at each and every show, thousands of audience members are amazed by the explosive power of the band's performance.
with sales in excess of 20 million, most associate the band with their arena-rock pop smashes, âhold on loosely,â ârockinâ into the night,â âcaught up in you,â âfantasy girl,â âif iâd been the one,â âback where you belong,â âchain lightninâ,â âsecond chance,â and more â timeless hits that remain a staple at radio, immediately recognizable from the first opening chord, and paving the way to their present-day touring regimen.

this music keeps our wheels on the road. we're a band that's tried to stay honest with what has driven us over the years. we started out with nothing but bold determination to make our own history and to endure. looking back now, it has been our greatest pride to have persevered and attained that level of success and longevity. for us, it's the ultimate validation.
â don barnes
