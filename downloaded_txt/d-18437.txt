joseph yu founded the feng shui research center in 1998 to accomplish his mission - to help more people globally to  understand what chinese astrology and feng shui really are. he is tireless in his efforts to transform and re-interpret sophisticated chinese classics into knowledge comprehensible even for a layperson or total beginner.


						 he hopes that one day, this valuable aspect of chinese culture will earn proper recognition in the scientific world.









take look at our
our mission and values










knowledge
knowledge is the key to a successful life, but it doesn't end with one or two diplomas. for us it is a lifelong process. we are happy to share this valuable key with you.







education
we have a wide offering of courses and seminars for total beginners as well as for professional consultants. we are working to make our courses available in your native language.







quality
we are continuously upgrading our services and courses in order to keep you up to date according to   master joseph yu's guidance and teachings.











wisdom
the learning process and gathering of knowledge is the first step. then one must digest the information to build one's wisdom. we don't teach or use simple tables and rules. the key for us is the understanding of "why".







integrating
if you start to learn with us, you enter our "family". integrating and helping each other is a very important value for all of us at the fsrc.







mentorship
not only do we help beginners  spread their wings, we also mentor experienced consultants from outside of our school. life is not just black-and-white. there are dozens of shades of grey. many masters and experienced practitioners also encounter difficult cases. we are here to assist you if help is needed.













our mission  and values
our goal is to help people live a better life.
