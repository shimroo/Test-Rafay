teens driving school




teens driving school is an organization dedicated to teenagers! our objective is to significantly reduce the staggering rate of teen related vehicle accidents and deaths.
we have developed several programs that deal with young drivers at a level they understand. we have also compiled hundreds of hours of research into the actions and tendencies of teen drivers so we can deliver a message that will impact the way they operate a vehicle. the teens driving school curriculum includes education in a variety of other areas such as the financial impact of poor driving, at-fault accidents, liability, and others to illustrate to young drivers the consequences they could face when operating a vehicle.
