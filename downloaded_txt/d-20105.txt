radio

                                              entered its tenth year of
                                              existence this spring of 2014.

                                              month. since aug 31, 2011,
                                              nearly 90,000 listeners have
                                              learned about native american

                                              no other daily native american
                                              broadcast can make that claim...
                                              and we have done it all on a
                                              shoestring budget! it only take
                                              $39.00 each month to keep us up
                                              and running two hours a night...
                                              which is much better than the
                                              $50.00 a week that bbs radio used
                                              to charge us for one hour a week.

"the

                                              prophecykeepers trilogy"
 i write this for
                                            christians in certain knowledge that
                                            we as a group have certain problems
                                            seeing anything outside of that
                                            which is strictly contained or
                                            written of in scripture. i am here
                                            to try and cause you to think
                                            "outside of the box". you probably
                                            might even find fault with this. 
  
 i am in no wise the first or
                                            last word on the mind of god and
                                            scripture but i do accept that the
                                            bible is true from cover to cover
                                            and christ was god on earth and my
                                            savior who died on the cross for my
                                            sins. where i might diverge from you
                                            is that i do not consider scriptures
                                            as telling all of the truth. there
                                            is much that can be "fleshed out"
                                            from other sources. the
                                            qualification here is that which
                                            adds to the puzzle of end times
                                            study in no wise contradicts what
                                            scripture reveals. if there is any
                                            apparent contradiction 2 things must
                                            pass through our thoughts... 

  1.does this change how

 having followed
                                            prophecy keepers for many years now,
                                            not only ordered all the interviews

                                            preparedness library (back when it
                                            was just two cd's), i just want to
                                            tell anyone who is on the fence
                                            about donating, and getting access
                                            to all this information, do it! it
                                            really is a treasure trove of
                                            information, i added it to my
                                            collection years ago, and have added
                                            my own stuff since, buy it really is
                                            well worth it, not to mention all
                                            the history, culture, and knowledge
                                            you can learn from all the elders'
                                            interview, there really is no other
                                            place to learn accurate information.
                                            keep doing what you do william, it
                                            really has changed my life, and will

 hello, 
  some of you (who are friends,
                                        foes, fans and detractors alike) are
                                        joining this conversation late, so here
                                        is some background: 
  a member of the 550+ member
                                        native prophecy council just pointed
                                        that my friend john

                                          hogue, one of the world's
                                        foremost authorities on the subject of
                                        prophecy, recently pointed out that major

                                          flooding is looming. 
  ...but do you really get
                                        what prophets are saying? 
  frankly, i kinda doubt it,
                                        based on past sad experience. 
  i have (some time ago and
                                        with no response from them) pointed all
                                        the following out to art bell, george
                                        noory, mitch battros, et al, all to no
                                        avail, and as far as i am concerned they
                                        are part of the problem... certainly no
                                        different that the populace was in
                                        noah's time... they are just down on
                                        what they were not up on. 
  most all of the people who
                                        are "making hay" nowadays selling books
                                        about the mayan prophecy should be
                                        ashamed. i know this is harsh, but i
                                        view some of them as just short of
                                        prostitutes, and some may be obfuscating
                                        this issue purposely. why? because it
                                        would not sell. or worse... some of them
                                        just might be government disinformation
                                        operatives. who the heck knows. i
                                        wouldn't be surprised, because we know
                                        from history that governments learned to
                                        use prophecy long ago as yet another
                                        avenue to control the masses. 
  now that i have beat up on
                                        them, i'll give them all virtual hugs,
                                        and kudos on a job well done in what
                                        they have done. it's a tough call all
                                        the way around. 
  now, a huge nasty fight
                                        ensued on our native prophecy council newsgroup
                                        on this very subject back after 2012
                                          the movie came out 
  one of our yahoogroup members
                                        actually prophesied (back at
                                        that time and i had to correct her) that
                                        no worldwide flooding on the
                                        scale shown in the 2012 movie would ever
                                        take place in spite of these salient
                                        facts: 
  the hopi prophecy says that
                                        hopi will be flooded up near the tops of
                                        their mesas and they would need boats to
                                        move to four corners to start a new
                                        tribe and religion. 
  as far as mayan predictions
                                        go, according to the mayan elders i have
                                        interviewed, the 2012 date may vary 15
                                        years either way. a picture of the last
                                        page of the actual dresden codex (from
                                        the 1880 förstermann edition) suggests
                                        to some that the world will end in a
                                        flood.

                                        statement that in the last days it will
                                        be as it was "in the days of noah."
                                        remember, noah warned people of the
                                        deluge, but no one listened.

                                                    that time. like the hopi,
                                                    their mystics predict a
                                                    certain "star" to be the

                                        i "saw" this flooding in night vision
                                        back in 1991, and so did (also in 1991)
                                        by a well known texas cherokee elder who
                                        wishes to remain nameless. he and i
                                        didn't realize coincidence this until we
                                        exchanged notes during the winter of
                                        2009-10 when i was at his home in east
                                        texas. the consensus between us was that
                                        the people had some time ago stopped
                                        listening to the elders, and don't
                                        deserve to know the truth.
 
 




 here's

and

                                                    interesting anecdote: a
                                                    cherokee descendant, sha ha
                                                    win, daughter of john
                                                    rolling thunder pope, about
                                                    7 years ago, saw in vision
                                                    the flooding in tennessee,
                                                    and told the bishop/pastor
                                                    of her (l.d.s.) mormon
                                                    church about her vision.
                                                    bear in mind that it is
                                                    l.d.s. doctrine that native
                                                    american prophets would be
                                                    sent to their church if it
                                                    ever erred. she was later
                                                    examined by 36 mormon
                                                    general authorities
                                                    including gordon b.
                                                    hinckley, and was promptly
                                                    ignored.





 
 interestingly enough that during her
                                        "inquisition" with the arrogant mormon
                                        authorities they did draw a correlation
                                        between her prophecy and her
                                        (unbeknownst-to-her-at-that-time) father
                                        rolling thunder's and mad bear
                                        anderson's 1972 prophecy of the future
                                        flooding of utah - which is curiously
                                        featured in a newly released us navy map of a
                                        flooded america. i reiterate that sha ha
                                        win (see http://www.myspace.com/shahawin)
                                        did not know she was rolling thunder's
                                        daughter at that time. she later moved
                                        to a tiny town 7000' in southern new
                                        mexico. 
  granted, this coming
                                        worldwide flooding (also bravely noted

will

                                        not be as extensive as noah's, thanks to
                                        god's promise in the book of genesis
                                        that he would never again destroy

                                        all life on earth by flood, but bear in
                                        mind that he reserved the right (the
                                        book of exodus) to use flooding to reign
                                        in errant nations. the mayans say the
                                        extent of the flooding will depend on
                                        how negative the people of earth have
                                        become.

                                                  forest" so plan on getting up

                                                  to escape this one. i suggest

                                        the us federal and state governments
                                        will be hard-pressed to restore order
                                        amongst 300 million people as mass
                                        starvation sets in and sources of fresh
                                        water dwindle. 
  one
                                              billion could die

  restoration of the
                                        infrastructure could take yearseven a
                                        decade or more. electrical transformers
                                        on poles would be burned out, and since
                                        they are no longer manufactured inn the
                                        usa, would need to be be imported from
                                        china. during the interim more than a
                                        billion people could die worldwidemore
                                        if warfare breaks out between countries
                                        desperate for scarce resources. 
  michio kaku adds his voice to
                                        the warnings 
  nasa has forecasted super
                                        solar storms for 2012 and is sounding
                                        the alarm it could knock out the earths
                                        entire electrical grid and kill 1
                                        billion people in its aftermath with
                                        food riots and civil unrest, and wars
                                        fought over resources. if proper
                                        precautions arent taken it could lead
                                        to nuclear meltdowns around the entire
                                        world. dr. michio kaku now warns of a
                                        huge solar flare as a "katrina from
                                        outer space" that could destroy all
                                        electronics systems (right down to your
                                        kitchen toaster!) on earth in our near
                                        2012 -- our electrical and
                                        communications grids and space
                                        satellites -- and that this would turn
                                        back the u.s. over 100 years. kaku sees
                                        the disaster as 10 times greater than
                                        katrina-perhaps even worse than that.
                                        wed be thrown 100 years into the
                                        past, he explained. the transition to
                                        the 1800s would occur as quickly as
                                        flipping a light switch off. 
  the holy bible concurs,
                                        predicting that at some point our the
                                        sun will burn 7 times hotter in the last
                                        days. 
  the hopi warned long ago
                                        before the electrical grid was even
                                        dreamed of that after the white man
                                        arrived (they knew he was coming), one
                                        would simply be able to "touch the wall"
                                        and that room would light up. they
                                        warned not to become dependent on that
                                        system once it arrived, because it would
                                        eventually fail. we see now that the
                                        infrastructure is aging because proper
                                        care wasn't taken so a few men could get
                                        richer. bridges are beginning to fail.
                                        for many years "planned obsolescence"
                                        has been a part of the manufacturing
                                        process so consumers, like junkies,
                                        would need to buy more and more down the
                                        road.

                                        what can you do? buy low tech things!
                                        study how the amish live. for example,
                                        get cookware that can be used on a
                                        campfire. get a wood stove.  learn
                                        how to do laundry in a 5 gallon bucket
                                        with a toilet plunger. build a
                                        clothesline for drying laundry -- maybe
                                        get a hand crank laundry wringer. get a
                                        simple solar+battery inverter system.

  think! there are lots of
                                        things you can do to prepare -- if you
                                        will only do so... but most younger
                                        people need the proper information and
                                        guidance... and that's what
                                        prophecykeepers is here for - to
                                        recommend the best books and other
                                        information you need to prepare, because
                                        chances are you will survive.
                                        it's your choice as to how comfortable
                                        you will be when babylon falls. 
  general patton once said "it
                                        doesn't take any intelligence to be
                                        uncomfortable."
