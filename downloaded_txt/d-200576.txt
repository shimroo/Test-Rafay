quality topsoil, mulch, gravel, limestone and sand delivered to your home.jones fuel co./ jones topsoil can deliver topsoil, soilplus, or any of your sand, gravel, or limestone needs normally within just a few hours.
we sell three different types of topsoil. regular (un-pulverized), is a good rich topsoil found along the scioto river. it is normally used for filling jobs. pulverized is the same rich topsoil, but processed through a large grinder, so the soil is loose and easy to work with. pulverized is normally used to top dress lawns, since it is easy to spread. soilplus is a blend of 60% pulverized topsoil, 20% sand, and 20% comtil, an organic compost. soilplus is used for flower beds and gardens!
our customers say
“the service was very quick. they offered to bring it out the same day but we had it delivered the next day. they showed up on time and delivered our topsoil.”

“they delivered a couple of tons of dirt. they showed up exactly when they said they would, dumped it exactly where i asked them to and they were really polite. i was very pleased with them. if i need dirt again i will definitely use them.”

“they delivered mulch and gravel to my house for me. they were on time with the delivery. i would use them in the future. they were courteous and kind. they were professional. the quality of their work was good. they were able to deliver it to me the same day. they were very responsive.”
 
“this company was great. i had originally scheduled them to come on a friday, but when i saw that the weather was going to be bad that day, i called on thursday and asked if they could deliver that day instead. they agreed right away and delivered at the exact time i specified. the driver was actually waiting for me when i pulled in the driveway. he quickly pulled his dump truck into my driveway, dropped the topsoil exactly where i asked him to, took my check, and drove off. it was all very neat, orderly, and efficient. i love them!”

“the service was very quick. they offered to bring it out the same day but we had it delivered the next day. they showed up on time and delivered our topsoil.”

“i had 8 cubic yards of topsoil delivered to our house for use in a new flower bed. the representative i spoke with was very friendly, helpful, and professional. the soil was delivered the same afternoon i called.”

“the soilplus was worth every penny. it was great quality soil and so easy to work with. the driver who delivered the soil suggested he dump the soil in our beds rather than on the driveway as planned. what an excellent suggestion-saving us hours of work!”
