2025 design!we have unveiled our concept for our 2025 float. a vibrant celebration that kicks off with the festive allure of piñatas! accompanied by the lively melodies of a mariachi band and the dynamic energy of traditional ballet folklorico dancers, this year’s entry promises to be nothing short of extraordinary — a true embodiment of  the "best day ever!”children and adults alike eagerly swing at piñatas, anticipation building as they await the cascade of treats raining down. it's a moment of pure delight, reminiscent of cherished celebrations like birthday parties, new year's day festivities, and the warmth of christmas gatherings.congratulations to steve and belle gagne who submitted this exciting concept! illustration by sharon gahlla.
