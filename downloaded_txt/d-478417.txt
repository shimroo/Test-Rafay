testimonials






most all of our jewelry is very sentimental, or very old. it’s hard to find someone you can trust with heirloom treasures! just a great person with a great heart. the world is a better place because of people like the milkins family-as in humanity and beauty. amazing!

leah halterman








i have used milkins jewelers for years for getting watch batteries to jewelry, to fixing my clasp on my necklace. they have always been very welcoming and knowledgeable and reasonably priced, plus it’s always nice to use a small business when you can. i highly recommended them❤️

susie harris








milkins is the only jeweler my family will use. their customer service is the best around and we trust them 100%
