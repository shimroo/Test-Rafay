what our customers are saying





we visited the showroom and fell in love with this table and bench immediately. we needed a large table to fill the space in our dining room and this 9-foot table and bench were perfect. the workmanship is beautiful and so unique. the design is one of a kind and we were so happy to not have to wait long for delivery since we were able to buy this right off of the showroom floor.

when i walked into the showroom, i immediately fell in love with these farm tables.  i was searching for a while for the right table for our family and for a table to pass down to future generations.  i went over what i wanted with bobby, and he hand-crafted every detail as requested. our pennsylvania farm table is the focal point of our home and where our family gathers daily. i would highly recommend these well-constructed tables,  ours will be a cherished heirloom for years to come. thank you to bobby for such a beautiful addition to our home.

bobby was a pleasure to work with. my fiancé and i have just received our kitchen table and the results were greater than anticipated. bobby worked with us and made the process a simple one. we are beyond thrilled with our newest addition to our home. as time progresses, i am confident that we will be returning to bobby for future additions to our home. the craftsmanship speaks for itself.
