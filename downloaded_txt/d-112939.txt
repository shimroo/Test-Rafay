giving back … victoria’s voice

save a life, today.
 






victoria siegel died from a drug overdose on june 6, 2015, at just 18 years old. she was one of 129 americans who lost their lives to a drug overdose that same day.
since then, a staggering number of families across the united states have lost a loved one to overdose. in fact, nearly 300 people die from a drug overdose every single day in this country. this needs to change.
help us save lives by supporting our mission to advance initiatives, achieve policy changes, amplify education, assure critical resources and applaud like-minded organizations to address drug abuse in order to save lives.
