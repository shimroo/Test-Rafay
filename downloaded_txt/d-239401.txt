  the clarion call?
if you came here 
   because you got spam email from a name at clarion-call.org it didn't 
   originate here.  spammers are forging the clarion-call email address.  
   people who have had my email address in their address books have gotten 
   viruses and the viruses have sent out email using my email address.  
   i've even gotten spam "from" myself!

i apologize.  
   let's have what is bad turn into good... it brought you here so 
	
go on in and see what is here 
   for you.
