cdh is not just a hole!congenital diaphragmatic hernia 

congenital diaphragmatic hernia

congenital diaphragmatic hernia (cdh) is a congenital anomaly that occurs when a baby’s diaphragm fails to form fully, allowing abdominal organs to enter the chest cavity and prevent lung growth.  
1 in every 2500 babies is born with cdh.   the cause is unknown.
babies born with cdh undergo complicated surgeries and long hospital stays.   in higher-income-countries, the survival rate is approximately 50 to 80%.  in lower-to-middle-income-countries, the survival rate is less than 1%.
cdh international was founded to help find the cause, prevention and best treatments of congenital diaphragmatic hernia while raising awareness and supporting patient families.
