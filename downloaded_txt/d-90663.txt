call to action ‚Äì policy makers must increase medicare advantage oversight and rein in overpayments
for many years, the center for medicare advocacy has advocated for legislative and administrative efforts to address the growing inequities between medicare advantage (ma) and traditional medicare, that favor ma, and encourage the growing privatization of the medicare program. these inequities include overpayments to ma plans that unnecessarily drive-up medicare spending, and lax oversight of ma plans that fails to impose adequate consumer protections.

issue brief:retiree auto-enrollment in medicare advantage plans ‚Äì choice is under threat
automatic enrollment of medicare-eligible beneficiaries into employer or union-sponsored group ma plans is a concern; among other things, it limits care options for millions of people and erodes the medicare statute‚Äôs protection of choice.

medicare home health coverage: reality conflicts with the law
under the law, medicare coverage is available for people with acute and/or chronic conditions, and for services to improve, or maintain, or slow decline of the individual‚Äôs condition, and such coverage is available even if the services are expected to continue over a long period of time. unfortunately, however, people who legally qualify for medicare coverage frequently have great difficulty obtaining and affording necessary home care.

yesterday trump unveiled his priorities for his tax bill.

everyone needs to understand what's going on here. it's a massive tax giveaway to the rich and powerful, financed by deadly cuts to programs like medicare and the aca that help regular people.

i explain it here.

according to a study by @kff, ‚Äúa majority of individuals, regardless of their political leanings, say the federal government needs to spend more on healthcare programs.‚Äù

it couldn‚Äôt be clearer: people want healthcare that works for them.

starting january 2025, there will be a new $2,000 cap on annual out-of-pocket spending for #medicare part d #prescriptiondrug plans. this is a timely improvement as drug prices have resulted in high cost-sharing burdens for millions of older adults.
