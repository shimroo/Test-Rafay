they are very attentive and responsive. eventhough we’re ended up have to take the trip from demre to fethiye, but they give as free bus ticket for the make up!
the boat trip itself also very nice, the food is great, the view is amazingly beautiful. due to bad weather, the first 2 days we’re circling around demre. but they give us few little compensation trip which is very nice.
