orthopaedic surgeons sydney 








elective surgery has not been shut down. a small number of the larger private hospitals have been asked to cancel non urgent elective surgery but all of the orthosports surgeons work at hospitals with no restrictions on their ability to care for you.we have implemented some changes at our offices for the safety of our patients and our staff. we are still dedicated to providing new and existing patients with continued care during these unprecedented times. when attending our rooms in person you will need to provide evidence of a negative covid test within 72 hours of your appointment. if you are unable to provide evidence of this test your appointment will be rescheduled or changed to telehealth. this is for your safety and the safety of those around you.we are offering video and telephone telehealth consultations for those patients who wish to have an appointment from the comfort and security of their own home.
