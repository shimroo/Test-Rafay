why choose airrangerwhat our customers are saying...



dear capt. sallie floyd and american airboat company team,
we are in the process of a pre-retirement life-stage transition, into making our minnesota island lake home our permanent abode. as such, there is the ice-out (spring) and ice-in (autumn) seasons, making our home “inaccessible”. we researched our options for safe between season transport, and the american airboat was the clear choice.
we purchased an 18-foot american airboat, and are impressed with its stability, handling and durability. your team provided instructions on maintenance and safe handling of this craft, both at your texas headquarters and on-site in minnesota. the drive training in texas was on open water; the drive training in minnesota occurred in january on ice and ice/water combination with sub-zero temperatures. this training was invaluable to say the least.
a huge positive selling factor is your team’s availability during the new owner’s on-going learning curve regarding maintenance, driving and trailering. there is much to learn & know regarding the safe handling of this craft, and on-going maintenance of oil-changes, fuel filter changes, grease gun ports, etc. the availability of your team for on-going questions as needed is most exceptional service!
as of mid-february 2024, we have been able to drive our airboat safely from shore to our island lake home, as well as trailer it on and off the ice. this was all instructed to us carefully by captain sallie and her team of professionals.
you and your team have given us the gift of year-round accessibility, and for our house to now become a ‘home’. the feeling of ‘having a home’ again is truly priceless.
for this and more, we are and will continue to be, most grateful.
most sincerely,
kevin & camille murphy
