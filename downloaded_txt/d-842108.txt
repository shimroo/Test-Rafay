the division of criminal justice (dcj) is responsible for investigating and prosecuting violations of new jersey criminal laws. with a staff consisting of over 400 detectives, prosecutors, civil investigators, and professional support personnel, dcj investigates criminal activity across the state, focusing on high-impact cases that require significant or highly specialized investigative resources. dcj also provides integral statewide trainings for prosecutors and law enforcement officers. in addition, dcj assists the attorney general in his role as the state’s chief law enforcement officer, which pursuant to the criminal justice act of 1970, gives the attorney general broad supervisory authority over new jersey’s 21 county prosecutors’ offices and the state’s 38,000 law enforcement officers.
