our puppy store – where our breeders reputation is our reputation!
we are much different than any other puppy store you walk into. the first thing you will notice is the spacious habitats our puppies stay in, the next thing you will notice is how clean it is and lastly, our puppies only come from the best breeders and we can proudly say we have one of the best reputations in south florida for over 16 years. we keep all of our breeder information posted in the front, and we give you all information when you purchase a puppy(and before if you are inquiring). part of being the only puppy store in parkland, fl means that we are under strict regulation to ensure we only work with legitimate, honest breeders. as we always remind people, our breeders reputation is our reputation and we have an excellent one!
