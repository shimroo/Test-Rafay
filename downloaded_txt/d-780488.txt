  halpern story



  contact us











           welcome

although halpern titanium has been dedicated to the knife industry since 1997, we are much more than a knife manufacturer. our 30 cnc machining centers and grinders have milled and waterjet cut millions of parts for multiple industries. our specialties are titanium, stainless steel, carbon fiber, micarta and g10.due to the exponential growth in our knife company, trm, we will no longer be accepting contracts for
finished knives. we'd be glad to provide quotes for individual knife parts, especially handles (minimum 250 sets for an initial order). because we are a
private label manufacturer, many pictures will showcase our advanced machining skills through our
trm knives.
