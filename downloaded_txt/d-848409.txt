                                                        new world re-order: how trump’s tariffs will reshape global supply chains

               navigating rates
               

a dynamic approach is required as investors adapt to shifting interest rates, inflation expectations and exchange rates. volatility will likely persist: while we expect monetary policy to become gradually less restrictive than in recent times, higher rates will likely uncover weak points as industries feel the impact of elevated borrowing costs. visibility of how markets will develop remains limited, even in the short term, and expectations could be upended. but we are confident this environment also creates opportunities. 

diversification is key – across public and private markets – and we have the ideas and expertise to navigate the complexity.

               embracing disruption
               

we think it’s time to recast traditional definitions of “disruption”. once a story for the tech sector, disruption is now all-encompassing as artificial intelligence and other transformative technologies are used widely. 

while technology may be driving many of the changes, this new wave of disruption could shape many aspects of our daily lives. there are also geopolitical shifts to watch as china becomes preeminent in high-tech industries like electric cars and india positions itself as an emerging power. 

the implications of this new age of disruption will be profound and exponential, and together we can embrace the opportunities.

               achieving sustainability
               

sustainable investing is evolving rapidly. increased flows rightly come with increased expectations of measurability and impact. the industry is on a journey: from a focus on esg-led risk management to purposeful sustainability solutions and ultimately to impact investing strategies that contribute to measurable environmental or social benefits. 

we believe this direction of travel towards real-world change will be the long-term trend of the decade. with a considered approach to achieving sustainable outcomes, we are alongside you at the different stages of your journey, whatever your ambitions.

               transforming infrastructure
               

infrastructure is key for the development and smooth running of economies and societies, but much of the infrastructure needed tomorrow does not exist today. private capital can play a crucial role in funding essential projects as huge investments are needed, especially for the transition to greener energy. 

investors have many ways to enter this complex asset class and can pick their spot in the capital structure and the region or duration of the investment. 

with our expertise and market access we are working with investors today to transform the infrastructure of tomorrow.
