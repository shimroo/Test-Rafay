joel kent, fbn security co llc 17 march 2023







special quests speakers were bj malley with the ms state fire marshall’s office and attorney ken kirschenbaum. if you have never had an audience with mr. kirschenbaum, you are doing yourself an injustice. he is the predominate authority on all legal aspects of our industry.


jack b. torrence, msa president 18 may 2021







good afternoon ken,i want to thank you for hosting the financial seminars with the wooster’s. both sessions have been highly educational and quite informative. you and your team are such a support to the entire industry and we all appreciate what you do.


ron bowden 18 september 2020







there is much value in k&k’s lawyer concierge program and its services.  i can’t imagine a reason any others if but at a glance wouldn’t recognize it is clearly so.


carl frommer 13 august 2020







the subject matter in your daily email today helped facilitate our decision to move forward with retaining your firm for phase ii of the ppp. at this point we are very glad we did. your representative, steve sheinwald was very helpful and well informed. he answered our questions, gave excellent advice, and provided us with a good sense of calm in a sea of uncertainty.thank you for offering this service to our industry.


r. ross, president 12 may 2020







also, i wanted to thank you again for your brutal honesty when reviewing my first contract i sent you about 2.5 years ago. it was the last bit of confirmation i needed that that particular job was trash, and i think it was best $500 i ever spent in my life.


dr. o 06 december 2019







stacy, thank you so much for everything!you guided us through the whole process and helped us every step of the way!you are the best!! hope to see you in the spring when we start looking for a place.


phyllis and steve 06 december 2019







hello mr. kirschenbaum,i wanted to reach out to you and thank you for your help in creating our alarm, products, and services provided contract that you did 10 years ago! unfortunately, we had to take one of our customers to court yesterday over a past due balance. due to the contract that you provided us, we won our case against the former customer and will now be able to collect the $45k that we are owed! the judge specifically stated that had we not had this contract, we would not have won the case. thanks again for your help, we greatly appreciate it!


jillian vaughn, cfo, digital sky 21 november 2019







please insert 1,000 random words "thanking you" for your recent personal email response regarding review of contract, and for everything else you do for us.


peter m. 28 september 2019







thank you for the courtesy. you are very supportive of your customers and i am thankful you are doing what you do!


lee b. 30 july 2019







first i would like to say that we love the alarm exchange. we have been part of it for about 3 to 4 years. it has been a key part of our growth in the low voltage industry. thank you for creating the exchange.


jose c. flores, president techaddict inc. 26 july 2019







i can’t help but notice in your remarks how much your knowledge of the industry has grown. hope it’s been a great journey from the first days of your postings so many years ago.  congratulations on finding and recognizing a niche. only in america right?  don’t know when you actually started to address the rest of the country but it was spot on.  how’s it feel to be an icon in the security industry?


zeke comtec 19 july 2019







amazing experience with the firm through multiple contract negotiations. highly recommended.


miscellaneous 5 mar 2018







ken kirschenbaum is direct, honest and thorough. his counsel can be relied upon, and when something is litigious, he executes with precision. when seeking representation on important family matters, our family relies on kirschenbaum & kirschenbaum.


paul and necy repetto 16 aug 2018







ken, please accept my sincere thanks for providing this forum for questions, answers and pertinent updates both for, and from, its many subscribers. i have garnered a lot of valuable information over the years.
