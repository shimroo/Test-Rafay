lord of the rings – army of the dead

posted on 03/05/2021  by  rob 

reply 


i was after something quick and easy to paint as i try and get back into painting more regularly this year this year, so after a look through my huge to paint stack i settled on the army of the dead as i have all the miniatures and they looked easy enough.

i was never keen on the way gw painted theirs thinking they looked much too grey and stone like, after i checked the film they looked much greener so i went with that colour scheme.

merry christmas – plague santa

posted on 24/12/2020  by  rob 

reply 


well what a strange year 2020 has been, it seemed that this model from wargames foundry was the obvious choice this year for a christmas figure to paint.


i quite enjoyed painting him as he’s relatively simple to do which is just what i wanted after a long break from painting, unfortunately the last couple of years have been very busy for me with a close family member dying and my business has been growing very quickly and then this year i’ve had building work been carried out so i haven’t had much time for any painting for a long time. things are hopefully settling down now though so my new years resolution is to get painting as much as i can as i’ve still been buying miniatures like a mad man.
i imagine this year has been pretty terrible for many people but i hope you have had at least something to celebrate, but lets hope for a better new year and happy christmas to you all.

lord of the rings – saruman

posted on 09/04/2017  by  rob 

reply 


as part of my attempt of clearing my painting desk i’ve finished the 6 saruman figures that had been sat there for a few years since i had the brainwave or painting all the maia for the lord of the rings,  i managed radagast the brown and sauron before getting bored of the idea.
 it’s actually the second time i’ve painted these as the first time the varnish went cloudy which is infuriating but seems to happen to everyone at some point.
the painting guide is below as usual –

dungeon saga – part 2

posted on 12/03/2017  by  rob 

reply 


i’ve finally got finished the next batch of dungeon saga miniatures, some are a joy to paint others are a pita.

from left to right are the armoured zombies, skeleton scythe men and zombies
i’ve nearly done all the monsters now, i just need to finish the skeleton bowmen but i don’t have the urge to paint them yet so it may be a while until the next dungeon saga update. but i am currently working on a large unit of skaven so that probably will be the next update.
the painting guide is below if needed.

warhammer – skaven rat swarms

posted on 12/02/2017  by  rob 

reply 


i’ve painted the first unit of my skaven army this weekend, although my skaven army is mainly a 3rd edition army i do have a couple of units which are newer, the first is these rat swarms from 6th edition –

sadly there were no rat swarm miniatures from the 80’s you were just supposed to stick the giant rats on to a 40mm base but i always found them far too large, so i’m using these as substitutes as apart from the skulls i think they fit with the older style pretty well.

advanced heroquest – skaven metal prototype

posted on 28/01/2017  by  rob 

2 


i’m lucky enough to own all 6 of the advanced heroquest metal prototype miniatures, two of the miniatures are very rare, this skaven and the elf, the other four figures while rare do pop up on ebay occasionally but still fetch around £60 each. as a comparison between the plastic and metal miniature i’ve done this picture for you –
as you can see there are a few minor differences but they are essentially the same figure, to be honest i don’t particularly like either figure, the metal miniatures head looks a bit pig like to me, but as i’m about to start my skaven army now i thought i’d paint the metal one up to test some colours that i’m thinking of using on them, and here is the finished result.i’m trying to get a drab look for the army with no bright colours, i’m happy with the fur but not sure about the tunics colour so i may change it for my first unit.
painting guide below if you’re interested.

dungeon saga – part 1

posted on 12/01/2017  by  rob 

reply 


firstly i’ve decided on a few new years resolutions related to my hobby –
1. i have to paint two models for every one that i buy this year, this is becoming essential as although i didn’t paint much last year i was still buying as normal and all my cupboards seem to be overflowing with miniatures.
2. clear my painting desk of unfinished miniatures, this may not sound too hard to you but right now there’s probably over 100 models on it in various stages of completion, one of which has been there for 16 years now.
3. start my skaven army and have enough units completed for a game by the end of the year.
they shouldn’t be too hard to achieve except perhaps the 2nd but we shall see.
over the christmas holidays i picked up a copy of dungeon saga from mantic games, i was interested in how it would compare to heroquest in both quality and it’s game play. although i haven’t played it yet i have begun painting the miniatures and they aren’t too bad, the sculpts are more detailed than the heroquest miniatures but they are made from a much softer plastic which has some pro’s and con’s such as they bend instead of break if dropped, most figures had warped in the box but hot water straightens them out, hopefully they will stay in the correct pose now that they are painted. the mould lines are also quite hard to remove, the plastic seems to fur up instead of being removed cleanly, i’ve heard that freezing the models first can help here though i’ve yet to try it.
i’ve painted the first batch of undead monsters from the game, the skeleton swordsmen, dwarf revenants and ghosts.

i didn’t want to spend a long time on the figures as they are obviously gaming pieces rather than display but i did want them to look like mantics display pieces as much as possible. painting guides are below and i’m now onto the next group –

posted on 24/12/2016  by  rob 

reply 


merry christmas everyone, i’m not dead but i have been very busy with work for the last 6 months or so not giving me much time for painting, hopefully things will change a bit in the new year, but i did manage to find time to very quickly paint this old citadel space santa just in time for christmas –

hopefully i’ll be able to get a fair bit of painting done over the christmas holidays and into 2017.

lord of the rings – arwen evenstar

posted on 30/03/2016  by  rob 

reply 


i’ve been a bit busy this month doing the boring aspects of modelling (paint stripping, flash removal, undercoating) to get much painting done but i did manage to paint the four lord of the rings arwen miniatures.
i’m pretty pleased with the result and am considering using a similar scheme for my warhammer 3rd edition dark elves, a painting guide is below –
