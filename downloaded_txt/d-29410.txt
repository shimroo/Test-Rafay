we are sad to announce that...
kevin vincent reilly, 54, of pompano beach, 
          died peacefully on april 26, 2009. 
          happy-go-lucky and kind-hearted, kevin loved spending time with his 
          family and will forever be remembered 
          for his infectious belly laugh. kevin was our dearly loved, good natured 
          jolly mon.
kevin was the founder of reilly's treasured 
          gold, a successful 20-year-old company in pompano beach 
          specializing in the manufacturing of his innovative sand and water scoops 
          and metal-detecting equipment. 
          kevin also authored two books on treasure hunting. 
reilly's treasured gold will continue to do 
          business as usual in memory of kevin.
