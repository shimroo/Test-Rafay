our vision a happy, safe, purpose-filled life for every individual with intellectual and developmental disabilities





marklund is a nonprofit organization that serves infants, children, teens and adults with severe and profound developmental disabilities and special healthcare needs.
at marklund, everything we do begins with caring for each and every child or adult with the same care we would want for our own family members. many of our residents and community clients are non-ambulatory and have severe cognitive deficits due to genetic disorders or complications during pregnancy and delivery. others acquired disabilities during infancy or childhood through tragic accidents. many have complex medical problems that require 24-hour skilled nursing care.
