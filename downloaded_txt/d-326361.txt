history

avenue capital group was founded in 1995 by marc lasry and sonia gardner. pioneers in the distressed debt market, mr. lasry and ms. gardner have successfully invested in the public and private debt and equity securities of companies across a variety of industries for nearly three decades.
prior to founding avenue, mr. lasry and ms. gardner founded amroc investments, llc. amroc began in 1989 as a $100 million distressed debt investment partnership organized by mr. lasry and ms. gardner in association with the robert m. bass group, inc.
although avenue’s investment focus has evolved from distressed debt towards the increasingly attractive private credit markets, avenue’s disciplined investment approach has remained consistent over time. 










investment approach

avenue capital group believes it has the unique ability to look at an outwardly difficult situation and see value for the future. the firm seeks to perform rigorous analysis of both the industry and the individual company before making an investment. industries in transition, whether through secular or cyclical forces, often represent opportunities. the firm follows well-developed investment themes and continually reevaluates its macro views and strategies.
