top 10 best affiliate marketing niches in 2024
i know there are a lot of niches to choose from, and some of them are far more “exciting” than others. however, if you want the best possible chance of succeeding in an online business (especially via affiliate marketing and/or seo) then it is much easier to go after a proven industry.
so, what does that mean for you?
it’s simple…
the most profitable niches (at least long term) are almost always going to be those that have been popular for several years, maybe even decades, and are not likely going anywhere for a very long time, if ever.
they have been hugely popular for a long time because they appeal to the wants and needs of most people — generation after generation. the actual products/services are going to change but the core niche stays the same, and will probably never go away.
often times, these industries were around long before the internet and can be found in many “offline” brick-and-mortar stores even nowadays. this means they have solid staying power.
these niches aren’t new or trendy. so the latest fad or trend doesn’t make the cut — even if it is a hot topic right now and could make some quick money. the lasting niches will always win in the long run! therefore, these tend to be the best niches for building a website or starting an internet business.
if you want to start an online business with the highest chance of succeeding then your best bet is to enter a market that has already been proven to be profitable. that’s not too hard to understand. there’s nothing wrong with cashing in on a hot trend, but we are talking about long term profits here.
you are probably asking yourself one of the following questions (or something similar):

what are the most profitable niches for affiliate marketing?
is this niche worth getting into for seo?
what industries are the best to start in as an internet marketer?
can i make money online with [insert niche here]?

this is what i often tell people when they ask me these types of questions:
as a general rule of thumb, if you are ever unsure if a niche could be profitable or not; just ask yourself…
“does it have something to do with getting paid, laid, or living a long time?”
what i mean is this…
typically the most profitable niches that are likely always going to be around are those dealing with wealth/money/finance (getting paid), dating/sex/relationships (getting laid), or health/fitness/wellness (living a long time).
why?
because these are things that virtually everyone on the planet wants!
therefore, if it falls into one of these 3 categories, you can presume it’s more than likely a profitable niche.
that’s not foolproof advice (there are exceptions to everything) but it’s a damn good start! obviously those aren’t the only niches that will make money, but they are certainly a good starting point if you aren’t sure where to begin!
so, with that being said, what are the top niche markets in 2024?
our niche ideas are compiled based on many years of experience and solid data showing them to be among the most popular niches to make money online. these industries are loaded with prime opportunities for creating a passive income business on the internet.
alright, let’s get to it…
these are our choices for the top 10 most profitable affiliate marketing and seo niches this year:
health/fitness/beauty
this is a huge industry that shows no signs of ever slowing down and will probably be around forever. furthermore, if you read above, you will notice this one is in the “big 3” categories under “living a long time” so it’s a proven profitable market. there are already thousands of money making sub-niches inside this industry and more are coming in all the time. it just keeps growing every year.
just think about it for a second, you have:

losing weight
fat reduction
diets (lots of these out there and new popular ones coming out every other year)
building muscle
supplements/shakes/vitamins (a lot of millionaires out there because of this sub-niche)
healthy eating
workout/fitness/lifting programs
exercise equipment
hair products
makeup
skincare
remedies
curing/preventing diseases
natural health
cellulite reduction
anti-aging
iv therapy
super foods (ex: i have a site about bone broth that does quite well)
meal replacements

…and about a million other things!
the list above barely even scratches the surface of this overall niche(s). plus, think of all the hundreds or even thousands of micro-niches underneath each of these. the list pretty much never ends! these tend to make great affiliate marketing niches as there are usually a ton of different products in each category that are very popular and typically provide affiliate programs so you can promote them to earn money.
there’s money to be made hand over fist here, and the opportunities are virtually endless. another great thing about this industry is that, even though it’s super popular, there are still a lot of untapped niche markets in it due to the fact that new things are coming out all the time. also, in many cases, you will actually be helping people so there’s an added bonus of feeling good about what you are doing.
many of the top niches for affiliate marketing can be found in this category and a ton of micro-niches that are often great for seo, but there’s plenty of other options, so don’t stop here if you are looking for more!
dating/romance
this is another one of the “big 3” (getting laid) and i doubt it’s ever going anywhere! it is highly lucrative and almost certainly always will be.
whether someone is looking for love, struggling to keep a partner, wanting to rekindle passion, trying to get laid, needing marriage help, or one of many other reasons why this is such a huge topic; there are tons of ways to build a business in the dating/romance niche with all the potential products & services available.
here is just a small sample of the topics this industry:

how to get a girlfriend/boyfriend
general dating tips
add excitement to your sex life
save your relationship
online dating sites
sugar daddies/mommas
pick up artists
marriage advice
pregnancy
intimate apparel/adult toys

people are always looking for advice when it comes to these areas and are willing to spend money to get the help they need. this will continually be a huge market full of potential for building a profitable online business. there are a plethora of affiliate programs to promote in these niches already and plenty of room to create your own product or service as well.
make money/finance
think about this one for a moment… there’s a reason you visited this website in the first place, and are reading this post right now!
the reason being this is a massively profitable niche that has always been popular and always will be. it also wraps up the “big 3” previously discussed with the “getting paid” industry.
some topics here include (but are certainly not limited to):

ways to earn money online
make money blogging
home business opportunities
search engine optimization (seo)
social media marketing
affiliate programs
digital currency investing
video marketing
mlm
investments

even if you are just getting started with building your online business in one of the other niches listed here, you could still help others by teaching the strategies and techniques you used to create an online business. share your successes, failures, tips, etc…
plus, there are a ton of courses, ebooks, coaching programs, business opportunities, and so much more than you can promote as an affiliate marketer. the options here are virtually limitless for what you can do in the money/finance niche.
okay, you have now learned the “big 3” niches for getting paid, laid, and living a long time! however, those aren’t the only great industries out there, so let’s continue with some more of the best niches for 2024…
pets/animals
people absolutely love their pets! in fact, many consider them a part of the family, and won’t hesitate to spend a lot of money on them. i am personally one of those people. i love animals and would do just about anything for them. there are millions of people just like me out there.
there’s food, treats, toys, crates, boarding, grooming, bedding, training, and a whole lot more. many people spend more on their pets than they do themselves in a given month, and some people would go hungry before letting their pet miss a meal.
if that doesn’t scream “hot niche” then i don’t know what does?! plus, people will always have pets, so this is a very evergreen industry that will almost certainly never die off.
survivalism/prepping/home security
another huge niche that has only been growing in recent years, and will likely continue to rise in modern society.
some of the sub-niches and topics include:

weapons/defense/security
bug-out bags
survival knives
bunkers/shelters
supplies/gear
self sufficiency skills
food storage
survival kits
tactical tools
bushcraft
alarms
security systems
cameras
door reinforcements

plus many others! the ideas are virtually never-ending here.
many preppers will spare no expense when it comes to emergency preparedness and doomsday readiness. plus, almost everyone wants to keep their home secure even in the best of times. so there are definitely some potentially lucrative niche ideas in here and likely will be for the foreseeable future.
these also often seem to work well as profitable seo niches because most of the research into these things and purchases are normally done online, and the overall competition levels are not super competitive yet. that also makes this one of top niches for affiliate marketers for many of the same reasons.
sports/hobbies
obviously there are a nearly endless amount of sports & hobbies out there, and they come with millions of different ways to make money from them. this is more of a general niche in that it doesn’t really have a defined list of specific top-level industries to discuss.
you have to use a bit more creativity here in finding your sub-niche, but it’s really not very difficult at all once you start getting the ideas flowing. every sport has some sort of equipment needed, and just about every hobby has some sort of product or service associated with it too. you just have to find what you enjoy and sell the products and/or service associated with said hobby or sport. it’s actually quite simple if you don’t overthink it!
technology
new technology and subsequent products are literally coming out daily. everyone wants the latest product or coolest new gadget on the marketing, and people will spend a lot of money to get it!
whether it’s the best new computer, tablet, smartphone, or the newest device on the block… people will pay for it. everyone wants the latest and best technology. then, you have accessories galore to go with these devices, which provides an entire world of opportunity for the savvy business people.
you can typically buy and sell these products on amazon, ebay, alibaba, and a whole bunch of other online marketplaces. you could also create your own video tutorials, information products, an authority site, and so on. there’s a lot of opportunity to cash in on the ever-growing tech industry.
learn another language
there’s not really much of an explanation needed for this one. people all over the world are wanting to learn other languages for various reasons, so you can do quite well for yourself by giving them the resources do to so.
whether it’s english, spanish, french, chinese, german, portuguese, russian, japanese, italian or any of the other hundreds of languages in the world; there are thousands of people wanting to learn them at any given time.
you don’t have to teach classes or be some master of multiple languages to make money in this niche. all you have to do is build a website or community where you can promote affiliate products that do teach people wanting to learn other languages. this can be a quite lucrative niche!
personal development (aka self-improvement and/or self-help)
whatever you call it, there’s no arguing that this is a huge niche market! there are countless courses, programs, books, videos, coaches, and much more in this niche.
there are few things more satisfying than feeling accomplished & good about yourself while building your body and/or mind to achieve greater things. we all crave it. thus making self-improvement one of the most profitable niches to get involved in.
virtually everyone around the world wants to do something related to personal development. whether that is building self-esteem, creating career success, building relationships, increasing confidence, achieving goals, overcoming obstacles, or about a thousand other things… it’s an almost endless niche!
this is a multi-billion dollar per year industry and is continually growing. even a small slice of this giant industry can give you a very successful online business. and it is quite a fulfilling endeavor to help others transform their lives in a positive way!
babies/kids
it’s not very hard to see why this one would make the list of the most profitable niches. people spend a fortune on babies & kids for all kinds of different products. not only their parents but also grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, and so on. there are a lot of sub-niches here and so many opportunities to make money as an affiliate in this niche via seo, blogging, or other forms of marketing.
okay, that concludes our list of the top 10 best niches for 2024. this is not to say these are the only worthwhile industries to get involved in. there are plenty of hot niches out there that you can make an absolute fortune from. how you decide to build your business is entirely up to you. we have simply provided these great niche ideas to help you get started. use them as the foundation for your business and build upon it until you have achieved all your goals!
also, before we wrap it up, let’s make something else very clear…
there are some other industries that are super popular, and therefore tempting, but they are also very difficult to compete in online (if not impossible). so they are not recommended unless you are a battle tested veteran of the internet marketing world with a large budget and a ton of experience & connections.
some of these include…

payday loans
insurance
real estate (unless it’s local)
travel
credit cards

that’s not an exhaustive list but you get the idea!
these are certainly profitable niches in the grand scheme of things – that can’t be denied – but in most cases they are far too competitive for the average person to succeed in, at least online, so we don’t suggest trying to get into them unless you are a high level marketer with deep pockets and a badass team! don’t be fooled by their numbers, you would be very lucky to ever make money online in any of those industries (unless you somehow find a very specific untapped sub-niche).
stick to the main 10 niches discussed above and you will have a much higher chance of succeeding with your affiliate business! as stated before, there are obviously millions of other industries that you can build a business in and be very successful, but we feel these are the best niches in general for the average person to start an online business and be successful.
once you have mastered a few of them, you can start branching out into others, or just dominate an entire niche subset. the opportunities are virtually endless with what you can do with these niche ideas.
top 9 home business opportunities for 2024
can you believe we are already rolling so far into 2024? the year is flying by so fast! though it seems they always do, so it’s not really that big of a shock.

it’s a new year full of new opportunities for anyone willing to get out of their comfort zone. with each year that passes the internet becomes a bigger part of our lives and that creates an increase in online businesses you can do from home. the world is changing and will continue to do so. this is your chance to get ahead of the game and take advantage of what’s available to you in this new digital world.
if you had plans to start a home based business this year, or expand a current one, but have been putting it off, the time to go for it is right now! before you know it 2024 will be coming to an end and you will be making plans for next year instead. there are plenty of great internet home business opportunities and other ways to become your own boss, so don’t put it off any longer. this is your year to shine!
often times, online business ideas are seen as opportunities for stay-at-home moms, college students, or underpaid office workers to earn some extra cash in their spare time, and yes they can be great for that, but you can also start an online home business as your main source of income — regardless of who you are, what you do, or your situation in life! not only that; it can be your path to financial freedom. of course, not every idea or opportunity will make you rich; you have to choose carefully and work hard.
to get you started on the right path to wealth, we have expanded our yearly top 5 into a new top 9. so below are nine of the best business ideas and opportunities for 2024. these aren’t listed in any particular order because there are many options available, and the “best” one is impossible to say because everybody has different preferences based on their particular skills and interests.

affiliate marketer
this is undoubtedly one of the easiest, cheapest, and fastest ways to start a home business on the internet — and is my personal favorite. there are affiliate programs for pretty much every niche you could possibly think of and almost all of them are free to join. i have never seen a market where there wasn’t some product or service at least somewhat related to it that you could promote as an affiliate marketer. and rarely do you find any that actually cost to join (although sometimes they do). thus making this one of the top online business opportunities in the world for just about anyone.
you can also use free blogging platforms such as blogger and wordpress to start a site. then, you can use free internet marketing strategies to promote them. so basically you could build a successful online business without spending a cent. although i do recommend getting your own domain and hosting, and investing some money on a few resources to help you along the way, but it’s not necessarily required. that’s what makes this such a popular way to make money on the internet and why it made the “top business opportunities” list.
however, just because it’s easy to get started with affiliate marketing, and can be done by spending very little money, if any, doesn’t mean you will be able to simply join a program and be cashing in the next day. it does take a lot of learning, time, and hard work to build a successful affiliate marketing business. you still have to put in the necessary effort just like everyone else. we recommend the super affiliate system to help put you on the fast track to success.

professional blogger
another one of the best home business ideas in 2024 and probably for many years to come is becoming a blogging professional. there’s a virtually unlimited amount of topics that you can make money blogging about. if you have a passion or specific knowledge about something that other people are interested in then you can become a professional blogger and earn a living writing about it.
you will need to research the niche and various topics within it before jumping in so you can be sure there is an audience out there. you don’t want to waste your time writing and trying to build a business around a blog topic that nobody has an interest in. you also want to be sure that you aren’t choosing a niche so competitive that you will never be able to get anywhere with it.
two of the most important parts of succeeding with a business like this are consistency and perseverance. it’s always easy to stay motivated at first but it takes time to write a lot of content, build up a solid readership, get high search engine rankings, daily traffic, and eventually a great income. the hard part is sticking it out until all of that happens. you need to be determined and continually work at it for quite a while before it will begin to pay off.
once you have gained enough traffic, readers, rankings, and authority; you can monetize your blog by selling advertising on it either directly or through google adsense. you can also sell affiliate products or services (as discussed above) and/or even create your own products or services to sell (discussed below). they are plenty of ways to make money from a popular blog, so you won’t have any trouble finding at least one to fit your desires when the time comes.
some of the big time bloggers literally make millions of dollars per year from their websites. in order to do that you will need to develop an insanely popular blog with hundreds of thousands of visitors per month, which is not likely, but it can be certainly be done. or at the very least you can earn a very respectable income from a more “normal” blog.
another way that you can build a blogging business is to actually hire yourself out as a blogger. this is not something you see too many people talking about but it can be a great opportunity. though, i will say, it is a bit more like a job than a biz, but it doesn’t have to be if you think outside the box and do it right.
with so many blogs online nowadays there are countless opportunities for someone willing to be a blogger-for-hire. a lot of people don’t have the time, energy, or ability to keep their blogs updated consistently so they will pay someone to help them out with the writing duties. this can be a great way to earn money online without having to build up your own blog.

online business consultant
with each year that passes the internet becomes more popular for starting home businesses online. but most people don’t have a clue how to get started or where to go after they do start. so there is huge money to be made if you want to teach them what they need to know. if you are an expert in a certain field, you could offer online consultation or coaching services to them. one big advantage of this idea is the low capital required.
people need to learn everything from niche research to setting up a blog/site to seo, link building, marketing, social media, content creation, copy writing, building a list, and everything else that goes along with internet marketing and online business. there are a lot of individuals, small businesses, and even huge corporations that will pay a lot of money for help with that stuff. if you have the knowledge and skills then you can definitely do very well as an online business consultant.
two of the biggest sectors of this industry are as follows:

seo consulting – with the growth of the internet and everyone coming online for business and personal reasons, it is more important than ever to be able to get websites ranked highly in search engines. most people don’t have a clue how to do search engine optimization (seo) properly nor do they have the desire or time to learn. they need the services of an seo specialist to help them out and are willing to pay good money for it. if you have the knowledge and skills to get high rankings on the major search engines (mainly google) then you can work from home as a search engine optimization consultant and earn great money doing it.
web designer – as with above, the increase of people and businesses coming online makes the services of a professional web designer more in-demand than ever before. most people and companies don’t know how to create a website or have the time to learn. they would rather pay someone to do it for them and do it right the first time. if you can design and build web sites you can make a very good living in 2024 and beyond. this is certainly one of the best business opportunities from home right now.

this isn’t really so much a way to get your home based business idea started because you will obviously need to already have plenty of experience in order to offer your consulting services (unless you’ve been working for someone else and realized you can do better on your own). however, it is a great way to expand on your current business and create another income stream for yourself. this opportunity will only increase in popularity in 2024 and for many years to come.

become a social media star
they are a lot of people who have literally become celebrities through social media sites such as instagram and youtube. they often times use that fame to build up huge followings on even more social sites such as tiktok snapchat, twitter, facebook, and many others. eventually they can get millions of followers on multiple platforms.
once this is achieved you can get paid thousands of dollars to mention a certain brand in a single tweet, post, picture, video, update, or whatever. companies are willing to pay huge amounts for the brand exposure to the millions of followers/fans/subscribers. if you can manage to rack up a huge following on social media, you could leverage into a very healthy income.
of course, you will need to either be entertaining, funny, informative, helpful, inspirational, sexy, different, or some combination of those things in order to build up the followers & fame. you also need to share frequently and consistently. you should also respond to comments from your fans as much as you possibly can.
yeah, you might get super lucky and become a social media sensation overnight from just one video or picture, but you probably shouldn’t count on it. as with any business, it will most likely take a lot of time and effort to do, but it can be very rewarding for those of you who follow through.
along these same lines, you can build a very successful internet business as a social media marketing coach. it’s no secret that social media is all the rage right now but relatively few people know how to truly use it properly and effectively for business marketing. so there is huge potential for those who do. one of the hottest ways to make money online in 2024 is being a social media marketing coach for small business owners and all kinds of different companies. if you got the skills they can definitely pay the bills.

app development
this is something that is still relatively new in the online business world, but can also be one of the most lucrative opportunities ever created if you can come up with the right idea at the right time, and run with it. if you have the tech skills, you can create mega popular app that makes you millions of dollars. even a moderately popular app can bring you in hundreds of thousands of dollars. you make money either from direct app sales or advertising to app users.
even free apps have the potential to earn a lot of money through ads, selling it, building a huge list, and many other ways. if you are looking for inspiration, look to apps like pokemon go, angry birds, candy crush, mobile strike, and other apps that have made their creators very rich in recent years.

sell products on amazon, ebay, etc
there’s really not a whole lot of new things to say about this particular online business idea. just about everybody knows what ebay and amazon are and have used them for buying or selling items for years (as well as other online marketplaces). for a long time this has been one of the most popular ways to start a home business to make money online, and that is no different this year. you could technically be up and running today if you really wanted to.
you might think all the good business ideas for succeeding as an ebay or amazon seller have been taken, but there are still plenty of opportunities to do very well with your own product selling home based business. admittedly it’s probably not quite as easy as it once was but it’s certainly not impossible either. at the very least it can be a great way to get your foot in the door of the internet business world.
there are countless stories of people who made millions from the unlikeliest of products. for example; stay at home mom, cheryl rigdon, had an idea to create a small spatula (the spatty) to help scoop out all the remaining contents from the bottom of bottles. she went on shark tank seeking investment but was shot down. this did not stop her product from taking off and earning her big money.
if you have an extremely unique and beneficial product or service, you can sell it online and make millions. the most important thing is to know your target market, provide actual value, and carry out a full internet marketing campaign.

cryptocurrency/bitcoin trading
one of the hottest topics in the digital and financial worlds these days is definitely cryptocurrencies — especially bitcoin — and there are an abundance of people who have started crypto trading businesses online, and are doing quite well with them. in fact, many people are making money hand over fist in this industry, and are able to do it from the comfort of their own homes.
in other posts here on the blog, we have already gone over many of the best options for how to make money with bitcoin (in which trading is one of them), and in addition to that, we have also posted a bitcoin trading tutorial for beginners, so i’m not going to get very in-depth on the topic of trading crypto here in this post as that would be redundant. i just wanted to mention it here as one of the top online business ideas in this day and age.
there’s little doubt that cryptocurrency is here to stay, and the use of bitcoin and other crypto currencies will only continue to grow in the coming years, so starting a bitcoin business now could make you very wealthy in the near future.

network marketing
some people love it, some people hate it, and some people can’t decide either way. but it seems like everyone at least has some sort of an opinion about network marketing businesses, aka multi-level marketing or mlm. you have probably even had one pitched to you by someone in the past or maybe you have joined one before.
whatever your opinions or experiences might be, one thing remains a fact, and it is that network marketing is one of the easiest, fastest, and most popular ways for the average person to start a home business. there have been more millionaires made in this industry than in any other in history. if you are looking to get out on your own and start your path towards residual income and financial freedom in 2024, you might want to consider network marketing as one of the best ways to do it.
a word of caution though, you do need to be very careful when choosing a network marketing opportunity. there are plenty of great programs out there that are perfectly legitimate. but there are also a lot of scams, schemes, and other shady business practices going on in this industry. look past all the hype, watch for red flags, and do a lot of research before jumping into something.

freelance writing
these days just about everyone needs articles, blog posts, website content, information products, sales letters, press releases, and many other things written. however, not everyone is a good writer (most aren’t) or has time to do all the writing themselves, or maybe they just don’t want to do it. if you were to work at home as a freelance writer, you would have more jobs than you could handle as long as you were good at it. a great way to get started with this is to become a fiverr seller, and build up from there. this is another one that will continue to grow in 2024 and years after.
okay, there you have it, our top 9 online business ideas for 2024. as i said, it’s impossible to say what the absolute best is because everyone has their own needs and preferences. however, these are certainly among the best out there right now. hopefully one of them fits within your expertise and interests. if not, then get started learning the one that fits you most and you will be working from home as your own boss before you know it!
keep in mind / final thoughts…
one thing to keep in mind is that, even though an online business is relatively simple to start, it is still a real business and you need to treat it that way. make sure you form an llc or incorporate, or whatever is best for your particular situation (figure that out and do it). most of that can be learned and done through legalzoom or another similar service.
also, be sure to learn about the ins and outs of running a small business in general. make sure any paperwork you might need to file is done, figure out if there are any restrictions, licenses or permits needed, biz plan, taxes, etc… basically just get your ducks in a row. a great place to start for this is the small business administration.
i made the mistake of building my first internet based home business without doing those things, and i regret it to this day. it may not be the “fun stuff” but it’s worth doing, trust me. it’s better to be safe than sorry.
another thing you must remember is that no matter what home business opportunity or idea you choose, it will take a lot of time and hard work to build it. read that last sentence again because it is very important! the chances of you becoming successful in a month or two are slim to none. it rarely happens — no matter what some marketers try to make you believe. you must have patience and determination.
you need to be ready to put in a minimum of 6 months to a year, or even much longer, of consistent focused effort before you see any significant results. too many people think they can just hop on the internet or join some system and be rolling in the money quickly & easily. that’s simply not going to happen. if it were that easy everyone would do it and we’d all be rich. any business takes a lot of time and hard work to develop, but it absolutely can be done!
now you know the top home business opportunities in 2024, so get up off your butt and get started right away! you could be on the path to financial freedom this year.
