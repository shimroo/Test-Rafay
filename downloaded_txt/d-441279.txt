healing through
love 



									at mission of mercy, “healing through love” is primary in our mission. as we strive to heal someone – whether they are physically, spiritually, emotionally, or physically broken – we know that approaching that person with genuine love provides at least as much healing as the physical services we provide. at mission of mercy, our product is love. our vehicle is medicine.

						“what inspired me most is when i saw that the only clearance to come here is need. there’s no paperwork. there’s no qualification, and what’s dispensed here is not as much care as it is love and dignity for a fellow human being.”
