how to pitch your proposal
researchers are familiar with pitching their proposal to funding agencies, but what about industry? to help secure industry partnerships, this workshop will demonstrate how to form a slide deck or written pitch document that addresses the business case for your research. key questions and strategy will be shared to help you see your work from an industrial perspective.
