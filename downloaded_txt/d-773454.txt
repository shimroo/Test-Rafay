'best friend' memorial







"if tears could 
build a stairway,
and memories a 
lane,
i'd walk right up 
to heaven,
and bring you home 
again"


this site is a little piece of cyberspace devoted to some of 
our temporarily lost 'best friends'.
my inspiration to start this was the loss of one of my 
best friends, my beautifully perfect 4 year old sharpei; sharpy. 
while this site is geared towards our 'doggy' best friends, 
the stories and poems displayed throughout certainly apply to any of our lost 
'best friends'.
pages of inspirational works i run 
across or am submitted 
are displayed through the site.
i am also offering it up as a free place for anyone who wants 
a memorial, or remembrance, to their own lost loved ones. because of the nature of 
the site, i have no intentions of charging. if you are interested in 
making a permanent memorial to your lost best friend, email me
here. feel free to include a picture, 
and the words you want to say, and i will place 
it on the site. i will include your contact 
info on the page or not, at your request. if you have a .wav file you would like 
to play when your page is opened, include that too. you will have a 
place to log in and remember your loved one whenever you want, from wherever you 
want. you can also share thisÂ  address with any of your, or his/her, 
friends from his time on this earth.
you can additionally read through some of the other memorials, to 
realize that you are not alone in your grief.
sometimes in our hour of need, it is nice to sit back and read 
words of wisdom, that make us realize what this life is really all about.
