                    donate … to support us 
                    help us continue work in jerusalem!
                

the importance of strengthening our palestinian presence and maintain our
                        historical rights in jerusalem cannot be over-emphasized as the late faisal al-
                        husseini once put it: “the existence of palestinian organizations in jerusalem is
                        a reflection of the palestinian people’s existence.”
relying almost entirely on grants our resources are very limited. as an
                        institution located in east jerusalem we are subject to the israeli legal system
                        that in itself is a financial burden in terms of minimum wages, ancillary wage
                        costs, pension schemes, high rents, etc. - costs funders or donors are hardly
                        covering.
against all odds and monetary pressures, however, passia remains steadfast
                        in the city and committed to continue its longstanding work in dialogue, policy
                        research, education, information and publication, as well as its extensive
                        involvement in the question of jerusalem.
your donation will help passia to maintain its presence and voice in jerusalem
                        and sustain its work.
