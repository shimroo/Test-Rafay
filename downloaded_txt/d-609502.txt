act one is a christian community of entertainment industry professionals who train and equip storytellers to create works of truth, goodness and beauty.






as an educational and professional collective, act one trains, supports and provides opportunity for creative development to both emerging and established writers and producers.
 
during the initial, intensive writing and producing programs, christian content creators are provided the tools necessary to create works of beauty for worldwide audiences.
 
world-class, award-winning writers and producers guide our high-end, leading-edge programs and events and serve to support the life and careers of our professional alums.
 
in giving back to the entertainment industry, act one offers creative services that further promote our core values of truth, goodness and beauty.






truth
telling stories of authenticity and substance beckons the audience toward the eternal. the art we create can help people see the truth that lies behind it all.
“our truest response to the irrationality of the world is to paint or sing or write, for only in such response do we find truth.”  – madeline l’engle


goodness
exceeding the best practices of the industry in excellence, integrity, hard work, and a “no excuses” mentality. we guard the hearts and minds of our audience by guarding our own first.
“excellence is an art won by training. we are what we repeatedly do.”  – aristotle


beauty
mastering the craft of storytelling to move audiences through the radiance, wholeness, and harmony of beauty.
“in every heart there is a secret nerve that answers to the vibrations of beauty.” – christopher morley
