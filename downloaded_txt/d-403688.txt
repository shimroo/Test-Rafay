this website is devoted to the issues, journeys, images and stories of the sudanese diaspora. whilst the civil 
war in sudans south and west has forced many of the countrys inhabitants to flee across the world, there is 
still limited global awareness of the sudanese situation. 

sora strives to provide an internationally accessible centre for sudan-related research and to raise 
awareness in academic and wider circles of the hopes, struggles and realities of the sudanese people 
living outside sudan. 

sora is the sole sponsor of the sudan resource centre of australia.

sora invites you to be part of a revolution in global awareness.
