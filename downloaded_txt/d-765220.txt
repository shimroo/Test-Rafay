âstevieâs knowledge of fishing and fly casting is top notch, from the trout streams and loughs of his native ireland, to the salmon, steelhead and beauty of the wilds all over the world, his passion, enthusiasm and infectious humour make this guy one of the "must fish with" guides on the planet.â 
                    ian gordon. (world famous spey caster and scottish guide)
 
"i  had a great day thank you. later in the summer i'd like to get another day with  you, to spend some time learning about the entomology side of things, and  learning what flies to use at different times of the day and year - and fishing  as well obviously, i was fascinated by the way you predicted & identified  the hatch etc. and would like to be able to do that type of thing. i'll  certainly be recommending you and the sixmile water" 
                    nick price (england)
