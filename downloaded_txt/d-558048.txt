the two witnesses



the bible reveals two witnesses in the power and spirit of elijah will appear before the "great and dreadful day of the lord," and the new testament reveals two witnesses will display the same powers that shake the heavens and the earth like the fiery elijah did!  soon these two witnesses will command world attention from jerusalem, israel and testify against eu atrocities and comfort their captive audience with reassurances that our god will come and save us!

return to zion?





shalom  ilan, haveri! thank you for thinking of me. we've had an ice and snow  snow that came in last night and expect another tonight. my car door won't open. frozen shut. 
i  would love to visit my beloved land but probably can't for many  reasons: i'm a poor white boy (i'm a poor fellow getting ready to sell  my home and move with mom and her boyfriend doug to a nice home with my  own bedroom in the country). and my aids doctors said i'll probably be  dead and are in shock i'm not already and haven't gotten sick with  infectious diseases. blessed be god! what will be will be. i won't give up without a struggle.

love ya ilan,

david

the vatican versus the fourth commandment





 commentary: the vatican versus the fourth commandmentby wyatt ciesielka | saturday, february 12, 2011on january 25, pope  benedict xvi again proclaimed his desire "to ignite a fervent missionary  movement in the catholic church," stating he wants to advance "the  entire catholic church into a new missionary age" in 2011 (catholic.org,  january 28, 2011). while this movement will ultimately contribute to  fulfilling prophecies such as isaiah 47:8-9 and revelation 17:2-5, an  aspect of this rejuvenated "fervent missionary movement" already affects  billions. this is the growing emphasis on sunday observance. read more

god hates christmas!





 
jeremiah 10 condemns christmas    trees!

jeremiah 10
1 hear the word which the    lord speaks to you, o house of israel.
2 thus says the lord: 


“    do not learn the way of the    gentiles; 
do not be dismayed at the signs of heaven, 
for    the gentiles are dismayed at them. 
3 for the customs of the peoples are futile;    
for one cuts a tree from the forest, 
the work of the hands of the    workman, with the ax. 
4 they decorate it with silver and gold; 
they    fasten it with nails and hammers 
so that it will not topple. 
5 they    are upright, like a palm tree, 
and they cannot speak; 
they must be    carried, 
because they cannot go by themselves.
do not be afraid of    them, 
for they cannot do evil, 
nor can they do any good.” 
6    inasmuch as there is none like you, o lord 
(you are great, and your name    is great in might), 
7 who would not fear you, o king of the nations?    
for this is your rightful due. 
for among all the wise men of the    nations, 
and in all their kingdoms, 
there is none like you. 
8 but    they are altogether dull-hearted and foolish; 
a wooden idol is a worthless    doctrine. 
9 silver is beaten into plates; 
it is brought from tarshish,    
and gold from uphaz, 
the work of the craftsman 
and of the hands of    the metalsmith; 
blue and purple are their clothing; 
they are all the    work of skillful men.
10 but the lord is the true god; 
he is the living    god and the everlasting king. 
at his wrath the earth will tremble, 
and    the nations will not be able to endure his indignation. 

jeremiah 10    condemns idolatry, both in the letter and in the spirit, whether a physical    idol or an idolatrous tradition based upon heathen customs like the "christmas tree"    that history clearly exposes as pagan in origin. those who adorn their    christmas trees and remain in denial about its pagan origin, who play deaf,    dumb and blind to the facts, who attempt to dismiss or downplay how it's a    heathen custom, are living a    lie and shamefully reject the clear commandments of god that speak    against such spiritual adultery, mixing and matching pagan error with biblical    truth, and will suffer the consequences for being so dishonest and deceitful.    

pagan holidays like christmas and    pagan customs like christmas trees are both abominations to god.    true christians shun both, we avoid them like the plague, because we love god    more than idolatrous traditions of apostate men!

why i no longer celebrate    christmas

christmas is about giving -- says    who?

c.h. spurgeon on christmas and    roman catholicism

will god curse our countries for    christmas?
