excellence in dental education and care
the saint louis university center for advanced dental education (cade) has been called
                  the finest facility for advanced dental education in the world.
located in dreiling-marshall hall on the eastern end of slu's medical campus in midtown
                  st. louis, we house four state-of-the-art treatment clinics — orthodontics, endodontics,
                  periodontics and pediatric dentistry — as well as an imaging center that includes
                  cone beam 3d imaging. we prepare dentists to become astute and multidisciplinary clinicians
                  in the fields of orthodontics, endodontics, periodontics and pediatric dentistry.
                  our students learn how to provide excellent and compassionate care in state-of-the-art
                  facilities, including an 18-station technique lab, a large multimedia auditorium,
                  classrooms, libraries and labs.
our clinics, dental specialties of saint louis university, provide services for both
                  adults and children. we offer advanced care at a lower cost than traditional practices.
                  services include orthodontics (braces), endodontics (root canals), periodontics (gum
                  disease and implants) and pediatric dentistry (children). general dentistry services
                  are offered only in the pediatric dentistry program.
at the saint louis university center for advanced dental education (cade), we are
                  a community dedicated to fostering diversity and inclusion. this commitment extends
                  to our students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni. we recognize that a diverse
                  learning environment enriches our educational experience, enhances patient care, and
                  strengthens our campus community.
we are deeply committed to creating a civil and respectful community, embracing individual
                  and collective truths. our aim is to ensure an environment where every member, regardless
                  of age, citizenship, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, geographic
                  origin, language, marital status, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation,
                  or socioeconomic status, feels valued and respected.
