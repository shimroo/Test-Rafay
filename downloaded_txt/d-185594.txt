    the treehouses
  





























canoe the best of south carolina to your own woodland hideaway.















retreat to the largest private wildlife refuge on the edisto river, accessible only by canoe. we offer our guests unparalleled privacy and stunning views from world-class treehouses. paddle about 13 miles down the cypress-lined, blackwater edisto river to a private tree house nestled in the woods along the riverbank. relax in a rope hammock or on the dining deck, complete with an outdoor grill for cooking dinner, and fall asleep to the woodland lullaby of rustling trees, croaking frogs, and hooting owls. wake the next day to the sounds of morning wildlife song and chatter and prepare breakfast on the small gas stove before continuing downriver.an adventure awaits around the next bend!

"had a wonderful time with 4 girls on the river and staying in the large treehouse. paddling was easy except for a few narrow turns, and cool beaches to stop and swim. the treehouse had all the amenities for a place without water or electricity. little tea lights everywhere made it romantic. all the plates, pots and pans you needed, even a french press for coffee."

"thoroughly enjoyed staying in one of their treehouses. had a very easy and relaxing trip down the edisto river. carolina heritage outfitters was professional, easy to work with, and very responsive. they even returned an item to me that i lost on the trip after it turned up a couple weeks later. i would certainly recommend taking the plunge and giving a treehouse a go."

our storyfounded in 1989, carolina heritage outfitters is the original outfitter and the only treehouse camping on the edisto river in south carolina. owner chris burbulak and our cho crew invite you to call us or email us with any questions you may have about an adventure on the edisto. when you are floating down the edisto to your private overnight site, walking the edisto river refuge’s trails, or relaxing on the deck of your private treehouse, you are in a fragile ecosystem, an annual flood plain (thus treehouses). great blue herons, egrets, wood storks, pileated woodpeckers, wood ducks, wild turkeys, deer, muskrats, and raccoons are residents on the refuge. frogs and owls serenade.whether it’s a wilderness day trip canoeing through the cypress trees of the edisto or a relaxing and quiet stay in one of our three man-made treehouses, carolina heritage outfitters would love to have you as our guest.
