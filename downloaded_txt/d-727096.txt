frequently asked questions
browse our faq section for quick answers on all things water filtration.

+what does a water filter do?

a water filter removes impurities from your household water that you don't want in there. for e.g. chlorine, fluoride and many others. you can choose between a drinking water or mains water filter. one deals with just your drinking water and the other filters all the cold water coming into your house.

+why is water so important?

water gives us the gift of life and even though it provides us with no calorific or nutritive value is essential to our survival.
water is a vital component of our diet and most of us don't drink nearly enough, so try to up your water intake to at least 1.2 litres per day, which is around eight 150ml glasses. tea, coffee and alcohol dehydrate the body, so we need to drink more water to compensate.
water transports oxygen, nutrients, minerals, dissolved salts and trace elements around our body. it helps detoxify us by flushing out impurities. water helps maintain our correct body temperature which is generally accepted to range from 36.1c to 37.2c. it helps dispose of body waste. water alleviates constipation. it helps our kidneys function, which is why it's important to urinate or empty the bladder regularly to avoid infections and other illnesses. water cures dehydration, so if you're feeling thirsty that's a good sign that you need to go and grab a glass of water. it helps our endocrine glands function. water helps the body convert food into energy. it supports every organ in the body. you can't live without water. well, you might survive for three to five days before your body shuts down.

+do i choose a mains water filter or a drinking water filter?

buying a drinking water filter or mains water filter (sometimes called a tap water filter) can be a challenge as there are so many domestic water filters on the market. the most significant question you can ask yourself before you buy one of our water filter systems is what do you want to change about your water? this is definitely the question we ask the most to anyone who contacts us.
if you're absolutely sure what you need then enjoy browsing around our online shop, using the product search to find the exact water filter you want to purchase.
but, if you're unsure what you want to filter out of your mains or drinking water, that's where our expertise and guidance come in. either call us on 01352 838 281, or send us a message.
you're in safe hands with fountain filters.
we have a range of drinking water filters and mains water filters to suit an array of spaces, styles and budgets.

+how can an under sink water filter help you?

there are a multitude of benefits to installing a drinking water filter or mains water filter in your home.
here's just a few of those benefits.

filtered water 'on tap'- we're always being told to ditch the carbonated drinks that are full of sugar and drink more water. when you're committed to drinking more water, you may as well have it 'on tap' so that you and your family can reap the benefits and enjoy filtered water all day every day without the hassle of having to run to the local shop to buy expensive bottled water. trust us when we say that installing a drinking water filter is one of the most convenient and cost effective health and wellness investments you'll make.
your food tastes better - when you prepare fruit, vegetables, meat and fish that's been rinsed and cooked in filtered water you'll notice the difference in taste. think about it for a second or two; if you can smell chlorine in your water, it's going to have an impact on that wonderful dish you're creating.
scum; be gone! - it's so annoying and unpleasant when you have a layer of scum floating on top of your tea. if you live in a hard water area you'll know what we mean. good news is that you can filter the lime scale out of your water with a drinking water filter or mains water filter that's specifically designed for hard water.
your skin, hair and weight will thank you - if you don't drink enough water your body holds onto water causing fluid retention. often when we feel hungry it can be a sign of thirst - so instead of reaching for food, drink water first and then see how better you feel.
you'll have more money - a drinking water filter cartridge can last up to 12 months and this will cost you far less than buying expensive bottled water. we've had a quick look at some of the cheapest bottled water available and worked out how much it will cost you per day, week, month and year. our figures are based on an individual drinking the recommended 2 litres of water per day. remember, that there's often more than one person in a household so multiply the annual figure to get your true household figure.
less waste - the use of plastic is currently a very hot topic. installing a drinking water filter or mains water filter means you'll generate less unnecessary plastic waste, which means less hassle for you and less plastic going into landfill.

the quality of your water can be impaired in several ways, with coliforms, yeasts, viruses, nitrates, lead, legionella; to name but a few. it is highly unlikely that your water will contain any of these substances, unless you live in a house with lead pipes! however, if you have a private water supply it's possible that your water may be impaired, which is why it's so important to have your water tested so that you can take preventative action to remove any risk of infection.
installing a mains water filter or drinking water filter is incredibly easy.
you can filter out whatever you want from your water which gives you control over the quality of the water you're drinking. it means that you can enjoy filtered water that tastes and smells great and is free of any one of the following - chlorine, fluoride, heavy metals, bacteria, chemicals, lime scale and so much more.
you know how you want your water to taste and it's comforting to know that if you don't like the taste of your water or what's in it that you have the option to improve it by installing a drinking water filter or mains water filter.
problems that you have with your water can be solved and we're here to help.

+how do i remove fluoride from my water?

there are no taste and odour issues but there is much debate about the benefits to teeth and the toxic nature of the fluoride dosed.
however, fluoride is only an issue if your water supplier doses it in to your water and if you do not want it.
fluoridation is not currently done at a nationwide level but the situation keeps changing with more areas being fluoridated.
firstly, do you have an issue with fluoride in your water?
secondly, if you do have an issue, is your water fluoridated? your local health authority or water supply company will be able to tell you - your doctor's surgery ought to be able to give you a contact phone number.
if you want to remove the fluoride, the oyster fluoride water filter is for you.
if your water is not fluoridated at the moment but becomes so, the cartridge for fluoride will fit the housings of the pearl and oyster models so you can always upgrade later if needs be.

+reverse osmosis or ro systems

you've probably come across a reverse osmosis or ro system when searching the internet for filtration of water ideas in your home. have a look at our reverse osmosis page where we discuss the pros and cons of reverse osmosis systems and where ro water is generally used. 







do water filters work?

an expert insight. the short answer is a resounding yes. otherwise, we’d all be drinking infected water and getting ill very frequently, just as people did years ago.
