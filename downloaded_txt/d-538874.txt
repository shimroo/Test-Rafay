peta2 swear jars?"swear jars" are a fascinating to me. basically, you put money in there each time you swear. and we figured that we might as well help you save up some money for a good cause while giving you an incentive to keep the profanity out of your vocabulary. your parents and teachers will probably love it, too!the way this works is as follows:1. print out this label, cut it out, and tape it onto a jar or container.2. set the swear jar in your kitchen, living room, classroom, car, or wherever you think it's likely to be useful!3. drop a dollar (or more) into the jar every time you swear. encourage your family and friends to participate, too!4. once the jar is full, use that money towards a good cause. some suggestions include becoming a peta2 donor or treating yourself to an animal rights t-shirt or hoodie!5. once you do that, keep it going. there's nothing but good that can come from this, so let's make it happen!if you have any pictures of you and your swear jar, send them along to streetteam@peta2.com and we'll give you a bunch of street team points just for trying it out.and yes, i realize you can swear up a storm on purpose if you just want an excuse to fill your jar ... that's up to you!   -pulin

peta2 sticker cake!check out this super cute and delicious looking vegan cake that peta2 street teamer melissa made!melissa told us that she and her best friend have a tradition where they make one another a birthday cake as a birthday gift, and that since she and her friend are both vegans, she of course made it vegan! she chose to use the golden vanilla cake recipe from vegan cupcakes take over the world (for other vegan cake ideas, check this out). melissa topped the cake off with a lemon butter cream frosting (vegan, of course) that she added raspberries to for that lovely pink color.i absolutely love that she got creative with her peta2 stickers to decorate the cake by taking two of the same sticker and sticking a toothpick between them. the cake definitely sent a strong message to the rest of the party!what kind of animal rights message would you like to add to the top of a delicious cake?   ♥ marta

bunnies drowned at petland - warning: disturbing image!this image was taken in the back room of a petland store in akron, ohio, and posted on facebook by elizabeth carlisle.  she can be seen grinning as she holds two dead, soaking-wet rabbits by the scruff of the neck—rabbits she just drowned while working at petland.when asked by a facebook friend if she drowned the rabbits, she replied "[t]he manager took the pic for me. [s]he reminded me that there were people outside as [i] was swearing at them to just hurry up and die but then she was so kind as to take this picture."  she has also stated that rabbits in the store were allowed to "attack and eat each other." the bunnies suffered from "deep wounds all over," "an eye missing," what petland staff "suspected was a broken jaw," and paralysis from the waist down.the store has closed, following our complaint, but peta investigations have revealed time and time again that companies that breed and sell animals are concerned about profits, not animals' well-being.please take a moment to send petland a message, asking the company to end all rabbit sales immediately, by clicking here!   -ryan!

|gorilla biscuits - "start today"]warped tour is still in full effect, and we couldn't be more stoked. not only is warped a time where we can see awesome bands and hang out with our friends, but it's also a good opportunity to check out some organizations out there that are trying to make the world a better place.when we heard that our good friend (and vegetarian!) heidi minx, got a chance to sit down with one our favorite bands, the a.k.a.s to talk about making a difference for inked magazine's "inked for a cause" column—we were so excited! not only is heidi the mastermind designer behind franky & minx and punk rock domestics, but she also makes a positive impact with her own non-profit group, built on respect.who better to interview about this topic than the a.k.a.s' vocalist?  mike ski has worked with multiple causes like warped eco initiative, filter for good, invisible children, and us here at peta2. my favorite part of this interview is when mike mentions that if he could choose one thing to tell one person to do on a daily basis to make the world a better place, it would be to go vegetarian!  find out why, and hear mike talk about our "animal testing breaks hearts" campaign in the video below.what do you do to make the world a better place?

being a jewish veganhere's a special guest post from my fellow peta2 staffer and cookbook co-author starza about being jewish and vegan. enjoy!-martai was raised jewish and my family kept a kosher household—that's right, we had "meat" plates and "dairy" plates that had to be kept separate, and you couldn't eat meat if the meal had dairy and vice versa. because of this, my brother and i would often fantasize about cheeseburgers, pepperoni pizza, and what would happen if we secretly ate steak on a "dairy" plate.i decided to go vegetarian a few months after my bat mitzvah because i didn't want animals to suffer for my meals. i found out that veganism was automatically kosher because there's no worry about whether or not a meal had meat or dairy in it. on top of that, i could eat "cheese" burgers and "pepperoni" pizza by using their faux alternatives. i even ventured out and made the most un-kosher-but-kosher-because-it's-vegan snack i could think of—"ham" roll-ups—which were crazy delicious! there's a recipe for them in peta's vegan college cookbook which i'm also sharing with you here, so that you too can experience their koshery goodness!sham "ham" roll-upsyou've always wanted to make something with chives because they sound fancy—admit it.1 (8-ounce) container vegan cream cheese1 tablespoon chopped chivessalt and pepper, to taste1 (5.5-ounce) package vegan ham deli slicesmix the cream cheese, chives, salt, and pepper together. spreadthe mixture on the deli slices and roll up. use a toothpick tohold together.makes 4 servings.if you're curious about vegetarianism, judaism, and how they are related, check out this article. it explains how the act of being vegetarian is a mitzvah (good deed) and a form of tzedakah (charitable giving)—something all jews are required to practice on a regular basis.so there you go, yet another reason why being vegetarian rocks. i know my bubbe would be proud!shalom!-starza

it's never too late to help elephantsfrom a front page story in the new york daily news to coverage on cnn and articles on the world's most popular blogs, including perez hilton, our new ringling bros. investigation has been capturing attention around the globe—awakening the world to the abuses behind the scenes in the "saddest show on earth!"this much needed attention and call to action against ringling's routine beatings of elephants with bullhooks is a huge step towards ending the cruelty once and for all, but there is still more we can do. we must keep the pressure on the elephant-beating circus so that one day these elephants can roam free in a spacious sanctuary rather than continue to live a sad, painful, and fear-ridden life with shackles around their legs and bullhooks dug into their skin.please write to the usda now and demand they seize ringling's elephants. if you've already done this, please share this information with your friends and family.also, please remember that if you attend any circus that uses animals, you are supporting the suffering we documented inside ringling. please, don't attend animal circuses.thanks!   -pulin
