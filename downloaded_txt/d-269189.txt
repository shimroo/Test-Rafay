 how to write sf 


the craft of writing science fiction that sells by ben bova, best-selling author and six-time hugo award winner for best editor.  (this is one of the books your ol' critter captain learned from himself, and i highly recommend it.)
(also via amazon) new book from a critter member 

**now in 
print edition
too!** awesome new book,
how to improve your speculative fiction openings,
from a critter member who's unearthed a shard of the secret
to becoming a pro writer. really good piece of work.
"...if you're at all concerned about story openings, you'd be nuts not to read what qualkinbush has to say."  —wil mccarthy, author of bloom and the collapsium






 what is the critters workshop?

critters is a member of the critique.org family of on-line workshops/critique groups, and is for serious writers of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. you get your work critiqued in exchange for critiquing the work of others, both of which are invaluable ways to improve your writing. it's run by andrew burt, former vice-president of sfwa and his army of software minions. critters is free (except for the work of doing critiques!) and funded by donations; if you find critters useful, donations are appreciated .

 check out
a more detailed description
of critters and
what it's like
to send a manuscript through the workshop.
our mission is to achieve
a high level of participation in giving critiques
on short stories, novel chapters, and entire
novels in the genres of science fiction, fantasy,
and horror.  the focus is on providing timely,
helpful critiques.  our rules
are what make this work.
 (and a steady hand on the tiller from 
the critter captain.)


 note to pro writers 
professional sf/f/h authors are most welcome, and we have many in the
group.  for one critique a month, voting sfwa/hwa members get immediate
reviews of their work.  if you don't mind a little humorous coaxing,
drop in here.
