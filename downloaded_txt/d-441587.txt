who are 
				the sunday bladers?
the sunday bladers is an 
informal social group that
enjoys more than just rollerblading. we blade 
at various locations around the tampa - st. 
petersburg metro area. every sunday is a new adventure from tarpon springs to 
longboat key, from st. petersburg to orlando. we usually blade 10-12 miles in 
the summer and 12-20 miles in the cooler months. read our 
faq page for more information.
 

brunch afterwards always
everyone is responsible for 
their own safety! safety gear is always recommended and worn by most of the 
group.
 

great company | fresh 
	air | exercise | brunch
>> check out our 
faq page, last 
sunday's skate pictures, 
				our photo archive, or our

>> a very special thanks to those who have 

sponsored the sunday blade website.
