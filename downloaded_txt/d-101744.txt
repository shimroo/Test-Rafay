trans-siberia railway – my personal journeys on the trans-siberia railway.

































trans-siberia



all you need to know about the trans-siberian railway and the countries it passes through. this is based on my own personal experience, my interest of traveling trans-siberia and advice from other travellers and travel agents.
i have travelled the journey four times. jan 2008 i travelled trans-manchurian which included dog sledding and the harbin ice festival allowing me to take some great photos. in july 2005 i travelled mainly mongolia using the trans-mongolia route. in 2004 i took the full trans-siberian from moscow to vladivostock and in 1997 i took the trans-mongolian from beijing to moscow.
whether you are finding out about the trans-siberian railway or planning to travel this on this fantastic journey, i aim to provide all the information you need including carefully selected tours, recommended books, advice and much more.
if you have travelled on this wonderful journey and have a good story, advice or photo to share, please let me know. i am also always on the look out for recommended tours, travel agents and hotels.
don’t forget to have at look at my photo gallery. why not send me your best photo. if it is suitable and has a good story i may publish it.
sadly the trans-siberia railway is not fully open to tourists at the moment. hope it will come back soon.
