using wireshark to solve real-world network problems
by chris sanders

i found this an easy read and it does a great job of taking you into the world of packet sniffing using wireshark.virtually serving virtual servers  (king, mikel) 200711
while just about every major vendor has developed a server virtualization product, often the open source varieties are treated like heirloom tomatoes; overlooked for whatever reason that may be. that is until you accidentally have one and wonder how you could have been living without it for so long. since i have already covered how to run freebsd as a guest operating system under vmware i thought it was worth an analysis of the virtualization technology built into freebsd.

i have written the subsequent article discussing freebsd jails, which i hope to be both informative as well as entertaining. additionally, i intend to utilize the article as a reference for future articles and discussions.

now without further ado, please follow the url to the article.

an introduction to kernel hacking
by joseph kong
isbn-10 1-59327-142-5
isbn-13 978-1-59327-142-8

this book seemingly overwhelming at first, as the reviewer michael hernandez admitted, is an intense trip through the land of kernel hacking. this is a handy lead by example and certainly well worth your time if you've ever been remotely interested in delving deeper under the hood of the bsd kernel.
