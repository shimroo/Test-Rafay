press release - "finding beauty"on her first album of all-original material, the tony-nominated singer-songwriter duets with melissa manchester, kurt elling, tierney sutton, and others.
los angeles, ca (august 21, 2023) â tony-nominated, multiplatinum-selling pop/jazz singer-songwriter ann hampton callaway will release her new album, finding beauty, originals volume 1, on sept. 29 via shanachie entertainment. comprised of 16 sumptuous tracks, immaculately produced and arranged by trey henry and paul viapiano for the chemistry set, finding beauty is a milestone for callaway â recently inducted into the women songwriters hall of fame â in that itâs her first album to feature all-original songs.

âthis is my most personal record,â callaway says. âthroughout my career, iâve loved singing the great jazz classics and selections from the great american songbook, but iâve always snuck my original songs on various projects. the pandemic made me think, âi donât know if iâll live through this, but if i do, whatâs at the top of my bucket list?â and i realized that i wanted to tell my story and share the deepest part of me. what better way than by sharing and singing songs iâve written?âclick here to read the full release.

"ann hampton callaway is an iconic singer-songwriter-musician who actually does have a personal life, even though it seems impossible, given the amount of time that she spends dedicated to the production of art. she is constantly touring with a selection of different shows, to places and clubs far and near. she has reached multitudes of fans through her various social media platforms. she records and releases new material on a regular basis. and when she shows up, she really delivers. in the spring ann played a week of sold-out peggy lee shows at 54 below and in the fall she returned to broadway's living room with her sister, liz callaway, with their all-new sister act. industrious, indefatigable, and always the most fascinating woman in the room, ann hampton callaway is a treasure to the worlds of music, live entertainment, and art. she has stood out in this writer's mind all year and staked a forever claim on my heart. she will be back at 54 below on january 15th with fever: a peggy lee celebration and sings the 70's and, again, on march 2nd with amanda mcbroom in divalicious. ann hampton callaway is a mistress of creation and we are all the lucky benefactors of her artistry." - stephen mosher

dear friends,

during the pandemic i started my dial-a-diva program to offer new ways to share my talents to keep the celebration going and be musically inspired. now that touring is coming back, i will be more selective on how much i can take on but since i enjoyed it so much here are the offerings:


1. if you would like me to write you a song for you, for someone you love, for a special occasion, or for a cause, let me know and we can discuss how to make this work.
2. if you are an educator in a music department and would like me to give a masterclass in song interpretation, arranging songs and making them your own, the music business, songwriting or improvisation, i'd be very interested in doing zoom classes with your students. i love seeing the potential in people and helping them to dig deeper and shine.
3. if you have a special occasion and would like me to give you, your friends and family a private zoom concert with requests or a theme that is meaningful to you, i am your diva.
4. want a specially priced offering to celebrate an occasion or the one
you love? i am now offering to make up improvs to your grocery list of
words and phrases or sing a favorite well known song. both come with
spoken dedications to your loved ones and will be uploaded to youtube
unlisted, so you will have the link to share with friends and family.
put your request in now for this very special offer!
for more details and pricing please contact my manager brett steele, steele management  at (727) 420-1547 brett@steelemgmt.net
