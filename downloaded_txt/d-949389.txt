education is in a state of crisis.


recruitment and retention of teachers remains a serious struggle, reaching record-breaking levels. in collier county, our educators face substantial challenges within the classrooms. nearly 64% of collier county public school students are “economically needy.” of the students enrolled in our student programs, 89% come from households living at or below poverty level.
poverty-related factors negatively affect a student’s ability to learn and succeed in school. champions for learning has built an effective array of programs to combat this crisis, preventing the perpetuation of poverty by investing in the future of collier’s students and educators.
