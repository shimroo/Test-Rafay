"mixed signals in u.s. life expectancy rebound





the latest cdc report reveals a partial rebound in u.s. life expectancy, rising to 77.5 years in 2022, with covid-19 deaths contributing to the positive trend. however, experts express concerns, noting a slower recovery than peer nations. the washington post reports that chronic illnesses, including heart disease and obesity, continue to impact longevity. the report highlights a decade of stagnation since 2010, emphasizing the need for comprehensive health initiatives. racial and ethnic disparities persist, underscoring the ongoing challenges. while the increase is a positive step, the u.s. faces a complex path to fully overcoming the impacts of the pandemic and addressing underlying health issues.

cheney's undisclosed location disclosed





"could there be a better visual metaphor for the change of administration?" -- gawkerthe very day former vice president dick cheney moved out of the official veep residence at the naval observatory, google maps posted an unobstructed view of the place.  they'd kept the place all fuzzy for years -- depending on aerial and satellite pictures from the us geological survey.back in 2005, the new york times' maureen dowd noted:the vice president, who believes in unwarranted, unlimited snooping, is so pathologically secretive that if you use google earth's database to see his official residence, the view is scrambled and obscured. you can view satellite photos of the white house, the pentagon and the capitol - but not of the lord of the underworld's lair.no undisclosed location for vp joe biden.

abortion funding football





president reagan created it, president clinton rescinded it, president george w. bush reinstated it, president obama re-rescinded it...getting dizzy?it's something called "the mexico city policy" -- effectively a u.s. mandated gag rule on abortion. in short, if foreign outfits want u.s. aide for family planning services, they have to agree to not talk about abortion with clients or patients. it's been that way for the last 8 years.president obama has eliminated the requirement with an executive order -- on the anniversary of the roe v. wade decision.

a quarter million down the toilet





think $800 toilet seats from the 80s were a sign of government waste?  you should check out the whole toilet at the interior department.  nearly a quarter million bucks spent on secretary dick kempthorne's (pictured) powder room.  from al kamen in the washington post:"seems kempthorne spent about $235,000 in taxpayer funds renovating the bathroom a few months ago, which included installing a new shower, a refrigerator and a freezer and buying monogrammed towels...."not quite the primitive privies you find in the national parks under interior's purview.
