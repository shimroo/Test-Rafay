greetings from all the masons in the bluegrass state
most worshipful mitchell a. may
grand master 2024-2025
the over 30,000 masons of kentucky welcome you to the grand lodge of kentucky free and accepted masons site.
although masonry has been in kentucky over 200 years, this represents one of the few public appearances in any media other than individual stories about the many philanthropic endeavors of our lodges and affiliated organizations. it is not that we want to be secretive, but our tradition is to not be flamboyant or advertise our good works. it is our hope that this site will serve to remove some of the shroud of mystery associated with masonry. any suggestions you have to make it more valuable will certainly be appreciated.
are you interested in pursuing membership? the basic criteria for membership is:
• a belief in god
• believe in the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man
• male and at least 18 years old
• be a resident of kentucky
• be recommended by 2 members of the lodge
• receive a unanimous ballot for membership
there is one little known aspect of petitioning for membership of which you should be aware. you will not be asked to become a member. masons in kentucky do not solicit for membership, we wait for the man to ask for a petition.
  
grand lodge programs donations
your donations to the grand lodge programs funds.  such as relief fund, masons helping masons fund, veterans fund, scholarship fund, these funds help masons, youth, families who are in need.  if have questions about any of these funds, please contact our grand master, grand lodge officers, grand secretary or grand treasurer.  your donations are not tax deductible.  please click on the button “donate” and you will be able to make a donation with most major credit cards. thank you for your donations to these brethren and their families!
