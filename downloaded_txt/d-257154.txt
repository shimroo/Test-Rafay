the woerner family began farming in 1915 with produce and dairy. gradually moving more of their operations to natural turfgrasses, the woerners opened their first retail location in pensacola, fl in 1979 and soon became an industry leader in the production of sod.
today, we’re proud to maintain that legacy by providing fresh sod, top-rated landscaping materials and superior customer service to our valued commercial and residential customers across the nation.
