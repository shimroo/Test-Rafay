i’ve wanted to be a novelist since i was a tween. back then, i loved reading stories about glamorous women with dazzling lives and loves. the older i got, the more i realized that the rocky times, hot-mess moments, and life hiccups – and having the sheer badassery to overcome it all – these are the most glamorous parts of a woman. my characters wear them proudly.enjoy!
