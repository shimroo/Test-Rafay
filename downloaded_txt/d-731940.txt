preowned 
        items for sale:



 






 
  
    
 

as 
        the name says, all of our stock has been previously owned, but not necessarily 
        used.  many items were purchased, put on the shelf waiting to 
        be built, only to be sold to make room for something new.
 all 
        items listed are in stock 
        and sold on a first come, first served basis.  the lists are 
        updated weekly and we continue to add items as soon as they arrive. 

all 
        items are sold in an "as is" condition and the description is 
        as detailed and as accurate as possible.  none of the items 
        carry any manufacturer's warranty and our only warranty is if you are 
        dissatisfied in any way, carefully pack the item along with your name, 
        address, item number and price you paid.  return the item to 
        us within ten days for a full refund (less shipping) on that item.  simple!
you can shop in confidence at preowned trains.com.

        we hope you'll have fun looking for those rare or hard-to-find or just 
        simply "lower-than-new" cost items that will build your railroad empire.
