agua dulce
agua dulce literally menas sweet water, a testament to its sweetness. looking on the old picture it seems that an american soldier reunited and took a shower at the agua dulce artesian well and the road at the right is now known as agua dulce street of today. this artesian well was struck by an american bomb during the fil-american war in the early 1900's, it served hundred of gallons to their army infantry and because it had a taste of sweeteness the residents called it agua dulce. this is also the only source of clean and drinkable water for the whole ormoc during the flash flood of november 5, 1991 since then, up to now, the water is freely flowing but only two valves are working and serving ormocanons for drinking and other needs for it.
