welcome
i am a paleomammalogist; i study the evolution of mammals over geologic time using living mammals and the fossil record. i am mainly interested in the evolution of south american mammals. south america has a rich fossil record and was geographically isolated for most of the past 66 million years. this makes it an excellent place to investigate topics such as mammal adaptation, diversification, and community ecology.

homepage-center, research, research projects 


i use a variety of approaches to study evolution and adaptation in extinct mammals, particularly those of south america. i frequently draw on information from living mammals from throughout the world to determine how these extinct species lived and interacted with one another. much of this is research is collaborative and involves colleagues and/or students.

fieldwork (fossils)

october 12, 2014


homepage-center, research, research projects 


my fieldwork mainly aims to increase geographic and temporal (time interval) sampling within south america. most terrestrial mammal fossils from south america come from the southern part of the continent (particularly argentina). therefore, my colleagues and i have focused our efforts on other areas, such as bolivia, chile, and peru. some of these localities have […]

i specialize in notoungulate systematics but have published studies on a variety of other south american mammals. representative publications on various groups are summarized below with links to their full citations. notoungulates: much of my research has focused typothere notoungulates, which include interatheres, archaeohyracids, mesotheres, and hegetotheres. many of these papers have described new species and/or […]





 

paleobiology

homepage-center, paleobiology, research projects 


understanding how extinct mammals lived is what attracted me to the field of paleontology in the first place. living mammals encompass an amazing diversity of lifestyles and adaptations that are even greater when extinct species are included. paleobiological studies aim to reconstruct the characteristics and habits of these species. this can be particularly challenging for […]





 

macroecology

homepage-center, macroecology, research projects 


macroecology means different things to different people. for me, it encompasses  more synthetic studies that try to answer questions of broad interest in paleontology. such studies frequently raise as many questions as they answer, but continue to refine our understanding of past communities. because south america was effectively an island for much of the past […]

homepage, south american fossil mammals 


do you know what a notoungulate is? how about an astrapothere, a necrolestid, or a sparassodont? these are just a few of the fascinating mammals that once called south america home. unfortunately, these and many other ancient south american mammals left no living descendants and have no close living relatives. as a result, they are […]





 

new mammal species

homepage, research, research projects, systematics 


one of the primary goals of field research is to document new species occurrences: a species new to science or remains of a species where they haven’t been found before. most people think that naming a new species is the ultimate paleontological prize. although finding and naming new species is an exciting and important part […]
