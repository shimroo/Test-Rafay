at the beginning of february, chelsea school launched a new wednesday enrichment program to bring performing arts and creative experiences to our students for the second semester of the 2021-2022 school year. the purpose behind this project is twofold: to provide our teachers with additional time to plan for their classes, and to provide our students with a social-emotional and creative outlet in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic and virtual learning.
to accomplish this, chelsea school has partnered with local groups to provide enrichment classes in playwriting, improvisational comedy, coding, hip hop dance, drama, spoken word poetry, filmmaking, and step dance. students will participating in two of these groups each wednesday for nine weeks, after which they will move to new classes. the response from students has been very positive.
“i’m really enjoying the opportunity to be creative and express myself,” said a chelsea school sophomore. “i didn’t think that i would like this as much as i do.”
one of the most troubling impacts of the pandemic on students was social isolation and the amount of time spent away from their peers in face-to-face social situations. chelsea school’s administrators are hoping that this enrichment program will help to foster better socialization for our students.
“our students need to be able to express themselves,” said kristal weems-bradner, head of school. “these enrichment classes give them a space to do just that. we are hoping that this will not only allow them to become more comfortable working in a group, but will also help them to build confidence.”
