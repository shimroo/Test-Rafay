gnaeus domitius corbulo, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gnaeus_domitius_corbulo:


the emperor nero, highly fearful of corbulo’s reputation, ordered him to commit suicide, which the general carried out faithfully, exclaiming “axios” (meaning “i am worthy”) and fell on his own sword.

ios 17 and podcast app – still being a pain 
posted on 2023/09/19 |  by adam 


i’ve been using the podcast app since it was part of itunes, etc. i consistently have this fun problem where old episodes randomly show up as new – but today is a new, fun issue.

this is “up first”, a daily podcast from npr. my work computer says that this is the latest episode, which would be correct. but when i play it, it’s playing the content from yesterday – a longer, more in depth episode on a single topic, not the usual 5-10 min review of what happened overnight. not what i want. 
if this was just happening to one show, i could see going thru the process of troubleshooting (which usually includes deleting the podcast and then having to re-mark 2+ years of episodes as played), but it’s happening to 4 podcasts that i’m aware of.

and listen. 
someone tried to send me a fax, apparently.

“all the photos from 9/11 are powerful, some much more than others. i have acollection of photos, links, thoughts, etc from 9/11 when i was trying to make sense of it all – and among them is this and one other “falling” photo. i forget they are  on my website until i go looking for something and find the folder, simply named “wtc”, silently waiting for me to click on it, which i occasionally do to reflect on what happened.”
