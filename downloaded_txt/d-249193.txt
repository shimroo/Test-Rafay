700 years in the making
park history 





in 1978, mesa verde national park was named a unesco world heritage site in recognition of its exceptional archaeological relevance. protecting thousands of archaeological sites, including hundreds of cliff dwellings, mesa verde national park is perched high in southwest colorado where the air is thin, the history is rich, and the views are spectacular.
