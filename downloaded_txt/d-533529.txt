floating or stationary docks


stationary docks (piers) are supported at a fixed height above water level by posts at each juncture of modules. they remain at the same level regardless of water fluctuations. stationary docks are appropriate for many ponds, lake docks, rivers, and more where water levels don’t fluctuate too much during active season and bottoms are not too deep or soft.
floating docks are buoyant and rise and lower as the water level changes.  they are used where water fluctuations are higher, for excess muck or boggy bottom conditions, with greater depths or slope, or where desired by preference.

open tread or solid decking


mod-u-dock’s standard solid decking is a high-quality, marine-grade, uv-inhibited pvc. it has a lifetime residential warranty and a 20-year commercial warranty guaranteeing that it will not peel, rot, blister, rust, flake, chip, crack, corrode, pit, or abnormally discolor under normal use. it has a luxurious and sporty cross-hatch pattern on a solid background.
like the solid decking, the open tread is maintenance-free, slip-resistant, and stays cool in hot temperatures. the open tread is uv-inhibited polypropylene. it is even a little lighter than the standard solid decking planks. it has an open web chevron pattern which allows sunlight and waves to pass through, minimizing storm surge where applicable and allowing light to pass through.
our decking comes in khaki in addition to white, tan, and gray.

 great product from mod-u-dock.  pier was built with excellent craftsmanship.  they even made a custom piece for the pier that fit perfectly.  erik, sarah and the entire team were great to work with.  obviously, the customer experience is front and center at this company.  pier is very solid and looks awesome on the lake.
overall, very pleased with the entire experience.
