hey guys! i'm back & fresh as a daisy. there's a new layout (yeah, i know, i'm hopeless at layouts) and new user info. everything's supposed to be aligned to the centre, but on my computer my posts are squished to the left. i'm told that's just my computer being evil, so hopefully it looks right on yours.♥

oh my gawd. i have all but abandoned my poor icon journal. i've been spending too much time on deviantart x__x. i've kind of lost my touch, and i would say i don't really like this batch, but it's a beatles batch and my brain won't allow me to connect "the beatles" and "bad" in the same sentence. the images were taken from my sister's personal trove, so they're mostly john & paul. not that i'm complaining.36 the beatles iconsteasers:    ( i'd be quite prepared for that eventualitycollapse )
