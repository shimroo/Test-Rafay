» i strive to find beauty in the imperfect. «

  









  









 

stina persson has done work for iconic brands like veuve clicquot, louis vuitton, and vogue nippon.i’m inspired by digitally unaltered art, where you can see the paper, the marks of the maker. when i work, i strive to find beauty in the imperfect.she works with watercolor, ink, collage, and typography to create content for print, animation and film. hand drawn, hand painted, cut and glued, and when necessary, digitally enhanced. working as a commercial illustrator i have learned to adapt to various clients and projects, while still honoring the core of my own style. 




























































































stina fuses the traditional with the edgy to introduce a modern look to illustration — a look that is appreciated by numerous clients.different projects demands different styles, and finding the suitable one is something i really enjoy. sometimes my work needs to be bright and colorful whereas other projects call for the power of a black ink line on white paper.so what would be some favorite projects or clients?i just finished working with the mccartney family on a linda mccartney cookbook which was fun, as i got to draw food and animals. i also recently worked with iconic brand bally and patriksson group and their brilliant creative director johan svensson. intense, creative collaborations — that’s what’s best about this job!
