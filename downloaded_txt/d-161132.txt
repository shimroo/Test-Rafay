what others are saying









sybil keefe
tip tam deserves a 10 star rating! amazing staff, great sites with some space to enjoy yourself, great amenities, and convenient! our trip was supposed to be 2 nights, but we arrived early and stayed extra for a total of 5 nights.








james albert
hands down one of the friendliest most accommodating resorts. always clean and very kid friendly. we travel the country every summer and have found it to be one of the best places to spend a night, weekend or longer.








jason dicampello
tip tam was such a nice place to stay. my family and i have been camping for years and this was by far above and beyond what we have experienced over the years. the staff was unbelievably kind and so family oriented.
