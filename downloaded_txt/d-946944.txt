katrina adams is the first black woman and youngest person to ever lead the the u.s. tennis association, and chair the u.s. open. recently she came to milwaukee to speak with the milwaukee tennis & education foundation to promote her book, own the arena, and encourage kids in the game she loves to become leaders.



the milwaukee tennis and education foundation is doing some amazing things, providing tennis training along with critical life skills that will lead city youth to success.



mtef in the news! 



the milwaukee tennis and education foundation is making tennis more accessible for the greater milwaukee community. 



check out a cute highlight reel from summer 2024 at merrill park in partnership with mke rec. 














from the njtl network’s founding by arthur ashe in 1969 to fifty year’s later, learn how mtef is working with milwaukee’s youth on and off the court.



tennis program teaches inner-city youth life skills, on and off the court.















“...quite honestly that program does not even begin to compare with mtef! my kids loved it so much they want to go to both sessions next summer and participate in the school year program and possibly do the fall lessons. i love your organization and program and can only speak in superlatives regarding it.”





“it was great!! we feel very lucky to have gotten a spot. it was wonderful for my son for health, social skills, and confidence building.”




what mtef parents say about our summer program!!




“thank you for keeping the camp affordable, it makes it easier to register all 3 kids. i wanted them to have fun, be active, have something to do during the summer break.”





“ i just loved that my child was able to be active and happy without being on electronics. it was good seeing his confidence improve and to hear that he was given the chance to learn and give back a little, by helping with younger kids, sometimes.”





“friendship and mentorship are 2 biggies. also our family is big into community building activities and mtef embodies this philosophy with a very proactive approach. we love it!”





“my child’s skills in tennis grew noticeably over the summer. she loved being outdoors and playing all day, really liked coach izayah, and felt challenged in a low-stakes environment”





“every year ‘mtef” manages to make the current summer programming better than the last. the leadership is amazing. the opportunities my child has access to (free books, rainbow camp and fall programming) are amazing. no other program/camp that i am aware of compares.”





“the staff is supportive and encouraging. the other camp kids are welcoming and friendly. the environment is very upbeat and fun.”
