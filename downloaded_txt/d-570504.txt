“one of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. an ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.”

black warrior waterdog listed as endangered













photo by mark bailey





on january 2, 2018 the black warrior waterdog, necturus alabamensis, an alabama endemic,was listed as endangered by the us fish and wildlife service. mark bailey of conservation southeast inc. has over 25 years' experience working with this species and is federally permitted to conduct surveys. conservation easement newsin december 2015 congress made permanent the enhanced tax deduction for conservation easements. we work with the alabama forest resources center and other easement holders in conducting baselines and annual monitoring of conservation easements.  "many people making a living off of the land are often land rich but cash poor, meaning they make much less from farming, ranching, or forestry than the land on which they do it is actually worth. this wealth discrepancy can pressure landowners to sell to developers, a pressure which the enhanced deduction is designed to alleviate."--amos eno, private landowner network rcw updates
