what customers are saying about darvin...




 navigate_before 


"friendly and helpful salesman (jay), not at all pushy. he gave us space to figure out what we wanted, but was nearby when we had questions. everyone was accommodating to our kids. prices were reasonable, and they have a large delivery radius. the store is far from our home, but i'll go back next time i need furniture."
"we are so happy with our experience at darvin! i don't think i'll be going anywhere else for furniture from now on!"
"my salesman, chuck, was great! he was very helpful and professional. he explained the differences between a few mattresses and made me feel comfortable with my decision. he was very patient with my indecisiveness! i received a great financing deal, free delivery, and they take away my old mattress. i would definitely recommend darvin to anyone looking for a mattress."
"you will never regret your furniture choices if you use the help of one of darvin's design consultants, soleil tierney. she works closely with the sales staff to make sure you choose the right pieces that will meet your needs, dreams, and budget. "
"always a great experience here. staff very helpful & friendly."
"darvin is always there serving well when we want one of their products. this was for our 97 year old decorated ww2 veteran dad! when they heard this was for him they went above and beyond to serve!"
"it was a pleasure doing business with you as always since my family has been shopping with you for the last 50 plus years."
