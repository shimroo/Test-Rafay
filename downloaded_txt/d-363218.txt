            product of the week
        







                            sóller oranges
                        



this is the name given to the different varieties of oranges grown in the sóller area in northwest majorca (balearic islands). the most characteristic variety grown in sóller is the canoneta orange, which is thought to originate in the sóller valley, from can canonet. this variety of orange has a high sugar content and gives large quantities of juice, and is the emblematic citrus fruit of sóller. the sóller valley has a tradition of over seven centuries dedicated to the cultivation of citrus fruit –particularly oranges– and produces a citrus fruit with a series of special characteristics due to its geo-climatic conditions and to the technique, common throughout the area, of growing the fruit trees on terraces.
