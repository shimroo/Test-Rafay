evangelical alliance ireland evangelical alliance ireland exists to serve individuals and churches in ireland who share our distinctive beliefs. these beliefs can be summed up in four primary characteristics.

the new birth
we believe in the absolute necessity of a personal experience of jesus christ by which each person is born again by faith.

the cross
our beliefs and practices must be christocentric.  christ’s atoning death upon the cross is, and always will be, the defining event of human history.

the bible
the scriptures are the word of god and are authoritative for christian faith and practice.

the gospel
our experience of jesus christ necessarily involves us in proclaiming the message of salvation, both in word and by actions that reflect the grace and truth of jesus christ.
