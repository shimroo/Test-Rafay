plant-wide control and optimization
modern distributed control systems
a modern distributed control system (dcs) is built using plant-wide control technologies. today, process control, discrete control, power control, and safety control no longer have to be a choice of separate technologies. producers can now choose to implement a plant-wide control system.
the use of common automation technologies enables seamless integration of the modern dcs with plant-floor and business systems, creating more opportunity for plant-wide optimization. this approach improves productivity, lowers energy consumption, and reduces total cost of ownership of a modern dcs. our plantpax system is a key component of the connected enterprise®, which makes all of this possible.

reduce costs and increase production
model predictive control and optimization

for many operations, production and profit margins fluctuate due to material variance, equipment constraints, operator skill set, and changing environmental conditions. our model predictive control (mpc) technology leverages the pavilion8® software platform. this technology is an intelligence layer on top of basic automation systems that continuously drives the plant to achieve multiple business objectives.
our mpc-based solutions include built-in controller performance metrics. key indicators such as utilization, time-at constraints, and deviation from target are monitored. these metrics allow product quality, production, and efficiency to be measured directly against mpc utilization and performance.
