what our clients say``the greatest benefit of inovonics products is their reliability. for our pendants to work effectively, we need to make sure our customer’s residents wear them, and if the residents don't trust the reliability, they won’t. because of inovonics reliability, it was fairly simple to get most of the residents to trust the system and wear the pendants.``- ryan entzel | cto | ltc solutions``inovonics products are the easiest to install and use, and have the least expensive repair requirements in the long-term. we've installed, repaired and recommended inovonics products since 2001!``- diana monagas | vice president | protech contracting, inc``we are building our company from the ground up, and started using inovonics products for temperature monitoring in critical access hospitals. using inovonics, we have now expanded our offerings to pressure and humidity measurement, opening us up to five new classes of customers, and allowing us to grow our business 200% in 2017, and 400% in 2018. thanks!``- jim stockwood | investor | rastix``inovonics products have workhorse reliability and competitive pricing, as well as predictable delivery schedules, and great customer service. we have never been left in the lurch due to lack of service.``- arthur blankenship| president | argen billing & conservationread more testimonials
