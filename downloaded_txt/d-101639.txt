honey against burns
health care
honey is well known for its soothing properties in case of throat irritations. consumed in hot water, or even with a small spoon, it calms the pain almost instantly. its soothing action against skin burns is less known, but just as effective. to use it on small surfaces and on a light burn, you just have to apply it as a mask and let it rest for about fifteen minutes. you can repeat this operation, at will, if your wound makes you suffer again.

choosing the right physical activity
physical activity
swimming, walking, gymnastics, cycling… before taking out a membership in a sports club or buying equipment, ask yourself a few questions. do you like to swim in the summer but would you like to go to the pool in the middle of winter? you don’t feel like going to the gym? being encouraged by a teacher can be very motivating.
