				what is this mega show format you ask?  it is the opportunity to 
				maximize the value in showing, maximize your dollar, maximize 
				your time, maximize your ability to gain aoa show points, 
				maximize the ability to gain valuable evaluations of your 
				alpacas!  we will provide 5 events in 3 days, that is 3 
				halter shows and 2 wf shows, all in one travel away 
				from the farm, one hotel stay, one cvi, one group of meals and 
				one set of miles on your vehicles.  here is the amazing 
				part, you can choose how active you would like to be, taking 
				part in all or in just a select few of the events we have to 
				offer.
how will we accomplish this, you ask?  with 
				just 2 huacaya rings and 1 suri ring (w/ 40+ suri in show) to make it easier on our exhibitors to follow the 
				pace, we will have 1 show at a time each day, males in one ring and 
				females in the other.  when the 1st show ends the 2nd show 
				will begin with a new set of judges.  after completion of 
				the 2nd show, the 3rd will commence with new judges yet again.  
				while the halter rings are going on, the walking fleece shows 
				will be going on as with any other show.  super easy flow 
				to follow!  however, in order to keep it easy for folks we 
				need to limit our entries so the judges may complete their 
				assignments each day.  
				the shows will be 
				limited to 300 huacaya and 140 suri per show. you want show points?  we will do our 
				best to get them for you.  interesting tid-bit, 78% of the 
				2023  and 70% of the 2024 aoa halter show award winners  attended at least one 
				of our mega show formats.  you certainly do not have to  
				participate in every event at the jamboree to  create your 
				perfect weekend, but if you are chasing points the opportunity 
				to compete in this many events gives you an incredible leg up on 
				your peers.

how to choose 
				what to register for?
mega show formats can be intense; 
				you could do everything, meaning 3 halter shows, 2 walking fleece shows, as well as performance, fiber arts and group production classes 
				or you could register for just one show.  the choice is completely yours! 

				we think we have designed this format to be super exhibitor 
				friendly, just one halter show a day and only 2 rings to keep 
				track of.  however, 
				we want you to walk away from this weekend feeling the event was  
				amazing for you and your breeding program,  if that 
				means scaling back the options to make you more comfortable, its 100% okay!


				check out what our exhibitors are saying!




						bart and rhonda leinberger, alpacas of indian point 
						hills
we 
						love showing in the mega show format because its a 
						great opportunity to get multiple judge opinions in one 
						weekend with one hotel, pen and travel costs.  its fun 
						and fast paced but organized so that you will be able to 
						make all your classes.
 
cathy 
						aksten triple diamond alpacas
the mega shows are 
						convenient, economical & competitive, (different judges 
						opinions with the same short term variables like 
						weather, humidity, etc). options for each farm to pick & 
						customize what show or shows to participate in). extra 
						day for evening networking and enjoying friends that 
						might not come the distance for just 1 or 2 shows.
 
chris 
						works, kendall creek farm alpacas
we really enjoyed the 2023 
						version of the jamboree. the multi-show format reduced 
						our cost per show and provided the opportunity for 
						feedback from multiple judges in one weekend. kudos to 
						the organizers and volunteers for a well run event!
 




						cheryl wise, lake alice alpacas
the 
						mega show gives us the opportunity to show in front of 3 
						different halter judges and 2 walking fleece judges for 
						examination of the best of our herd. this let's us know 
						if our breeding decisions are spot on or need more 
						consideration.  this is huge for a small farm.
 


						jerry forstner, majestic meadows and alpaca boutique
						
the 
						mega shows have revived the alpaca industry and while 
						hectic at times are a wonderful way to showcase your 
						best stock in front of multiple judges at once.
 


						randy strong, k-ran alpacas

						advantages of the mega alpaca shows is that you can get 
						multiple judges evaluation at one location.  you only 
						have to pay the stall fee for multiple shows saving 
						money. and you have the ability to collect many show 
						points in the aoa show system both for your farm and for 
						individual alpacas.
 




						elaine simpson, hilltop hideaway alpacas
we 
						were really skeptical about attending such a large show 
						butit was a surprise. the eastern alpaca jamboree was 
						very well organized & ran smoothly. 
 


						marie voorhees, hidden spring lavender && alpaca farm


						always a good time at this show and so much wonderful 
						competition. always run very efficiently and 
						professionally, not to mention 3 great shows in 1 trip.
 



						brenda weber, blue ridge alpaca ranch
the 
						mega-show format in ia was well-organized and 
						incorporated efficiency between the halter rings and 
						walking fleece.  the show remained on schedule, which 
						allowed many to finish before noon on sunday.  i like 
						being able to maximize my time and money in a show that 
						offers several opportunities.
 




						stephanie glyptis, aoa certified judge

						from a judge's perspective, the mega shows offer a 
						chance for exhibitors to get multiple evaluations from 
						multiple judges in one location, and that also gives the 
						judges a chance to discuss after the show how our 
						training and calibration stand up.  we as judges often 
						have a close pair in a class that could go either way, 
						and we make our case in our reasons. mega shows truly 
						illustrate to the exhibitor how close some placings are 
						in the class and how hard the placings can be for the 
						judges.  it further shows how judges balance fleece and 
						conformation.
