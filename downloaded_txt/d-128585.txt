happy sunday! and day 11 of sld advent of photo sharing. here‚Äôs another smaller but impactful kitchen remodel. in this late-90‚Äôs home, our client wanted ‚Äúa bright kitchen but not bland.‚Äù the husband mentioned feeling crowded when cooking, so we moved the fridge to the west wall and moved the range down to give some extra room in the congested corner. as always w/sld kitchens, some strategically placed storage solutions(trash/recycling pull-out, blind corner, knife/utensil pull-out, and pull out shelves in base and tall cabinets) made much more efficient use of the existing footprint. like with most projects over the last few years, delays in significant components meant not great ‚Äúafter photos‚Äù but you can still see that little changes can make a pretty big difference. #kitchenremodel #kitchendesign #spokanewashington

an important conversation to have when designing a new space with a client is to discuss how they would like to store their things or what currently works for them. in a kitchen for example, finding the perfect spot for plates and bowls is an important decision!! there are so many possibilities but what makes the most sense to you and your family? do you like them stacked all in one drawer or prefer in shelves? peg drawers are a great solution to keep all your plates and bowls in one spot and ensure them don‚Äôt slide back and forth when closing the drawers. it keeps everything ultra organized just as we like it!my inner #mariekondo spirit tells me this ‚Äú brings me joy‚Äù!
