our vision
diversity and sustainability
local and small business




procurement services strives to provide a world-class supply management function in support of the university’s mission by creating value through strategic sourcing, efficient processes, and professional service. read more
 





cornell uses its purchasing power to help build a sustainable economy. each purchasing decision represents an opportunity to choose environmentally and socially preferable products and services and support companies with strong commitments to sustainability. we also guide and support the university’s ongoing commitment to encourage business opportunities and diversity among its vendors by promoting minority business development as a shared responsibility throughout the university.
 





we aim to provide a resource that will assist the university community in locating and establishing relationships with local, regional, and small and disadvantage businesses so that locally owned, woman-owned, small veteran-owned, small service-disabled veteran-owned, and small hubzone business concerns have competitive access to participate under cornell university's procurement of materials, supplies, and services consistent with effective and economic purchasing practices.
