present the k.i.s.s. principle behind three keys of building a successful business on the internet


first: selecting the correct domain name/s - (rarely your business name) to gain the best results on the search engines
second: building the correct interactive structure to gain the best results on the search engines. most web designers use a standard template which eases their task but does not maximise your exposure on the search engines.
 we tailor every website for our client's unique needs. after 15 years of web building we know all the tricks.
third: beware of "peacock" designs which look beautiful but play no part in positioning you prominently in the search engines. 
we custom make your design from scratch to maximise your impact through the search engines.
without these three key criteria, expertly handled, your website will forever remain lost in cyberspace. 
your position on google, not a "pretty design" spells success. we have several of our own successful online businesses 
through which we continually refine and tune our expertise. billboards (websites) in the nullabor desert (lost on google) don't sell one unit of anything!

consider these facts.. we have been building web pages since 1994 (the first web building company in australia)* and this website is prominently listed on all the relevant key words related 
to web building on the internet. *check when gwb.com.au was registered - no other web building companies existed in australia back then and if our competitors were as good as they claim to be in search engine optimisation then why are they not above us on the search engines in their own online marketing arena? nothing beats fifteen years of hands on experience in building web pages. we design simple but effective pages (like this one); did you know fancy graphics (which we can do) often jeopardise your position on google? see the links below for our history and some of our unique designs


no one in this industry can boast these major australian companies as past clients
