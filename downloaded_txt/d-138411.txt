a better kind of used vehicle
each gmc cpo vehicle is thoroughly inspected and reconditioned before you buy it. and when you pull off the lot, you'll have your own happily ever after with two factory-backed warranties: a new, longer 6-year/100,000 mile powertrain limited warranty that includes roadside assistance, and a 12-month/12,000-mile bumper-to-bumper limited warranty. those benefits add up to a value you can depend on, and a used vehicle you can trust.
