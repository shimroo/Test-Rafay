founded in 1990...


star coaches was founded on a gravel parking lot by danny hamilton in 1990 with one bus, a forty foot model 10 eagle...â  very humble beginnings...
our objective and business model has always been very simple and straight forward:
do business with integrity...
today, our fleet of nearly sixty coaches has been built and tailored to help meet the budget of most every touring band...
we offer both prevost and mci entertainer coaches as well as executive limo styled coaches...
check out this video to give you an up close and personal look at who we are...


 

star coaches:  the pioneer of the executive limo coach...


danny hamilton had a vision... take a rock & roll bus and turn it into a limousine. so that's exactly what he did.
after meeting with numerous coach builders who turned him down, danny met with jerry calhoun, the godfather of the rock & roll bus industry.
the meeting was brief and to the point.â  jerry asked danny to write down references and then told him to go to lunch...
when danny returned from lunch jerry said "go pick out a bus, i believe in you!"
since 1990 and millions of dollars later, the relationship between danny hamilton and jerry calhoun has been very special.

14 bunker coaches

many years ago, and thanks to our friend george clinton and parliament funkadelic, we made a decision to convert some of our coaches from 12 bunkers to 14 bunkers...
this move has opened the door to helping bands save money by "sharing a bus" with an opening act, or carrying a full crew and keeping the cost involved to only one bus...
with a year round rate starting at $850 / day, our 2013 to 2016 model 14 bunker coaches can really make a difference to bands and touring theatrical shows that are faced with tight budgetary restraints...

 

our drivers give backâ¦


in 2005, we went to our drivers with a simple task:
"guys, figure out a way to make a difference to our clients."
we knew that the economy was going to tank. we didn't know when, or how bad things would get, we just knew the bubble was going to burst.
over the course of two weeks, we held countless phone calls with all of our drivers discussing their ideas on "how to make a difference".
they came up with many great ideas. finally, our drivers decided that the best way to give back and make a difference was to change their overdrive structure in favor of the client.
industry standard has always been, and still is, for a driver to charge an overdrive (equal to a days pay) after driving 450 miles.
our drivers voluntarily and collectively, decide to break that mold.
their decision was to not charge a client an overdrive at 450 miles, but rather at 501 miles.
this was a huge move on their part. unheard of in the industry. they were mocked and ridiculed by their esteemed colleagues in the industry.
but... they made a difference.
so, ever since 2005, our great drivers have made a significant difference to our clients every day with their overdrive structure, which starts at 501 miles, not at 450 miles like our competition!
our drivers will save you money on your next tour!

accurate proposalsâ¦


as of december 2021, don neuen has created proposals totaling over 153 million miles, and has contracted over 50 million miles worth of tours!â  50,000,000 miles worth of tours!!â  that's more than half way from the earth to the sun!
when don prepares a proposal for your tour, he leaves "no stone unturned".
more often than not, when clients compare a star coaches proposal to our competitor's proposals, our proposal will "appear" to be more expensive.
why? because it is thorough...
show more
it's not designed to be "pretty"... â  it's designed to be accurate.â  actually, it is designed for you to end your tour below the projected budget.
don takes the time to prepare every single proposal for every single tour himself.
he suggests stop point cities on longer drives to keep a driver safe and legal.
while this level of thoroughness takes more time, it has been invaluable, especially for foreign clients that are not familiar with the geographical layout of the united states.
see for yourself what many consider to be the best, and most informative proposal in the industry, and then get ready to enjoy "coming in below budget" at the end of your tour.

star coaches:  east coast & west coast!


our primary facility and corporate offices are located in atlanta, ga. in addition, we also have a satellite location in indio, ca.
the majority of our fleet is based on the east coast in atlanta, but we also position coaches on the west coast.
this has proven to be beneficial to our clients, especially those with a west coast pick up and drop, as we are now able to greatly reduce the deadhead costs by utilizing our west coast coaches.
now our clients can receive the same great customer service from both the east coast and the west coast!



trailer weight limitsâ¦


about 60% of our clients pull rental trailers to carry their backline equipment, merchandise and additional production... but, with the increased importance of performing, also comes the desire to "bring additional stuff"!
most of the time, this is not a problem, as most bands are staying within our 10,000 pound limit for gvwt (gross vehicle weight, or a loaded trailer)...
show more
by the way, for you production managers, our trailers weight about 4,500 pounds empty, leaving you about 5,500 pounds for the gear / merch...
anyhow, a more frequent occurrence is that we find ourselves receiving a frantic call from our drivers at pick up stating that "this trailer is very heavy"...
so we instruct the driver to immediately weigh the full trailer, only to find that the gvwt is over 10,000 pounds... this becomes a new problem...
to battle this potential problem, we suggest making sure your packed load is less than 5,500 pounds, and if you must exceed that limit, act before the tour pick up...
rent a box truck and a driver...
star coaches now has a small team of box truck drivers that can help solve the problem of a disaster at pick up...
if you can't get the gear to 5,500 pounds, let us know, and we will gladly assign one of our auxiliary drivers to your rented box truck from hertz, budget or uhaul...
don't be that guy who is overweight at pick up...
