passing on the history of the cherokee

 introduction
greetings
        everyone! for over 30 years, 
		i published a quarterly called the tellico plains mountain press, in 
		tellico plains, tn. the 
		mountain community where i live. the first one printed on a regular 
		basis since the early 1900's. this local publication contained history, 
		local news, and feature articles, and lots of my photography. 
 i have moved my 
		publication to the web, with both old and new content.
this site has the most complete pages of information for the tellico plains area, 
		with all those hard to find places only the locals know. i look forward 
		to hearing from everyone. be sure to like us on facebook. 
tellico plains first and most complete information

		come back & visit
