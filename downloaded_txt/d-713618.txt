systran features overview 



with systran’s proprietary neural machine translation engine pnmt™ technology, translations are more accurate than ever before.
much like a human translator would learn to translate, the pure neural translation engine is powered by ai (artificial intelligence), that simulates the human brain, which has led to remarkable improvements in translation accuracy and fluency and is more comparable to human quality translations.
available in on premise and cloud solutions
