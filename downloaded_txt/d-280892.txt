advocates forum. our lawyers have also
been named trial lawyers of the year by 
the nevada justice association for their
skilled courtroom advocacy and ability to
secure favorable verdicts. and while we 
cannot guarantee specific results for any 
legal matter, our ability to win cases is
just one of the many reasons we have been 
considered northern nevada’s premier 
personal injury law firm for more than
