				steadfast in sisterhood			

since 1852, phi mu fraternity has challenged women to become their personal best. we are proud of our rich history as the second-oldest secret society for women in the u.s. and we continually strive to provide our members with the many benefits of a steadfast sisterhood, embodying our open motto, “les soeurs fideles,” the faithful sisters.
for women of ambition, phi mu offers personal enrichment for a lifetime through member experiences that build character and promote vibrancy. for women with leadership aspirations, phi mu provides an environment that develops leaders who radiate confidence. for women who are community-minded, phi mu provides endless opportunities to lend a helping hand, bringing energy and purpose to community service and philanthropy. for women seeking friendship, phi mu offers sisterhood that lasts a lifetime, knowing that our connectedness is vital to our mutual success.
