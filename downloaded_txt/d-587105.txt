best experience i ever had 
i have been tubing all over tn and nc and must say this was the best experience i have ever had. 100% going to bring my kids back here so they can enjoy this as well.

sooooo awesome! 
1 or 2 hrs tubing down long riverstream... it's best if you purchase a long stick and water shoes from them or bring your own because you will get caught on big rocks and will need the stick to push yourself away from them or you'll have to step into the cold water and free yourself.. there's also zip-lining and half dozen other things to do.
