welcome to huntsville town
                        huntsville town...a great place to live!
						
if you love small towns you will love huntsville town! although huntsville town is part of odgen valley and the greater weber county, we are incorporated which makes us a unique part of the valley. huntsville town has its own mayor and governing bodies.
we invite you to take a stroll around this cute community and see what we have to offer. huntsville town is home to resturants, a library, a gorgeous park, beaches, community pickleball, an ice skating rink (in the winter months),  and even an observatory. we are also home to one of the oldest bars west of the mississippi.
for huntsville happenings, check out our calendar below!
