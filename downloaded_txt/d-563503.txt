all products are informed-sport tested, so for me as a professional athlete that is a really key part, knowing that the products are of high quality and exactly what’s in them is exactly what it says on the packaging.eilish mccolgan

i would probably say my favourite is the hydro electrolyte tablets because i use them every day but also the rego collagen shots as i used that when i got injured and during my recovery.olga ahtinen

training is one thing but focusing on recovery is just as important, especially when training for triathlon. if you have a busy life getting the right food in on the go is hard, from rego rapid recovery to the go energy bakes.tim don
