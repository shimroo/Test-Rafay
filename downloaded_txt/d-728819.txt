the question is why this charming little place changed its name? snickersville sounds fun nowadays, but back then it didn’t attract any attention. the reason for the name change is simple, snickersville changed its name to help attract visitors from washington d.c. due to the fact that the blue ridge mountains are close, and they are known for the blue color of the mountains that attracted many visitors, just like the blue cave croatia on bisevo island attracts thousands of visitors year after year. read more about that unique and remarkable geomorphological natural wonder on official websites of zen travel croatia. the village, in fact, did have benefit from the washington d.c. visitors after the railroad was built in the early 1900s. the village prospered as the resort area with many charming little hotels and lodging places.

history
the first settlement of today’s bluemont was founded
somewhere in the 1770s when a connection was created between the colchester
road that runs through snickers gap to winchester pike. snickers gap was named
after a ferry operator that worked on the shenandoah river, his name was edward
snickers. since the new connection to winchester significantly reduced the
travel time, this new road was fairly used and as a result, on the intersection
of these two roads a new settlement was found. it was given the name of
snickers’ gap when the post office was founded in 1807. it took seventeen years
for this settlement to be named snickersville. although this was a strategic
place in the civil war it was rarely used, and the only incident happened in
1864 when 14 confederates surprised and attacked 22 resting federal soldiers.

the next major event in the history of the snickersville happened in 1900 when southern railways extended the tracks to the town so that citizens of the washington d.c. can get to the base of the blue ridge mountains easily. basically, that major event in snickersville history happened because of the beginning of tourism activity. local resort success was the trigger for the railroads to expand. the next thing that the railroads did was the petition towards the united states postal service to change the name of the snickersville to bluemont so that public can associate destination with the blue ridge mountains, and we can easily say that those were the beginnings of the modern day’s public relations and marketing. since the bluemont is a very scenic and peaceful location it lured many artists and musicians, one of them was clyde beck who founded the bluemont citizens association with evelyn johnson. together, they set the ground for the annual bluemont fair in 1968, and the bluemont concerts series in the 1970s. bluemont is listed on the national register of historic places since 1984, and it represents one of the virginia historic landmarks.
