dr. yi was amazing! honestly, the entire staff including all of the vet techs were very helpful and willing to answer all of my questions. i was able to call in and receive updates very easily, and everyone was just overall super friendly and knowledgeable! would definitely recommend. i'm considering switching my vet to them!

falls road animal hospital is such a great place. i value their knowledge, experience, and skill when i turn my kitty pantaloon over to them for shots, dental cleanings, etc. they care for her so well! during this covid reality they've worked out ways where you can receive the same great care while steering clear of social situations that might be problematic. that's not easy to do -- but they've done it.

we were in town for the weekend and needed prompt care for our puppy that possibly ingested his larger sisters incontinence medication. we quickly found falls road hospital and took our little guy there and they attended to him quickly. after a short stay to monitor him, he was released back to us that same afternoon. very good service and professional staff.

i brought my injured cat on a sunday afternoon and they took him right away. the staff as well as the vet were extremely professional and knowledgeable i really think it’s the best vet hospital in baltimore.
sam alruby


our puppy got bitten or stung and had an allergic reaction. they were able to take us right away. we were asked what we would like and after she received her treatment they were willing to keep her for observation for a bit. her face was significantly better and we are so thankful they could see her right away and she is doing well now! we are so thankful to them and i would recommend them to anyone!

frah's professional, friendly, and caring staff has been wonderful with all of our pets and family. large and small, exotic and non-exotic. without a doubt i would continue to make the 45 - 60 min drive, knowing that our family pet(s) are getting the absolute best care possible. thank you!

taking your pet to an emergency room comes with much fear and anxiety. the staff was very attentive, knowledgeable and helpful. with the covid-19 pandemic going on, i expected a bit of parking lot confusion. to my surprise the process was easy and overall great. they took great care of my puppy and i am very pleased.
jasmin green


my dog gizmo was not feeling well when i came home from work. my vet office was closed so i took gizmo to falls road animal hospital for a sick visit and they took care of him in a timely manner. the vet and staff were very professional and pleasant. i will definitely bring gizmo back for future care.
