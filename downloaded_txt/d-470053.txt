see what the arts can open your eyes to!
our programs support artists and the creative economy. we believe creativity is an essential ingredient for the well being, prosperity, and joy of everyone in our communitiespainted by artist lynn staiano - 2022https://bio.site/millspondgallery














fine art exhibitions





take time to engage with the arts…maybe you will be challenged by the views represented...maybe what you experience will shift your thinking in some way or help you understand contradictory perspectives…see what the arts can open your eyes to!  our exhibitions reach our local communities through classes, special events and community outreach programs that focus on active and collaborative learning. 












art classes for children & adults





involvement in the arts inspires tomorrow's creative thinkers. what they learn from their art experience will be woven into their future lives...open their eyes to new ways of seeing...and help them to interpret these crazy times we live in! creative art classes at mills pond gallery teach the technical skills of drawing and painting, while sparking a desire for future investigation and learning as a young artist.












music programs





mills pond gallery proudly hosts a variety of emerging musicians. folk acts, singer-songwriters, jazz artists and classical musicians are equally at home in our space. the tall ceilings, historic hardwood floors, and ever changing exhibitions help to create a unique experience for performers and audience alike. with a capacity of 50 guests, our space is particularly suited to acoustic and minimally amplified styles
