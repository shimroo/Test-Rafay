the rocketeer who never wasnasa histories say that the first american rocket-powered aircraft flight was made by william swan at atlantic city on january 4, 1931. but the launch was made in june and swan was not his real name. he made the first air-launched rocket aircraft flight in 1932. in 1933 he bailed from an aircraft over boca chica, texas, now the site of the spacex starship launch facility, disappeared into the clouds, and was never seen again. where had he come from? where did he go? it was only in the 21st century that the life story of swan was revealed.

podsadka - failed plan to win the moon race podsadka was a secret plan to use a two-launch scheme to shoot the first soviet crew around the moon. the reason for the puzzling soyuz manned launches in 1966-1969 are revealed to be tests of this scheme. the effort was bandoned after apollo 8 orbited the moon and the l1 program was cancelled.
n1-l3: two launches to get one man on the moon the single-launch approach to the moon landing sold to the soviet leadership was unachievable due to payload shortfalls and safety considerations. by the time of america's first landing on the moon, it had degenerated into a two-launch scheme. the first launch would deliver a ye-8-2 robot rover to place a homing beacon at a safe location for the manned landing; and a reserve unmanned lk-r lander to provide a way home in case the primary lk lander failed on the lunar surface. the second launch would result in the single-crew lk lander setting down near the beacon and reserve lander...
mkbs - secret origin of mir and soyuz t the mkbs was an n1-launched, nuclear-powered orbital battle station that would assure soviet dominance of space through use of beam weapons. it was developed in 1969-1974, only to be ended when the n1 booster necessary to put it in orbit was cancelled. however the spacecraft and systems developed for it became the basis for the soviet manned space program of the 1970's and 1980's.

apollo 8 first manned flight to lunar orbit. speed (10,807 m/s) and altitude (378,504 km) records. mission resulted from audacious decision to send crew around moon to beat soviets on only second manned apollo csm mission and third saturn v launch.
