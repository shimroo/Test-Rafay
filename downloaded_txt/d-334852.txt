ten great relationship jokes not to share with your significant other
1. you know you’re in a relationship when the doghouse has carpeting, a cot and a television.
2. marriage is a 3-ring circus: engagement ring, wedding ring, and suffering.
3. i married miss right. i just didn't know her first name was always.
4. two antennas met on a roof, fell in love and got married. the ceremony wasn't much, but the reception was excellent!
5. boyfriend: do you think my salary is sufficient for you?
girlfriend: yes it is sufficient for me, but how you will survive?
6. dear math,
i'm sick and tired of trying to find your "x". just accept the fact that she's gone. move on, dude.
7. q: what's the difference between a girlfriend and a wife?
a: 45 lbs.
8. q: what's the difference between a boyfriend and a husband?
a: 45 minutes.
9. standing in front of a boutique, i noticed an impatient looking young man approach an attractive woman. “would you mind talking to me for a few minutes?” he asked her. “why?” she countered suspiciously. ”my wife has been in this shop for a long time,” the man explained, “but i know she’ll come out if she sees me talking to you.”
10. my daughter has been going out with this guy for a while, so when she came home from a date all upset, i asked her, “what happened?” she replied, “he asked me to marry him.” "then why are you so sad?” i asked. “because he also told me he doesn’t believe in religion. mom, he doesn’t even believe there’s a hell!” i quickly replied, “marry him anyway—between the two of us, we’ll show him how wrong he is!”

											can a long distance relationship really work?
									 	

don't let a border come between you and your true love
long distance relationships are often a topic of controversy; everyone seems to have a story or an opinion on why relationships will or will not work. quite simply, if you love someone enough, distance, and even borders, will not prevent you from enjoying a healthy and wonderful relationship.  certainly most couples would prefer to spend the bulk of their time together, enjoying each other's company and sharing experiences together. unfortunately, a number of couples do not enjoy that luxury as a result of work, citizenship status or familial obligations. sometimes physically being together simply isn't an option. however, that doesn't mean that the relationship is destined to fail.  find ways to keep in touch with your partner and make sure to take full advantage of every moment you get to spend together. plan short trips together, take a sick day at work or just show up unexpectedly at their door when possible. you would be amazed at the long lasting impact that effort will have on the level of admiration you receive from your partner.  remember that the heart knows no borders, so don't allow them to interfere in a relationship with the person you love most.

											how do i get closer to my spouse?
									 	

play together and stay together
life gets tricky doesn't it? and the very person whom you love the most can actually drift away if you don't pause and take"fun" time together. a lot of couples come together to discuss money, holidays (the in-laws and the ex-laws), kids and the every busy calendar. discussing these things can be stressful and usually doesn't build up your relationship. instead, you gotta play together. get a board game, pick up a tennis racket, sign up for a fun run, go skiing, go shopping, but do something you both like together. playing together lets you laugh, relax, and simply have fun together. it will bond you and remind you of why you love your one and only so very much. couples that daily take time to be together in an enjoyable and relaxing setting grow closer to each other. this bonding is priceless and can make the journey of life and your relationship a lot more fulfilling. couples that play together can make it through the hard times much easier because they have their best friend right by them. build up your relationship and spend time having fun together.

how to hire a home health care worker for ill  or aging spouse or parent
a home health care worker improves opportunities for ongoing independence in cases of aging or illness. choosing a home health care worker requires consideration of many factors such as compatibility, experience, skills and needs. the ideal search method will include specific criteria that can be used for screening that yields the best overall fit.
write down needs and expectations. it is easier to find the right person when you are clear about what is expected, when it will happen and how it will be done. consider using the needs-assessment worksheet at www.familycareamerica.com.
conduct a broad search. ask friends and co-workers, place advertisements in the paper and on bulletin boards, contact agencies such as the national association of area agencies on aging, and call schools that train certified nursing assistants. include telephone and email contact information for ease of applicant contact.
screen applicants by telephone before scheduling in-person interviews. ask questions about experience, availability, special skills or training, and willingness to accept assigned duties.
use the eldercare locator database at http://www.eldercare.gov to find trustworthy help nationwide. ask questions to determine the reputability of any agency chosen to provide home health care workers.
conduct criminal background and reference checks. ask applicant for picture identification and social security card. contact the local police or sheriff's department for criminal background information and previous employers and instructors for references.
hire a home health care worker. consider instituting a probationary period of 30 to 60 days. at the end of this period provide feedback about what is going well and what is not. use this evaluation to determine if the worker will be terminated or become permanent.
