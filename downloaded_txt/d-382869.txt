"being an auto value certified service center has been a win/win experience for my business and my customer base.  as a csc we have formed a business partnership with our auto value warehouse distributor, their parts suppliers and service providers. they genuinely care about my business and we work hard, together, every day to help achieve success by offering me the tools, resources, training and support programs i need to service the ever changing, diverse needs of my customers.” brett bohlmann, owner

highway 7 service center - newell, ia 







"i’m a proud to be a certified service center!  i have a great relationship with my wholesale distributor, auto-wares, as well as their sales, marketing and training  brain-trust!  i have become a lifetime customer because auto-wares treats me, my business and associates like “family”!  training is a big factor,  and i focus on it daily.  training, after all, doesn’t cost…it pays!  today interstate auto care embarks on its 18th year in business.  a major reason why is because auto value and bumper to bumper care about my business success as much as i care about theirs." bill nalu, owner     
interstate auto care - madison heights mi 







"as an independent auto repair shop i find it beneficial and necessary to align myself with a recognized and valued program to demonstrate our commitment to provide superior customer service. they listen to us. they provide us with what  we need to compete and they give us independents a voice…a presence in the automotive aftermarket.  bottom line is we get unmatched services and support.  we work together with respect and integrity…and it makes all the difference in our success."  alain robert, owner
