what the cos is about





live music events at our organ venues featuring world class artists playing a range of music you will know and love no matter what your tastes.






four publications a year keeping you in the loop with information and articles for all aspects of cinema organ.






an extensive archive full of photos, audio and documents has been amassed over many years and is accessible to members to look at in the flesh and online.






we are a society and many friendships have been made through our common interest. everyone is made welcome at every event and we always encourage new faces.






workshops and tuition on the playing and maintenance of the instruments is provided by a number of experts both formally and informally.
