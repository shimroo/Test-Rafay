metro reunion registry
(an international registry)















the metro reunion registry serves
as a repository of information pertaining to adoption searches by all members of the triad that have been affected by adoption.  registrations include nearly every state, canada, and over 20 foreign countries.  information
is entered into the database upon receipt.  in the event of a
match with existing data, or a match with new incoming data, you
will be notified immediately.

please help keep this registry free


there are no fees for this service, however, your donations
are what helps keep this free service free. registration is not contingent upon a donation nor will you be denied the use of any information or service due to the lack of a donation.  donations are used to offset the cost of equipment, supplies, telephone service, isp fees, web hosting fees, and other expenses related to maintaining the registry.  information contained within this site is completely free of charge.

privacy
your concerns for privacy are understood and appreciated and that is why the only portion of your information that is accessible on the web site is what you see when you click "browse the registered dates".  the remainder of your registration information is considered confidential and is not revealed to anyone unless there is a confirmed match (see "what to do in case of a possible match"), and then information is released only with your permission.

beware of scammers

it appears that scammers are targeting those registries that post personal and contact information on their web sites to obtain information to feed their scamming activities.  click here to read an actual scammer email sent to an adoptee attempting to obtain more information.
special note
information is released only to members of the triad or their immediate families.  professional searchers, search angels and other volunteers can help you get your search started, but in the end the only person that can receive information is the adoptee/birthparent/sibling, or other birth family member involved.       



registrants are responsible for the accuracy of all
information submitted.

you are not expected to have all of the requested information.
 we just try to cover all the possibilities, so fill in as much
as you can. more information improves the chances of making a match.  it is surprising the number of times that what might be considered an insignificant piece of information is the final determining factor in a match.

not everyone searching has the luxury of having an exact or complete date of birth of the person they are searching for.  check the unknown dob listing which is sorted by city of birth.

what to do in case of a possible match


use your browser's "back" button to return to this page after browsing the registered dates or the unknown dob listing.  if you see a possible match in either listing, complete the registration form and include in the "comments" section "possible match with #(record number)".  identifying information pertaining to current registrants is considered confidential and will not be released until a final determination of a match has been made.  therefore, it is imperative that you provide as much information as possible.  withholding information only delays the process of making a determination.  responsibility for final determination on "possible matches" rests with the registry administrator.





updating your registration
go to the registration form and enter your name, status (i.e. adoptee, birth mother, etc.) and e-mail address.  enter the changes in the appropriate blanks.  enter a remark in the "comments" section such as "update to reg #0000"




notice

please read before completing the registration form

any registration that does not have a full name, complete mailing address, telephone number, and a valid e-mail address will not be entered in the registry.  this information is required if you want to be contacted in the event of a match.


keeping contact information current is your responsibility.  we will make two (2) attempts to contact you via e-mail in case of a match or the need for more information.  if there is no response after two attempts, your registration will be tagged "pls update"  and no further attempt will be made to contact you unless we receive updated contact information.





deleted registrations

registrations will be deleted in those instances where we have attempted to contact registrants via e-mail, snail-mail or telephone and have been unable to make contact.  if you do not see your registration, it is possible that it has been deleted due to outdated contact information.  to view a list of those that have been deleted, click the button below.





effective 02/01/2003 we will no longer delete registrations if we have tried to contact you and received no response.  your registration will be annotated "pls update" (to indicate no valid contact information) under the heading status.  to update the contact information in your registration, follow the instructions at updating your registration.
