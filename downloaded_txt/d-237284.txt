adultery in the news
(now available in thai, portuguese, and english.)

you cant have him  hes mine: a womans guide to affair-proofing her relationship (adams media; trade paperback; 2007), is an authoritative tactical guide to beating the homewrecker at her own game. citing research that reveals how men fall in love faster, harder, and, upon a breakup, suffer much longer and in many cases, deeper than women, the authors reveal just how menacing a marital poachers sexual spell can be to any marital union.  women will gain profound insights into the nature of female competition and the personality disorders that drive many women to pursue affairs with other womens husbands.  the authors reveal the hunting grounds of marital interlopers, including the workplace, the home front, and the internet.
 
encouraging readers to look in their marital mirror, the authors offer a few simple marital reality checks that can be used to honor whats right between you as you work on whats wrong or at least, what could stand improvement.  you cant have him  hes mine helps women head trouble off at the pass with advice on overcoming monogamous monotony, satisfying your husbands sexual and emotional needs (even when they differ markedly from your own), and promoting marital interdependency.  
 
noting that an encroaching affair is not the end of your relationship, the authors offer guidance on using divorce lawyers and marital therapists during a time of marital crisis caused by an interloper. offering frank advice on the vagaries of marital satisfaction experienced by all married couples, the authors reveal the distinct characteristics found in happy, long-term marriages and offer advice on coping with stress and depression extramarital affairs cause  and much more.
