take an object of negligible value and attach a great-great-grandparent to it and you have an article of infinite value -- in some cases.  on the things we hold dear, and the things that lose their luster between generations.

daily asterisk


even in a country you know by heart
 its hard to go the same way twice
 the life of the going changes.
 the chances change and make a new way.
 any tree or stone or bird
 can be the bud of a new direction. the
 natural correction is to make intent
 of accident. to get back before dark
 is the art of going.
