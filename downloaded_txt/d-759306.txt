					welcome to family service of greater new orleans					












how to access services
if you suffer from stress, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, trauma or domestic violence, are a parent without healthy child-rearing experience, or just need to talk, you can email 911@fsgno.org to assess your eligibility for counseling.
many services are free, and fsgno offers a sliding scale fee schedule to assist clients who may be unable to pay for general counseling services that are fee-based. fsgno will not discriminate in the provision of services based on ability to pay, or on the individual’s race, color, sex, sexual orientation or expression, national origin, disability, religion or age.


our mission
family service of greater new orleans strengthens the emotional health and fosters the self-sufficiency of families and individuals.
