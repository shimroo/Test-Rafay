life's just a series of merry little mix-ups!
loves: my nephew, svu, cherry vanilla dr. pepper, my job, growing up in the south, writing, music, movies, europe, america, politics, laughing, loving, living.

  
    
 name:nettie   location:south carolina, united states  
loves cartoons, educational stuff, reruns of the golden girls and especially law and order: svu. forever cold and hungry- sad, eh? adores working at bath and body works- "it's more than a job, it's a way of life!" her buick is named harvey -she doesn't know why either. a certified klutz, yet they still let her play with boxcutters. loves music new and old. saved at the age of nine. likes to make people laugh. fell in love with europe on her after-senior-year trip and wants to go back and randomly wander and look at stuff. tends to randomly wander anyway when she's transfixed in her own little world. republican politics volunteer since before she could vote, despite her hatred of making phone calls. is thoroughly obsessed with a certain eight month old child named austin fortunate enough to share her gene pool. 
i have dreams, and i have nightmares. i overcame the nightmares because of my dreams.
