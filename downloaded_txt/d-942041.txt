many direct journal links are on the recent or featured poems and
          haiga page as well as in bio and books. i don't attempt to add all
          links and only do this periodically beginning in 2009. journals don't
          always archive so links become dated very quickly. i've been publishing since
          2002 and would estimate that it would be hard to find archived links
          for probably 2/3's of the publications. print publications, needless
          to say, can't be archived.

 i've not added new poems to my site since
          2015 due to injuries that make sitting at the computer difficult. i've
          added a few short forms and kept my books undated until jan 27, 2020

          go to books in the left index to see my books in print. after 2019 no
          new books will be added to this website.                                 
january 27 2020  i
          will have a blog (under construction) for occasional postings at                             
          pris.poeticinspire.com
