when i needed to step up my design game and do a high-speed 8-layer board for the first time, sierra circuits reviewed my fab drawing notes and gave me feedback to improve. the finished boards were also top-quality.

i was introduced to your tools through following petr dvorák. if a titan of the industry such as petr is using and promoting your tools, they must be worthwhile!

the sierra circuits calculators are the genuine hidden gems of the internet.

















juan francisco aguerre
r&d specialist – sciences green incorporation



the bandwidth calculator goes beyond basic functionality by offering the ability to calculate critical lengths for various track types. additionally, it allows direct input of parameters such as dtr, frequency or rise time, further enhancing its usability and efficiency.














anand m.
hardware design engineer – luminar technologies



sierra circuits has been an incredible learning resource for my pcb design. 

unlike paid options for pcb tools, sierra circuits’ impedance calculator is free and user-friendly, providing pretty accurate results that compare well with fab house data. not only that, it has a community to support newbies and also has good study materials and webinars to support designers with their designs. 

really appreciate sierra circuits for their efforts.

















hossein pirhadi
r&d specialist – sciences green incorporation



the bandwidth calculator is a great tool! first, it is easy to use. second, it is quick to work with and gives not only the characteristic impedance, but also propagation speed, inductance, capacitance, and even the effective dielectric constant. and it is just for the se traces. there are other tools by sierra for differential impedance, crosstalk, via, etc. i have really enjoyed using them. 👍

















juan francisco aguerre
embedded system & industrial robotics engineer at adimra



these tools offer invaluable flexibility to designers, allowing them to tailor their approach according to their specific criteria. by dynamically displaying the calculations for each completed field, it provides designers with comprehensive information that allows them to leverage their expertise and choose the most appropriate criteria for their designs.
