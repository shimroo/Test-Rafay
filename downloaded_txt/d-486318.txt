"the reserve on which hidden valley inn lies is majestic, including miles of trails and multiple waterfalls throughout. the service is top-notch, professional and friendly while the accommodations are very nicely appointed, very well maintained and comfortable bedding. the evenings cooled into the 60's and with screen throughout, along with a ceiling fan it was a very comfortable sleeping environment . . . peaceful and quiet. ..... lawrence france - google reviews
