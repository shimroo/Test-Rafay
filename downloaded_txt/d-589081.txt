speech thomas  2x grammy award winning founder and lead singer of the 4x platinum hip-hop collective arrested development. known for consistently pushing the artistic and social envelope, speech’s keynote mixed with a musical performance makes for an experience.  speech thomas was born in the same year that dr. martin luther king was assassinated. he was born into a time when it could not be more clear just how dangerous it is to be a brave leader.  years later, as he entered the hip-hop scene in the early 90s, when the glorification of racist and oppressive stereotypes defined the genre, speech and arrested development proved that speaking from a place of love and honesty can help you rise to the top of your industry.  speech thomas and arrested development embody what brave leadership is all about and are a living, breathing, singing, and jamming representation of what is possible when we dare to break the mold, work together, and do differently.

dr. terence n. thomas scholarship



lifting up the young, gifted and black! established in 1992 after the tragic death of speech’s older brother terry, the dr. terence n thomas scholarship was endowed with $20,000 by the thomas family and another $25,000 was given by speech the following year. the scholarship fund was incorporated in wisconsin as a 501(c)3, nonprofit corporation. since 1996, over 50 of our students have graduated from universities! next year we will surpass the $ 1 million dollar mark in stipends to students from neighborhoods often described as at-risk.our students must maintain a 3.0 annual gpa in order to continue their scholarship award into the following academic year. this scholarship has an average retention rate of 98% annually! most go on to post graduate studies. we presently have doctors, lawyers, communication specialists, clergy, accountants, international business specialists, elected officials, educators, social workers, business owners and pharmacist graduates! and most return to milwaukee to become community thought leaders. it’s working!
