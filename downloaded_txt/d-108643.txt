founded in 1995, todd's rigs & lures,

                          of 1996 we acquired another lure company that had been
                          out of production for several years. we then developed
                          two more lures the following year and are currently
                          in development of several more scheduled to be released

                        batch of award winning lures! 






our lures
                              have been successfully fished throughout florida,
                              the bahamas, the cayman islands, the hawaiian islands,
                              both coasts of mexico, jamaica, texas, louisiana,
                              south carolina, and north carolina to catch a variety
                              of species including dolphin, wahoo, yellowfin,
                              bluefin, & blackfin
                            tuna, sailfish, blue & white marlin. 
in 1999, we acquired another well
                            known lure company, dick k. lures, he had a wide
                            variety of lures that have also been successfully
                            fished around the world. this acquisition greatly
                            expands our lure product line. we will integrate
                            the full line of lures over the next couple of years
                            and continue to make any special requests. 

                          thanks!
