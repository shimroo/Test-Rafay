                              it is important to distinguish the sources of information that you use from your own
                              ideas, interpretations, and conclusions. failure to cite your sources is plagiarism.

explore the library



circulation & reserves


circulation is the main intersection in the library: check books and dvds out or access
                                       items on reserve for your courses.





library commons


whether you want to relax with the newspaper; find an article from a peer-reviewed
                                       journal; browse for a dvd; or meet up for a group study session, this is the place.





quiet study


much of the library is designated for quiet study so that you can always find a place
                                       to read, write, think, study, or just relax. the reference room and all the stacks
                                       are quiet areas.





reference room


with large tables to spread out, get deeply involved in your research, whether you’re
                                       using the reference collection or the library’s extensive online resources.





senior theses


the senior thesis is a requirement for a simon’s rock ba; it is also a work that adds to the world’s
                                       knowledge. the library archives a copy of every thesis submitted in the reference
                                       room.





stacks


with 75,000 books in the stacks, this is the number one place to find just the right
                                       book or a quiet nook for a serious study session.





atrium


enjoy the quiet splash of water and the occasional call of a bullfrog — you can also
                                       meet with a tutor, get help at the writing center, or ask advice of the pros in the
                                       win commons.
