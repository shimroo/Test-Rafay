natural history photography with an emphasis on wild marine animals, the kelp forest, inhabitants of remote islands, national parks of the american west, california landscapes, coral reefs and difficult-to-photograph subjects. over 40,000 of my images are available on this site for editorial or commercial license or for purchase as prints.  some of my more popular natural history photography includes blue whale underwater photos, great white sharks, cetaceans (whales and dolphins), seals and sea lions, the california kelp forest, and many marine fish species.  looking for a particular image?  search by keyword for images, browse through hundreds of galleries, check out my extensive list of subjects and species or see what new images i have made recently in the natural history photography blog.
