									covid-19								

federal covid-19 vaccination guidance is updated frequently. our covid-19 vaccine main page provides quick links to all of the important resources, cdc and fda web pages, and partner websites you need. we connect you to current covid-19 vaccination content in one place.


									view all covid-19 resources									





 


									clinical resources a–z								

immunize.org has developed hundreds of resources for healthcare professionals and their patients. our expert team regularly reviews them, and each one clearly displays the date it was last updated. whether you need an influenza vaccination standing order template, or a handout for parents about how to care for their infant after vaccination, you can find it here. search our extensive resource library using keywords or filters to quickly locate what you need.


									browse all clinical resources									









									vaccine information statements (viss)								

viss are produced by cdc and explain both the benefits and risks of a vaccine to recipients. because federal law requires that current viss be provided before each dose of certain vaccinations, all healthcare professionals who administer vaccines require the most up-to-date versions.
our unique repository of vis translations makes viss available in dozens of languages for vaccine recipients whose preferred language is not english. for these recipients, the use of translations alongside english language viss lowers barriers to important vaccination information and increases their confidence in vaccination. this repository is made possible through our cooperative agreement with cdc.
