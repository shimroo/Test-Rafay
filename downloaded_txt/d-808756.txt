true stories that make you face yourself & think








stirring accounts of hopeless lives and life-changing hope.


real people, true stories, dramatic accounts of brokenness and despair…and the hope that changes everything. unshackled, the award-winning radio drama from pacific garden mission in chicago, grips listeners around the world with compelling and relevant stories of transformed lives.
without jesus, we are all shacked by sin – by our wrong choices, disobedience, and selfish motives. but our god is a god of redemption, and the power of christ is able to set us free from this bondage. only then, do we become…unshackled!
