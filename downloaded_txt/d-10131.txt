not that kind of good guy - earc
it’s there for anyone to see: there are dark forces at work on the world, working to destroy civilization. all it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to stand by and do nothing. we need a good guy.

not all heroes wear capes—but some do

for a generation, individuals have arisen with super powers, able to change the course of history, or at least save a few lives. but these people have free will—and not all choose to work for the forces of good. we need someone with an unblotted escutcheon, a galahad for the 21st century, someone pure of ethics and morality.

not that kind of good guy

what we get is michael: the product of a broken childhood, raised in the foster system of one of america’s most dangerous inner cities, his wisdom comes from drug addicts and whores. maybe he’s not the hero we asked for, but he’s the hero we need. and he’s about to hit puberty.

but the woods hold secrets as dangerous as the yvags themselves. when a spectral figure emerges from the depths, leaving a trail only the ördstone can illuminate, thomas is drawn into a deadly mystery that challenges the limits of his courage and cunning. poisonous blooms, traps within traps, and a shocking betrayal await him in a perilous game of survival against ancient powers.

with each step, thomas ventures closer to uncovering the truth of his enemy’s dark designs—and the shadowy forces that may already control his fate.

1637: the pacific initiative - earc
the ring of fire saga reaches the pacific, where samurai, settlers, and native leaders shape the fate of a transformed new world. 
a cosmic catastrophe, the ring of fire, strands the west virginia town of grantville back in time in the middle of the thirty years war. one of its ripple effects is that japan has pulled back from a policy of isolation and staked out its own claims on the west coast of north america. but it is not the only power interested in that part of the new world, and the native americans have also responded, in different ways, to the unexpected colonists. and there are conflicts among the colonists themselves.

in settling the fate of this part of the new world, a few remarkable individuals have an outsize role to play: oyamada isamu, a samurai on his first independent command; yells-at-bears, a young native woman of vancouver island; father blanco, a jesuit priest and former missionary; and iroha data-hime, the daughter of the grand governor of new nippon.

so he’s got time.

however, there are forces on earth that while david may believe he is done with them, are by no means done with david. an escalating tit-for-tat is about to begin, over issues that will one day be worth far more money and power than heor anyone else can imagine. an escalation that will soon spiral out of all control, and david will find himself with no choice but to unleash the horrors of war on an unsuspecting populace. a war that will exact a price from his own flesh and blood before it is over.

friends indeed - earc
stephanie harrington must navigate conspiracy and danger to protect sphinx’s treecats and its future in this honorverse prequel.
the trouble with treecats

stephanie harrington didn’t discover treecats—they were indigenous to the planet sphinx, a colony of the tiny star kingdom of manticore. but at age ten she was the first human to bond with one. now, almost 17, she is the species greatest champion.

to the rest of the human galaxy, if they are known at all, they are recognized as tool using, socially organized, fuzzy little creatures, with no known method of communication—who also happen to be fierce hunters. but are they sapient . . .? because if they are, that would have all sorts of repercussions for the families who have settled on sphinx, the harringtons not the least.

there will be winners, and there will be losers. and stephanie is there to make sure the treecats don’t lose out.

but stephanie, the treecats, and sphinx itself may be caught up in an even greater conspiracy than the one to help the fighting ‘cats survive, one generations in the making . . .

baen books announces plans for eric flint’s ring of fire series


novels overseen by flint before his death as well as reprints of the best of the ring of fire press ebooks will carry the legacy of the best-selling alternate history series into the future.

riverdale, new york, april 9, 2024 — eric flint’s ring of fire is the best-selling alternate history series of all time. when the small, 20th century town of grantville, west virginia, is hurled through time and space to europe during the 17th century, the course of history is forever altered. and with the publication of eric flint’s groundbreaking first novel in the series, 1632, the course of the alternate history genre was forever changed. flint and baen books opened the series to coauthors and fan writers, who wove a tapestry of novels, novellas, ebooks, and short stories that created a densely populated world. with flint’s death in 2022, the future of the series was left uncertain.
now, baen books announces plans for the future of eric flint’s ring of fire. flint was working on the series up until the time of his passing. baen will release these final novels, which will be completed by the authors flint was developing the books with. beginning with 1635: the weaver’s code, cowritten by flint and nationally best-selling author jody lynn nye, baen will release:
      1635: the weaver’s code by eric flint and jody lynn nye (october 2024)
      1637: the pacific initiative by iver cooper
      title tbd by eric flint and walter hunt
      1637: pilgrim’s passage by eric flint & griffin barber
      title tbd by eric flint & charles e. gannon
in addition to the print novels, baen books will be rereleasing select books originally published by ring of fire press. these include former ring of fire press titles by vrginia demarce, bjorn hasseler, david carrico, paula goodlett & gorg huff, garret vance, bethann kim, and mike watson.
and while the grantville gazette, the online magazine edited by flint that featured stories set in the ring of fire series, will no longer be published, the flint estate has granted permission for a new online and ebook magazine to continue the tradition, begun by flint, of welcoming new authors into the series. more information about eric flint’s 1632 and beyond can be found at https://1632magazine.com. (note: baen books is not affiliated with eric flint’s 1632 and beyond.)


with new novels, reprints of ring of fire press books, and more, baen books is thrilled to continue eric flint’s legacy into the future.


 






on the passing of steve miller

steve miller, best known for the long-running liaden universe® series of space opera stories and novels, coauthored with his beloved wife and partner sharon lee, died february 20, 2024, in their home in waterville, maine. he was 73.
steve had been fighting heart trouble for several years and, old newspaperman that he was, had prepped his obituary for the trade months before. steve had worked many jobs before becoming a full time writer, including managing early bbs systems, acting as an internet librarian, owning and managing a science fiction themed used bookstore and art gallery with his wife, and acting as a freelance reporter for many baltimore area and national publications.
steve leaves behind a legacy that has profoundly shaped the landscape of science fiction and inspired a generation of new writers. last year saw the publication of their 100th collaboration together, the national best-selling science fiction novel salvage right; ribbon dance, also a liaden novel, is scheduled for release in june 2024, and sharon intends to continue the series as they had planned.
steve’s interest in chess was lifelong. he was a member of the university of maryland baltimore county chess league, a u.s. chess federation tournament director, president of the owings mills chess club, president of the waterville chess club, and ran numerous tournaments in many venues. he was part of waterville’s main chess league championship team in 1998.
we at baen honor not only his remarkable literary achievements but also the warmth, kindness, and boundless imagination that defined him as both an author and a friend. “he was one of the good guys,” said his publisher toni weisskopf. “a true light shining in the science fiction community.” in this time of sorrow, our thoughts and condolences are with sharon lee, and the countless fans whose lives have been touched by steve’s legacy.
steve was predeceased by his father, donald miller of madeira beach, fl, his stepfather, ronald l. moore, sr., and his mother, helen moore.  survived by his wife, sharon lee, and siblings donald george miller (kim), craig edward miller (brenda), cindy rex (ron prietz sr.), roland l. moore, jr. (kay) and numerous nieces and nephews.

eric flint 1947–2022


it is with a heavy heart that we share the news that eric flint has passed away. we were proud to publish eric’s first novel, mother of demons, in 1997, and to continue publishing his many worlds, including the best-selling ring of fire series that started with 1632.
there are several of eric’s works already delivered and on the schedule. eric was a tireless collaborator, and readers can also expect more of his works to be released with eric’s designated collaborators in the future.
we will be celebrating eric and his works on the baen free radio hour this week and the following week and encourage all to tune in.

to whom it may concern:
what is it we do at baen books? we publish books at the heart of science fiction and fantasy. 
science fiction has traditionally been a unique kind of intellectual pleasure, a process of glorious intercommunication and inspiration, with ideas flowing from scientist and engineer to writer and artist, to reader and viewer, back and forth, in a delightful mélange of shared thoughts, wild speculation, cautionary tales, reality checks, and the sheer fun of playing with boundaries and ideas. it is not for everyone. but those who enjoy it, take great pleasure in the dialogue.
when the modern form of sf began, with hugo gernsback and the other pulp magazines of the early 20th century, the publishers fostered that interaction through letter columns in the magazines and by encouraging science fiction readers to organize in clubs and meet in conventions. baen books continued that tradition with baen’s bar, a kind of virtual convention and on-line conversation that has been around in some form for over 20 years. 
the moderators are volunteers. the readers, editors, and writers post and interact on the bar at their own desire. some conversations have been gone over so many times, they’ve been retired as simply too boring to contemplate again. sometimes the rhetoric can get heated. we do not endorse the publication of unlawful speech. we have received no complaints about the content of the bar from its users.
that said, it has come to our attention that allegations about the bar have been made elsewhere. we take these allegations seriously, and consequently have put the bar on hiatus while we investigate. but we will not commit censorship of lawful speech.
it is not baen books’ policy to police the opinions of its readers, its authors, its artists, its editors, or indeed anyone else. this applies to posts at the bar, or on social media, on their own websites, or indeed anywhere else. on the bar, the publisher does not select what is allowed to be posted, and does not hijack an individual’s messages for their own purposes. similarly, the posts do not represent the publisher’s opinion, except in a deep belief that free speech is worthy in and of itself.
most sincerely,toni weisskopfpublisher

 





to all of those who expressed interest and support for baen's bar in recent weeks, we are happy to announce it is back on-line, though with some changes. baen is handing the bar over to its users, and will henceforth be run by sff forums, llc, and may be found at https://www.baensbar.net. returning users will be able to use the bar as usual, but new members will have to make a purchase at baen.com before they can log in. (note: new users will not have to buy a book; there is a bar tipjar option so they may contribute to the maintenance of the forum).
