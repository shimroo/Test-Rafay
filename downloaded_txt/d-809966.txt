conservation.more about what we doour organization     national wildlife refuge systemthe u.s. fish and wildlife service manages an unparalleled network of public lands and waters called the national wildlife refuge system. with more than 570 refuges spanning the country, this system protects iconic species and provides some of the best wildlife viewing opportunities on earth.programwashington,dcour species   image detailsbirdsthe islands and coastal lands of the alaska maritime refuge are bird magnets for seabirds whose only other home is the ocean; for birds migrating along asian routes and needing to rest and eat; for birds that evolved on these remote islands and breed nowhere else.  image detailsfishthe abundance of seabirds and marine mammals that breed and raise their young on the lands of the alaska maritime refuge is due to the banquet of marine foods in surrounding waters.  image detailsmammalson the mainland areas of the refuge, the native mammals are similar to those of nearby areas. on islands, however, native land mammals are either absent or sometimes unique because they have been isolated in their development since the ice age. marine mammals use these coastal lands to breed, raise their young, and rest.  image detailsplantsfrom the windswept and treeless aleutian and pribilof islands to the lush forests of southeast alaska,

provides long-term, time-series data. when the data reveal biologically-significant changes, scientists can test hypotheses about the causes of those changes. this long-term monitoring program is an integral part of the management of the alaska maritime refuge. the information it provides is used to define "normal" variability in demographic parameters and identify patterns that fall outside norms, thereby signaling conservation issues. the research vessel tiĝlax̂is key to accomplishing our mission.view all projects   working with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife,
