the center gave me life-saving information when i needed it most.















-sally k., boyle heights














medicare can be confusing. you are not alone.



that’s why the state of california, the county of los angeles, and the city of los angeles came together to fund the center for health care rights.pretty much everyone finds the paperwork overwhelming. there are too many options. tv commercials make it even more difficult to know your best medicare choice.call our helpline, meet with our counselors, attend a workshop, or check out our fact sheets.we’re not selling anything. we offer free, accurate, unbiased and helpful guidance that is tailored to your situation.
















we provide free medicare health insurance counseling to thousands of los angeles residents each year.




























i would be lost without the center for health care rights since medicare information is so confusing.
