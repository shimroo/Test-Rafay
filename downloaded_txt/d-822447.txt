kb kickboxing 
















 








do you struggle to feel motivated to get a workout in of a day? it’ll be a thing of the past if you join our kickboxing classes.our london kickboxing classes appeal to people looking for an alternative, engaging way to work out. the cardio-blasting nature of our kickboxing classes near king’s cross and euston is highly addictive. punching, kicking, blocking and moving at an accelerated pace is an exhilarating way to fight against a more sedentary way of life.aside from water breaks, a stretch and the time it takes the instructor to provide clear, concise instruction, you’ll be moving the whole hour. all of our members would tell you that being a martial artist at kb kickboxing has pushed their fitness to an unprecedented level. 







due to kelly bunyan’s black sash in kung fu (passed in 1991), kb kickboxing’s style is very much rooted in the ancient chinese martial art. you can learn more about our chief instructor, here. our instructors and members are very welcoming; they look forward to sharing the martial arts with you. as a united team, our classes generate an electric, collective energy – come and be charged by the ‘kb generator.’ 










kb martial arts journey 



what many of our members like most about our classes is the fact that they are progressive, so there is always something new to learn and achieve. we’ve been teaching a tried and tested system to our members for years. knowing what’s ahead is motivating, so here’s a brief outline of your first 6 months under our tutelage: 










month 1this will be the official start of your martial arts journey - how exciting! the aim is to familiarise yourself with a selection of the new kickboxing techniques you’ll be introduced to, including punches, kicks and blocks (e.g. round kick and a jab). you’ll be hitting focus mitts from the beginning, great for stress relief after a busy day. if you already know that you would like to start your grading journey, you can submit your name to take your kb kickboxing white belt. this can be taken after 3 months if you attend classes regularly, and follow the training plan. 










month 2you’ll be introduced to more of the school’s techniques, helping you to be a well-rounded martial artist. as well as fine-tuning the techniques, the main goal is to improve your footwork - move more. at the beginning, people need to stand still to concentrate, but this month you’ll be encouraged to move at all times, which will help you push your fitness to a whole new level.
 










month 3the ultimate goal is to miss fewer calls. martial arts fitness needs to be built up. now that you’re more familiar with the techniques, it’s time to strive to do every call. it’s also time to decide if you wish to take your blue belt in month 6. (names are submitted in month 3). 










month 4it’s time to spar! sparring means kicking and punching your training partners with light contact, in protective kit. we are a semi-contact school so all contact is controlled. sparring pushes your fitness to a whole new level and it’s so exhilarating! it’s also great for your self-defence because you’re actually applying the techniques, particularly the blocks, that we’ve been teaching you for 3 months. it’s a chance to put all you’re learning into action.  










month 5this month’s main focus is to apply the punches and kicks you’ve learnt, with the correct range. range is knowing where to stand in order to land your technique correctly, e.g. a jab with a straight arm, rather than bent. a roundhouse with the top of the foot, not the shin, connecting. understanding your range is also great for self-defence as if you had to land a strike on an attacker, you’ll have a better understanding of how far away to stand. 










month 6you’ll be feeling the unique, euphoric grading high this month! you’ll be ready to move to the school’s chief instructor’s classes for final preparation. it’s an incredible moment when kelly (kb) shouts, blue beeelllt and awards you your kb kickboxing blue belt on grading day!!

our team will be with you every step of the way with regular check-ins and feedback, to make sure you are on the right track to achieving your full potential. trust that it’s also fine if you’d rather not spar or grade; it is your choice and we’ll be here supporting you, whatever route you take on your martial arts journey. 















kb kickboxing class content 



kb kickboxing’s approach to teaching kickboxing techniques is quite revolutionary in the world of martial arts. kelly’s style of kickboxing is very different to all other kickboxing schools; it is unique. she has applied her extensive knowledge of kung fu, boxing and kickboxing to ensure that the martial arts is accessible to all.each class lasts for one hour. the lesson begins with a 10 minute warm-up, which incorporates punching and blocking. after a 7-10 minute stretch, the remainder of the class involves kicking and punching. the classes incorporate air work and pad work, the latter being great for self-defence, learning where to be stood to land a strike is key. 









 








our members’ skills are also perfected by sparring with other students (controlled, equipped contact practice). our lessons are semi-contact, focused on boosting morale, not demoralising. violence and aggression do not exist in kb fitness’s vocabulary. martial arts training within our school is highly controlled. the focus of our classes is not to hit hard and ‘damage’ other members of the class – everybody’s got to go to work the next day after all. some of our students never wish to spar, which is absolutely fine. there is never any contact with another person for these students, they just work in the air or onto gloves. 








 








new ideas and techniques are introduced week by week. the first classes should be treated as a starting block. starting from the basic stance, students learn the kickboxing moves step by step. special attention is given to you so that you are learning at a speed that is suited to you. every lesson provides new kickboxing tips and advice.our lessons meet the demands of the experienced and fit, as well as complete beginners and those of us whom could be fitter. all the classes will push you consistently through new limits, although you will be encouraged to choose your own pace throughout the session.an example: if the task is to throw 2 side kicks, you can kick just once if that is sufficient for you; after a few classes you’ll be able to do 2. 







all in all, the classes really work you hard. the music and collective energy keep your adrenaline going and the buzz comes from the high-impact routine (you can train at a lower impact if you need to). a great work out, leaving you feeling fantastic afterwards. the lessons are not ‘set to’ music as such, the beat is just a motivational force working with the instructor to push you. 















kickboxing benefits 



kick to the top: at kb kickboxing, we teach people to soar, through finding their inner fire. join the school and be ignited. it takes a lot to step into the unknown, but once you edge outside of the safe parameters of your current lifestyle, the benefits are life-changing: there is a great, uplifting vibe and energy in our classes.training with us stimulates the mind and develops inner strength. it’s an excellent way to relieve stress – by shouting, punching and kicking. our members are literally walking taller, with so much more confidence. 








 











 




							have you been feeling lethargic?						


						the kickboxing workout will certainly energise you. it really is addictive, you'll be raring to go from the off. the more you practise, the more alive you'll feel.					
















 




							does getting into better shape matter to you - are there some clothes that you really want to get into?						


						if so, combining the classes with nutritional and weight training advice will help you fit into them.					
















 




							are you feeling overwhelmed by life?						


						having a new focus in life, a form of escapism, can give you just the boost you need to fight back. when becoming skilled in something as powerful as the martial arts, it is impossible not to actually feel empowered.					
















 




							were you always rubbish at sport / the last person to be picked for the school team?						


						training in the martial arts is so confidence-boosting, because everybody can excel in it. our proven system can unleash the inner martial artist in the least sporty person. if you were great at sport, it's another string to add to your bow.					













we could go on and on, pointing out all of the positive outcomes – of which there is a copious amount. however, isn’t it best to just dive in and get started? if you agree…
