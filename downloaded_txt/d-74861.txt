since 1994 millennium restaurant has been committed to providing fresh, innovative vegan cuisine. millennium restaurant offers globally inspired plant-based fare in an inviting fine dining setting. working with small farms, our menu changes constantly to showcase the finest local, sustainable, and organic produce at its peak. thoughtfully blending flavors from around the world with classic techniques, we create vibrant dishes that are exciting to diners of all kinds. our bar features inventive cocktails highlighting our house-made infusions and fresh juices, as well as craft beers and an internationally recognized wine list.the restaurant recently moved from san francisco to rockridge with a refreshed menu of our locally sourced, elegantly plated concoctions, which might include purple cauliflower fritto or polenta croutons on pickled carrot salad. the interior is upscale but not fussy, with rustic woods, metal floor tiles, exposed ductwork and plenty of bar and table seating – plus a spacious, modern outdoor patio.
