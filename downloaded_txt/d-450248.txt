 five decades of research and exploration in the turkana basin, kenya




























































mission statement

the continued research in the turkana basin will further the global understanding of human origins and the context in which it occurred through the recovery and investigation of new fossil material from deposits in northern kenya.
the koobi fora region has, over the last 35 years of exploration, produced a wealth of paleontological, geological and archaeological data. research in the area has revealed a complex history of volcanism, tectonics and sedimentary cycles preserving fluvial and lake phases of the basin. some 16,000 fossil specimens have been collected from the turkana basin, almost 10,000 from the koobi fora region.
