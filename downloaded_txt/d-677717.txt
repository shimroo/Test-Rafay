me and my family had a wonderful stay at the resort, the ladies at the reception were so friendly and very helpful towards our stay. i loved the fact that we could purchase our theme park tickets at the reception of the resort. we will definatly recommend the resort and will be back to stay again this time next year.marley hampsoni have just returned home after a pleasant stay at the isle of palms resort. the rooms were comfortable and clean, my only comment would be that they had the ‚Äúclosed up‚Äù smell when first arriving, but that didn‚Äôt hang around long and was forgotten after the first night.
the area felt safe and the convenient location to the pines shopping centre was really helpful when returning later than expected. lucy at reception was brilliant to deal with, she was prompt, helpful and always friendly. lucy is a great asset to the resort. thank you very much for a great stay.
wiki.wiki powerwe recently stayed at isle of palms resort with our 2 children and my parents. we thoroughly enjoyed our experience staying here. the water front apartment was perfect for the 6 of us, plenty of room and was nice and clean. we could cook our meals in the well appointed kitchen (with diswasher!) and use the bbq‚Äôs provided close by. the kids really loved swimming every day at the 2 pools onsite. the pines shopping centre was fantastic, had everything we needed and was only 5 minutes walk from the resort. we particularly liked the security gates and staff were extremely helpful, making check in hassle free. we would definitely stay again.
the resort itself was only 20 ‚Äì 30 mins drive from the theme parks and we liked the fact that we could get away out of the over populated areas and return back to a more relaxed and laid back area of the coast. thumbs up!katrina andrewi had a great time at isle of palms in august. i stayed in unit 41 from 18th august for 9 nights. i visit gold coast every year, but this was my first stay at isle of palms.
reception staff were very kind and friendly, the location is perfect!
i came back to japan, and i talked about my experience at isle of palms. i recommend my friends to stay here and of course i will be back to stay here again.
