                                               a frosty row in seldovia                              « ‹   										of																					684										   › »               
in seldovia, you will experience gorgeous views of majestic mountains sitting over sparkling waters, long stretches of sandy shores and plentiful and towering spruce forests reaching from the tree line to the water’s edge.   we believe seldovia is one of alaska’s most beautifully situated seaside towns where visitors will always find the beauty they are looking for,  inseparable from our welcoming people.  the authenticity of seldovia’s citizens will make you feel at home, and give you cause to remember your journey to the true alaska with fondness!
