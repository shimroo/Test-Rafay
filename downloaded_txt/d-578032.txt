our history

the story of the mantis design's creation is an amazing tale of conflict, survival and conquest, culminating in national poster-tours, exposure of mantis design products in popular culture and many frosty beverages.  somewhere in the mix there was a significant amount of hard-core mountain-biking, leusirely snowboarding, and absurd quantities of sushi.since we're not yet sure how to tell this tale without compromising national security, this content is temporarily on-hold until such time as we can indentify the danger of releasing this top-secret information and complete a workable plan to assess and repair the resulting damage to society and the planet at large.please visit us again in the near future to see if we've revealed this sordid, legendary epic for your amusement.

house rules of poker


24" x 36" poster






amazon review (5 stars):"i love it!"



the periodic table of rock & roll


36" x 24" poster


















amazon review (5 stars): historic insight & hindsight combined"this item of historic insight & hindsight shows somebody really loved doing their homework.  the culturenik company was a real pleasure to do business with — now i have two of these frame worthy items, and may order more ahead.  such a 'period' piece, there ought to be an app that'd play samples when the 'elements' are selected. :)"

so many beers…so little time (puzzle)


1000-piece puzzle






amazon review (5 stars): now i'm thirsty"this is a fun, fun puzzle. it's easy to get sections; some bottle labels are very distinctive, either by color or by lettering. but then how do they fit together? why do so many beers use white lettering on a green background? i'm trying to recall if that particular letter style is pilsner urquell or heineken. it actually came together fairly quickly for a 1000 piece puzzle, even with the box out of sight in a closet (the only fair way to attack a puzzle). i'd even had about a third of the beers depicted in the puzzle, which thankfully included very few overhopped modern ipas. of course, when i finished it, i celebrated with a…coke. (it was 11am, folks!!)."



periodic table of beer styles


24" x 36" poster






amazon review (5 stars): i hadn't bought a poster in years"this poster contains way more information than i expected. it is organized and informative. i thought it would be kinda funny to have a periodic table of beer, but this posters no joke. it has beer styles by category and describes the styles using ibus and srm. i bought this on sale for 44 cents plus shipping which worked out to be about 5 bucks. this poster is definitely worth it."



house rules (college)


24" x 36" poster






amazon review (5 stars): new pad"this is going in the cave, right next to the keg. like it cuz it covers all the bases. blah."





house rules of the living dead

surviving the zombie outbreak (book)


7.9" x 5" paperback, 271 pages






amazon review (5 stars): awesome book"if you liked the zombie survival guide, you'll like this. it is similar to the zsg except with less 'fluff' in terms of stories, etc and written as a real survival guide. includes a lot of real information in such a fictional book, some highly in detail, some slightly simplified (examples include assisting in child birth, descriptions of all firearm actions, firearms safety, how to clear and unload firearms, etc). lots of pictures to make it interesting as well."

36" x 24" poster






amazon review (5 stars): glad this poster is here"i bought this poster and framed it as a gift for my husband, who finds comfort in this quote, as i do.  he loved it and immediately hung it in his home office where he can enjoy it whenever he wants.  i sometimes stop by his office just to read it again myself.  it's a big hit in our home…





america's most wanted


24" x 36" / 12" x 36" posters





















amazon review (5 stars): love it!"this is the perfect poster for any stoner's room!  goes great with all of my other marijuana-related decor!  this poster will defiantly be on my wall for a long time!"



so many papers…so little time


12" x 36" poster









periodic table of cannabis


24" x 36" poster






amazon review (5 stars): eye candy for science/weed lovers"my friends thought it would be funny to replace my actual periodic table with this one (it was pretty hilarious).  as a science nerd, i love this poster.  it's creative, fun to look at, and has some great information about cannabis.  it's pretty amazing the people who made this were able to match each of the strains with the actual elemental symbols.  the only thing i dislike about this poster is that some of teh numbers are repeated, but with different strains (the real table assigns each element a unique number).  oh well.  everything else is perfect.  there's even some facts about thc, the benefits of cannabis, and the three different species (sativa, indica, and ruderalis).  if you love weed and/or science, this poster is a must-have."
