    asian/pacific gays & friends
los angeles


a/pgf is an non-profit, social and educational group established for gay asians and friends who share an interest in asian cultures and experiences.  
a/pgf's primary purpose is to provide a supportive environment where the interaction between members is enjoyable, safe and enriching. 


dear apgf members     the recent catastrophic events can not be understated.  however the silver lining, that is our members, continue to shine through.  the supportive, caring, hospitable, protective, courageous, selfless, and loving strength that our members have exhibited during these times define us, not as an organization, but as a family.     our family has always remained front and center, rather than the organization.  we are so very proud of you all.  please continue to keep yourselves safe and alert in the coming days.  we have much to celebrate at our upcoming annual gala dinner on march 22ndyour apgf board
