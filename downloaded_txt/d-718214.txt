we must live our enlightenment 
as a world event. 
we must search within to find our answers. 
we must question all we have learned. 
we must discern for ourselves  
what is truth and what is not  
for ultimately
we are the only authority.
out of a framework such as this,
sacred, creative thought will arise
bringing into being a world of peace,
love, and prosperity,
and thus we will become
a source of peace and love in the world.
let us love one another,
as he loved us, and loves us.


































  

"let the one who seeks continue seeking 
until what is sought is found.

when that which is sought is found
the seeker will be wise.

once wise, the seeker will transcend all
and will attain rest and will be
at peace concerning everything.  ~the gospel of thomas






































































































"every gun that is made, every warship
launched, every rocket fired, signifies in the final sense a theft from
those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not
clothed." ~president dwight d. eisenhower: april 16, 1953.
