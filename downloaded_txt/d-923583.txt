                                        this place is absolutely amazing. we love it. you  can change your money into old time money and spend it in all the shops and pub. you can buy fish and chips and also eat them in the pub with a open log fire. been a few times and can't wait to go back.

                                        this trip has reminded me that, simply, this is the greatest concentration of historical sites in the uk. if you make one visit to the uk, and you want to visit one heritage spot, make it ironbridge.
