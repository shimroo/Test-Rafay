cnc punching
the starting point for nearly all sheet metal fabrication items is blanking; at rhino mfg. blanking is done on punch press machines. rhino manufacturings two cnc turret punches plow through production with extreme speed and accuracy. 
these machines are capable of holding tolerances of better than 0.005” and can punch parts using over 50 different shaped tools at a time.



forming
using our four cnc press brakes to form complicated three dimensional shapes and features with bends up to 12 feet long. speed, accuracy & repeatability are the key to forming; our brakes regularly hold better than 0.005” tolerances and keep angles within +/- ½ degree of nominal. 
hydraulic clamping rams and quick change tooling help us to change tools and setup machines in a fraction of the time required by other companies.



specialty welding
truly rhino mfg.’s specialty! need your welds to be structurally sound and still look great? no problem! mild steel, stainless steel, coated steel, aluminum; rhino manufacturing welds it all.
capable of mig, tig, spot-welding, seam-welding, and even robotic welding our welders are fast and effective while maintaining excellent quality.




 





finishing
rhino mfg.’s 3 axis cnc machines round out our metal working capabilities. our in house prototyping and programming allows for rapid realization of product from a solid model or cad drawing. 
we machine all types of metal, creating features as simple as tapped holes and countersinks to complex features and 4 axis surfaces.



assembly
whether your parts get press hardware, rivets or nuts and bolts rhino mfg.’s assembly department has the equipment and skill to perform the assembly.  
additionally our electrical assembly department builds industrial panels and wires together breakers, contactors, relays, switches and more under our ul 508 certification.














 
since our last meeting, i have been paying closer attention to the purchases going out to rhino.   managing the supply chain has shifted quite a bit of our ongoing work to you.   your performance, consistency, and collaboration have made you the go-to shop for metal products!       congratulations on your largest quarter yet! 
there is no reason that it shouldn’t continue this way!  hang on for another ride! 
great to see this relationship working out so well.    you have a great team and solid principles.  
 thank you,
matt t.
 
rhino mfg. did a fantastic job with such short notice building the gutter wire way. i really appreciate the phone calls asking questions to make sure we got what we needed. it looks exactly how i wanted it and matched the drawings perfectly. i look forward to working with you again." deb d.
