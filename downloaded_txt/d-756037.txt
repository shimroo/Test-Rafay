cinema en verite


jim mcdermott
13 february 2025
 

as streaming services reshape film distribution and the role of film in popular culture, critics including quentin tarantino, have reopened the debate around whether the art of film storytelling has been compromised. so how did we arrive at this point of scepticism, and is the magic of cinema salvageable?

the use and abuse of tariffs


andrew hamilton
12 february 2025
 



can tariffs really create a fair economy? as president trump’s administration leans into protectionist trade policies, we must ask whether these strategies undermine the values of mutual respect and shared prosperity that should define both national and international relationships.

is google shaping faith in america?


michael mcveigh
12 february 2025
 

vice president jd vance’s defense of trump’s executive orders has ignited a theological debate on "ordo amoris"—the order of love. critics argue that reducing love to a hierarchical formula distorts catholic social teaching. but is the influence of big tech reshaping both religious thought and our global priorities?

three poets: john kelly, isabella g. mead, warwick mcfadyen


andrew hamilton
14 february 2025
 


 



these poets offer distinct reflections on life, faith, and human experience in their recent work. from kelly’s reflective musings on faith and education to mead’s exploration of motherhood and nature, and mcfadyen’s grappling with grief, their works search for a ‘something more’.

bluesky thinking: can the internet rebuild its town square?


jenny sinclair
07 february 2025
 

in the wake of elon musk’s tumultuous twitter takeover, the social media landscape has fractured, scattering digital discourse across competing platforms. bluesky, threads, and mastodon each offer a vision of what comes next, but will any replicate the vital, unruly town square twitter once was?

in a world of rigid borders, who belongs?


nirmal ghosh
07 february 2025
 



amongst hardening borders and rising ethnonationalism globally, those who resist rigid identity labels find themselves caught between worlds — too foreign for home, too foreign for here. if identity is both fluid and contested, can belonging ever be more than a temporary state?

japan poems


geoff page
12 february 2025
 

where do cultures start, we ask? what forgotten emperor thought up walls without graffiti? i’m told now that it’s not that simple. japan when under martial law was famous for its litter.

still completely unknown


barry divola
30 january 2025
 

the flame war over a complete unknown burns like a fire on main street, with dylan die-hards railing against its liberties, sometimes without even seeing it. but in their quest for accuracy, they overlook a deeper truth: when has bob dylan ever let facts stand in the way of a good story?

we’re outraged with hypocrisy. is that hypocritical?


barry gittins
29 january 2025
 

as the news cycle fills with exposés of hypocrisy, from politicians to celebrities, we are confronted with uncomfortable questions: when should we hold others to account, and when should we accept the contradictions in ourselves and others? the answers, it seems, lie somewhere between judgment and grace.

could deepseek be a gift to the developing world?


stephen minas
10 february 2025
 

the launch of deepseek's new ai model has upended conventional wisdom about who controls the future of artificial intelligence. with its open-source nature and unprecedented affordability, it may offer the global south a rare opportunity to become creators and beneficiaries of ai innovation.

the art of the self-serving deal


andrew hamilton
06 february 2025
 



donald trump’s presidency, often dismissed as chaotic, follows a clear, transactional logic: power over principle, loyalty over institutions, and reshaping america into a high-stakes deal-making enterprise. but history suggests such a system cannot last. in the meantime, how should we respond?

the moral dilemma of negotiating with putin


sergey maidukov sr.
04 february 2025
 

as global powers weigh the prospect of negotiating with vladimir putin, indicted for war crimes, the moral dilemma looms: can peace justify sitting down with a war criminal? this question, compounded by the ongoing suffering in ukraine, forces leaders to balance expediency against the principles of justice, accountability, and human rights.

a sweet, sorrowful midnight walk in broome


sandy toussaint
13 february 2025
 

in broome, the work of the royal commission into aboriginal deaths in custody uncovers not only personal grief but also the enduring systemic failures that continue to claim indigenous lives. as the commission’s findings remain largely unimplemented, the question remains: why has australia failed to meaningfully address the injustice of these deaths?

when neighbours were family on argyle street


erica cervini
05 february 2025
 

in 1940s australia, neighbourhoods pulsed with neighborly connection — a stark contrast to today’s soaring rates of loneliness. as societies grow increasingly fragmented and isolation deepens, can that bygone era offer any lessons on healing our contemporary disconnection?

what the great teachers leave behind


warwick mcfadyen
29 january 2025
 


 







the relationship between a teacher and a student can be profound in ways that are not realised at the time. as schools go back, it's worth revisiting the gratitude we have for our great teachers, and reaffirming how a mentor’s gentle encouragement can shape a lifetime.

the priest who tried to warn people about the khmer rouge


ray cavanaugh
05 february 2025
 





 










when the khmer rouge seized cambodia, western intellectuals dismissed reports of atrocities as propaganda. but french missionary fr françois ponchaud persisted in exposing the regime’s horrors. with his passing, we remember a man who saw the truth before the world was ready to listen.

on 'getting' the synod


richard lennan
19 december 2024
 

is the synod a parliament, a shareholder meeting, or something wholly unique? how we frame it shapes our understanding of its purpose and outcomes. beyond analogies, could the true essence of synodality lie in embracing grace and discernment, re-centering the church on its divine mission?

all religion is local


john warhurst
03 december 2024
 2 comments







the synod of bishops may mark a turning point for the catholic church, but the real work now begins — locally. from diocesan councils to parish communities, the challenge lies in translating synodality into action. in australia, divergent episcopal views and a patchy history of reform raise critical questions about the church’s future.
