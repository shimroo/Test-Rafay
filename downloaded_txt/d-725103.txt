 that's me, at age 4, rocking the izod. super-stylish.









 



 nice to meet you. me? i am:a fractional creative director.a brand strategist.a storyteller.a marketer.a designer.a developer.a devsignoper.an entrepreneur.a beatboxer.a ui/ux designer.someone who knows the difference between ui and ux.whole-heartedly, intensely, and enthusiastically on team oxford comma.a native new yorker living in the atlanta metro.a tinkerer.short.a beer nerd.an affirmed alliteration advocate.an extraordinarily mediocre guitar player.a fan of breaking up lists into artificially short sentence fragments for dramatic effect.the creative birdy on your shoulder.the friendly voice in your head saying “yes we can.” 















for over 20 years, 



i have been infusing brand strategy with creative principles, tech savvy, and self-effacing wit to help companies craft compelling messages and build their brands. i do this by sticking to three guiding principles: versatility, motivation, and teamwork.   











 





 


								versatility							

								my career has been spent with large companies, small agencies, and entrepreneurial endeavors.							







							my career has been spent with large companies, small agencies, and entrepreneurial endeavors –						

							i have been employee #300-something, employee #12, and employee #1 – and i am versed in dilbert-esque corporate dynamics (ask me about “appropriate foliage”), practiced in ignoring the clacking cacophony of the foosball table, and frighteningly effective at bouncing ideas off of my twisted bamboo plant.

i have created corporate communication campaigns for b2b and b2c clients that run the media gamut of brand messaging, logo design, print collateral design, web design, web development, and interactive presentation creation; from the coca-cola company to my uncle’s law firm.						


















 


								motivation							

								many strategists have mbas; many creatives have bfas. i have a bachelor of science in biomedical engineering. 							







							many strategists have mbas; many creatives have bfas; many technologists have computer science degrees. i have a bachelor of science in biomedical engineering. 						

							an engineering education focuses on problem-solving: state the challenge, understand the set of rules (physical constraints) and the set of tools (assets) and find a creative solution. marketing, whether strategic, creative, technical, or all three, follows the same pattern.

all relevant skills are 100% self-taught or absorbed from colleagues, from strategies and foundational principles of design and marketing to becoming a zen master of photoshop to the alphabet soup of html, css, php, and mysql. that which i do not know becomes a challenge to conquer. i think yoda said that.						


















 


								teamwork							

								although i operated my business as a sole proprietorship for 11 years, i love a good team.							







							although i operated as a sole proprietorship for 11 years, i love a good team*						

							i have taught print designers how to strategically design for the web, worked with propellerheads to convince them that good design increases usability, and have secured executive buy-in on marketing campaigns. i have been a freelancer, have managed freelancers, and have worked collaboratively in small teams.

collaboration is important; collaboration makes magic happen; collaboration combines individual contributions and magnifies them exponentially; collaboration is social. lennon and mccartney wrote “a day in the life”; mccartney, on his own, wrote “wonderful christmastime.” q.e.d.
* full disclosure: i also love the new york jets, which can hardly be described as “a good team.”

moving pictures 



video is where brands get to literally speak to their customers. video is where brands truly shine.from overly silly displays of personality to marketing engagements to multimillion-dollar philanthropic campaign announcements, i’ve produced, directed, storyboarded, scripted, voiceovered, starred in, shot, and edited…sometimes all in the same video.videos i’ve made have been viewed over 500,000 times. not all of which were my mom.
