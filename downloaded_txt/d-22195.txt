exhibitors can upload documents and attach them to individual entries, as appropriate, or to the exhibitors account. these can then be verified and/or printed out at the fair office. documents uploaded can be registration certificates, health papers, photos or many other types of documents required, by the fair, for the exhibitor or individual entry.
what does it cost to take entries online? 
in addition to your normal yearly blue ribbon upgrade and support, an additional yearly online support fee of just $99 is paid prior to the start of the online entry process. contact us for special offers.
there is a per exhibitor fee for taking entries online. this is only for entries submitted by the exhibitor online and does not apply to entries you may enter into blue ribbon on your office computer. no matter which way the fair decides to handle the fee, there is only one fee for each exhibitor and it applies for an unlimited of entries for the given show or fair per year. there are 2 options for handling the convenience fees.
1. if the fair pays the convenience fee, then it is based on the number of exhibitors that enter online. this is a sliding scale that ranges from a low of $1 up to a maximum of $2 per exhibitor. the rate is based on the total number of exhibitors entering online. the more that enter online, the lower the rate and the greater the overall savings for the fair.
2. if the fair wishes to have the exhibitor pay the convenience fee, it will be a flat $2 per exhibitor. remember, there is only one convenience fee per online exhibitor for each show or fair per year and always for an unlimited number of entries.
if the fair elects to collect entry fees or sell tickets, passes, etc. online via credit cards, there may be transaction charges from their financial institution, but never any additional fees will be due martech systems. 
take entries 24x7 
the online entries site is open to take entries 24 hours a day, seven days a week. exhibitors will visit the fair's website at their convenience where they will find a link to the fair's blue ribbon fair online entries site. the exhibitor will create an account and make their entry selections; they can return to their online account another day to complete their entries or after completing entries on one day can return another day to select more entries. the fair has the ability to define different entry deadlines for different types of entries.
sell tickets and passes online 
your online site also lets you sell admission tickets, gate passes, parking passes, and even general admission grandstand entertainment tickets. the per online account convenience fee is charged but no additional fee or percentage is charged for additional item sales.
reduce errors and increase productivity 
taking entries online relieves your staff from a large data entry burden.  processing hand written entry forms takes time and resources that are increasingly scarce.  promoting your online entry site will reduce staff workload and data entry errors. the online system automatically validates entries as they are made, so the data in the fair management system is more accurate and complete.
credit card processing capabilities

						a "no credit card processing" option is, also, availble when the fair does not need to
						collect fees online.

martech systems has provided mobile applications and devices for entering judging results and weighins for more than 15 years. we programmed the first symbol palm pilot devices back in 2000 long before the competition even thought of using mobile applications. as new devices and technology have arrived on the market, martech systems has been implementing those technologies. winfair mobile first used tablet devices in 2011 and now this application not only has the ability to use ipad and android tablets but also laptops and smartphones on the fairgrounds or away from the fair office.
winfair mobile gold, our newest mobile version, is a web application with offline capabilities and it allows you to use your ipad or android tablet device, notebook or smartphone for entering data at the show area away from the fair office via a browser based interface. an wireless internet connection is required to sync data from the cloud to the device and then back to the desktop. once data is synced, the devices can be used away from the internet. the device is only online at the time data is being synced between the devices. different departments can be synced to separate devices allowing judging to be done in multiple locations simultaneously. the device used must be running a current version of a popular browser such as edge, chrome, firefox or safari. a built in camera in the device is required to scan barcodes or qr codes for judging results.
easy to use and reliable 
with the click of a button in windows fair management, the mobile application and the required data are loaded from the fair computer onto the mobile device via wifi. data entry of judging results or market weights can be completed easily by anyone at the judging site or at the scale. the wifi connection is only needed at the time the data is either checked out or checked in to the main computer in the office.
rfid tags and barcodes 
an important function, at the fair in todays world, is the ability to have a secure way to identify and track market animals both at weighins and at the fair. rfid tags and scanners provide this capability. a relatively low-cost rfid scanner linked with a tablet device or smartphone (ipad or android) allows you to track this id number at weighin, checkin and the judging arena quickly and efficiently.

						qr codes or barcodes on entry tags along with your tablet device or smartphone (ipad or android) can also be used to enter judging results quickly and easily right where the exhibits are judged. 
						
reduce entry errors and increase staff productivity 
winfair mobile relieves your staff from a large data entry burden. processing hand written judging sheets or weigh in worksheets takes time and resources that are increasingly scarce. winfair mobile will not only reduce staff workload but also reduce data entry errors. the device is brought back to the main computer and the information collected is effortlessly snyced back into your windows fair management program.

ok the test. they were great about calling me back on a very timely basis and never lost patience with me when they had to repeat themselves time and time again.
                        so glad we made the change from showorks. 
kathy simmons, amador county fair, ca 
it worked great (online entries). so user friendly and easy on my end as well. i loved being able to just push one button and all entries were downloaded. 
margaret kalb, douglas county fair, ks  
"the arapahoe county fair returned to the martech fair management system after using a competitors system for one year. the reasons for returning to the martech system are 1. better and more knowledgeable support before and during the fair. 2. better and more reliable reports. reports are much easier to export from the martech system. 3. much easier to navigate with data entry and checking for mistakes concerning data input. 4. the competitors online entry system did not have the software programming that we needed to do online entries."
kathy mcdaniel, arapahoe county fair, co
we like that it is user friendly and easy to navigate through.  the support from martech is the best overall.
