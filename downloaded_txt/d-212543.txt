978-0578906010"chadwick is striking in her pursuit and defense of the truth with regard to the person beneath the habit and the songs."the singing nun story by d.a. chadwickreviewed by janet green for readers favoriteâ when you think of a singing nun, visions come to mind of a habit-clad woman dancing in a field of wildflowers on a hill, spinning happily with palms up, belting out a healthy hymn. but the story of the singing nun is anything but that vision. it is a portrayal of the few spots of joy and the consuming tragedy that was this young nun's life, stopped short by suicide, and an inability to feel accepted in a world outside the convent. in this updated biography, d.a. chadwick compassionately reveals the tumultuous, angst-filled journey traveled by jeannine decker, soeur sourire (sister smile). through journals, photos, interviews, and other well-documented research, we come to know this nun and her partner ann pecher, who many would say was decker's lover as much as best friend.â chadwick is striking in her pursuit and defense of the truth with regard to the person beneath the habit and the songs. soeur sourire, as decker preferred to be known, was tragic in character, constantly second-guessing herself, her talents, her commitments, her sexuality, and eventually her ability to survive the overwhelming stressors that were continually dealt her. through her ordeals, ann faithfully would join her, even to the very end in her own suicide alongside decker. for a passionate and well-turned biography, this novel is recommended for its fluid reading and what is probably the closest thing to the truth ever written about this historical figure, soeur sourire, the singing nun.â up date: new documentary on soeur sourire!this summer a new film on the singing nun will be released in france by,â  charles-antoine de rouvre who is a french documentary director.â he has been commissioned by the european cultural tv channel arte to direct a 52 minutes documentary on jeannine deckers with zeta productions.â i did an interview in february 2021 by zoom since covid-19 put a stop to flying to paris with aaron chervenak as the cameraman, audio tech and director. he was great and fun to work with. the documentary will air in europe this summer.â
