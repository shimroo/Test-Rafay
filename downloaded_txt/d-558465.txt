grewehopefully we will all live to see the day when the german 
shepherd dog world will be under the same concept, that of a well-structured, 
perfectly balanced dog capable of performing at the highest known levels. 
perhaps we will see the day when fashion gives way to balance and the golden 
middle rises supreme, not as a choice among many, but rather as the only 
sensible option. in the meantime, on the eve of the centennial celebration of 
the "king of breeds" on this earth, let us remember the final plea of its 
founder, max von stephanitz's last words to his good friend muller on his 
deathbed, "take this trouble for me: make sure my german shepherd 
dog remains a working dog, for i have struggled all my life long for that 
aim".

steady and sure, impossible to find fault, always full of self-confidence with nerves of steel.

you can find information on ragan's sire link on our home page here 
you can find information on eddie, ragan's dam on this page  here
this is ragan's full brother quigley  click here
 
we sold ragan at 8 week of age and she was raised in texas as a companion and agility dog. 
sometime things in our lives change and we have to change our directions. this happened with ragan and we were able to bring her back home and do some training with her. 
she reminds us so much of her dam "eddie" in her wiliness to work and eagerness to learn that we are going to add her to our breeding program. 
  ragan has a broad and powerful head with captivating expression.
nice dark bi-color with correct structure great bone strength, strong, muscular body type built for performance.
she has a nice temperament, confident and calm in new places.
 
friendly and outgoing disposition showing great train-ability and has the genetic capability to learn quickly.
 superior bonding capability with the handler and naturally guide-able, follows the obedience commands willingly.
highly motivated to work, athletic and quick to do anything asked of her. enthusiastic and enjoys performing, loves to play with a ball.  

we have worked her with a decoy only a few times and she has a lot of drive for the decoy and no problem biting with a full confident grip.
  we feel ragan has grown up to be exactly what we look for in our breeding females.

1-11&12-25 ragan entered her first akc show. she earned two legs towards her bn title. on saturday with a very nice 193 and took second on sunday with another very nice 196. good girl!

i would like to share a few words that express my thoughts on breeding working german shepherds. 
       there was a germany before ww2 and all the german shepherds came from that stock.
what made the ddr program keep the dogs healthier and in some ways stronger in character is not the fact 
that they were bred in the northeastern part of the former unified germany.
it was because of the regulations the east government set for their police and working breeds after removing 
these breeds from the kennel club control and regulating their breeding programs governmentally.
  the dogs all came from the same place. but went into different directions because of different breed regulations and controls.
since the fall of the ddr and germany's reunification, the west (sv) regulations have been the only regulations in place.
and we all saw the direction the west dogs had gone with their attitude about breeding. 
 there were some isolated breeders in germany (west) who bred according to their own standard they set for themselves.
greif comes from one of those, as did dogs like bussecker schloss etc.
        my point to all this is that it matters most how dogs are bred, not where.
some dogs in west germany, or czech, or holland, or belgium, or austria, or switzerland were awesome.
the fact that nobody seemed to care how these dogs were used in breeding is what caused the problems. 
it is getting very hard to find any good ddr stock.
there is no more ddr regulation stock.
so you have to settle for pedigrees with ddr dogs in them.
my point is that people slapping dogs who go back to ddr lines together does not make it a ddr dog, even if they claim 100%.
ddr dogs are german dogs anyway.
the reason they were not messed up was because of the regulations the ddr had.
nobody follows those regulations, so there are no more ddr dogs.
once again my point to this is: 
                       dogs who produced the same traits are important

discussed and agreed upon by armin winkler and jim reed
 just who is looking after you and your family?
a german shepherd dog is naturally equipped with what it takes to do the job better than any sensory system man has made. 
it can hear and sense danger where a video surveillance system does not, and can chase after any intruder and stop them.  
it can tell the difference between an intruder and a family member.....day time or at night.

we have questions all of the time about the height and weight of our dogs.  we have added that information by each dog.
so we thought maybe we should add the standards for height and weight of the german shepherd dog:
from schutzhund usa web page: size/weight
males: height at the wither 60 cm to 65 cm. 
height 60 cm is equal to 23 inches. height 65 cm is equal to 26 inches.
weight 30 kg to 40 kg.
weight 30 kg is equal to 66 pounds. weight 40 kg is equal to 88 pounds. 
females: height at the wither 55 cm to 60 cm.
height 55 cm is equal to 21 inches. height 60 cm is equal to 23 inches.
 weight 22 kg - 32 kg
weight 22 kg is equal to 48 pounds. weight 32 kg is equal to 70 pounds. 
 
from akc web page :

the desired height for males at the top of the highest point of the shoulder blade is 24 to 26 inches; and for bitches, 22 to 24 inches.
akc kennel inspection:
our kennel was inspected by akc on june 8-2016. 
this is what the inspector had to say:
the breeder was in compliance with all rules and regulations with the akc and should be commended on the overall care and condition of her dogs as well as the organization of her paperwork.
