chartock's rants make npr

npr producer says: 'i was driving through upstate
new york and listening to the local public radio station, and there was
this guy on the air ranting.'

'but i wanted the red bentley' dept.
"wamc's listeners are the most generous in public
radio!" -- alan chartock
generous?  i'll say!
look what you bought the boss!

this 'loaded' 2006 subaru forester*
is
alan chartock's 'company car' -- 
a 'perk' courtesy of wamc's board of trustees.**
(this one replaces the 2004 forester wamc got him just
2 years ago.)
and of course, it's only used for 'company business'
--
so why does alan park it at night in his driveway 
in great barrington? 
also don't forget, wamc-fm listeners pay for this new car's sales tax,
titling fee, annual insurance, annual inspection, annual vehicle tax; 
also its maintenance, gasoline, tolls, and of course,
parking whenever alan travels to manhattan.
ah well, just one more 'must have' for alan paid for by grateful
listeners.
(i mean, you don't expect the ceo of a 'non-profit' charity to walk,
do you?
and god forbid he should have to buy his own car!) 
how lucky wamc members are!
* subaru
forester 2.5 x 'the l.l.bean edition' 
(base model before
accessories and add-ons msrp $27,520 delivered.)
** and
remember, full-time use of this brand new car is in addition to
the $161,101 salary package chartock is already getting from not-for-profit
wamc-fm.

and he calls republicans 'crooks and
liars'?
'honest' alan says:
$52k pay hike "not been a secret!"
oh really, mr. chartock?
see:  "chartock
defends $48,000 raise" - albany times-union - 03/14/06
also see: "alan
chartock and control of wamc's $6 million coffers: 
when
is bilking not bilking?"
also see: wamc-fm's
board of trustees lacks legitimacy -- let the members vote.
alan chartock let loose yet another bit of self-serving
snot yesterday.  (that's about what its credibility was worth.)  
this time it was to albany times-union reporter
mark mcguireabout
that little $52,000 behind-closed-doors raise alan took more than a
year-and-a-half ago.   but alas, alan somehow forgot in all
that time to mention it to the folks who actually pay the bills --
wamc-fm's
listeners.
mcguire writes in tu that the ex-suny professor told him "the raise
has 'not been a secret,' stating he received the salary hike after retiring
as a professor from the state university of new york."
oh really?  well when, until the pirates broke the story
on this web site on march 8th, did anyone -- anyone -- within earshot
of wamc's seven-state signal ever hear a peep from mr. chartock
or anyone else on wamc about the ceo asking for or receiving a raise
-- let alone a 45% increase? 
does anyone recall mr. chartock or his trusty wamc board of trustees
seeking input from the listening public (whose money subsidizes the station
and pays mr. chartock's now $166,000 salary) about whether it was a good
idea in a year of 2 1/2% inflation for a public charity to give a corporate
officer a 45% pay increase? 
certainly no mention was made during the station's most recent $700,000
'begathon'. 
nor was any given at the fund-drive four months before that, nor at the
one before that, nor back before that. 
so in the year-and-a-half since he took the secret raise, when exactly
was mr. chartock finally going to let the public in on to whom more of
its money was now going, and the little secret that he says wasn't a secret. 
my guess is alan was just waiting for his esteemed board of trustees
to make the formal announcement, and that in the meantime wamc's
'ceo for life'  would just laugh all the way to the bank --
but of course, not secretly and not behind closed doors.

fund-drive mantra dept.: 
"just three week's expenses in the bank!"
chartock's $52,000 raise!*
that's right, you read that number correctly. 
and for those who still think wamc-fm is a
'not-for-profit' public charity,
that little salary increase works out to be a
45% pay hike
for the ex-suny professor.
(editor's comment: no
wonder alan chose wamc over suny, the money's better, 
plus he's got near total
control over $6 million per year flowing through the station.) 
see chartock's salary
increase for yourself:
check out wamc's
fiscal 2005 form 990 -- just released by irs.
(when you open the .pdf file, scroll down to "statement 11 - list
of officers, ... .")
also, compare the current
salary with fiscal
2004.
(scroll down to "statement 9.")

for the latest fiscal year (2005) is $166,101

bloggers! 

the pirates start listener web log
the pirates have established
a new blog site for wamc-fm  listeners. for the first time
in the radio station's history listeners can now give feedback in a public
forum for all to read.  anyone may comment about anything of interest
to listeners whether it is station programming, its management, or even
office gossip around the water cooler. 
this new blog site is set
up to be an open forum with a no-holds-barred attitude to encourage
honest in-your-face commentary and opinions.  in posting to
the site, bloggers have a choice whether to use a real name, to sign with
a
nom-de-plume, or simply to remain anonymous.  by giving such
choices, the site encourages maximum public participation. 
best of all though is that
after all these years wamc-fm  listeners will finally have
opportunity to find out just what all those other wamc-fm listeners
are thinking about when it comes to their favorite radio station..

why does wamc-fm need 
a legal defense fund?
wamc-fm's
chairman-for-life
alan chartock calls it a
'first
amendment fund,' but it looks to be nothing more than a defense
fund to protect and perpetuate chartock's total and absolute (some would
say obsessive-compulsive) control of wamc.  (he's already persuaded
a bunch of suckers to donate nearly $200,000 (as of
2/10/05) to this latest scam ostensibly on grounds
that fcc's recent attention to on-air obscenity requires wamc to protect
itself just-in-case.)
a first amendment fundfor
what?
when was the last time you
heard anyone on wamc utter four-letter words or any other fcc attention-getting
expletive for that matter?  in fact, have you heard anyone even suggest
that the tightly-muzzled staff at wamc ever has had a habit of airing
obscenities?
and not only that, but now
to go so far as to set up in advance a deep-pockets fund the purpose
of which is supposedly to defend against litigation with fcc stemming from
an anticipated onslaught of complaints from area listeners suddenly overwhelmed
with a desire to file charges of obscenity against the station; the fantasy
of it all leaves a sense that something is not right, that something else
is afoot here. 
have you heard of any other
npr station anywhere setting up such a fund? 
then just what is going on? 
why the fuss?  why this sudden need by wamc to set aside money for
legal defense? 
why would you do it
-- unless, of course, you already knew you'd done something that warranted
that kind of response and defensive posture. 
what does alan chartock
know that he is not telling listeners and the station's membership about?
is wamc facing an irs problem?
has ceo chartock used his
wamc soapbox just once too often as his own personal platform by which
to lobby on behalf of candidates he favors for public office -- and in
opposition to those he is against? 
has chartock's lobbying threatened
wamc's cherished tax-exempt status, and is this new defense fund not
for anything fcc-related, but actually for fighting the u.s. internal
revenue service?  (irs has stringent, long-standing regulations governing
501c3's and political activities, see below.)
or maybe it's not at all
about preservation of the station's 501c3 status.  perhaps instead
alan is worried that wamc failed an irs audit.  (just where does
$6 million go every year?)
or it could be that chartock
is afraid that listeners are finally fed-up and on the verge of filing
a class-action lawsuit on behalf of all wamc dues-paying members -- the
purpose of which would be to seek voting privileges for the membership
so they can be the ones to elect annually those who would sit on
wamc's board of trustees --- so listeners finally could elect those
who would run listener-supported radio. (see related article: alan
chartock: selected, not elected -- ever!!! )

(this may take a few seconds.)
this web
site offers alternative viewpoints and opinions to those expressed (ad
nauseum) over the wamc
90.3 fm northeast public radio network located in albany, new york. 
you can even link to wamc
by clicking on the logo.
this web site's goal is to
let you know what listeners
really think, and to provide answers
to questions about things you might have wondered, but about which you
could never get a straight answer from the powers-that-be at wamc.
for example, aren't you interested
where your "membership" dollars really go?
.....and aren't you curious
why dues-paying 'members' of wamc are not allowed to vote in annual
elections for the station's board-of-trustees, nor allowed the 'right'
to run for that office?  (members of most other listener-supported
so-called 'public' radio stations have these valuable membership privileges.)
.....and how is alan chartock,
wamc's 
former board chairman, now its president and ceo, able to surround himself
on the wamc  board with hand-picked trustees who continually
rubber-stamp his wishes (and his personal salary increases), a board which
never fails every year to elect him chairman, and paid 'executive director'?
.....and how did a valuable
fm broadcast license, owned by the citizens of new york state and operated
by albany medical college, end-up being transferred for free
to the literally permanent control of one politically-connected
suny professor and a small hand-picked group of his buddies?  and
all this without benefit of that pesky legal formality -- whenever the
state disposes of valuable assets -- of publicly auctioning-off those assets
to the highest bidder?
.....and speaking of suny,
why did suny overlook for 25 years alan chartock's 40+ hours per week 'other'
job at wamc, a glaring breach of its own university policy (a code-of-conduct
which prohibits full-time
"moonlighting" by full-time, tenured faculty)?
......and aren't you wondering
how mr. chartock obtained this sweetheart deal from suny which, though
full-time
"moonlighting" is prohibited, paid him a full professor's
suny salary package while simultaneously
overlooking the professor's
wamc
full-time salary package with perks, benefits, pension, travel allowances,
and expense account all courtesy of 'public' radio wamc 90.3 fm?
......and haven't you noticed
how news reports and feeds from
wamc 90.3fm rarely, if ever, make
it onto
national
public radio's network news coverage or onto npr's national
programming?
......and aren't you inquisitive
as to just what percentage of your dollars generated during each of the
lucrative thrice-annual
wamc membership drives ends-up in the wamc
ceo's pocket as salary, perks, and pension benefits?
stay tuned!!!  as this
site evolves and grows, these questions and more will be answered!!!
