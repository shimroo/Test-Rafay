the most advanced & cost effective systems






t-m vacuum products, inc. provides a wide selection of heat treating and thermal processing solutions. we provide various sizes of medical, sintering, continuous, tempering and high vacuum furnaces and ovens. we also offer vacuum brazing furnaces and ovens, optical coating systems and atmospheric enclosures, commonly known as glove boxes.
we strive to create the best vacuum tempering furnaces and heat treating equipment possible which means high quality and cost effective products. our systems typically exceed 20 years of life in a full-time 24/7 production environment. this means that each of the heat treating sintering, continuous, brazing, medical, high and tempering vacuum furnaces, high vacuum ovens, optical coating systems, and glove boxes you purchase from our company are the most advanced and cost effective on the market. this characteristic applies to all of our systems regardless of application or product specificity. optical coating systems and our glove box units all carry the same mark of quality that our furnace systems possess.
vacuum thermal processing and heat treating will always offer superior quality products. if you eliminate gas contamination and non-uniform convection current heating, adherence to product property specifications and batch consistency will be profoundly improved. this translates into a higher quality finished product and lower labor and energy costs. t-m vacuum has a robust and full featured thermal processing vacuum furnace solution that can more than meet any requirement you might have. contact us at your earliest convenience for more information on any of our systems.
