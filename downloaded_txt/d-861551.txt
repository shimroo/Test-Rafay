we’re pensacola habitat for humanity!since 1981, we’ve built over 1,650 homes in the escambia and santa rosa county areas. we help families find strength, stability and self-reliance through affordable homeownership. but our impact goes beyond building houses. we reach wide across the community, with various programs and services aimed at transforming communities, one homeowner at a time. everyone deserves a decent place to call home.













































remembering president carterwith president carter’s passing, habitat has lost one of our leading voices and one of our most tireless volunteers. as we join the world in mourning the death of a statesman, an activist, a friend and one of our inaugural habitat humanitarians, we look back at the life of a man who made a difference, celebrating the houses he helped build and the lives he helped change — including ours. “we are deeply saddened by president carter’s passing, and our prayers are with the carter family,” said jonathan reckford, ceo of habitat for humanity international. read the full press release here.
