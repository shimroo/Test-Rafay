intellectual curiosity











intellectual challenge











embrace the moment











sparking passion











all together


























a sense of community

		oakwood school was founded in 1951 by parents who wanted to provide their children with an educational experience that was rich in the arts, sciences, and humanities and challenging to their creative, intellectual, and physical capacities.
	


		they wanted a learning community that would foster independence of thought, intellectual integrity, and sensitivity to the needs of others, and prepare students for participation in a democratic society.
	




statement of philosophy




















cultivate depth of character

		we believe that a school environment should foster individual growth and an active communal life, should hold intellectual attainment in high regard, and should encourage young people to exercise increasing autonomy and responsibility—for one another, for the environment, and for the larger world.
	











why oakwood?
we are committed to a relational pedagogy that views students as partners in teaching and learning. learn more
