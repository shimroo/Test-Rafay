the mathematics of wound healing - tanniemola liverpool



wound healing is a highly conserved process required for survival of an animal after tissue damage. in this oxford mathematics public lecture, tannie will describe how we are beginning to use a combination of mathematics, physics and biology to disentangle some of the organising principles behind the complex orchestrated dynamics that lead to wound healing.wednesday 19 feb 2025, 17:00, lecture theatre 1, mathematical institute, oxford










  





shorts stories



 want a quick flavour of who we are and what we do?

 our youtube shorts are, unsurprisingly, short films featuring oxford mathematicians talking about, among other things, their research, their toys and their toothpaste. and there are also clips from our popular public lectures to whet the appetite for the full thing.










  





alison etheridge appointed dame commander of the order of the british empire



alison said: ‘this really is a huge honour and it's taking a while to sink in. it has made me appreciate how lucky i have been to have the support of family, friends, students, and colleagues in and beyond oxford. and of course, it has been a huge privilege to spend so much of my career in the university of oxford.’
