once-in-a-lifetime experience! the trip lasted approximately 4 hours. the staff was incredible, working very hard to make sure we found and were able to swim with sharks. we viewed about four to five sharks and lots of seals. i would strongly recommend this tour!

lifetime experience with asec starting from helping us out with an afternoon trip on the very next day. crew were friendly, professional, eco-friendly, and helpful. they also use scuba which was great as it allows you to stay under water for as long as possible. got to see 3 sharks (not big whites though - but we didn't expected that) and what an experience. sea was rough, but our experienced crew managed to spot the sharks for us.

the pick up was on time and the staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the area and the animals. the boat and gear was all good, the wetsuit did a good job keeping us warm even when the water was fairly cold. plus the 25% discount for food and beers at the restaurant next door just made it a perfect morning. very good!
