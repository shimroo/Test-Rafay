akc dual purpose labrador retrievers













we breed dual purpose labrador retrievers that are more like the dogs before the breed split into two extremes. they have the trainability and natural desire to do well in the field. plus the looks and loving temperament that made the lab the #1 breed for over 30 years.
our dogs have broad heads and yet they wouldn’t be confused with rottweilers. they tend to be a little heavier than field labs and make great weekend hunters and hunt test competitors. they also have an ‘off’ switch.
we’ve bred quality, akc registered labradors for over 20 years. using carefully chosen bloodlines, we breed for healthy, structurally correct, trainable hunting dogs and family companions. dogs are tested for genetic problems and are health certified by ofa.
located on colorado’s front range.
