mission: 
          to foster enjoyment, appreciation, and understanding of the history 
          of cajun music! 
if you can find recordings by 
          the artists featured here, by all means please get them!
these recordings all come from 
  my private collection with considerable help from other french music fans. i 
  post them here as a labor of love without gain and with no wish to cut into 
  any else's profit. i simply make these important and scarce recordings available 
  here due to their inherent interest to the cajun music community, to preserve 
  and promote appreciation for the likes of nathan abshire, austin pitre, ambrose thibodeaux, 
  revon reed, sady courville, preston manuel, roy fuselier, and many other great musicians! they are the 
  roots and influences of our contemporary cajun music...i hope a new generation 
  will pick up and expand on our great tradition by hearing these great recordings. 
  every girl and boy ought to have a chance to hear them. to the artists and families 
  who have given me permission to post these songs here so that they can be heard 
  widely, thank you!

          by chance you hold copyright and do not wish to see these works made 
          available in this format. further our music by making recordings like 
          these available worldwide. bonne chance  tout nous-autres!
