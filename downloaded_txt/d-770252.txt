the compulsory purchase association (cpa)



 


xin






 


the compulsory purchase association (cpa) is a not for profit member organisation that promotes best and effective practice in the delivery of land for infrastructure, housing and regeneration through the use of compulsory purchase powers. its members represent both acquiring authorities and claimants affected by compulsory acquisition, and come from a range of professional disciplines involved in the compulsory purchase process, including chartered surveyors, lawyers, barristers, forensic accountants, planners and land referencers. in that sense, it truly reflects the profession. the cpa is a non-partisan organisation and neither supports nor opposes specific public works schemes. its objective is to work for the public benefit in relation to compulsory purchase and compensation in all its forms. it seeks to promote the highest professional standards amongst practitioners at all levels, and to ensure that the legal framework for compulsory purchase and compensation is clear, fair and effective.want to become a member?join our 700+ members today and become a member by clicking, here.how our members can help if you are affected by a cpothe cpa cannot provide advice, but we have members that possibly can, click here to review some of the documents we have prepared to help you decide what to do. if you are a claimant looking for advice, please click here.
