lewis & clark national trail
the beginning...
william clark and meriwether lewis left from clarksville on october 26, 1803, to begin the lewis and clark expedition to explore the louisiana purchase. the departure site was the home site of george rogers clark, older brother of william clark.  the clarksville and louisville areas are where they recruited, enlisted, and trained the "corps of discovery." the departure site is also referred to as "clark's point" and "falls of the ohio." lewis and clark returned to clarksville in november 1806.
the trail...
the lewis and clark national trail was recently extended by 1,200 miles with a law signed in march 2019. the trail extends through indiana kentucky, ohio, pennsylvania, and west virginia. the clarksville section of the trail is at the falls of the ohio state park along the ohio river where a historic replica of george rogers clark's cabin is located. 
the extension...
the trail's extension now opens the door for more public education and tourism throughout the ohio river valley.  "the lewis and clark expedition was the most important adventure of exploration and discovery in our nation's history," historian lou ritten said. view the lewis & clark national historic trail site.
