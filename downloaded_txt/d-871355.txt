import & customs 301 china tariffs: st&r customs attorneys have filed almost 1,500 petitions seeking exclusions from these duties and successfully obtained refunds. we advise and support importers on re-engineering transactions to lawfully mitigate the impact of these tariffs.

tariff mitigation  trial and appellate court decisions adopted our arguments which established the first sale doctrine that has allowed thousands of companies to dramatically reduce duty assessments.



tariff mitigation 



trade negotiations  st&r has represented clients including governments in the negotiation of every u.s. free trade agreement since nafta in 1992, as well as those currently under consideration. our advocacy to benefit and protect our clients includes all chapters and rules of these complex agreements.



trade negotiations 



trade remedies  we have represented u.s. importers and global exporters in antidumping, countervailing duties and other trade actions before the itc and ita and, where necessary, the court of international trade and appellate courts. our representation spans hundreds of products from many countries.
