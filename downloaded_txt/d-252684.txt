    high priest nichinyo shonin’s new year’s message
  



nichiren shoshu is the name of the denomination that follows the orthodox teachings of true buddhism as taught by nichiren daishonin, the true buddha, who made his advent in japan in 1222. nichiren shoshu has temples and propagation centers worldwide and actively propagates the true teachings of nichiren daishonin. the practice of nichiren shoshu true buddhism brings about powerful benefits and positive changes to the lives of those whopractice it. the ultimate goals are the attainment of enlightenment by the individual and, through widely spreading true buddhism, the establishment of a purified and peaceful world where all people can enjoy happy lives together.




    most rev. urushibata's new year’s greeting
  



the daily practice consists of chanting nam-myoho-renge-kyo and reciting a chapter-and-a-half of the lotus sutra, called gongyo, to the true object of worship called the gohonzon. there are six temples in the united states and many local area meeting places. all are invited to come learn about nichiren shoshu true buddhism and experience its beneficial power. this site provides temple locations, articles, and links to other related nichiren shoshu sites. you canlearn more about this wonderful practice at nst.org.
