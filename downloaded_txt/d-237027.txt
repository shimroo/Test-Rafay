welcome to the world phenomenology institute 		 	missionthe principal purpose and desired consequence of the  wpi’s programs and publications are an ever-deepening critical inquiry  into and understanding of the central and governing principles of edmund  husserl’s phenomenology, both in their own terms and in terms of their  subsequent extension  of and dialogue with current phenomenological  investigations.  the wpi shares the universalist impulse of husserlian  phenomenology, which sought and aspired to the creation of a mathesis  universalis  or universal science able to maintain the fully integrated  relation of various and diverse fields of intellectual inquiry in a  cohering and coherent worldview. the range of the wpi’s research interests and the full dimension of  its programs and publications—extending across the arts and  humanities—are evidence of that ambitious and fundamental husserlian  premise and philosophy.  the institute similarly assumes as its own the  husserlian injunction to phenomenological philosophers to serve as a  “functionaries” of human interests in a cultural and intellectual  inquiry, and in so doing demonstrate the unity of human knowledge and  the possibility of deep communication and philosophical understanding.it is to that end that the institute organizes and advances  multidisciplinary events and encounters among scholars drawn from  various and distinct fields of higher education.  hence, leaders and  participants of the institute have traveled the world over for the past  four decades to bring phenomenology to an ever-increasing number of  world cultures and philosophical traditions.  the institute encourages  the engagement with various branches, interests, and traditions of  phenomenology of the past and present. in the new millennium, our new communication technologies hold out  the promise of an increasingly interconnected and reciprocally engaged  world community.  certainly, these new technologies have changed and  enhanced the nature and practice of philosophical inquiry to such a  degree that an international community of scholars and a “world”  institute are now more fully realizable than at any time in the past.   the institute is joined to that effort and hopes to further extend its  participation in world intellectual culture, further disseminating the  methods and principles of advanced phenomenological inquiry.
