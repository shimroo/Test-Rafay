the 'black & white' healey cd-3000

my 1966 austin healey 3000 mkiiia (phase 2 bj8) - myaustinhealey - has been a
'weekend racer' in sydney australia since 1969. amazingly, before that, it had been driven overland 
from london to sydney in 1967 by its first owner, richard steil. 
donald mitchell healey (dmh) designed
austin-healeys as sportscars to be driven and enjoyed. austin healey 3000's were built to be strong and torquey 
- and were known for their rally success. they were sportscars which could be driven to work during
the week, and then used in motorsport on the weekend. every owner
(past and present) of the 'black & white car' (as this
particular healey has been known for many years) has shared donald
healey's original philosophy. even in 2008 - classic cars are still for
driving!
this site provides other healey enthusiasts with
information on the classic austin healey 3000 (marque, news and technical - see left column);
and the specific history of my 1966 'ivory over black' austin-healey 3000 mk iiia (bj8) - known as the 'black & white' car (see right column).




the black & white car has history, character and reputation.
in july 1966, the "black & white car" was purchased new by richard steil from john sprinzel racing limited, london, england. 
in 1967, richard and his wife trish spent 3 months driving the healey from portsmouth england to calcutta india, 
from where it was loaded onto a ship bound for sydney australia, arriving in september 1967. what a honeymoon! the next owner, ian morgan, began racing the healey in 1969.
the "black & white car" has provided a whole range of excitement and adventure for it's custodians. above all - this healey has always been driven and enjoyed.
these days, there are many restored healeys - but you can't buy
history - and the "black & white healey" has a fantastic history of being driven and enjoyed.
the 'black & white car' has won numerous trophies. two
trophies best epitomise the history & reputation of the black
& white car...
in 1969 - the inaugural year of the foundation of the austin-healey owner's club of nsw - 
the "black & white car" was club
competition champion - in the hands of ian morgan. the same club competition
perpetual trophy is still awarded today. in 1999, and 2000 -
the black & white car was runner up for this trophy - and both
times was the individual car with the highest points on the ahoc
nsw club pointscore.
donald healey came to australia in january 1977 - when wally
gates owned the 'black & white car'. this was to be dmh's only
visit 'down under'. a display was held in dmh's honour at warringah
mall, brookvale, and many healeys (big and small) attended. the
black & white car won this trophy - awarded by dmh. this was not a
trophy dmh merely presented (where the recipient was decided by
others - or a pointscore etc), but a trophy awarded by donald
healey, based on donald healey's own judgement. the inscription
reads:

all............


  
1999, 1974, and 1969 - same car, same corner, same circuit -
