reviews from clients 











@frankrobinson4453 – excellent looking radio, appreciate the fact that they added a fan to this, definitely has the power to reach out and touch whoever you want to like the old style look.


@ed-ur5be – i need more power . this might be the fit.					







						@miura – a few days ago i purchased the new ranger rci 2995 dx hp from a store in the us and started to use the radio today. i previously owned à rci 2995 dx cf (same radio but less watt output). my first conclusion it that the hp is massively powerful 350w pep ssb & am and 70w am-fm average. i just had to open the radio, push the switch of the internal power supply to 220v for the u.k. and swap the external 7amp fuse for a 3amp one. everything now works as it should, it is bang on frequency on receive and transmit. sound is crystal clear and volume very powerful.					








@samuel barr –you know how i love loud audio and that radio sounds great. and it’s got all of that power right out of the box. nice! 

@244-badnews2 – i had to get this one. it’s going to be a great addition to my collection. i’ve been looking at these for a while now. it sounds great and can’t wait to get it hooked up. 					








@timburton409 – man that’s a sweet radio. nice clean power. i want one just wish it was full size to use the same mounting brackets as my other radios. it sounded like it  had a stronger punch with the stock mic but the 198 ergos have really won me over. i like it better the the 636 ‘s i’ve been running for years. 					








@sean leclercq – i own this rig, and it's an awesome performer, the receive on it is amazing!  rci put a lot into this radio, new board, with all the bells and whistles.
