a little bit about us
the saratoga county agricultural society is dedicated to not only showcasing the accomplishments of each year’s participants in a wide range of competitions, but also in teaching about the history of saratoga county while offering a glimpse forward to its future.
one trip to the fair in july and you can learn how it was done, how we do it now, and how it will be done in the future; and not just by display, but by the people who did it, do it, and will do it. in a social climate that is more and more focused on what people have, the annual fair is about what people have accomplished.
