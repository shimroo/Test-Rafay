socio-political polarization, the potential of generative ai, masculinity in crisis, sportswashing and community-based sustainability are the five key trends that will disrupt existing global marketing practices in 2024.

now in its 13th year, the marketer’s toolkit 2024 offers insights to help turn these disruptive areas into opportunities for growth for you and your business.
while it’s fair to say next year’s economic outlook is mixed, we found marketers’ confidence levels are actually higher than 12 months ago. according to our annual marketer’s toolkit survey, a majority (61%) of firms expected improved business performance next year, up 10% from last year. and with the olympics and election spending, warc expects global ad spend to grow 8.2% in 2024, topping $1 trillion for the first time.

the health of creativity: how often is creativity also effective?






are you a warc creative subscriber? login to access the full report

×








each year, warc tracks the results of the top regional and global award shows for creativity and effectiveness for its warc rankings.
                                                    



using the rankings data, we wanted to assess the health of creativity: how often is creative work also effective? 
                                                        


we compared data from the rankings to see how many creative ideas were subsequently awarded for effectiveness, and if highly awarded campaigns were more likely to be effective.
                                                        


the research shows that 20% of all creatively awarded ideas are also awarded for effectiveness, and if an idea is highly awarded for creativity, it is more likely to be effective.

“warc is a treasure trove. it’s my first port of call for ideas and information as the content is always backed up by data and examples. the warc team are also always on hand and fantastically helpful.”
joshua robertson
cmo, apac, vccp




“warc is a very inspiring think tank for me. i can find useful case studies, sharing and the latest trends to empower my strategic thinking. also, the key account manager is very helpful and warm to give the prompt supports. in short, i would highly recommend warc to people in marketing, advertising, and innovation industries”
thomas wang
senior strategist, lego




“warc is a key source of insights for our marketing team. we use it to source best practice case studies from around the globe both within and outside of our category. it is great to see the detail behind the success of different campaigns and use these learnings in our own market.”
sarah loye
research manager, allied irish bank




“i love how rigorous the case studies are. what stands out most is the take on roi measurement and how the cases show real outcomes, results, and measurements.
they are impressive because general publications simply do not go there. they don’t go down to roi and the evidence behind why the campaign was effective. i find that more appealing because most of my clients are interested in learning about results and what it takes to get results.”
seraj bharwani
chief strategy officer, illumin




“i always use warc as a key resource in building a foundation of insights for any project i'm working on. i can always rely on reports, best practices or even data points to get me started in the right direction.”
sidney galstad

shayni shecter
associate strategist, yum! brands

strengthening our strategic foundations, delivering better activities and synergies across our portfolio and campaigns. warc delivers on our input, so our output has higher relevance for our portfolio.”
marius huseby gulbrandsen
head of marketing technology & consumer data, orkla asa




“having access to warc's impressive database allowed us to have a more informed direction going into our christmas strategy and offering. it helped lay the groundwork for our own independent research and helped qualify some of our findings. many members of our team value warc as it provides insight for the thorny issues that regularly come up in the media world”
emma winetrobe
insights executive, teads

richard pohlman

“out of the database resources my institution has access to, i use warc the most for teaching and keeping up to date with the state of marketing. it’s the database i most often refer my students to - and they use it for their assignments. it really is a great resource and i highly recommend it to serious educators!”
dr brent coker
digital marketing and social media professor, the university of melbourne
