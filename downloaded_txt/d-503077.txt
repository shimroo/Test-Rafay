connecticut sheep breeders association




webmaster - smurray@ctsheep.com




















































our mission since 1893





the original constitution and by-laws written in may of 1893 said, âthe purpose of the association shall be to promote and encourage the keeping of sheep upon the farms of connecticut, to improve breeds of sheep, and to aid in securing legislation favorable to the sheep industry and agriculture.â  we continue to strive to carry on their mission by offering mentoring for new shepherds, supporting youth interested in sheep, providing educational workshops at various times for youth and adults, offering the connecticut blanket to aid members in using their wool to obtain a value added product from their farm and putting on the connecticut sheep, wool & fiber festival on the last saturday in april every year.
