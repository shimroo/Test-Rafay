casey was a rock star from day one! when we began looking at homes, she quickly and intuitively picked up on exactly what we did and did not want in a home. this is because she listened so well to our needs and desires for a home at this stage of life! her communication and quick responses answered any questions we had about the process. she went above and beyond for us at every step along the way, with grace and integrity. in a word, she is amazing! and we could not love our new home more! mark and jana j.we loved working with bill and casey to find our first home! bill helped explain the home buying process to us, and his experience and expertise made us confident that we were in good hands and getting the best advice. casey was so much fun to tour homes with- her positivity made the process easy and enjoyable. she was flexible with our schedule, and willing to go tour any house that caught our eye. when we finally found our home, they both guided us through the process and helped us get a great deal! even after the final sale they continue to check in and make sure everything with the house is going well. the home buying experience always sounded so intimidating, but we had the best experience working with virtual office reality! thank you bill and casey!  megan a.bill bastine from vor has helped us with five transactions now. he's great.  willie w.we were thankful that we were referred to bill by our financial counselor.we thought we had already found a great property and thought we just need bill for the paperwork formalities.our first deal fell through (couldn't reach agreement with seller asking way too much).but bill helped us refine our search parameters and we looked at several properties he sent to us for review.our next offer, the seller never responded. we lost a small bidding war on our 3rd offer.bill provided great data and comps so we could gauge what we thought the property was truly worth.thankfully, we found our most perfect place with our last deal. bill helped us throughout in the protracted negotiations which resulted in our purchase. bill provided great references to inspectors, etc. and setup all the needed meetings at the house.bill provides good advice when you want it and makes a great sounding board for your own thoughts.  keith s.working with bill and casey has been a dream! i came to casey about 5 months ago knowing next to nothing about buying a condo. since then she and bill have gone with me to countless condo tours, educated me on what to look for once we are in the space, how to make a competitive/educated offer, and the ins and outs of mortgages and resale certificates. i would 100% recommend the vor sells homes team to anyone and everyone! kate w.











your real estate solution awaits.would you be willing to put off the sale of your home for 2 years in order to be able to reinvest your proceeds and defer taxes on your sale?here is an example of a client we are working with right now:our client has a highly appreciated home, wants to defer taxes on the sale of their  home and still be able to claim the section 121 exclusion. ·  client paid $198,000 for their sammamish home in 1989.·  client invested $143,500 in improvements over the years and has the receipts: new kitchen, new master bath, new roof, new guest bath, added a fence, 2 decks, created a closet in the attic off the master bedroom, added a patio off the front porch·  client’s house value today about $1,650,000.·  if they sold it, they would likely have to pay capital gains tax of about $135,800 as follows:sales price:              $ 1,650,000cost of sale:             $   132,000purchase price:         $   198,000improvements:          $   143,500gain on sale             $1,176,500section 121 excl       $    500,000  (married filing jointly)taxable gain            $    676,500cap gains rate:                  20%tax on sale:             $    135,300last year they bought a home in florida for $579,000 that they hope to retire to someday, but for now, are renting the home to cover the costs.when they decide to retire, they plan to: 1.  move into their florida rental house and make it their new primary residence.2.  convert their sammamish house into a rental property for at least 2 tax seasons.3.   after 2 years of rental, but before 3 years of rental, sell the sammamish house using a section 1031 exchange.4.  claim the section 121 exemption on the sale of the sammamish house and use that $500k to pay off their loan on the florida house.5.  use the 1031 exchange on their sale to roll the remaining proceeds into a delaware statutory trust so it would continue as investment property for them. after all that, they hope to end up with:·  a florida home free and clear of all debts;·  about a $919,000 investment in a dst (currently yielding about 5% cash on cash).look at the attached chart below to see an example they used to make their decision.  it’s a side-by-side comparison for them showing the difference between selling now and paying the taxes vs converting to an investment property and then exchanging into a dst in about 2 years.
