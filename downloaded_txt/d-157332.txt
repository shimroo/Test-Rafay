about this site
welcome to isopoda.net, website of italian biologist and science photographer francesco tomasinelli. my favourite photographic subjects are unusual animals, travels and scientists at work, but i shoot many other topics, like sports, events and corporate pictures.
i work as scientific consultant too, mainly on nature conservation and as museum exhibit designer.
