accent corner 
 

ledgestone large accent corners are perfect for adding a finishing touch to any facade. these corners are keyless and can be stacked on top of each other to span the height of any building. these corners go up lightning-fast and best of all, absolutely no mitering.



ledgestone wainscot 
 

designed with a built-in top ledge, these pre-engineered panels are a typical wainscot height of 36-42”(varies between patterns) and are 8’ long.
these one-piece, ready-to-install wainscot panels interlock to form a seamless and natural aesthetic appearance with easy and fast installation.



stucco clad 
 

these synthetic, textured architectural panels are the perfect alternative to typical efis applications.
stucco clad was designed to compliment stone, brick, and cmu exterior designs and are equally suitable for both new construction and remodels.



cornice 
 

our cornice is created utilizing 3d computer cutting capabilities, we can create any shape and sized element tailored to compliment your building.



urestone designer panel - brick 
 

our urestone designer panels in clean brick can be painted nearly any color, so if you're trying to match an existing brick facade we can help!



urestone designer panel - stone 
 

urestone stone textures are available in both the larger 4'x8' size as well as our compact urestone lite 2'x4' series.
these panels were designed to make it possible for the average person to install beautiful stone without having to hire a specialty mason. check out our full offerings to see if urestone is right for you.



 



metal trim 
 

we carry a number of styles of metal trim/flashing that work in concert with urestone products.
if you're working on a metal building project be sure to check out the r-panel trim.



pilaster 
 

similar to accent corners, pilasters are pre-fabricated and go up in a flash. they come in widths between 12" and 48" and the heights are in 4' to 8' intervals.











				as seen on			

				you'll find replications unlimited products on a plethora of tv and film sets, at sporting events, and in museums and pop-ups.
impossible to visually discern from the real thing, but with even more versatility, their lightweight, the ability to install fast, and durability that lasts—consider faux the next best thing in production design.
