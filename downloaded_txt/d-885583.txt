the metropolitan forum project (mfp) has as its central mission to increase citizen involvement in government processes.

          
         two fundamental concerns have occupied the citizen leaders participating:

improving public understanding of the fiscal relationships between state, regional and local government, and
intelligently investing voter approved school, park, library and other public dollars so as to build not only new facilities but better neighborhoods in the urban centers of california.
