        fbi director nominee kash patel has often joked that on day one in office he would shut down fbi headquarters and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state. rueful joke aside, he may not know how close to the truth he really is. the fbi has a sneaky little secret that has probably escaped the attention of its most ardent fans at doj. it's even possible that the cloistered and suited gangsters on the 7th floor don't even know how easy it could be to topple the entire enterprise. 

the fbi has been in the middle of countless scandals, illegal behavior,

        uk prime minister sir keir starmer declared his willingness to deploy british troops to ukraine “in harm’s way” to deter russian aggression hours before he is set to join an ’emergency summit’ on the matter in paris on monday.

the united states and russia are meeting to discuss the ukraine war in saudi arabia this week, but european leaders have not been invited to send delegations. apparently prompted by being left behind in this regard, and likely too by the trump white house’s suggestion that european nations actually decide what they are actually capable of doing on ukraine, european leaders are meeting in paris today for an “emergency summit”.

        president donald trump has been forced to take his fight to the u.s. supreme court after an obama-appointed judge reinstated hampton dellinger, a biden-era bureaucrat, as head of the office of special counsel.

this latest legal battle comes after a series of judicial oversteps by the activist judiciary.

last friday, president trump exercised his constitutional duty to dismiss dellinger from his position at the office of special counsel, an agency tasked with safeguarding federal whistleblowers.

rather than accept his removal, dellinger filed a lawsuit to reclaim his job.

        cbs news was a dumpster fire on sunday. face the nation’s margaret brennan thought the nazi holocaust occurred because there was too much freedom of speech and the press in germany. then, 60 minutes decided to produce a segment about germany waging a total war on freedom of speech, taking offenders away…on a train ride. finally, there is this pity segment on government workers who are lost after getting fired.

        parts of the northeast and mid-atlantic could be in for their biggest snowstorm of the season later this week if all the pieces come together, according to the fox forecast center. 

confidence is increasing, with computer forecast models showing an impactful winter storm developing in the plains and tracking across the central and eastern us. however, uncertainty remains about the system’s exact track and what the impacts will be for those along the heavily populated interstate 95 corridor. 

the energy for this storm moves out of the rockies and into the plains on monday before heading east.

        i confess it's a wee bit demoralising to find jd vance has stunned europe with a speech that contains nothing that would be remotely surprising to any reader of this website for the last quarter-century. of course, he's the vice president of the united states and i'm a "niche canadian". and in fairness jd was still in high school back when i started boring on about this stuff.
nevertheless, the german defence minister herr großer von wich ser spoke for the entire european establishment when he magisterially pronounced mr vance's remarks "not acceptable". germany, france and the rest of western europe are dying before our eyes, but it remains "not acceptable"

        at the end of january, the center-right christian democratic union (cdu), its bavarian ally the christian social union (csu), the neoliberal free democratic party (fdp) and the far-right alternative for germany (afd) party voted together for much stricter asylum rules, triggering a heated debate that has yet to subside.

before the vote, the protestant church in germany (ekd) and the catholic german bishops' conference (dbk) wrote a joint letter to all parliamentarians urgently warning against such collaboration. the letter was signed by leading figures from the two denominations, prelates anne gidion and karl jüsten.

        it is not coincidental that mere days after vice president jd vance went into the munich security conference and denounced european censorship regimes, cbs’s 60 minutes would air a report extolling the virtues of german censorship. the report filed by correspondent sharyn alfonsi makes sure to highlight prosecutors who go after memeposters as defenders of civility.

the report opens with alfonsi laying its predicate- censorship as protective of “civility” and “discourse”, and with the airing of a predawn cartoon deemed to be racist (click “expand” to view full transcript): sharyn alfonsi: if you've ever dared to read the comments on a social

        the u.s. department of agriculture (usda) has slashed millions in contracts that were active under the biden administration, including for a “brazilian forest and gender consultant” and a “central american gender assessment consultant.”

secretary of agriculture brooke rollins announced the cuts on friday, saying that the department has terminated 78 contracts totaling more than $132 million. rollins said 1,000 contracts are also currently under review for potential termination.  

the findings are the result of a review by the elon musk-led department of government efficiency (doge).

the oceanic basin, settled between the southern coast of the united states and the northern coast of mexico, was known as the gulf of mexico until president donald trump changed the name in an executive order on his first day back in office. while the order, referred to as “restoring names that honor american greatness,” only officially applies within the u.s., many companies

        acting deputy attorney general emil bove just delivered a civics lesson to a now-former top new york prosecutor who was apparently confused about who she worked for.

it all began when bove, as authorized by attorney general pam bondi, directed acting united states attorney for the southern district of new york danielle sassoon to dismiss the federal indictment against new york city mayor eric adams. the biden justice department had indicted adams on a somewhat questionable bribery charge after he had voiced public criticism of president biden’s policies on illegal immigration.

well, this is interesting. what a surprise. dirty judge jack mcconnell, who believes he was recently elected us president, halted president trump’s current spending freeze. but judge mcconnell is not some innocent bystander. judge mcconnell’s organization has received $117.6 million in government funding in total (ending in 2023). maybe that’s why he wanted the money to keep flowing. he’s expecting several more million this year!

        the trump administration wants the supreme court to permit the firing of the head of the federal agency dedicated to protecting whistleblowers, according to documents obtained sunday that would mark the first appeal to the justices since president donald trump took office.

the emergency appeal is the start of what probably will be a steady stream from lawyers for the republican president and his administration seeking to undo lower court rulings that have slowed his second term agenda.

        much of donald trump’s popular appeal can be explained by the context in which he has ascended.

for decades, the rules of the road in american politics have been set by a monolithic progressive establishment that has boasted something akin to a monopoly in political media, academia, hollywood and the federal bureaucracy.

this single-note chorus has not only produced a laundry list of myths, but threatened those who challenge it with professional and social ruin. “how dare you say that, bigot?”

“how could you think that, rube?” yet the supposed bigots and rubes always outnumbered the pedantic establishment, which enforced its orthodoxy through brute force.

        secretary of state marco rubio defended vice president jd vance's speech in germany slamming europe's penchant for censorship on sunday. rubio clashed with cbs host margaret brennan on "face the nation" after she suggested that free speech had been "weaponized" to bring about the holocaust in nazi germany.

brennan highlighted vance's speech to the munich security conference in germany last week, which criticized european allies for adopting a "soviet"-style approach to censorship.

        the white house slammed democratic sen. chris murphy as a "moron" on social media after the connecticut lawmaker posted an expletive-riddled admonishment against a lara trump parody account he seemingly believed belonged to the president's daughter-in-law. "you are a moron, chris. it is obvious this page is not affiliated with president trump, his family, or the administration. we do, however, support your right to make such a statement, no matter how imbecilic it makes you look," the white house's x account, rapid response 47, said in a message posted on friday.

        the theme of president trump’s next term is accountability.
gone are the days when the left and the uniparty could run amok, doing whatever the heck they pleased—whether it was coddling criminals, protecting illegals (same difference, really), while throwing hardworking americans under the bus. and that brings us to this latest story involving aoc, who has completely abandoned her american constituents and is now pouring all her energy into helping illegals evade capture – which goes against everything the american people voted for in 2024.she actually had the audacity to put together a webinar for them.

while the updated numbers only marginally constitute news — cbo has warned for years about our dire financial future, only for lawmakers to keep spending — one particular nugget illustrates the problem. the budget gnomes significantly increased their spending projections for medicaid, as but one example of how entitlement programs continue to cannibalize the federal budget.
