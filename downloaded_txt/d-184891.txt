because we've all been newbies at one point and time and we've all had a lot to learn, cindy and i like to do a newbie run once a year to help teach people who are new to the world of jeeps the basics and get them out on the trail. last chance canyon is where we typically like to do this as it is short enough and has just the right amount of obstacles to help someone learn how to use their jeep off-road. of course, being that there's so much more to what we consider the jeep wayalife than just driving over stuff, we always make sure to throw in a bit of sightseeing, history and camping out with good friends under the stars.
 

in this short presentation, you'll get to see all the fun we have on our annual wayalife last chance canyon newbie run. i hope you enjoy what you see and if you're new to the world of jeeps, i hope you join us on our next run.

more than just a jeep, it's a wayalife!

advance             adapters jeep tj
                  slip yoke eliminator (sye)
                  & cv drive shaft installation

whenever you lift a jeep tj above 2" (and sometimes even just 2"), your drive line will be off enough to cause what is known as drive line vibrations or "vibes" for short. because of this, most lift kits will include a transfer case skid plate lowering kit to help restore your drive lines back to or at least closer to stock. for the most part, this will do the trick but then you have to ask yourself, do i really want to lower the very part of my jeep that i just spent a boat load of money to raise up? yes, there are other ways you can kind of get around this like installing a 1" motor mount lift and/or lowering your transfer case skid plate just a bit with washers and you can even try to convince yourself that the vibes are gone.... but believe me, once you install an advance adapter slip yoke eliminator or aa sye for short and a cv drive shaft, you'll know that you had just been kidding yourself. once installed, your jeep will drive like butter. it will also be quieter which is something i hadn't expected and you will be doing your u-joints a huge favor.




howell throttle body fuel injection jeep cj - 258 i-6 engine 

installation write-up & review 

                from day one, i have just been dreaming about a day when i could install a howell fuel injection system on my cj. one of the biggest reason for wanting fuel injection was so that i could pass a visual smog inspection but one of the biggest benefits of having a fuel injection system is that i could ditch my piece of crap carter bbd carburetor! no more crappy idle, no more stalling at the most inopportune moments and no more miles and miles of vacuum lines under the hood.

 just so you know, there are other fuel injection kits available out there (like the mopar mpi) but cost was a factor for me. also, in the state of california, the howell tbi and mopar mpi are the only smog legal fuel injection kits you can use.

 the instructions that come with the howell tbi kit is more intended for a 1990 yj and may seem a bit confusing at times. this write-up was written for a 1981 jeep cj with a 258 engine so there will be differences along the way.




jeep differential fluid change service
 dana 30, dana 35, dana 44 & chrysler 8.25 

changing the fluid in your jeep's differentials is important part of routine maintenance. new gear oil will insure your differentials will be properly lubricated but taking the time to pop open the cover will also gives you a chance to inspect the gears within it for any damage or unsual wear. as i like to say, better to catch a potential problem in the garage than having to figure out how to fix it on the trail.

 following "schedule b" in the jeep owner manual (heavy driving), i change my differential fluids every 12,000 miles. however, it's always a good idea to do this after going through a deep water crossing too. below is a list of what you will need and instructions on how to perform this service yourself on a dana 30, dana 35, dana 44 or chrysler 8.25 axle.
