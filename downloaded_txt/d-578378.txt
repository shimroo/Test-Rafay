				mann+hummel for a cleaner world: leadership in filtration since 1941
				
			
		














filtration is everywhere. we filter the air we breathe and the water we drink. filtration can be found in our cars, refrigerators and even in our showers and coffee machines. without filtration, there is no baby food, no computers, no medicines. and certainly no clean, safe planet.
can you imagine a world without filtration? a world where almost nothing is safe? neither can we.
that's why we at mann+hummel work every day on filtration solutions for cleaner mobility, cleaner air, cleaner water and cleaner performance & industry. as one of the world's largest filter manufacturers, we want to understand how this world works - and make it a little better every day. our goal is to protect people, nature, and machines. by using filtration to separate the useful from the harmful.
for more than 80 years, we have stood for leadership in filtration. as a family-owned filter company with german roots, we operate globally at more than 80 locations. for our filtration solutions, we use the combined know-how of our employees, a global research and development network, and the opportunities offered by digitalization. the future is being decided now. that is why today we provide filtration solutions for tomorrow.

the world is constantly changing. for mann+hummel, "green mobility" means sustainable mobility thanks to fine and brake dust particulate filters, and other technological innovations for a range of vehicles and machines, even for alternative drive systems. this is how we reliably protect the environment, people, and machines from fine dust and other pollutants.

in order to fight against the increasing air pollution worldwide, we offer cutting-edge filtration solutions for indoor and outdoor areas. for example, our high-performance air filters provide protection in industry, while air filters for hvac systems or mobile indoor air purifiers offer protection from fine dust, viruses, bacteria, and other pollutants in the air.
