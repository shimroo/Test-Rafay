about the global gecko association (gga)


global gecko association (gga)


the global gecko association (gga) was previously hosted on this domain. they were dedicated to gecko enthusiasts worldwide. membership was open to anyone with an interest in gekkonids, from the professional herpetologist to the hobbyist.
the gga was an organization committed to promote interest in “gekkonids” in a variety of ways, from responsible captive care, to study in the wild, conservation, academic research and beyond. furthermore, the gga would serve people who were interested in gekkonids by providing a voice and means of communicating and sharing of resources and ideas.
the journal of the global gecko association
members used to receive two issues of the association’s journal annually, together with regular members’ newsletters. the journal of the global gecko association was produced in color and contain articles and papers, book reviews, interviews and other items of interest that reflect the full breadth of the gga’s objectives. many of the leading figures in the “gecko world” have agreed to contribute. newsletters would keep members fully updated with association events, gecko related news and views from around the world, veterinary advice and provide a mechanism for members to communicate with each other.
advertising used to be accepted for the gga newsletter “chit-chat”, gga journal “gekko” and gga online classifieds. it will still be possible to advertise on this newly created gecko website.
correspondence used to be be sent to:
global gecko associationc/o leann christenson1155 cameron cove circleleeds, al 35094u.s.a.
from “the official facebook page of the gga”
the gga has officially closed it’s operations, and in accordance with irs standards, assets were turned over to another non-profit irs group, herp digest.
back journals are available for sale on the website herpdigest
