love bite gone wrong

this morning and many mornings in the past, ma gets up and feeds me and goes back to bed. this mornin' she was sitting up in bed(she had a snack) so i got on her lap and was saying 'good mornin ma' and turned around and bite her on her neck! i think i bite too hard as she said 'ouch, bad boy' and i got a tap on the nose. i got off the bed as fast as i could and mournfully cried going down the hallway waking the guys both up. i heard ma telling mom mom on the phone about it and mom mom said it was probably an over affectionate love bite. later, i made up, but i wouldn't give mom a kiss on the hand she wanted. she let me taste her spaghetti and meatballs, so all is well.

the house is calming down

we've had a load of beans here this year to see the big tree in the house (why oh why?) a couple of kids even showed up and i tore through the house down to my basement hideaway. you know i was desperate to do that. anyway, i got some cool new stuff to play with. a striped tail- like thing that i kick the heck out of and some little mousies that i can really toss in the air and push under the appliances in the kitchen (there's one under the stove as i type this-ha!)i wish you all a :

mom and dad got themselves a new 'flashy box' for christmas. mom was playing with it and caught me sunnying myself under the dining room table. ha-ha-she forgot to remove the big white envelope there!

chillin'

 very funny! so i'm looking through the slats on the chair-oh go and get the flashy box and make me look so evil with those glowin' eyes. at least i don't get red 'devil' eyes when i get my photo taken. ha! and look at this-i'm surrounded by books on the floor! mom has two huge bookcases above me in this photo and she can't fit another book in them. so pathetic.

hissy fit

i look all adorable here, yes i do. but take me out of my bed and put me down the basement at night and i'll hiss at you! it's a new thing i've started to get attention. started when dad just took me out of my bed for the heck of it (he's not a cat person at all) and i loudly voiced my opinion at being disturbed. so now mom is giving me treats to hush me up, though i know she'd like to give me a kick in the tail region. she even broke the lid of my snack jar last night trying to fish out a treat in the dark kitchen. darn her, i liked that jar. she better fix that lid or find something that will work-make it work is more like it!
