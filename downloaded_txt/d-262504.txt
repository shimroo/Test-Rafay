 new york 
                    -- by the time sb dance's "the bucket" (presented at williamsburg 
                    arts nexus, january 16-18) ends, you can't imagine anything 
                    else three people could do with metal buckets, an oval galvanized 
                    tub, and about a ton of ping-pong balls. the conceiver of 
                    this fascinating work, stephen brown, and his two creating 
                    and performing collaborators, christine hasegawa and liberty 
                    valentine, who live and work in salt lake city, have created 
                    a weird, provocative stream of imagery that smudges the line 
                    between dance and theater. click

 new york 
                    -- once again, katie workum and terry dean bartlett managed 
                    to compile a collection of short and sweet gems for danceoff!, 
                    seen in its latest edition january 15 at symphony space's 
                    leonard nimoy thalia theater. hell, it was worth the trip 
                    just to see bartlett shake his thing in a 1985 video choreographed 
                    by miss kate (his hometown dance teacher) and its subsequent 
                    historical recreation by bartlett, workum and leigh garrett.

                    journal, 1-23: identity crisis
                    lifting the veil, veiling the dance  
by paul

                    copyright 2004 the dance insider 
 paris 
                    -- these are confusing times for the republique, currently 
                    contemplating a law which, by the latest reports, could ban 
                    not just the veil from the french classroom but the turban, 
                    the beard, the bandana, and any other sign that could possibly 
                    be interpreted as or even substituted for a "visible" or "ostentatious" 
                    (the legislators are arguing over which term to use) demonstration 
                    of one's religion in a country where most of the public holidays 
                    celebrate christian occasions. some muslim proponents of the 
                    ban (most notably the imam of marseille) argue that there's 
                    nothing in the koran which dictates women should wear the 
                    veil, a contention which, if true, would seem to exempt the 
                    veil from a ban targeting religious symbols. the sikhs -- 
                    a french community of which apparently everyone in the government 
                    was unaware until they started speaking up against this proposed 
                    law -- argue that they should be allowed to keep their turbans, 
                    because the turbans themselves are not religiously significant, 
                    but are worn to veil their hair, which is. a cartoon by willem 
                    in yesterday's liberation summed up the confusion at its ludicrous 
                    best: before a screaming teacher with electrified hair who's 
                    taken refuge on top of a blackboard stands a bow-tied girl 
                    with a beard ("but it's a lay-beard!"), a baggy-pantsed boy 
                    with a bandana over his chin ("i wear a veil to hide my beard."), 
                    a pimply teen ('it's a form of jewish acne, and i want to 
                    protect it!"), a turbaned boy in short pants ("i am not sikh, 
                    i am wounded."), and a tall young man clad only in a loincloth 
                    and bandana with his arms akimbo, crucifixion-like, as he 
                    insists, "me, wearing a cross? where?" elsewhere on the cultural 
                    terrain, it seems that a heretofore under-publicized aspect 
                    of the new regime for france's intermittent (or freelance) 
                    performing artists and technicians is that the benefit reductions 
                    include the elimination of maternity leave, causing one actor 
                    to remark, "it's so that artists can't reproduce."
 countering 
                    the official xenophobia, we have the continuing and generally 
                    admirable efforts of theaters to expose french audiences to 
                    other cultures. at the theatre de la bastille, this has taken 
                    the form of a sort of mini-festival, "complicites portugaises." 
                    it began charmingly, with shared concerts by vera mantero 
                    and joao fiadeiro, two giants on the portuguese contemporary 
                    scene, both of whom have significant international profiles 
                    as well. i was charmed by the concert i saw and 
                    reviewed in november, but looking back after catching 
                    a second entry, tiago guedes's "a solo," january 12, perhaps 
                    i should have been alarmed. click
