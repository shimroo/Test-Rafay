pro paintball - off season moves

neweraballer76
november 25th, 2024



				the off-season has already proven exciting with major moves from edmonton impact and multiple departures from houston heat - the two highest-paid rosters in pro paintball. impact took a close 2nd place to pbfit at world cup in a game they were clearly winning, but they are still completely revamping their squad by picking up 4 world-class players and releasing several of their players that helped them earn that 2nd place.

nova paintball sentinal nx1 review

evilpoptart
november 19th, 2024



				i watched a lot of novas videos from youtube and checked out reviews from folks that i would best describe as online autococker influencers. nova didnt just regurgitate the same formula that everyone else has done. in my mind, they really separated themselves because they tried a few new things on their design. regardless of some of the initial negative publicity, i was really interested in seeing them in person and possibly shooting one.

				dane hawkins has been shooting pro paintball on and off for pbnation for years. when we heard he was available to shoot the national xball league's chicago stop, we jumped at the chance to get some of his favorite images on the site. he captured the mud, mess and fun like no one else. enjoy!

				tampa bay damage won every single match they played this weekend at the chicago nxl to once again claim 1st place in the brutal pro division. they overcame muddy conditions and were even missing their star player from last event, chad busiere.


paintball fit continued their semi-pro dominance by taking their 4th consecutive 1st place (and 7th consecutive podium) and blast camp continued their run with a 4th consecutive 2nd place.

				junior brown said of the sponsorship this was an easy decision for us. san diego dynasty is not only one of the most accomplished and longest running paintball franchises of all time, but their passion for the sport and their fans is unmatched. they make themselves so accessible to the paintball community and their creation of the dynasty champs club is truly inspiring. we are super excited to be heading into 2023 together

new freeflow "trix"

january 4th, 2023



				there is more than just milling for those asking. it is based on the dsr+ platform as freeflow wanted something that had mechanical ability. we are very grateful for dye partnering with us on this. it feels like a long road to get to this point but are very grateful and the guys over there have been nothing short of amazing to work with.
 for those of you that are familiar with the way we release markers, this will follow that protocol and you will all be able to customize.

jt zebra proflex

john
december 21st, 2022



				the jt proflex is easily the most iconic paintball mask ever made and 2022 was an amazing year for it. we saw more proflex releases than ever. some limited editions (so they'll never be made again) and some special edition (so you might see some parts again someday but not regularly or soon). we saw so many partially because covid delayed 2020 and 2021 masks so much. is the zebra the last proflex of 2022 or does jt have one more surprise for us before 2023?
