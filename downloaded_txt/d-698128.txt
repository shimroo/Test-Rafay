an orchestra of voices

new album!the rivers are our brothers is an ode to the natural beauty of california. each movement personifies a different element of the sierra nevada’s majestic terrain, from its towering trees to its rushing rivers and snow-capped peaks. “the goal,” says composer majel connery, “is to give nature a voice. i wanted to allow these vibrant things to speak on their own behalf." by giving agency to these inanimate parts of our world, the music invites us to empathize with nature, uncovering the unique personalities of the sierra's landscapes. the rivers are our brothers was originally commissioned by musica sierra in 2021 for synthesizer, violin, bassoon, and voice. this new arrangement for chanticleer transforms the work into an accessible choral song cycle that draws us into a personal connection with the natural world.
