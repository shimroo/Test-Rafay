be lovedbe lovebelong














god loves us allat broad street united methodist church, we invite everyone to feel that love; not just on sunday mornings but every hour of every dayit doesn’t matter who you are,  where you live, or what you have or have not done; our church is a place of authenticity in a world aching for something real, and when you enter into communion with us, you will be welcomed and loved by us… just as you are. we don’t want to change you; we want to help you embrace the person you were meant to be through the grace of jesus christ.




















































a church is only as strong as its peoplebeyond our invitation to love and be loved, we also invite you to join us—for sunday worship and beyond. every person in our congregation has their own reasons for coming here and their own reasons for staying, but each and every one of them says they’ve never before felt such joy or wonderful sense of belonging to something greater than themselves. so, come sing in our choir or serve meals to our neighbors. join one of our support groups or sign up for bible study,  share your creative gifts. our community can’t help but be brighter and more blessed with you in it. we can’t wait to have you join us!
