elementary school support

earlier in the uss colorado deployment a number of students from the fourth and fifth grades of mission viejo elementary school took time to write letters to crew members of uss colorado. upon receiving the letters the crew returned the favor, responding personally to the fifteen students who wrote letters.
in addition, the commanding officer, cdr david beam, wrote a letter to the principal expressing their gratitude. saying in part: “the men of uss colorado have all been warmed by the wonderful letters the students have written … we have been posting a couple of the letters at a time in our main passageway and it has become a cause for excitement each time a letter from mission viejo elementary school appears.”
the commanding officer also sent along an american flag which had been flown from the bridge of uss colorado during a recent surface transit while on their deployment.
while visiting the boat after its arrival in groton, association members noted a number of these letters posted on a bulletin board in the passageway.
