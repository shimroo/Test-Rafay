how do self build mortgages work?
the first and most important thing to be aware of is that you won't be able to borrow funds using a traditional mortgage from a high street lender, as there's not a habitable property to lend against, so you'll need a more specialist approach. 
buildstore has designed a range of exclusive mortgages, specifically for homebuilders, delivered by a panel of 14 leading lenders. with over 60 specialist mortgage products as well as access to 12,000 mortgages from over 90 lenders, you can be sure our expert mortgage advisers will find the right product for you.

how to calculate your build costs
there are numerous magazines and on-line guides available to help you calculate build costs, but it's important to understand the complexity of the design, method of construction, level of energy efficiency, specification, the way you intend to contract the work out, location, and the input from you, your family and/or friends on site, will all have a significant impact on the construction costs. generally guides, by their very nature will refer to averages, however, in our experience most self builds are anything but average!

our lenders
finding lenders that have an appetite or any understanding of homebuilding projects can be tricky. but, that's definitely not a problem you'll experience with buildstore. our exclusive panel of lenders consists largely of building societies and all of them, true to their roots, are keen to help you build a home.
