when my wife judith was alive, we desperately wanted to keep her at home for as long as possible. als canada was able to provide a wheelchair and a ceiling lift, both of which were very helpful.”
james king•former caregiver

when my mom was diagnosed with als, we had no clue what to expect. als canada was with us from the beginning, providing guidance, education and support. the only way i could show my gratitude  was to offer my time to raise awareness and funds  so that this program can be offered to other  families dealing with the same things my family  went through.”
ritu sethi•als canada volunteer

my focus is not on the three letters a-l-s, but on four letters: hope. in addition to my appreciation for the practical support als canada provides, to me it’s equally important to focus on new treatments, research, and hopefully a cure one day. this inspires me to fundraise and i am filled with gratitude for all others who do, too.”
steven gallagher•living with als since 2019
