it only takes one bad hire money is a horrible reason not to do a background check on a potential hire or volunteer. one cheap "national search" and you've brought on the wrong employee that could damage your companies' image or reputation- and it could cost you everything. if you don't screen properly, you could face hefty fines from the federal trade commission (ftc), a multi-million dollar employment lawsuit, or worse. invest now instead of paying later.invest now instead of paying later.

insulate your workplaceone wrong step and you’ve employed a felon or stumbled into a lawsuit. you need a background screener with your best interests in mind. the cheap online guys leave you vulnerable. the big firms won’t take your call, or leave you with a bot. at shadow trackers, we treat every client like our only client, big or small.





giving you one less thing to worry about since 1992licensed activity - in states and/or counties requiring private investigators to be licensed, we utilize licensed private investigators for such work. such license requirements are verified through each respective state’s licensing boards. in some instances, a third party may be used, who in turn utilizes a licensed private investigator. our goal is to protect all parties involved.
