john 
                15:16 
                "ye have not chosen me, but i have chosen you, and ordained 
                you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit 
                should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my 
                name, he may give it you." 
people 
                were jesus' top priority. he involved himself in the lives of 
                people who were considered the worst of sinners, and he met them 
                where they had needs. in doing so, he helped elevate their sense 
                of self worth. one of the ways jesus gave worth to the people 
                was by showing them their value in god's eyes, by comparing god's 
                care for other creatures with his care for them. the authority 
                of jesus was opposed because he was a poor carpenter's son from 
                the village of nazareth. 
john 
                15:16-17 
                â€œye have not chosen me, but i have chosen you, and ordained 
                you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit 
                should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my 
                name, he may give it you. these things i command you that ye love 
                one another. 
the 
                majority of ministry and missionary activity in the early church 
                and ministry was accomplished by nonprofessionals, ordinary men 
                and women involved in secular work as their occupations. jesus 
                entrusted ordinary everyday people with major responsibilities 
                of spreading the gospel. he took fishermen 
                from their boats, he made them fishers of men. jesus knew 
                that ordinary people would become extraordinary in ministry. 
                "god does not called the qualified, he qualifies the called". 
                when the lord calls us into ministry he does not place limitations 
                on us, we are only limited by our own imaginations. we look forward 
                to speaking with you about your calling and how we may 
                be able to help you further your reach in the ministry. office

chaplain 
                    fellowship ministries is a christ centered, christ rooted 
                    ministry dedicated to recruiting, training, ordaining, licensing, 
                    motivating, and mobilizing an international network of chaplains 
                    and ministries who have been called to serve where ever needed. 
                    from the beginning, the spread of the gospel was a lay movement. 
                    men like peter and john were untrained fishermen. 
                    the majority of ministry and missionary activity in the early 
                    church and ministry was accomplished by nonprofessionals, 
                    ordinary men and women involved in secular work
as their occupations. jesus entrusted the laity 
                    "ordinary people" with major responsibilities of 
                    spreading the gospel. he took fishermen from their boats, 
                    he made them fishers of men. jesus knew that ordinary everyday 
                    people would become extraordinary when empowered by the holy 
                    spirit. when the lord calls us 
                    into his ministry he does not place any limitations on us, 
                    we are only limited by our own imaginations and other people 
                    if we allow them to.. 
the 
                    members of chaplain fellowship ministries are ordained and 
                    licensed as nondenominational chaplains and ministers. 
                    we are a one of a kind ministry of presence with members and 
                    affiliate ministries serving nationwide. we come from all 
                    faith groups, ethnic, gender and educational backgrounds. 
                    chaplain fellowship ministries by god's grace and guidance 
                    has been molded and shaped after the ministry of jesus, and 
                    we are growing by leaps and bounds every day. we are looking 
                    for real people who are serious about their calling. the 
                    members of chaplain fellowship ministries are very real hard 
                    working people with the heart and compassion to reach out 
                    to those who are lost or in need. 


the 
                great commission: chaplain fellowship is about the great 
                commission. do you feel like you are being called to do something 
                that will make a difference in your life, but you don't know where 
                to start? i think that maybe we have all felt that call at some 
                point in our lives. becoming ordained and licensed as a chaplain 
                and minister will take you far beyond your wildest imagination. 
                it will make you a much larger person in 
                the spirit of the lord than you ever dreamed you could 
                be. as chaplains and ministers if we see someone in need and have 
                the ability to help them and don't, how can we say that the love 
                of jesus abides in us? never forget that what we go after here 
                on earth, determines where we go in the hereafter. we make a living 
                from what we get, but we make a life from what we give. 
                anyone can give without loving, but no one can love without giving.
proverbs
11:25
- 
                 be generous, and you will be prosperous. help others, 
                and you will be helped. those who are good are rewarded here on 
                earth, so you can be sure that wicked and sinful people will be 
                punished.
chaplain 
                fellowship ministries is internationally recognized as a faith 
                based nondenominational ministry of presence that offers everyone 
                including the every day hard working man or woman an opportunity 
                to serve in the position of an ordained 
                chaplain and minister through specific ministry programs. chaplain 
                fellowship offers ordination, ecclesiastical endorsements and 
                certifications in your chosen field of ministry thereby allowing 
                anyone who feels god 
                has called them to be able to minister at some level as a ordained 
                chaplain and minister. our mission 
                is to recruit, qualify, 
                equip, and offer training to officially recognize those seeking 
                legal ministry license, ordination, chaplain endorsement and accredited 
                certification documentation as ministers, 
                pastors, priests and chaplains. 
the 
                picture on the right is a very real person and the best example 
                we have to prove the need for nursing home chaplains, no one should 
                ever be treated this way. when chaplains make regular visits to 
                nursing homes, it cuts down on this type of mistreatment. not 
                all nursing homes have this type of abuse, but there are many 
                that do. this little lady is a child of god, and there is no doubt 
                that there is a special place in heaven for her. this type of 
                abuse is a disgrace and we should all be ashamed to allow such 
                treatment of our senior citizen. as legally ordained chaplains 
                we can make a difference in this world, we just need to get out 
                there and do it. all it takes is good hearted people who have 
                compassion, mercy, kindness, love and understanding. 
                if you don't want to be a legally ordained chaplain or minister 
                fine, just please do something in your life to make a difference 
                in the lives of those who are hurting, suffering, 
                who have lost everything, or have nothing, and no where 
                to turn. we have to be there for each others, as brothers and 
                sisters in jesus christ, it is up to us! becoming a chaplain will 
                change your life and the lives of others 
james
2:14 
                -
dear brothers and sisters, what's the use of saying 
                you have faith if you don't prove it by your actions? that kind 
                of faith can't save anyone.
we 
                know by building and strengthening our communities and proclaiming 
                the gospel of jesus to the world at large we are doing what he 
                has called us to do. jesus has poured out his spirit upon us, 
                we are to help the lost who are seeking salvation, 
                we are to help those seeking healing for the spirit soul and body 
                with the anointing that rests upon each of us in the name 
                of jesus.
james 
                1:27
- 
                what god the father considers to be pure and genuine religion 
                is this: to take care of orphans and widows in their suffering 
                and to keep oneself from being corrupted by the world. 
 
                chaplain fellowship ministries will not judge you, belittle you 
                or criticize you for your past, or your lack of a formal education. 
                please understand it takes all of us to get the job done, just 
                as jesus recruited many from different backgrounds. it does not 
                take a college graduate to walk into a biker bar full of bikers, 
                in fact we would not advise it, it takes a biker who has been 
                there. nursing home chaplaincy or ministry takes a chaplain who 
                is ordained and has compassion, mercy, love and understanding, 
                it takes those who have the love of jesus christ in their hearts. 
                it requires someone who knows how to listen, and many times someone 
                to just be there with them when they are dying, the thought of 
                dying alone is very scary for senior citizens. who 
                better to work with our returning troops or veterans of other 
                wars than veteran who are chaplains themselves that have been 
                there and understand their pain, suffering, fears and disappointments.
james 
                2:13
- 
                for judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. 
                mercy triumphs over judgment. does anyone not want a merciful 
                judgment from god, before whom all must stand?
when 
                we begin our work as an ordained chaplains and ministers we can 
                be confident that the lord who has already started a good work 
                in us and he will complete it. please never let anyone tell you 
                that you are not good enough for the lord's ministry, or that 
                the lord has not called you into his ministry. there is no human 
                being on the face of this earth who has the right to judge or 
                decide who has been called, or who has not been called. 
                we understand that it is the lord who ordains, we simply recognizes 
                what he has already done, and provide the legal documentation 
                required by the secular world. membership and ordination 
                information 
we 
                all need jesus as our lord and savior in our everyday lives. he 
                is the one who can lift us above the degrading forces of evil 
                in the world that tries to tell us we are not good enough. it 
                is jesus who holds all things together, including our lives. become 
                a member and receive your god given right to ordination and license 
                as a legal member of the clergy. take a leap of faith, and watch 
                your whole world, and the way you see thing, literally transform 
                before your own eyes. 
1 
                cor 9:19-22
for 
                though i am free from all men, i have made myself a servant to 
                all, that i might win the more; 20 and to the jews i became as 
                a jew, that i might win jews; to those who are under the law, 
                as under the law, that i might win those who are under the law; 
                21 to those who are without law, as without law (not being without 
                law toward god, but under law toward christ), that i might win 
                those who are without law; 22 to the weak i became as weak, that 
                i might win the weak. i have become all things to all men, that 
                i might by all means save some. (chaplains must be all things 
                to all people).
we 
                believe all christians have been given spiritual gifts
to 
                fulfill their callings. ministry ordination 
                is a spiritual gift and calling directly from god and is not to 
                be taken lightly. he chooses to call 
                who he will, or to use any instrument, to accomplish his will. 
                when we act upon our calling, we become a member of his ministry.

galatians
6:4-
you should each judge your own conduct. if it is good, 
                then you can be proud of what you yourself have done, without 
                having to compare it with what someone else has done.

romans 
                12:1-4-8 -
just as each of us has one body with many members, 
                and these members do not all have the same function, so in jesus 
                we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all 
                the others. we have different gifts, according to the grace given 
                us. if a manâ€™s gift is prophesying, 
                let him use it in proportion to his faith. if it is serving, let 
                him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach; if it is encouraging, 
                let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, 
                let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; 
                if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.
