possible meteor storm may 30-31
there are several predictions that there may be a new tau herculid meteor shower overnight monday may 31 that may reach "storm" levels and may be the best in decades or even a generation.
unfortunately, it seems that the event is likely to be a "hit or miss" situation and will either be a very impressive meteor shower, or basically nothing at all, and if it does occur it may last only a fairly short time.

astronomy zoom presentation october 20, 2020
david jarkins springfield astronomical society member and nasa solar system ambassador will be presenting "our neighbors next door- alien life on europa" via zoom with the christian county library on october 20, 2020.
when most people think of the search for life on another planet, they imagine some kind of intelligent humanoid creature. while creatures like that may exist, it is far more likely that we will find other forms of life more prevalent. the presentation examines what we believe are the requirements for a habitable world, where we have searched, and where we may find life close to home.
