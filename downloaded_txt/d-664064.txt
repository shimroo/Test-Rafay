our new site


 


from 1 february 2016, the casting network migrated their services to the pop platform. (popsss)

the casting network remains an independent agency but now also encompasses the functionality of the software facilities of the pop platform, which greatly increases the speeds for processes for availability-checking, provision of look books/suggestions, booking sas & producing booking sheets.
