        children’s legislation begins moving at state capitol


 by joe dorman
•
february 10, 2025

as the first full week of session has ended, the lawmakers at the oklahoma state capitol are hard at work with shepherding their legislation through the committee process.                                                                                     the legislature has implemented a new committee deadline system which has extended the time for hearings by committees; in the house of representatives, they have established that most bills will be heard by two separate committees. this is an attempt to front-load much of the work to go over the bills and have them in better shape when they move the full house of representatives for discussion. this idea has a great deal of merit.                                                                                     lawmakers are also continuing the effort to improve the transparency of the budgetary process. this is something advocates, and every oklahomans, should applaud as we see similar conversations at the federal level.                                                                                     as the legislation moves forward, the oklahoma institute for child advocacy (oica) works with lawmakers to promote ideas, and to stay connected with others who are moving their own agenda items forward. in this column and in subsequent weeks, i will highlight some of the house bills i hope you will also review and encourage lawmakers to support.                                                                                     rep. mark tedford, r-jenks, has filed legislation to modify the process for awarding child custody to parents going through the court process. oica worked with him, along with other advocates, to attempt to shorten the long, drawn-out process of costly legal battles in the court system and attempt to establish a more solid opportunity for parents to have 50/50 custody of their children. this arrangement is something social science has shown will most benefit children. house bill 1082 is currently in civil judiciary/judiciary & public safety oversight awaiting consideration.                                                                                     rep. mark lawson, r-sapulpa, sat down with advocates to develop a new concept to ensure that children are safe when in custody of the state or housed in other children’s institutions which receive state or federal funding. the oklahoma commission on children and youth would have the ability to investigate complaints, review inspection reports from other government agencies regarding the facility, and interview residents (children) within the facility to ensure that they are safe.                                                                                     this is in direct response to the issues seen with the tulsa juvenile detention center and that mirrors issues from the 1980s that led to a massive overhaul of the way oklahoma cares for justice-involved youth. house bill 1574 is in the children, youth & family services/health & human services oversight committees.                                                                                     house bill 2921 by rep. ajay pittman, d-oklahoma city, seeks to allow dental therapists to operate in oklahoma. with the increased need for dental care in our state and a limited number of dentists, this would create and authorize the practice of training these health care providers. they would be able to apply specific care to patients which will help in decreasing issues with dental problems before they escalate.                                                                                     if the bill passes, dental therapists will have to receive university training, and the therapists could be hired under dental practices to work throughout oklahoma. the bill is in the house public health/health & human services oversight committees.                                                                                     finally, some sad news to report: two excellent lawmakers with whom i served passed away last week. former reps. bill nations, d-norman, and ryan kiesel, d-seminole, both did exemplary work to make our state better for all oklahomans. bill was ryan’s mentor in the legislature. ryan had helped bill win his first legislative election, and then a few years later, ryan was elected and joined him. our state is better for them having served, and i will miss them both.                         ﻿

      children’s court system is desperately needed statewide


 by joe dorman

january 27, 2025

as the oklahoma legislature begins work, there is a record number of bills presented for consideration over the next four months before the constitutionally required adjournment on the final friday in may.                                                                                                  the oklahoma institute for child advocacy (oica) is diligently reading bills to determine which would have a direct impact on the health and well-being of children and their families.                                                                                                 some of the concepts are quite innovative, while others resurrected ideas which did not pass in past legislatures, the two-year period when lawmakers meet between elections. there likely will be several ideas not filed that will possibly be added to the bills as they work their way through the process.                                                                                     one returning idea for consideration is the proposed creation of a business court system in oklahoma. currently, the judicial branch may create such a court, but the newly filed bill would require there be such a court in oklahoma’s two counties with a population of more than 500,000 residents: oklahoma and tulsa counties.                                                                                     this idea has support from governor stitt and many people inside and outside the capitol. this is a good idea to have judges who are well-versed in an area of law rendering rulings for a more just system.                                                                                     with that, i also encourage lawmakers, as they look at the need for this type of court, to consider another area of the law which desperately needs attention: expanded children’s courts in oklahoma.                                                                                     children’s courts would be charged with addressing the severe backlog of thousands of family cases. these cases are critical because delays are keeping children away from their families or slowing their placement in a permanent setting that is best for the child. currently, only four counties have designated judges specifically charged to handle such cases through a juvenile bureau, but more are needed.                                                                                     the federal court improvement program (cip), created to “promote the continuous quality improvement of court processes and legal representation in child welfare proceedings through ongoing data analysis,” provides federal funding to state and tribal courts to assess their child welfare and judicial practices and develop and implement improvement plans. other states have models which could easily be replicated in oklahoma.                                                                                                  a children’s court system would reduce numbers of youth lingering in foster homes or awaiting placement with other family members until a court renders a decision. some of these cases can last well over a year, which is traumatic for the child and impedes business productivity while employees are involved in these cases. this often costs families tens of thousands of dollars.                                                                                                              oica was among the organizations supporting the family representation and advocacy program. this program, under oklahoma’s supreme court, provides financial incentives for attorneys around the state to take on family law cases. this is important because these cases almost always do not pay well from families, often struggling financially, who want to find a way to bring their children home. this program levels the playing field for families by providing access to experienced family law attorneys.                                                                                                 it is important that lawmakers continue to expand this program to see success, but even this will not provide the overall solution needed. the ultimate answer is to have judges across oklahoma who specialize in family law who can set manageable dockets and have resources to expedite decisions to benefit children involving greater use of court appointed special advocates (casas) and guardian ad litems.                                                                                     we encourage policymakers to consider a statewide children’s court system. not only will this be best for families and their children, but it will also be good for business in oklahoma.                         ﻿

 




      your "helicopter" moment in life

january 17, 2025

when i heard the news of the death of former president jimmy carter, i was reminded of a statement he made 10 years ago during his announcement that he was battling brain cancer. he was asked if he would have done anything different in his life. i was surprised by his response.                                                                                     “i wish i’d sent one more helicopter to get the hostages and we would have rescued them, and i would have been re-elected,” carter said.                                                                                     by the way he responded, you could tell that decision weighed heavily on his heart. i hope that this did not haunt him, but i also know with politicians, due to the nature of their decisions which sometimes impact millions of people, they often struggle with making the best choice for most people with the least harm to those they represent.                                                                                     former gov. george nigh often says that based upon the information that he had at the time, he felt that each decision he made was the correct one in that moment. now, information can change and provide a different outlook in the future but knowing that you did the best you could with what you had certainly makes it easier to not dwell on those decisions.                                                                                     every person has some situation which at some degree plagues them, a “what-if” scenario that either is a whisper at the back of their mind or that completely disrupts their life. if it is the latter, let this be a suggestion for considering a conversation with a therapist to discuss how this has impacted you and a way you can move past that tribulation. it is important to seek help for something which causes you to dwell in the past and what might affect your current personal or professional well-being. i am not embarrassed to share that i sometimes visit with a therapist when i feel pressure, and this provides significant relief. i have also found that it helps to visit with people who you have “wronged” in some situation to enable that healing, hopefully on both sides.                                                                                     facing regret in a healthy way is critical to growth, healing, and hopefully prosperity.                                                                                     i have thought about what my “helicopter moment” might be, and i am fortunate that i cannot point to a major one. i can certainly think of several choices i have made which i wish that i had handled differently, but nothing as significant as president carter. personally though, i wish that i had developed a better work/life balance in my earlier years as i am a “workaholic” and have often spent far too much time with my job instead of building a better equilibrium. with that regret, i do balance it with the opportunities to do good that i have been afforded, and, to me, that certainly helps.                                                                                     i provide this bit of advice to those policymakers who are about to start making decisions for the people with their votes: before deciding on legislation, put thought into the consequences and outcomes for all those impacted.                                                                                     additionally, no vote is worth keeping your elected office. if it goes against what you believe is “right” at your core, you must be able to look at yourself in the mirror long after you leave your position. but also, do not be afraid to grow as a person, as sometimes you learn from others and your views (and vote) might change. finally, dedicate time to friends and family as it is easy to lose touch with them while serving in an office.                                                                                     your “helicopter moment” could come at any moment, so do your best with what you have so as to hopefully avoid that regret.

as the 1st session of the 60th oklahoma legislature approaches, there is much work occurring at the state capitol.                                                                                     congratulations to sen. lonnie paxton, r-tuttle. for being elected the next president pro tempore of that body, and to rep. kyle hilbert, r-bristow for being elected as the speaker of the house of representatives.                                                                                     when the legislature convenes for the regular session again on monday, february 3 at noon, lawmakers will begin the process of debating, amending, and passing legislation. the four months of the legislative session will involve advocates from many walks of life and a myriad of interests engaging with policymakers to share ideas on multiple sides of each piece of legislation.                                                                                     the advocates who understand the rules and procedures have a tremendous advantage in this pursuit as they know the deadlines and the rules which are used to operate the process. to help with that, the oklahoma institute for child advocacy (oica) created a conference which teaches those who attend the nuances of the process.                                                                                     this legislative learning lab is designed to not only be a deep dive into the process, but also as a way for likeminded advocates to network and build alliances. it is not necessary to be a child advocate to attend, as almost all of the instruction is solely on how the process works.                                                                                     our team has assembled a powerful slate of speakers and panelists. we will kick things off on wednesday, january 29 with dr. bob blackburn speaking about the political history of oklahoma; essentially how we got where we are based on the circumstances which have shaped our state.                                                                                     following that, i will present a dialogue explaining the structure of and versions of bills heard by the legislature, along with the overall framework of our current legislature. over lunch, current legislative leaders, including speaker hilbert, democratic senate leader julia kirt, democratic house leader cyndi munson, and a member of the republican senate leadership will speak about the 2025 session.                                                                                     we will have a conversation with cherokee principal chief chuck hoskin, jr., and chairman rocky barrett with the citizen potawatomi nation about oklahoma state-tribal relations. we will have a conversation with former gov. frank keating and former public safety cabinet secretary chip keating about the structure of oklahoma’s executive branch. we will finish the first day with a panel conversation with several capitol reporters who cover state politics.                                                                                                  thursday, january 30 begins with a presentation by senate appropriations chair chuck hall; he will discuss the state budget and how the process works for allocating dollars for services. attendees will hear from lobbyists representing a&a advocates and the lepard group discussing how they work on legislation. we will end the morning by hearing about the committee structure and rules governing both legislative bodies.                                                                                                 over lunch, a panel conversation will give attendees a chance to discuss effective strategies for building coalitions to support or oppose legislation. there will be a presentation on ethics rules governing campaigns and elected officials, and then justice noma gurich will discuss oklahoma’s judicial branch.                                                                                     after this, we will hear about polling, data analytics and the impending use of artificial intelligence in government, presented by former sen. kyle loveless. we will also have a conversation about how oklahoma’s attorney general interacts with the legislative process, along with closing remarks of how to effectively engage in citizen lobbying.                                                                                     if you would like to attend, we still have space available. you can register at https://www.oica.org/events and we also will have the option to attend virtually if you are unable to attend one or both days in person. we hope you will join us and learn the strategy of being a stronger advocate.

some say that deaths occur in “threes,” and for oklahomans that was truly the case last week with a trio of remarkable individuals who each had an impact on those in their circle of life.                                                                                     former u.s. president jimmy carter (100), oklahoma city businessman and philanthropist gene rainbolt (95), and center of family love case manager sister veronica higgins (74) each passed, all having left a mark on those who respected them and the lives they impacted through their work.                                                                                     james earl carter, jr. served as the 39th president of the united states from 1977 to 1981. following his presidency, carter continued his humanitarian work with his wife rosalyn by his side for their 77 years of marriage together. the former first lady preceded him in death in 2023.                                                                                     he was awarded the 2002 nobel peace prize for his work to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. many consider carter to be the nation’s greatest former president due to his philanthropic work with programs like habitat for humanity and efforts to bring peace to parts of the world in turmoil.                                                                                     “i have one life and one chance to make it count for something. i’m free to choose that something. that something—the something that i’ve chosen—is my faith. my faith demands that i do whatever i can, wherever i can, whenever i can, for as long as i can with whatever i have, to try to make a difference.” – jimmy carter                                                                                     closer to home, many tributes have been shared about the life of harry eugene rainbolt, the founder of bancfirst. rainbolt inspired his employees and those around him to recognize the power of philanthropy in impacting the lives of those in need.                                                                                     in 2024, the oklahoma institute for child advocacy (oica) created an award named the h.e. “gene” rainbolt corporate citizen award to recognize a business which helps give back to children through their volunteerism, inspired by the work which rainbolt himself championed for children through his bank.                                                                                     “change the world,” rainbolt wrote in his own obituary. “have some fun. make some money. give it away. believing the tragedy of death has to do entirely with what was left undone, mine ended with my having done all i could do, but with so much more needed!”                                                                                     sister veronice higgins of the carmelite sisters of st. therese of the infant jesus was a past administrator and principal at the former villa teresa school in oklahoma city. sister veronica was a well-recognized presence around state politics, often seen promoting positions dear to her at the state capitol.                                                                                     her passion though was the work with the center of family love in okarche. cfl provides lifetime quality care and empowers individuals to conquer intellectual disabilities, as taken from their facebook page. they shared that the residents called her “mama,” an endearing name that she cherished. she said that she loved completing her career at cfl because god had called to serve the orphans, the poor, and the needy.                                                                                     “love incarnate, help us to follow your example of love by welcoming the homeless, comforting the sorrowful- being your light in our dark world.” – veronica higgins                                                                                     each of these remarkable individuals left an indelible mark on those they touched through their charitable work. it is now up to those of us left to continue their work and lift those around us to greater heights.                                                                                     things often can be overwhelming for those struggling, but it is people like these three who took just a bit of that load off of others and made the trek a little easier, so please pay tribute to each by taking up a cause that will uplift others.

      a season of giving can make a difference for children

december 23, 2024

no matter what holiday you are celebrating in december, there are usually gifts involved.                                                                                     with christmas day and hanukkah both falling on december 25, and kwanzaa starting on december 26, people from all around the world will have reason to exchange gifts with friends and loved ones. i should say most people, as there are many who are without anyone in their lives other than those generous strangers who provide the means to share a bit of joy with those truly in need.                                                                                     think back over the past and remember that one special item which brought joy to you. i can think of many great things received, even with my family often struggling to make ends meet. one of my friends had a handheld video game, donkey kong, and i really wanted one of my own.                                                                                     my parents gave me a gift to open one christmas morning. it was a video game cartridge of the game that i wanted, but i assumed they did not realize that it was not the item that i wanted and would not work without the atari console. to surprise me, they brought out the console it would play on following my look of dejection. i was thrilled. it was special to have something like this, a gift i never expected to receive.                                                                                     i was lucky. i had parents willing to make that type of financial sacrifice to see me happy. in fact, i appreciate all they were did to provide opportunities for me, along with people in the community where i grew up who helped me have the chance to take 4-h trips, participate in activities, and be involved in programs which set me on the path to service.                                                                                     with my current job, i often see the tribulations many modern-day youths face. far too many do not have family members who provide a safe and loving home for their children. when this happens, the state must find a suitable place for children to remain until problems are resolved and reunification can happen, or adoption when no other option is left.                                                                                     according to the state-run website okfosters.org, there are currently 5,824 children currently in the custody of the state as foster children, with 350 waiting to enter the system. oklahoma human services estimates that there are 736 families needed to serve as foster or bridge parents for youth at this moment.                                                                                     at one point, oklahoma ranked ninth in the nation for grandparents raising their own children’s children. much of that number is contributed to incarceration rates for single parents or sometimes even both parents. other family members are often called upon to take in youngsters when something happens which requires the children to be taken from their mothers and fathers so as to avoid foster care. these family members often do not receive financial support similar to what foster parents receive from the state to care for children due to budget constraints.                                                                                     many of these children will be fortunate to eventually return to their biological parents, but they need a safe, loving environment until that occurs. if you are able and have the means, please consider giving that special gift to a child who is enduring the most traumatic experience of their young life: being a foster parent.                                                                                     oklahoma is in desperate need of those who could open their home to a child in need and make that difference to them. if you are moved to do so, please call 1-800-376-9729 to learn more. please also share this thought with friends, your church, and others so together, we can ensure each of these children has the brightest of holidays possible.

 




      nonprofits need you this holiday season

as we approach christmas and the other holidays celebrated during this time of year, many will have joyous moments, while others will endure sadness.                                                                                                 i want to extend heartfelt appreciation to the nonprofit camp fire heart of oklahoma as their board made the difficult decision to close down. this program offered many camping adventures to thousands of young people through the years.                                                                                     our ok-lead program, which took older foster youth their ropes program, was an experience which our campers enjoyed thoroughly. unfortunately, the inability to recover financially following the pandemic led to this decision. they have indicated news about their campgrounds are forthcoming.                                                                                     many areas of the nonprofit sector have endured financial stress in recent years, partially from federal tax policy that eliminated some incentives for giving, along with personal giving having faced a slowdown due to economic hardships.                                                                                                  the oklahoma institute for child advocacy (oica) has been no different in that we had to leave some positions vacant longer than we wanted this year to ensure we could complete our mission and be ready for 2025.                                                                                                              i have heard stories shared from counterparts regarding the need for financial support and more volunteer hours to support work. i can attest as just a few short weeks ago, we had members of pi kappa phi fraternity at oklahoma state university, the house in which i was a member, come to oklahoma city to help with distributing soonercare information which was mailed to schools and daycares in twenty rural counties. these brochures provide information to families about how to qualify and a number to call for assistance. we appreciate their help as we would have missed our deadline if not for them.                                                                                                 not all of the news this year is negative though as we just wrapped up our annual effort to help support foster youth across the state through ok foster wishes. oklahoma human services (ohs) approached us for support to collect gift cards for foster families to be able to purchase gifts for the youth under their care.                                                                                     ohs set a goal of 200 cards of $150 each this year and oica originally committed to raise funds for 50 of them. thanks to generous donors, we were able to surpass that and provide 82 cards for them. if you were a donor to this or another of the ohs holiday hope programs, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your generosity.                                                                                     we will still collect for holiday hope for another week as children enter foster care each and every day, including on christmas day and these workers are committed to their mission, even on holidays.                                                                                     it is not too late to support your favorite nonprofit organization or mission. your donation could make the difference in sustaining the work coming from nonprofits. end of year giving often raises 10 percent of the funds that these organizations use to operate. please do not leave them off your list this year as the struggle is very real.                                                                                                  and, if you are so moved, we at oica would be very grateful to be included among your end of year giving plans to support our operations. you can go to make a donation at                                                           https://tinyurl.com/oicadonate                                                           or to discuss planned giving, you can contact our development director, dr. myron pope, at                                                           mpope@oica.org                                                           with questions.                                                                                                 thank you in advance for your generosity to oica and all the nonprofits that do critical work in oklahoma. your support is what keeps all of the state’s nonprofits able to continue improving the quality of life for oklahomans.

 




      advocates look forward to working with new leadership at state capitol

december 9, 2024

the deadline for submission of ideas for the upcoming legislative session was friday, december 6, and lawmakers were turning in their concepts for bills up to the final moment.                                                                                                  the oklahoma institute for child advocacy (oica) worked with several state senators and representatives on ideas developed during our annual fall forum conference. i expect a robust conversation will be held this upcoming session on those ideas, which comprised the children’s legislative agenda for 2025. you can read that document on our website at                                                           https://tinyurl.com/25oicalegag                                              .                                                                                     i always enjoy this time of year as advocates who have suggested solutions to problems have the opportunity to work with policymakers to produce the needed answers. of course, not all of these ideas move forward; sometimes the price tag is too much no matter how noble the solution. of course, politics sometime comes into play, and personalities certainly can influence which ideals move forward.                                                                                     people have taken notice of late regarding civility in politics. i would argue that, in oklahoma, our lawmakers certainly take pride in their party registration, but the division is not as wide as what we see at the federal level. of course, with 81 of 101 house members being in one party, and 39 of 48 senators also being in the majority party, it is often more difficult for members of the minority to have their bills heard due to time constraints and natural differences in views.                                                                                     the big difference in oklahoma is the hostility between the parties is not as prevalent as what we see in federal politics. i believe that is due to many state lawmakers finding areas of consensus, sometimes with it being friends with each other’s families or sharing school loyalties, or even geographic similarities.                                                                                     i deeply enjoy working with colleagues from both parties to discuss the problems seen and seek reasonable pathways to help those who are facing those issues through my years in this business. i feel there are a majority of people who are elected who also share that sentiment.                                                                                     i am extremely excited about the new leadership teams in both the house of representatives and the senate for the upcoming session, ranging from new presiding officers and floor leaders to budget committee chairmen who have been elevated from their vice chair roles.                                                                                     one of the two minority leaders will also be a new person holding that role. i have had a chance to work with each of these men and women through the years and i believe each to be in public service for the right reasons, which makes the job easier for child advocates. we can rest easier knowing lawmakers also want to see realistic solutions and are willing to look at different pathways to get to those answers.                                                                                     as we begin the new session, oica will collaborate with all lawmakers willing to work with us on new concepts this year, some involving access to insurance for children, greater access to medical and dental care statewide, and increased support for affordable childcare. we will also continue to work with allies who want to revisit the effort to end corporal punishment for special needs students. we look forward to working with budget leaders to ensure the many successful programs benefiting the youth of our state continue to be funded.                                                                   ﻿                                                                  while this all might be a “glass half full” view of our state politics, i do feel optimistic that this new generation of leaders who either continue or begin their service in february will live up to that term “leader” for our state.
