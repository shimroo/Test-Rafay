2025 new york city rising stars

new york city is in a league of its own. the level of execution and creativity continues to impress and inspire us year after year. but this time around, we’re struck by a new generation hard at work and leading the charge in the city we call home. from young guns to seasoned entrepreneurs, the hospitality industry in new york is going through a transition. sustainability, community, and well-being are top of mind as restaurants, bars, and bakeries infused with personality and identity open across the city. the post-pandemic era has finally faded away and something new and exciting has emerged. stay tuned for the announcement of our new york rising stars award winners and the release of our new york magazine on wednesday, february 26th.
