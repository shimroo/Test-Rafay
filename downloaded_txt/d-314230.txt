untitled sonnet





again, i fell for it, the same ole' dating routine.i saw you, i loved it, until i saw the real thing.you acted like you were "the stuff" and tried to push me away.i rejected that attitude and came closer trying to stay.you turned your back repeatedly, making me feel bad.you even yelled at me once because i made you mad.you cut me off in sentence once to shut me up right then.you squeezed your eyes and walked away, and left me alone again. i watched you walk the longest way, again i felt so awful. but, i'll never stop thinking of you, or how you are so wonderful. by sydney stewart

untitled poem





when away i feel okay alright i get home sink into my regular depression self pity, self loathing self analysis what a wimp i hate this life what comes ahead what was what is we are born to die go to school work for fifty years die another ant come and gone that's all we are if you think you're different you're wrong if you choose optimism congratulations i wish i could i try, but my brain won't have it cursed to a life of self pity self loathing, pessimistic wimperyby eric newport

untitled poem





wherever i am whoever i'm with apathy sits in the pit of my soul melodramatic my writings may be expressive of thoughts and feelings they are accurate depth perception falls short writing with ease flowing with words empty of meaning without direction my brain is wrinkled with repetitive thoughts of petty introspection feeling worthlessby eric newport

untitled poem





teenangstpoetry.com note: not entirely sure if this is an authentic teen angst poem or an adult angst poem channeled through the bad rhymes of a teen angst one. am i gifted or cursed for the way that i think? have i been given something extra or am i missing a link? nothing ever seems complicated or too hard and i happily go that extra yard.i see things in patterns and approach things one step at a time; however i am at a loss to explain my downward climb. i have always been different and have never fit in. so many questions i don’t know where to begin.is there anyone else out there at all? maybe you are the one who should answer my call. i can’t be the only person who loves to work and live alone, who reads and writes and hates the phone. i can never be myself around people i know and it is a huge effort to keep up the show. i pretend to be stupid and i never make waves, bosses seem happier when working with slaves. i work twice as hard and never complain. i put up with ignorance and listen to the truly insane. i lower myself to have half the chance. nobody likes a smarty-pants.i never claimed to be brilliant, but i can’t change what i know. i swallow my pride and secretly grow. i need none of the things that people work for. although they are nice to have around, i need something more. what that something is i have yet to find out. until then i will quietly accomplish my goals without any doubt.everyday something happens that hurts me deeper inside. a struggle each time to go on or runaway and hide. so many things in this world that don’t make sense and closer to home on the same side of the fence.no one cares about anything at all. they do their eight hours and disappear behind a wall. everyone rips everyone else off. people are treated like pigs in a troph. most people accept that they have to work, but they take the fun out of it and just go bezerk.all the rules and regulations. the lawyers and courts and masturbations. schoolyard politics, techno and rap! nothing left to enjoy, i am surprised we don’t snap.why have tertiary pressures to succeed, when there are not any jobs for the many that need. i have painted a grim picture that affects us all. these problems can be fixed when broken down small. i program myself daily not to worry about things i can’t control. i predict the things i can, a one in six chance each time i roll.by matt carroll http://www.mattjamescarroll.com

untitled





in silence the air trembled, every movement caused the table to shutter. millimeter by huge millimeter i shook towards the edge, this is not direction i would choose to go, if i were actually alive. i am an empty glass, alone, unable to help myself. if i were to fall the pain would last just seconds, for i would be the only one grieving. then i clattered off the table. the glass spilled into fragments like tiny blades scattering across the floor. the event lasted seconds, but the following trials would last much longer. for if there was not a foolish infant crawling along the floor unable to reason, then a boy would not have to chase after it... but the boy did, and in that same moment glass flipped into his eye. screaming in agony, the boy fell unto to the floor, his body only met more shards. sharpened glass hit arteries, a red pool swirled around him. the paler he got the more crimson stained, his body sliced into pieces bled. after mush flailing the glass blades completely disfigured him. he died. two things gone. the baby startled, as was the mother and the process started over. please don't leave us on edge, we'll get revenge.by: eimile mcilnay 1983

about




teen angst poetry


vancouver, canada
what is teen angst poetry?
teen angst poetry is written between the ages of 12-18 (or later) when one is depressed or hurt. it is an outlet for the most "profound" thoughts ...or so you thought at the time - those "yes! this is so what i mean!" moments. most often teen angst poetry has horrible rhyming schemes and very obvious metaphors. 
common themes include: 
i am alone, 
no one understands my pain,
i will never love again,
fuck you,
fuck off,
go to hell, and
life sucks.
