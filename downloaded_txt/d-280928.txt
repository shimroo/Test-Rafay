						frederick hohman announces the completion of a new original musical work for organ and piano duo, bearing the title "elegy." the work is of moderate difficulty for both organist and pianist, and has a duration of approximately 7 minutes. the new work took its inspiration from a small, two-note motive which is found in samuel barber's adagio for strings. among the compositional stylings which are common to frederick's writing are the melodic "sighing" figuration, as well as his "floating" tonality, where tonal centers retain their dominant-tonic effect, while never becoming grounded in any one musical key. frederick hopes to record the work at the pro organo studio in december, and to release both the recording and an engraved, printed dmusical score in march, 2017.

						when released, the score shall be available at the zarex scores section of proorgano.com. to view and sample more of frederick's original compositions, which are published and available for purchase, please link here to the zarex scores area of the pro organo website.

frederick lectured and provided an organ recital in the site of the birthplace of edwin h. lemare on saturday, september 12. frederick joined the congregation of holy trinity church in ventnor, isle of wight uk, on the weekend of september 12-13, as the parish recognized the 150th anniversary of the birth of edwin henry lemare (1865-1934). edwin henry lemare was born and raised in ventnor, isle of wight, where he became known as a keyboard prodigy, playing the organ at holy trinity church, prior to setting off for advanced training in london. lemare has become known in recent decades as a supreme organ virtuoso of the symphonic organ era, which spanned the years 1880 to 1920. lemare was a celebrity musical figure, active both in england and in america, who helped to shape the development of modern organ-building techniques and playing styles. frederick, who focused his eastman school of music doctoral essay upon edwin lemare's musical career and playing style, will gave a lecture on lemare from the lecture located in the nave of the sanctuary at 5:00 p.m. on september 12. a buffet supper followed at6:00 p.m. at 7:30 p.m. fred gave a one-hour recital of original works and transcriptions of lemare and his contemporaries on the holy trinity church organ, an organ that edwin lemare once knew as a youngster.

notes by fred ... posts from 2013 and earlier.
three new hohman score publications now available. just this past week, i was pleased to see the first printing of three new publications. one of these has been a very long time in arriving. it is my 1988 transcription of the march of the toys from victor herbert's operetta "babes in toyland." please link here for details and to purchase this score at proorgano.com.

						the second of these new printed scores is my highly embellished arrangement of the original trumpet voluntary attributed to henry purcell and also to jeremiah clarke. link here to see details and a sample of the score. it is called festive trumpet voluntary in e.

						the third of these new publications is a recent arrangement, and the first in a series of similar arrangements soon to appear in print, from the keyboard concerti of j. s. bach. the first movement of the keyboard concerto no.3 in d, bwv 1054 is now available, and the score reveals how i play both the keyboard soloist part and the orchestral parts with one organist on a three-manual organ.
hand in glove is how i would describe the experience of playing the very musical organ built by dan jaeckel at first lutheran church of duluth on april 21. i found it an instrument that gave much back to me, and the connection there, i believe, carried over to enhance all aspects of the recital. i look forward to playing mr. jaeckel's opus 52 again!
good spirit was with us in concert at third baptist in st. louis in february. it was a wonderful and spiritually-charged time at third baptist church in st. louis on sunday afternoon, february 24. the organ dedication recital went well. the third baptist church and members of the emmanuel episcopal (webster groves) church choir joined me in a hymn-sing in the early part of the program, and they sang again later in the program when third baptist's choir director, mr. kad day, led the choir, brass, timpiani (and me at the organ console) in the premiere of my"festival anthem on the hymn-tune germany." the 6-1/2 minute anthem was commissioned from me by third baptist church for premiere at the february 24 organ dedication concert. the work is now published by zarex scores and is available for purchase. it is recommended for a minimum 50-voice satb choir. link to the product here. for a look at all the scores published under the zarex scores brand, sold exclusively at proorgano.com, please link here. the audio of the february 24 concert was streamed live through the auspices of organlive.com. i was told after the concert that listeners from more than 10 nations around the world were tuned in.
tumbling off the podium - february 25! on the evening after the february 24 recital, on monday, february 25, i was pleased to present a lecture-recital upon the topic of the symphonic organ and transcriptions for the st. louis chapter of the american guild of organists. the venue, again, was third baptist church and its newly-completed 4-manual reuter organ. about 2/3 of the way through my presentation, i took an unexpected tumble off the stage. the podium and pulpit area is multi-leveled, and is covered in the same white carpet. i did not see a drop off in the area, and as i went from one side of the podium area to another, there i went! while some in attendance uttered an audible gasp, luckily, i fell correctly, and no harm was done, so i picked myself right back up and finished the presentation. thanks to ago for coming out for the event and for arranging such a well-catered meal at the church prior to the evening's program.
