how to be happy according to jesus
happy are the helpers (pt. 2)









on television
count it all joy
the joy of serenity 









today's devotional: feb. 18
illustrating mercy
the book of proverbs is filled with comparisons using like or as (a simile). for example, “like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control” (proverbs 25:28, niv). a lack of self-control is compared to a city with broken-down walls. instead of saying, “practice self-control,” the image of the city illustrates the danger of the lack of self-control.

from this point forward by dr. jeremiah
cure for the unbridled life
are you tired of feeling like your life is spiraling out of control? surrendering to god can lead you to true freedom, purpose, and an overwhelming sense of joy. imagine the powerful analogy of wild horses and bridles, illustrating our tendency to live 'unbridled' lives, chasing after our own desires instead of following god's will.
the good news is that there is a solution—allowing god to 'bridle' our lives through the holy spirit. although this might seem restrictive initially, be assured that it opens the door to the abundant fruits of the spirit: love, joy, peace, and so much more. he invites us to trade in our wild, chaotic lives for peace and fulfillment by embracing god's gentle and guiding hand.

are you sabotaging your spiritual growth?
8 habits that are destroying your walk with god
feeling stuck in your spiritual life? you're not alone. we all develop habits that can unknowingly sabotage our relationship with god. it might be procrastinating on prayer or comparing yourself to others, leaving you feeling envious and discouraged. even passively going through life can disconnect us from god. but recognizing these habits is the first step to freedom!
by turning to scripture and prayer, you can replace those negative patterns with intentional actions that draw you closer to god. imagine the peace and joy that awaits as you realign your life with his purpose!

mind your priorities
what do you think?
what is the human mind? is it the brain or something different? while the bible doesn’t define the mind, it does contain the most important words ever spoken about the mind: “you shall love the lord your god with...all your mind” (the words of jesus in matthew 22:37). while jesus didn’t define the mind, we know exactly what he means. we are to use our unique human ability to think, reason, and choose in ways that honor god.
the gifts of thought and choice are a part of our human resources, just like time, talent, treasure, and our physical body. and we are to be good stewards of those gifts.
in this series, dr. jeremiah studies the mind and together we will discover how our mind determines who we become; and learn the critical need for renewing the mind in order to be spiritually transformed.

the jesus you may not know
this study is not a recounting of jesus’ earthly life and ministry. it is not about what jesus did. dr. david jeremiah takes you on an amazing journey into the very heart of christ—not through a storybook of his life, but through an astonishing exploration of his character, his attributes, his spirit.
did you know...

jesus can be found in the old testament!
jesus actively seeks us!
jesus is praying for you!
jesus said we will do greater works than he did!
jesus desires to work through you today!
jesus is preparing for a second resurrection!
jesus is living in the past, present, and future!

none of us know him as fully as we should, for jesus is the mystery of the ages. take the journey to knowing the full depth of jesus with dr. jeremiah.

download your free legacy-planning guide
christian legacy planning organizer
we all enjoy planning for our family vacations and getaways with loved ones. however, how many of us spend more time planning a vacation than we do planning for the future? probably most of us. why? because planning for a vacation is fun, exciting, and brimming with anticipation. planning for our future seems to be a bit different since it can involve fear, confusion, and uncertainty. but, if you plan for your future legacy in an organized way, it can be just as simple as planning for that wonderful vacation that is so exciting. you just need to get started, and we want to help.
begin the process of making plans that last by downloading your copy of turning point’s free christian legacy planning organizer.
