as the largest kempo karate association worldwide, we take our job as leader in our field of kenpo very seriously. we have without a doubt the best video training and ranking program in the martial arts.we teach those with no experience to agencies and military. our best selling program is highly accelerated for fast results when you are in need of sure fire moves to get you safe in a hurry, whether you are in a dangerous job or area of the world, or being stalked by the school bully. our video program succeeds where others have failed.. 






















accept the challenge to be fit
here at the world kempo association we do not throw a bunch of karate techniques at you and then mail you a worthless piece of paper and call that teaching.  




we have a serious program that teaches you real self defense just like you were in one of our private kempo lessons. you will feel as if our master instructor is right there with you in person. every video is designed to teach you everything you need to know for that specific belt level. none of our students green belt (equivalent to most schools black belt level) or above has ever lost to an attacker on the street or in a military application! when attacked they proved kempo rules a street fight. you train at your own speed competing against no one but yourself. you will gain the knowledge and skill in a few short months that take others years to learn, if they are lucky enough to find a qualified instructor. if you can perform the material you can get the ranking. there is no time in grade, only your ability matters. we have been doing this for a long time now and we have it down to an exact science. after we receive your testing video that you make for ranking and evaluation purposes, our master instructors will review and critique your video. you are then sent an e mail of your progress and what you need to work on, and if you have passed the test for rank advancement. professor hargrave grades all tests personally and contacts you with the results. we understand all styles and can help you. since there are so many different kempo or kenpo styles our video program does not focus on the empty hand kata. the program utilizes three weapon forms only and the rest is combat techniques and strikes. while the moves may be familiar they take on a different twist of being non telegraphed or non chambered for combat efficiency. this is the next step up in your martial arts journey. its not easy, but the things in life that we value never are. for those who are already black belts or school owners we offer certifications and rank recognition.
