movin' out.



i love that billy joel song, movin' out (anthony's song) particularly this verse:you should never argue with a crazy mi mi mi mi mi mindyou ought-a know by nowyou can pay uncle sam with the overtimeis that all you get for your moneyand if that's what you have in mindthen that's what you're all aboutgood luck movin up cause i'm movin outwell i'm doin' just that: movin' out. well kinda. i mean this little corner of the interwebs will still be here. for now. i'm just craving a fresh, new start. i hope you'll feel the urge (and heed said urge) to follow me over to the new digs. you might like the place. it might take a little bit of getting used to, but i think it'll be pretty cool.please come visit. often & long. my biglittle world is my new personal blog where you can check me out on a regular basis. i've also cracked open a couple of newer blogs with a much different focus than this here personal one (or the newer personal one). i guess you could say i'm branching out with sharing my ideas and thoughts. while i wouldn't pretend to think that i'm an important person, i do believe that what i have to say and what i hope to represent in this world can be of some value to someone. you can find the links to my new blog-ventures at mybiglittleworld. i hope you'll take just a few minutes to check them all out.

see it. be it.



on this last day of 2008, many people are thinking about, talking about, or avoiding the age old ritual of new year's resolutions. most folks plan to lose weight or stop smoking/drinking. those are the most popular new year's resolutions. most of the same folks lose their momentum sometime around february 1st or shortly after the super bowl game, whichever comes first and it's no wonder with all the beer, nachos, and burger ads. the reason most folks fail at keeping their new year's resolutions is not because they are stupid, lazy, or gullible (although some may, indeed be all three). they fail because they never quite get past the setting the resolution stage. they never set up a game plan for succeeding.looking back at the goals i have accomplished and those that i have failed to accomplish, there is indeed a common thread. those goals that i managed to accomplish were goals that i planned out step by step. i figured out what steps i needed to take to be successful. i considered what obstacles i might face and how to overcome them. i considered a plan b, plan c, and vowed to be flexible in case there was a need for a plan d. but most importantly, i imagined myself being successful. i utilized the power of the human mind (and i'm living proof that little can indeed be large when it comes to brain power).most successful people will tell you that it takes visualizing the end result to get to the end result. if you cannot imagine yourself being successful, you are less likely to be successful. ask any top notch successful athlete or entrepreneur and they will tell you that visualization is definitely a factor in increasing your probability for success.i often refer to the practice of visualization as playing a self-made movie in my head. is it any wonder that i harbor fantasies of being an actress? you get to make up the script, the wardrobe, the lighting, the cinematography, set design, everything! and you can even alter details on a whim and in a split second--or less. you get to be the hero (or the bad guy, if that's your kinda thing). i like the little movies in my head far better than some authentic hollywood products these days. of course, serial killers often used the power of visualization to, ahem, acheive their goals.now i'm not saying that you'll definitely be successful if you sit around daydreaming all day about landing an incredible job, hooking up with that hot guy/girl, or getting super fit. no see dude, you actually have to do the thing you picture yourself doing. the visualization part makes you more comfortable in doing it, helps you improve your actual skills in doing whatever you need to be doing, & reinforces progression to a positive outcome. that nike ad really did have something going for it you know?so, as ya'll get ready to throw yourselves into the new year with new plans, goals, and aspirations, remember that you can help yourself become successful by picturing yourself actually being successful. and how cool is that?*check out this google search on visualization to help you locate helpful resources for your particular goals.

house.



this is a really interesting online test. it's based on the draw-a-house test.... well it is the draw-a-house test. i'm not sure the results are entirely accurate for me, but who knows...i'm always learning something new about myself and the world around me. here's what my results said: based on your drawing and the 10 answers you gave this is a summary of your personality:your house tells the world that you ought to be a leader. you are a freedom lover and a strong person. you love your house and family. you are a gifted artist as well. once you have a problem, you need a friend with you. your life is always full of changes. you are very tidy person. there's nothing wrong with that because you're pretty popular among friends. your life is always full of changes.you will avoid being alone and seek the company of others whenever possible. you love excitement and create it wherever you go. you see the world as it is, not as you believe it should be.you added a flower into your drawing. the flower signifies that you long for love. it also safe to say that others don't see you as a flirt. you don't think much about yourself.your turn! if you click this link you will be able to draw a house too and see what your drawing says about your personality. when you have drawn your house it will be added to my street, pleasant cove, which is a collection of all the houses drawn by people i know.

inner peace.



it's been a hectic week. really.yet in the midst of the fast pace and the craziness, i'm finding more of me. i'm becoming more and more centered and balanced. i'm trying to see beyond the surface to the truth. lately, it seems that i have these sort of epiphanies -- or maybe they are really psuedo-epiphanies. is there really such a thing?at any rate, i don't want to get all spiritual and mystical on ya'll, but it's true--in the middle of all this frenzy i'm finding the calm.must be one big effin' storm on the way.

change.



tuesday, november 5, 2008 will definitely go down in history as one of the greatest days of our time. change has certainly come to america and the world. while i did not support our new president elect with my own vote for my own reasons, i was indeed moved by the moment. the record turn outs proved that each vote really does count. i hope that this shows many others that they, too, should vote because they do have a voice in our government. i am indeed proud to be an american. i am proud to have witnessed another barrier broken.i am still concerned about what happens now. i am one who can be moved and affected by words, but for whom actions are key indicators of true intention. i will wait. i will watch. i will support and i will celebrate, but i will insist that our president be held accountable for his words and his actions. i am hopeful. cautiously hopeful.i want to break out in dance and song (not a pretty sight for onlookers i'm certain) to celebrate one more barrier broken, and yet at the same time, i know that this historical moment cannot overshadow the realities of the world of politics. barak obama is a politician, no matter how different he may present himself to the world. our society asks, no demands, that politicians please all the people all the time. this is an impossible task. i know that there will be times that i agree with our new administration and there will be times that i disagree, as with all administrations that i have followed in my adult life. now is the time to set aside differences and disagreements and work for improvements for all americans.preseident-elect obama said that he hears even my voice and that he is dedicated to being my president, too. my hope is that he will be my president by his actions, not just his title. my hope is that he fulfills his campaign promises and that my fears of what is to come will be quelled.congratulations mr. obama. congratulations america. thank you mr. mccain for your graceful and respectful concession speech. thank you all who voted in this election to prove that each and every voice really does count.
