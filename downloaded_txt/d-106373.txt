new stormo! forum


		as i promised last year, a new forum  was in the works. although i enjoy the current forum format, the phpbb style format
        is so widespread now that its become the standard. and so today, i roll out the
        new forum. the style, colors and the theme reflect much of the feed back i
        received from the current forum. the new forum is separated into two parts, a modeling forum and a history forum. the history section
        is extensive with fifteen topics covering all the major theaters of operations of the ra and anr. i also provided a forum for
        "other history eras" that cover flight from its earliest inception. there's also a general history section. also included is a
        research section and a current events forum covering the latest news, politics and sports. the new forum comes with many different
        and interesting avatars of ra fighters, bombers, ground attack aircraft and ra/anr units. each registered user begins with a pilot
        ranking and is promoted to squadron commander, then gruppo commander and so on depending on the number of 
        individual posts.


		i'll continue with the current forum until the end of the month at which time i will close this forum and transition to the new forum format. until then please do register and do contact me with any suggestions for the new forum.

		welcome! this has been sometime in the making, stormo!  stormo! is an online model magazine devoted to the 
		modeling of the italian air forces of wwii as well as the italian armed forces in general. you maybe asking
        yourself what stormo! means?  well its the equivalent of an italian wing in aeronautical terms. for example,
        three squadriglie (squadrons) make up a gruppo (group) and two gruppi (groups) make up a stormo (wing). some
        italian wings or stormi are quite famous such as the 1o stormo (archer) and 4o stormo (a wing in honor of
        francesco baracca, a famous italian wwi ace who  sported the prancing horse and made famous by ferrari s.p.a).
		by the way, the 'o' in 1o stands for 'primo' like the 'st' in 1st (first).

		stormo! publishes high-quality, well researched historical and modeling articles
		which present interesting subject matter regarding the regia aeronautica (ra) and
		the aeronautica nazionale repubblicana (anr) as well as the italian armed forces of wwii.
		please 
		submit your articles or read interesting articles from the
		
		articles page.  also, do participate in lively debates on the 
		 stormo! discussion forum.

		please glance through 
		stormo! storefront products for finished kits, books and decals.
		it is our sincere hope that stormo! will provide a complete
		virtual online experience from model building, forum discussions, online articles, purchasing books
		as well as having the opportunity to own a highly detailed and realistic model of a
		regia aeronautica or anr fighter, bomber or ground attack aircraft; or just having fun
		flying a ra or anr aircraft in a flight simulator.


		the webmaster,


		vince tassone
