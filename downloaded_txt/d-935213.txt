about our new design – august 2020
we know that you will have questions and queries about our new design for the website. so, here’s some information about it.
since the last redesign in 2017, many members of a.a. contacted us and congratulated us for our work on making the website more friendly to alcoholics and addicts all over the world.
the site however lacked a strong search engine and aesthetic appeal. we also had some critical feedback that was taken on board with a positive mindset and we decided to rebuild the website with a much stronger, faster, and sleek looking framework. having gone back to the drawing board early in 2020, we finally finished our work in august and voila! we hope you are happy with our work and will continue to support us in preserving the history of alcoholics anonymous.
