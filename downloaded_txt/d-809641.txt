welcome to aboc
in july 2024, amalgamated bank of chicago ushered in a new era by rebranding as "aboc." the new name and look reflect the bank's embrace of a forward-looking, digital-first philosophy while retaining the principles -- such as responsible banking practices and a commitment to excellent service -- that has made aboc successful for over a century. though aboc continues to evolve and grow, the bank is built on a strong foundation.
