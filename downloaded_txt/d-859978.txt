kinder mountain rescue team (kmrt) has been in existence since 1971, and is one of seven mountain rescue teams that operate within the peak district national park, as part of the peak district mountain rescue organisation (pdmro).
our 50 members operate on an purely voluntary basis and are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to assist members of the public on the hill or in urban search and rescue situations.
we are almost exclusively funded by public donations, and all proceeds from fund raising go towards equipment and resources used on our call outs.
