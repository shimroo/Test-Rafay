the corrector & protector by len brown



saddle fit, by the man that started it all!the butterfly racer shown in the back, the fork has a thigh relief cut in the swells. they swing back & move the horn forward & give you confidence to concentrate on your horse & the barrels. all black mesa saddles have a narrow waist seat, so you can ride all day in comfort. how can the gullet be wide & the seat narrow? it’s the bar twist. as i twist the bars out at the top in front, they get a steeper hourglass seat shape and narrower at the bottom bar foot in front. no-pinch twist means the tree doesn’t pinch withers with a wider gullet. it is supported on the upper rib cage outside the withers by the curved bar foot on each side. this basic geometry is used in all my trees, it lets me send you a saddle without playing “saddle-fitting games”. only the length is a concern to be sure the saddle is not too long for your horse’s back. a couple of photos of your horse from the side with current saddle and no pad, tells me the saddle length your horse needs. regards, len brown

has been bringing awareness of saddle fitting problems to horseback riders world-wide since 1983.len did this through clinics, booklets, videos and inventing the ortho-flex panel systems that attached to a saddle. he spent millions and fought the industry. it changed the world of the horse. while ortho-flex became the largest saddlery in the us., there was never an article done in a major horse magazine! after having the 3 major publishers settle in an anti-trust legal action, len shut the company down in spring of 2001. it was not worth pursuing a battle with multi-billion dollar publishers supporting the rest of this industry. by 2003 len designed a new device that has since been improving the life of horses and their owners alike!      the corrector was made to eliminate having to buy a saddle to fix your horse's problems. it is made to work with any saddle and any horse or mule! find new ways to solve your horse's saddle-fit problems while enjoying the site!

the protector 



these 1/10 inch thick "impact resistant" polymer shields are never used directly on the horse as shown under the cutter tree above ! they are laminated in between layers of felt to make a single unit saddle-pad called "the protector" . balance shims are  then inserted into a pocket under the top layer of 1/8" wool felt of the protector pad.  this combination is all you need under your saddle as the balance shims are used to take the "rock" out of your tree bars & balance yourself & your saddle on the horse.  these protective shields are inside all protector pads and a 4mm felt liner pad is included so you never have to wash your protector. balance shims come with the protector as well. 















the protector is a pad with the patented corrector system built into it.  it is :  closer, softer,& lighter, and has the 10" thick kydex protective shields built into the envelope pad. 6 front & 4 rear 1/4” thick balance shims are std.w/ western protector pads. they slip in a pocket under the top 1/8” felt layer of the pad & over the protective shields.all protector models have a liner pad 4mm felt that is shaped just like the protector above it. an 1/8" felt with fleece liner is available when ordering, in place of the 4mm felt liner. liners attach via 1” elastic & velcro at front & rear center of the pad. now you don't have to wash your protector pad. new liner pads are available separately.  just remove the liner & hose it off, let dry for a half hour, velcro back on & ride.

neoprene foam in seat & up the back of swells to create that "pocket" to hold you secure & comfortable.an english tree with a western fork. the pocket is 22" long for the 13" racer. it is comfortable, secure, and you feel your horse like you're riding a treeless. let's the horse move better than the typical saddle. it stays on the horse like glue with the 3-point in-the-flap adjustable rigging. the double layered skirt cups the ends of the bars and leaves you with a single layer center to feel your horse. the forward curve in the center of the fork moves the horn forward an 1.5" from the rider this giving the rider more leverage when using the horn and more room when riding at speed. the  matching protector pad that has the patented horse shaped shields & balance shims + a custom 1/8th in. liner pad. everyone that tries a pocket barrel are amazed at how their horse runs and how comfortable & secure they are.
