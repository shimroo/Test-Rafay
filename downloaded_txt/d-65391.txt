life work transitions  »   







welcome
resources, encouragement and inspiration for making your
life work transitions

more personally meaningful,
rewarding and focused on making a difference.

whether we like them or not, transitions are a part of our lives. when the old disappears and the newly emerging is not yet present is a potent time. developing more awareness of what to expect during a transition will help you harvest the wisdom gained from the past. there are generally 3 stages to consider when moving through a transition that will lead to your next transformation:

endings loss of identity, role, income, passion.

 what is that loss for you?

neutral zone dealing with ambiguity.

 how do you handle “not knowing?”

beginning life and spirit speak through you again.

 what is your vision?

discover
through writing and sharing
the story of your life
what works for you.
through the power of your own story gain the confidence and clarity that come with discovering the values and beliefs that guide your life choices. knowing yourself at the core makes it easier when we need to gather our wits and make those choices that make all the difference in the world. whether you are seeking to create a more sustainable lifestyle, or find work with a passion, or prepare to write and live your legacy, i invite you to consider the power of your personal storyline.
i can help you move through your transition to new beginnings with a simple process for creating the insight and outcomes you desire. start with telling your story – you write for yourself. and if you want to share it with me i can help you pull more juice out of it. there are two kinds of storytelling, or autobiographies as they are often called.
life work experience autobiography 
consider a systematic review of your life work experience with a chronological outline of your “work experience” and the times in between. start with early childhood and your first “job” to understand what oppresses you and energizes you in a work setting. where were you at your best in the world of work?
spiritual autobiography 
begin with drawing a storyline that captures all the wonderful, inspiring, joy fulfilling experiences of your early years. even the most challenging backgrounds provide opportunities for learning and growing. draw and then write about significant “spiritual” experiences (not necessarily religious) that bring out your highest self.
i would like to join you in your current “transition” as you journey through your past and present story. you can sign up to receive my newsletter and announcements of workshops and new programs that will enlighten your journey. i look forward to hearing from you.

deborah is available to lead workshops and retreats and six week classes in your church or organization. she is also eager to help you if you want to enhance or deepen your writing, or deepen further your understanding and self awareness. her expertise in reading between the lines, and looking for clues and your spiritual storyline are amazing. check me out. i’d love to hear from you.
