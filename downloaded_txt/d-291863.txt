quality is fundamental. not discretional
qubed ai is our proprietary technology that is designed and trained to stop the panel fraud we see today and tomorrow and improve respondent quality. this next-gen tech uses advanced ai and machine learning to identify fraudulent activity within milliseconds – protecting the integrity of your data and the million-dollar business decisions you make with it.
 









key features
advanced ai & machine learning
our anti-fraud tech uses 5 deep neural networks and years of data collection to identify fraud where humans and other software cannot. we don’t rely on urls, thus futureproofing data defence.

real time, continuous operation
a single action doesn't define a panellist - there is a whole story to tell. qubed ai uses a respondent's full history to detect fraud.

detects fraud in milliseconds
it processes over 300 survey and respondent features per survey session and is trained daily based on 60m+ events - giving it data to trigger an appropriate response instantly.
