river art group is one of the largest and finest artist groups in the country. housed in the historic florian house within la villita artisan village in downtown san antonio, river art group was formed during the summer of 1947, when two small groups of san antonio artists had the notion of doing a combined art show on the refurbished san antonio riverwalk.
today, river art group has over 200 member artists from san antonio and surrounding communities working in a wide variety of media. our gallery offers works in acrylic, oil, watercolor, pen and ink, pastel, photography, clay, metal, wood, and fine art reproductions. many artists are juried in for multiple categories. 

river art group is fortunate to have very talented artists in the group, and all activities are directed and executed by members, including the daily operation of the gallery. the hard work and dedication from so many of the members over the years has contributed immeasurably to the longevity of our self-supporting organization.
in addition to the operation of our physical gallery in la villita and our online shop, river art group runs a members-only competition each year, and sponsors and organizes riverartober, an annual outdoor art festival the first weekend of october open to both member and non-member artists.
