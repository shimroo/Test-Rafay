impact story
empowering indigenous communities
indigenous communities often shoulder a disproportionate burden when it comes to the impacts of climate change and are also one of the first groups to feel the effects of a changing climate. while they only make up a small percentage of the us population and a comparatively small contribution of total planet-warming emissions, indigenous communities have long been at the forefront of the clean energy transition and efforts to implement climate solutions.
for the lumbee regional development association (lrda) – a private nonprofit in pembroke, north carolina, founded by tribal leaders seeking to bring much-needed social, educational, and economic services to lumbee members – going solar will deliver meaningful cost savings that will be reinvested into their community in the form of education and workforce development programs. in partnership with eagle solar and light, sunwealth developed solar on top of lrda’s roof, which is the first solar installation on a building associated with a state recognized tribe in north carolina. this installation will reduce 1,826 tons of carbon over its lifetime, save $51,000 in lifetime energy, and generate 76 kw of clean power.

impact story
a mango farmer in peru
carlos ochoa has worked in agriculture for over 20 years as a farmer and owns the santa rosa farm in peru. his entire family, including his four children, are dedicated to agriculture as farming is the family tradition. before purchasing the farmland using his savings, carlos rented the property. today the farm employs about 40 workers during harvesting season.
carlos explained the challenges of farming and how he became a mango farmer. “before, i grew rice, and now i grow mangos. before there was more water, so we sowed rice, all of this area was filled with rice paddies. now, we have water shortages and because of that i grow mangos instead and the entire harvest is exported to europe and asia.”
“for the future, i hope to keep growing trees and maintaining the soil quality, and perhaps buy a larger fumigation tank. we get loans every year, and it helps us to work and improve the plantation. it helps us to keep it in good condition and improve the furrows and the roads.”

impact story
mr. guardado becomes a first-time homeowner
at the age of 25, mr. guardado achieved the remarkable milestone of becoming a homeowner, a goal he once deemed impossible. at college, he had the opportunity to connect with representatives from affordable homes of south texas, inc. (ahsti), who gave him information about their housing programs. he discovered that ahsti also catered to deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) beneficiaries, which meant he didn't have to delay his aspirations any longer. this opportunity allowed him to take a significant step towards purchasing a home for himself and his family. mr. guardado's living situation became urgent, as their current home exposed them to hardships associated with changing weather conditions.
reflecting on his journey, mr. guardado described the experience as truly gratifying. as a daca recipient, he never anticipated receiving such comprehensive assistance and care. he was initially apprehensive about what to expect and admitted to feeling fearful. however, on the day of the closing, he found the whole experience surreal. the prospect of a better life and a brighter future filled him and his family with hope. mr. guardado expressed profound gratitude to ahsti, concluding his interview by saying, "thank you, ahsti." this transformative experience has left him more knowledgeable about the responsibilities and joys of homeownership.

impact story
kigali’s big shift to small electric motorcycles
in kigali and across east africa battery-powered motorcycles are slowly replacing oil-guzzling motorbikes, as they bring more benefits than just reduced greenhouse gas emissions. electric motorcycles cost less to acquire, finance, and maintain than an oil-powered motorbike, allowing drivers to save life-changing money for their families. with a petrol bike a driver spends around $2,000 a year, however with an e-motorbike a driver can save a third of the cost, which is about $700 a year.
ampersand, africa’s first electric vehicle and ev energy company, is working to transition kigali’s community to e-motorbikes and cut emissions, help drivers save money, and fuel a greener future. the company was founded in 2016 and manufactures lithium-iron-phosphate batteries. since its founding, ampersand has grown its fleet in rwanda to more than 2,200 e-motorcycles, over 300 employees, and 26 charging stations. in rwanda and kenya combined, ampersand powers over 1.2 million km per week and provides 120,000 battery swaps every month.
numukobwa dative is one of ampersand’s customers and began driving a year and a half ago. she purchased her e-motorcycle for $2,100, including interest, through an 18-month credit financing program coordinated by ampersand and the deutsche gesellschaft fur internationale zusammenarbeit (giz), and funded by un-habitat via solutionsplus. the battery provides electric power, giving dative a smooth, silent ride of up to 100 kilometers (km) per charge. dative and a group of 32 other women received free driving instruction and have since formed a cooperative to support each other. dative has also completed a short mechanics course. dative’s e-motorcycle debt is now fully paid thanks to a steady stream of daily customers who hire her to take them to school, work, bus stations, and home again. read more about ampersand’s work here.
