 what our guests say about us

   
 5/5  ~  1/4/25we stay at the sherman twice a year. we love the history, the architecture, the staff. we are never disappointed. they did a great job of preserving the charm of this building while adding modern comforts and design. we highly recommend!!

 5/5 ~ 10/28/24quaint hotel on the town square. the room is nice, there is a window unit for heat and air due to the age of the building. everything else in the room is very modern. both the king bedroom and bathroom are big and spacious. little winding halls make it feel like a mini maze getting to the room. it's very quiet and peaceful in the area. very nice rural town and surrounding area. beautiful area.  definitely will stay again at the sherman. love it.

 5/5 ~ 7/15/24i try to stay at the sherman every time i am in batesville.  it is always exciting to see what room you will get as i am almost positive no two are the same.  it is close to everything i need and it is always clean.  the staff is friendly.

 found a gem from google maps!we drove from st louis to ohio to pick up a much needed boat part. we wanted to stay somewhere decent heading towards home, searched historic hotels and found this. the room was perfect. fresh, clean, new, welcoming, and the bed/linens/pillows 5*****.
