welcome to lisle townshiplisle township provides vital services to residents efficiently and equitably. services include the food pantry, recycling, medical lending closet,  senior services, passports, benefits access, and more. the township fills a specific need within our communities that other units of government – like cities, villages, the county, and the state – do not.

 

by law, illinois townships are charged with three basic functions:the administration of assistance for residents in need;the assessment of real property for the basis of local taxation;the maintenance of all roads and bridges outside of federal, state and other local jurisdictions.
