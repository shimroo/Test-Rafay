          ‚Äúi reported to jared for 2+ years while he led the recruiter product team at linkedin and would highly recommend him as a product leader and manager. jared leads with empathy and puts the customer and his team at the center of every decision he makes. as a product leader, he managed to inspire large teams of engineers, product managers, designers, and cross-functional partners behind bold visions--launching a new mobile experience, taking on the largest enterprise launch in linkedin's history, etc.--while managing to sweat the details that make for truly exceptional customer experiences and inspiring others to do the same. as a manager, jared was deeply committed to creating an environment where everyone on the team produced their best work. he set a strong team culture, worked tirelessly to create a deeper understanding of our customers and business, and struck the balance between providing guidance while leaving enough room for each member of his team to run on their own. for these reasons, and so many more, i would welcome the chance to work on jared's team again!‚Äù

          ‚Äújared and i are partners in crime for linkedin recruiter. we worked very closely together for 2.5 years to build best product experience for our customers. i would recommend jared as a product leader to anyone and any company. he's a very passionate person.  you can always see the sparkle in his eyes when he's talking about his product vision and roadmap. he's also full of compassion when working with everyone around him. 

one thing i really admire him is that he has a way to make complicate things easier. he's able to reason about things and dissect complicate problems into different components to provide clarity. he's a great person to have to move things forward.

over 2.5 years period, he and i built a lot of trust between product and engineering. we lean on each other but yet often challenge each other for a better product. i throughly enjoyed my working experience with jared.

          worthy read: the art of decision-making by joshua rothman

in the product talk newsletter, i recommended the book farsighted: how we make the decisions that matter most by steven johnson. in this new yorker article, author joshua rothman considers many of johnson's arguments (and those of other experts on decision-making) through a lens that most people can relate to‚Äîthe decision of whether or not to have children.

check it out here: https://buff.ly/2soawhc

‚ùì reflecting on joshua rothman's article, how have your most significant life decisions‚Äîwhether personal or professional‚Äîshaped who you are today? can you share a specific decision that led to a major transformation or new understanding of yourself?

          worthy read: doerr's law on product teams by al tenhundfeld

there's a well-known quote by investor, venture capitalist, and "grandfather of okrs" john doerr: "we need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries." al tenhundfeld digs deeper into this concept and how it applies to product teams' motivation, empathy, and empowerment.

check it out here: https://buff.ly/34mdt2m

          ‚Äúif there is no clear owner, then it‚Äôs the pm that owns it.‚Äù 

i sat down with esteban contreras from #productstate to discuss product leadership, or prioritization process at productboard. we also dug into the concept of extreme ownership, which is a principle i firmly believe in.

          "how can i best leverage my skip-level meetings with my boss's boss?"

this was a great question during our live ama today! i shared a few go-to questions with the group that marvin and i gathered. 

comment to add your advice too.

expansive questions for boss's bosses: üí¨
‚Ä¢ what business priorities are top of mind for you right now?
‚Ä¢ what keeps you up at night?
‚Ä¢ tell me more about your career journey and obstacles you overcame.
‚Ä¢ what do you look for in an awesome candidate for a manager role on this team? 
(then follow up: "what are my blindspots or things to work on to be a stellar candidate?")



much more coming on this topic, and all juicy things related to 1x1s in my lightning session on maven next week. no-cost, rapid, practical learning.

          "in product, we're bombarded by high-level concepts like empowerment, data-driven, product-led, customer-focused, accountability, getting into the details, and high agency. but teams have trouble putting these ideas into practice. why? and what can you do about it?

when i ask people to describe the behaviors these things might entail‚Äîwhat i would observe (see and hear) if these things were happening‚Äîi often get blank stares."

          unlike many people think, product operations is not just a support role. it's a catalyst for product success! yet, many companies are still slow to adopt it.

in the book "product operations", co-authored with denise tilles, we dive into how this discipline can transform your product approach. one of the key pillars we explore is business data & insights. though many companies have data analysts, they often miss the product-specific context essential for driving strategy.

here's how to get started with data and insights in product ops:

1Ô∏è‚É£ define the key questions that will inform your product strategy.
2Ô∏è‚É£ identify the data you need to answer those questions.
3Ô∏è‚É£ locate the systems where this data resides and learn how to extract it.
4Ô∏è‚É£ begin with a manual dashboard to visualize your data.
5Ô∏è‚É£ use business intelligence tools to automate your dashboards, keeping your data fresh and actionable.

if the data team is outside your product sphere, product ops can bridge the gap, ensuring a seamless flow of insight. if you're just beginning to build this capability, consider anchoring it within product ops to align data with product goals from the start.

let‚Äôs push forward to harness these insights, ensuring our strategies are both informed and impactful. how is your team leveraging data today? i'd love to hear your experiences!

          have your digital transformation, design, and product teams defined a process that triangulates every issue with no accountability? the spotify design and product engineering model has¬†totally¬†ruined innovation, accountability, and speed to market. if you are building your dream home the electrician doesn't work with the plumber...so why do we allow this to happen in design and technology? the enclosed governance model was created¬†as a consequence of¬†witnessing how poorly delta changes and product roadmaps were pushed to production. now we have defined an operating and governance model that works for anything.¬†#startups¬†#digitaltransformation¬†#innovation¬†#governance

          i often see product teams walk away from strategy meetings with more questions than answers. vision statements might sound inspiring, but if they‚Äôre too broad, teams are left struggling to prioritize.

in my blog last week, i explored a way to move forward when strategy feels unclear. anchoring in value, whether it's increasing revenue, protecting it, or reducing costs, can provide a guidepost for decisions that matter.

how do you approach prioritization when strategy is unclear?

          i was asked the question recently, "at what stage should founders start thinking about user experience?" my answer? yesterday! in all seriousness, engaging a ux consultant during the conceptual or planning phases isn't just beneficial‚Äîit's transformative üöÄ

here's why: bringing ux on board early integrates strategic planning right from the outset. this collaboration isn‚Äôt about aesthetics; it‚Äôs about meticulously crafting a product and a growth strategy that align seamlessly with both your business objectives and the needs of your target users üíé

think of your product's user experience strategy as the blueprint for a well-constructed building. just as architects don't add the foundation after the walls, effective ux should be foundational‚Äînot just a final touch-up. starting early means that every element in your app is designed with growth in mind üìà

if you‚Äôre laying the groundwork for a 0-1 venture, remember: ux is the cornerstone, not just the paint üß±

          üé®üí∏ what's the biggest gap for product designers in tech today?

üéôÔ∏è this is one of the many questions marc and i explored with josh brewer (partner @ enjoy the work) in our latest episode of the podcast. 

josh's answer was fantastic: most product designers don't spend enough time understanding their product's business model and go-to-market strategy. this can create a disconnect between user experience and business objectives.

designers who can productively balance ux with $$$ will dramatically increase their impact and accelerate their careers as a result. i couldn't agree more. the most impactful designers i know always connect value for users and value for the business.

our conversation also covered other engaging topics, including:
‚Ä¢¬†attracting top talent and fostering a culture of creativity & accountability
‚Ä¢¬†josh's thoughts on "founder mode" 
‚Ä¢¬†delivering and receiving feedback in a growth-oriented environment
‚Ä¢¬†the role of design in the ai era and its impact on future products
‚Ä¢¬†and more!

          stop gathering requirements.

anyone can make a list of features.

anyone can write down what people say they want.

that‚Äôs not product discovery.

product discovery is about going deeper.

it‚Äôs about understanding your customer‚Äôs pain points.

feeling their frustration. seeing the gaps in their work.

it takes time, patience, and empathy.

it takes stepping away from the solution and sitting with the problem.

great product leaders don‚Äôt rush this process.

they fall in love with their customer‚Äôs problems first.

because when you truly understand the problem, the solution will rapidly emerge.

are you giving yourself the time and space to discover your customers‚Äô problems?

          ux design is often underestimated, but it plays an important role in whether customers stick around or not. if your product is hard to use, even the most innovative features won‚Äôt keep users engaged.

the challenge is getting leadership to see how ux directly affects business outcomes like retention and growth.

here‚Äôs what to keep in mind:¬†
1Ô∏è‚É£ retention insights: are customers dropping off because the experience is clunky? quantify those losses to strengthen your case.¬†
2Ô∏è‚É£ competitive edge: are rivals gaining ground with better ux? show how improving usability can help win back customers.¬†
3Ô∏è‚É£ team capacity: if your team is doing great work but overloaded, demonstrate how adding more designers will help you move faster and deliver more impactful products.

leaders are more likely to support ux improvements when they can see how it directly affects the business. let the data speak for the value of design.
