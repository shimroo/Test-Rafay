a little about the blogger 
  
my name is lulu, and i have seen financial woes before. the way i managed to fix my life? help from a friend. one bit of advice: one day a week, focus only on finances. the rest of the week, just do what you can. this idea got me out of a horrible point in my life, as it gave me a structure to work on. for me, that day was wednesday. i still maintain it as a day i consider my finances and work on improving my finances.
