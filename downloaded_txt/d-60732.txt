	    among the many of its treasures that ireland has shared with the world, are 
	several beloved breeds of dogs. among them are four beguiling terriers and 
	perhaps least known of them is the glen of imaal terrier. it has been 
	described variously as a rough-and-ready sealyham, a miniature irish wolfhound, or a soft coated wheaten on short legs, etc. while these 
	descriptions might allude to an aspect of the glen of imaalâs profile, they 
	ultimately miss the point. the glen isnât a rough-and-ready or miniature 
	anything. it predates many of the breeds to which it is likened and is a 
	truly unique and remarkable creature beloved by most everyone fortunate 
	enough to come into contact with one.
	the history of the breed finds its roots in the starkly beautiful glen of imaal in county wicklow. like its three irish cousins--the kerry blue 
	terrier, the soft coated wheaten terrier, and the irish terrier--the glen of 
	imaal terrier was initially bred to rid the home and farm of vermin, and 
	hunt fox and badger. the european badger weighs in at 40 lbs and the glen 
	was tough and strong enough to go to ground and dispatch the vermin 
	soundlessly.

	according to legend the glen of imaal also has a unique task which it was 
	expressly designed for: it was a turnspit dog. the turnspit was a large 
	wheel which, when paddled by the dog, would turn the spit over the hearth--a 
	canine-propelled rotisserie, if you will. the glenâs highly individualized 
	bowed front legs and powerful hindquarters were ideally suited for this. for 
	several hundred years, these hearty dogs performed their tasks unnoticed by 
	all except those who treasured them. with the advent of dog shows in the 
	19th century, the breed began to emerge into the public eye. in 1934, the 
	glen of imaal terrier was given full recognition by the irish kennel club. 
	it was the third of the four irish terrier breeds to be so acknowledged. the 
	breed is now recognized by the kennel club of great britain, fci, and 
	several rare breed associations. in america the glen was fully recognized 
	by the american kennel club and entered the akc terrier group in october 2004 though the hard efforts of 
	members of the glen of imaal terrier club of america. there are 600-700 
	glens registered in the united states.

	owning a glen of imaal terrier can be a unique and rewarding 
	experience...but it is not the breed for everyone. read on to determine if 
	it might be the right breed for you.
