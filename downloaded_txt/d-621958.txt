welcome to southwind farms

				take a break from the hectic world around you. come witness the quiet rolling hills of connecticut.  learn why the curious gentle alpaca's fiber is comparable only to cashmere. you'll relax and maybe laugh a bit at the antics of these wonderful animals.
				

				as you tour our farm, get to know our alpaca family, and peruse the many different types of yarn and other alpaca products southwind farms has to offer, you will begin to understand why this is more than just a business for us. it's a way of life!
				

				please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions. we'd love to hear from you.
				






did you know this about alpacas?

				there are two kinds of alpacas. the huacaya( way-ki'-ya) has fiber that grows straight out from the body and has crimp to it.  the suri(surrey) alpaca has fleece that hangs down from the body and has pencil-size locks that move in waves when the animal moves.
