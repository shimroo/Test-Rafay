it’s been fantastic. one of my greatest joys is participating in the user group and helping shape the future of autoclerk.

it makes my front desk’s life a breeze so they can focus on the things that matter and serving our clients.

burbank, illinois				





 









 



it used to take a lot of time for us to switch pms providers, sometimes a week or two before our staff could get up to speed on a new system. in switching to autoclerk, our staff was able to use it immediately.




michael shandro
general manager
best western® plus city centre inn
edmonton, canada				





 









 



i’ve been in the hotel business for close to 25 years and dealt with a number of pms providers, and the autoclerk support team gets a 10 out of 10.

if you’re thinking about replacing your pms, think about what things you’re struggling with in your current system and just ask autoclerk to give you a demo. … i’m sure that will really help sway you!
