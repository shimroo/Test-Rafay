wilder woods
curioso
release date: february 7, 2025
        


 
bear rineheart is a seemingly endless wellspring of new songs. 2023 saw a release from both his major music projects - needtobreathe and wilder woods - and while 2024 was a bit quieter for output, he's already back at in early 2025 with another wilder woods album. a more alternative and r&b-flavored endeavor compared to the southern rock stylings of needtobreathe, his latest wilder woods album continues in the same vein as the self-titled album and fever / sky, but with some sonic variations to keep things fresh and fun. on his social media right now, it shows a slew of different playlists curioso's singles are getting adds for - american soul, folk & americana, new in rock, folk rock, and alternative - and it's a good indication of how many genres and eras of music we dip into over the album's 35-minute runtime...









drew & ellie holcomb
memory bank
release date: january 24, 2025

memory bank is a thirteen-track release with sounds covering rootsy americana, bluesy rock, folk, and even traces of motown. due to the wide array of sounds mixing in...









cory asbury
cover to cover
release date: january 17, 2025
        


 
if you have been a music fan for any length of time, the cover song can be a delightful change of pace and a new way of seeing a beloved song. or conversely, it can seem like a violation of one of your favorite tunes. that acoustic guitar player in the corner of the coffee shop can either deliver a well-known number in a refreshing new way, or depressingly remind you of the much better original version.


thankfully, worship leader cory asbury delivers his covers project in the refreshing way, and over the course of about forty minutes, he delivers ten rock and roll classics in a warm acoustic tone...
