crampbuster cruise assist for motorcycles – electric bikes – scooters
the crampbuster allows you to comfortably maintain a steady throttle control on your motorcycle. it eliminates the need to clench your wrist for long periods of time and makes riding much more enjoyable. this easy-to-install paddle dramatically reduces wrist fatigue often caused by long rides.

no tools are required for installation. just spring it open and slip it on.

the crampbuster is not a throttle lock, but rather a motorcycle cruise assist. with a relaxed hand on the throttle, this type of cruise control allows for much easier throttle operation. a crampbuster is easier to operate and more versatile than traditional and mechanical motorcycle cruise controls.
we have five different models to choose from. we have a size for over sized grips that you’ll find on a harley motorcycle, as well as a wide, narrow, long and short model.
try it: you’ll like it.  crampbuster has sold tens of thousands of products with just as many satisfied customers!
