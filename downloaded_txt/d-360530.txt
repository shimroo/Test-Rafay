publicanista! december 27, 2007.





due to technical difficulties, i.e., returning from christmas break to discover an expired walk-in cooler at the public house, there are other things to do than finish the weekly newsletter. i expect to have it posted on friday, december 28, and things at work should return to normal by afternoon on thursday. we're open as usual; however, some beers are warmer than others ...

publicanista! december 6, 2007.





in this edition of publicanista!:i. publican's choice: saturnalia returns.ii. nabc brewery update:holiday flood of house beers.iii. from the hand pull: more casks are queued. iv. itinerary for pacific northwest brewtour '08 released.v. recent news and articles at the potable curmudgeon’s beer blog.vi: draft beers: our liquid, daily bread, on tap at rich o’s and sportstime.vii. new bottled beer list has been released.viii. calendar of events, hours and related facts. ----i. publican's choice: saturnalia returns.saturnalia begins at 1:00 p.m.on friday, december 7. our annual draft festival of christmas beers, winter seasonals and choices that strike me as festive will proceed throughout the month of december, and probably well beyond. with gravity head slated for february 29, “permanent festival” might be the best way to describe matters. the previously published pre-order list for saturnalia mmvii underwent a few alterations before finality was achieved, but arguably fewer changes than i feared. cross your fingers; some kegs are still in transit. a few probably won’t make it until january.now, back to the list. unavoidably scratched were scaldis noel, st. feuillien cuvee de noel and urthel bock, all belgians, and brooklyn brewery winter ale, flying dog k-9 cruiser and north coast old rasputin imperial stout.i chose not to attempt replacing the belgians, because currently there is a backlog of belgians in the pipeline (ichtegem grand cru, moinette, moinette bruin and saison dupont among them), and these will simply be plugged in when the time comes.the chance arose to get moretti, an old favorite in bottles but one that we’ve never had on draft, so it was added to the list.brooklyn brewery black chocolate stout, ommegang chocolate indulgence stout and samuel adams winter lager were added to the ledger from the states. i’m disappointed that old rasputin didn’t make it. we’ll keep trying.view the official saturnalia mmvii program here (pdf). there'll be updates posted here and at my potable curmudgeon blog, but they'll not begin until the 18th of december.17 starters ...belgiumde ranke pere noelgouden carolus noella rulles cuvee meilleurs voeuxenglandyoung's winter warmer (vintage 2006)germanyaventinus weizen doppelbockschlenkerla rauchbier marzenjapanhitachino nest espresso stoutunited statesbbc hell for certainbrooklyn brewery black chocolate stoutclipper city “heavy seas” hang ten weizen doppelbockgreat divide hibernation alejolly pumpkin noel de calabaza (cask-conditioned firkin)nabc bonfire of the valkyriesnabc naughty clausrogue hazelnut brown nectarschlafly pumpkin alesierra nevada celebration alestill to come:belgiumbiere de miel (dupont)de dolle stille nachtde glazen toren canaster winter scotchde glazen toren cuvee angeliquedelirium noeldupont avec les bons voeuxkasteel rougen ’ice chouffedenmarkwintercoat yule alewintercoat vildmosegermanyuerige sticke (gravity pour keg)italymoretti birra la rossajapanhitachino nest xh (aged in shochu distilled sake casks)united statesanchor christmas ale (“merry christmas & happy new year”)barley island bourbon barrel-aged oatmeal stoutbell’s java stoutbell’s winter whiteboulder never summer alebreckenridge christmas aleclipper city “heavy seas” winter stormdark horse tres blueberry stout great divide yeti imperial stoutharpoon winter warmeroaken barrel epiphanyommegang chocolate indulgence stoutpyramid snow caprogue chocolate stoutrogue jls santa’s private reservesamuel adams winter lagerschlafly christmas alethree floyds alpha klaus xmas porterupland winter warmerii. nabc brewery update:holiday flood of house beers.concurrent with saturnalia, nabc will have ten house-brewed beers on tap (see below for list).i botched the naughty claus listing in the saturnalia program. the spices/seasonings used in this year's version do not include ornage peel. there are cinnamon, fresh ginger and vanilla beans in 2007, and the character, while similar to 2006, is different.nabc’s local connection logo designs is busy creating fresh allotments of t-shirts for the holiday season. there’ll be hoptimus and “these machines kill fascists” tees, and, for the first time, brewery (logo + “i’m for it”) shirts in longsleeve. finally, another small release of the past summer’s sportstime 20th anniversary tees (men’s and women’s styles) is coming out. nabc’s t-shirts are okay as stocking stuffers, but work even better when you just wear the damn things.iii. from the hand pull: more casks are queued.cooler weather means we’re back in cask-conditioned “real ale” season. here are the next selections for dispensing by the hand pump:(now) jolly pumpkin noel de calabaza special ale … michigan;
