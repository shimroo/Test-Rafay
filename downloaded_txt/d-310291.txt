welcome to aqua performance, manufacturers of self-retracting boarding ladders for the boat and watercraft industry. what makes our ladders stand out from all the rest? our patented self-retracting boarding ladders are designed to retract up automatically. the automatic, spring-loaded mechanism eliminates the hassle of having to pull your boarding ladder up after every use. all our boarding ladders are uniquely designed to meet the application criteria of any boat or watercraft. when a special requirement is needed our engineers can design a ladder that will meet that application. pull it down – climb aboard and the ladder will automatically retract. it’s that simple!  











what customers are saying... 










						all i can say is...  why didn't we get this step sooner?!  i had been after my husband to put a step on our boat for years.  i was at a point that i would not go in the water anymore because it was such a hassle to try and get back on our boat.  the step made such a huge difference that now all our friends (wives) will only go on our boat! my husband loves the sleek design, and the fact that he doesn't have to worry anymore about whether someone put the step up. this step goes up automatically, it doesn't get any easier. aqua performance i can't thank you enough!  you have made boating enjoyable for me again.

						the boat ladder was delivered today. it fits the boat like a glove. i don't have it mounted yet but it is great. thanks for working with me on the ladder and it is a pleasure to do business with people that know what the heck is going on in this world. not many out there.

						all too often customers have time to complain but never get around to say thank you for excellent customer service. well, i didn’t want to be one of those customers. i thought i was going to get the usual run around from contacting companies on the internet but you reached out to me and took ownership to my problem. your professionalism and problem solving attitude proved to be resolution i was hoping for. so, thank you very much and i hope your company knows what a great professional they have representing them.
take care and stay safe in these challenging times.
