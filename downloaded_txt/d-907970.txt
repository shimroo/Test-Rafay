of course, living in a condo building is not for everyone. those who are looking for a single-family home or townhouse may want to consider neighborhoods such as towles court or laurel park. the towles court artist colony is located in the middle of downtown and offers homes built in the 1920s and 1930s. laurel park, on the other hand, features cobblestone streets lined with old brownstones alongside newly constructed townhomes. both areas are within a short walking distance from popular areas such as burns court and pineapple square. there are a number of other neighboring districts, each with its own unique character and charm.
in addition to the wide range of living options, those who reside here enjoy living a walkable lifestyle filled with rich cultural opportunities. from the sarasota opera house to the many art galleries, there are plenty of opportunities to enjoy the arts. similarly, the farmer’s market, festivals and other local events that take place throughout the year provide residents with ample opportunity for entertainment. on main street alone, residents will find locally-owned restaurants, charming boutiques, an intimate cinema and numerous nightlife entertainment opportunities.
given the recent revitalization of the downtown real estate market, there has never been a better time to buy a property here. with so many options to choose from and with so much to offer, it is no wonder why so many people flock to the area.
so please, have a look around, and contact us with any questions you might have about the market or our services. no question is too mundane - we are here to help!
