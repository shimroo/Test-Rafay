parents need good tools for working with their children.
unfortunately many of the tools parents are using overemphasize behavior modification. heavy doses of reward and punishment weaken the internal motivation in kids. in fact, kids learn to ask the wrong questions about life such as:
 what will you give me if i do what you want?
                  what's the least i need to do to get the reward?
                  is the punishment worth it in order to do what i want?
that's because behavior modification basically says to kids, "if you do what i say, i'll give you what you want."
behavior modification is ruining the internal motivation in kids.
those parents who are successful with their children use a variety of tools. in the family toolbox you'll learn several practical tools that reach the heart of a child instead of relying on rewards and punishment to get through the day.
 
heavy doses of rewards and punishment damage the relationship between parents and their kids.
some parents think the problem is just that they have difficult kids. but if they only knew that there are some better ways to work with children, they'd be encouraged. and, if they put those tools into practice, they'd see dramatic changes. 
when parents rely on behavior modification, then they develop a police officer approach with their kids, often blowing the whistle to keep their kids in line. parents don't want that, but their approach often leads them down the wrong path. 
when parents use a heart-based approach, they take on the role of counselor or coach with their kids. they're still firm. they still offer consequences at times, but they also use a host of other parenting strategies that contribute to a strong and healthy relationships.
it's hard to raise kids today. the family toolbox makes it just a bit easier.
