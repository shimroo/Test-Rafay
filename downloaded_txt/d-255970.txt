pond supplies, pumps, kits and decor
welcome to pond-o-mania.com! where 
            did the sumnmer go? as winter draws near, there are a few seasonal 
            care tips to keep in mind. though pond life slows down during winter 
            time, it is still important to provide regular care for it. there 
            are a variety of things which can and should be done to encourage 
            a healthy and thriving ecosystem once spring returns.
along with the special care tips necessary for the upcoming 
            season, the holidays are also worth mentioning. now is the ideal time 
            to purchase pond-related gifts for any loved ones who care for their 
            own ponds. we offer an excellent selection of filters, pumps and more 
            for great prices.
 









supplies
find only the best supplies for ponds, 
                  gardens, aquariums 
                  and plants.
 


pumps
a variety of accessories 
                  -such as solar water pumps, 
                  heaters and pond 
                  pump filters - can truly enhance your pond.


decor
decor is essential to making your pond your own. 
                  consider bridges, artificial 
                  plants or even accent lighting.











 
 liners
to keep your pond looking clean, be sure to invest 
                  in a pond liner, filter 
                  or skimmer.
 


 kits
our kits contain all 
                  you need to create your dream pond: chemical 
                  supplies , netting, waterfalls 
                  and more.
 


 plants
aquatic plants 
                  add life to any garden pond, 
                  and are perfect for koi and goldfish 
                  ponds.
 




because algae growth will stop during the cold temperatures, 
            the filter and uv light of a pond may be disconnected. these things 
            are only necessary when fish are being fed. during winter however, 
            fish metabolism slows to the point that fish should not be fed at 
            all below 45°f. between 45°f and 55°f, easily digested 
            food such as wheat germ should be used and the fish should only be 
            fed two or three times a week.
plants should no longer be fertilized beginning around 
            six weeks before the first frost. also, particular plants will need 
            particular care. it is best to research any species of pond plants 
            you own ahead of time (this is also a wise step for fish species, 
            of course). hardier plants may simply be allowed to go dormant during 
            the cold season. other plants may need to be brought indoors, however.
for some people, the slowing down of wintertime means 
            extra time for planning changes for the next year. let us help you 
            get started on any future pond project. pond-o-mania offers a wide 
            range of pond supplies, from filters to decor and more. we also offer 
            a useful and informative learning center. all of this is available 
            at your fingertips within the convenience of your home.
            here is some info to help you get started:
lighting - pond lighting 
            does much more than make a pond visible at night. with the right lighting, 
            many interesting and beautiful effects can be achieved. a pond can 
            take on an entirely different sort of mood once the sun goes down. 
            underwater lighting and floating solar lights are just a couple options 
            for creating the ambience you most desire. underwater lighting achieves 
            amazing, gyrating shadows and bounds of light. accent lighting can 
            be used to highlight certain features such as fountains or spitters 
            and cast their shadows across the garden or onto your home. be creative 
            and have fun.
fish supplies – our 
            store includes all the best fish supplies for your koi, goldfish or 
            other pond fish. count on us to provide you with great deals on everything 
            from fish food to water clarifiers. while fish survive simply enough 
            in the wild, using the right products will keep them beautiful and 
            fit in an artificial pond.
filters - pond filters 
            are one of the basic needs for keeping your pond clean and healthy. 
            explore our learning center to decide whether it is a biological or 
            mechanical filter that you need. then explore our store to select 
            from a great variety of filters, including submersible types.
of course, there are many more pond supplies available 
            beyond lighting, fish supplies and filters which are necessary to 
            create and maintain the perfect pond. if you are starting from scratch, 
            then you are going to need a pump, filter, liner and other items. 
            a great idea is to start out with a pond kit. kits include all the 
            basic pond supplies required to build your own.
when it comes to personalizing your pond to suit your 
            specific designs, there are even more options from which to choose. 
            these include water treatment chemicals, fish food, plants and possibly 
            some decorative fountains. unlike the ponds that mother nature creates, 
            man-made ponds require human maintenance to stay balanced and beautiful.
