is your vacuum distillation equipment effective with hemp and cannabis processing?
yes, 0ur vacuum distillation equipment has been proven effective for all aspects of hemp & cannabis processing. in fact, centrifugal molecular distillation (or short-path distillation) is recognized as the optimal thermal separation method for heat-sensitive materials like cannabis, because it poses minimal risk of damaging or destroying the product. myers vacuum is simply the recognized leader in centrifugal molecular distillation. the key principles behind myers vacuum’s stills are low pressure and extremely short residence time, both of which are absolutely essential to effective cannabinoid processing. myers stills give you maximum purity, quality, and yield. contact us today for more information.
