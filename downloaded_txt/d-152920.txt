blue hawaii vacations we specialize in personalized multi-island hawaii vacation packages



 

 why try us?blue hawaii vacations is located on the beautiful island of maui. we began over 22 years ago with the concept that your travel agency should be located where you are going -- not where you are coming from. all of our hawaii vacation specialists specialize in hawaii vacations and hawaii travel, and there's no added cost for that knowledge and service. it just makes good sense to use a hawaii based travel agency with local hawaiian knowledge and local hawaiian service. our agents plan your hawaii vacation in paradise with years of experience, not a guide book. we do not manage properties; we work for you, building one hawaii travel package at a time. our service is free, we never charge a booking fee or a service fee. read more

blue hawaii vacations, inc. was established over two decades ago on the island of maui with the concept that your travel agent should be where you are going, not where you are coming from. we were one of the pioneers of selling hawaii from hawaii, instead of from some large, mainland city.
