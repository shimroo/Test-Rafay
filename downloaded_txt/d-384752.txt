 at acr we specialize in the mail order camera repair and restoration of classic manual focus 35mm slrs dating from 1960 to 1990. we can repair many of the classic manual focus slrs that no longer have factory parts available, and many cameras that other repair shops say are unrepairable.  
 most of the cameras sent to acr stopped working years ago and were stored. the customer usually wants their camera restored to good working condition so they can start using it to take film pictures again for enjoyment or to pass it on to their children. acr has been repairing 35mm film cameras since 1978. 

how does acr mail order classic camera repair service work?
read the  3 steps  below.

step 1.  move down this page to the menu and locate your classic camera. find its repair price and contact us for price confirmation and find out the turn-around time. (there is no obligation and we do not ask you for any information other than what type camera you have and its problem.) call (325) 676-2524 (hours 11:00 to 5:00 mon-sat ct) or use e-mail
 acrkori@gmail.com 

step 2. pack your camera in a good box with at least two inches of packing material around your camera. include our  print-out repair order form  (or a brief letter), describing the problem with the camera. and finally, enclose a personal check or money order for the amount matching the listed repair price of your camera.  click here for picture   

step 3. ship your camera to acr by:

ups
fedex
us postal service

send it to this address:
acr
401 neas rd.
abilene, texas 79601


 acr offers three levels of classic slr camera repair and restoration. all three levels repair the camera to a good working order, but the gold and refurb levels bring the camera closer to full restoration. with each higher level you are buying more of the repair technician's time that can range from approximately one and a half days, up to three days. the technician uses that extra time to go deeper into the camera for restoration purposes (cleaning, lubrication, adjustments, fixing future problem areas).  




silver camera repair service 

the silver repair service is our most economical repair service.  
 basic repair of the camera to good working order. lubrication of accessible camera parts. adjustments to shutter speeds. adjustments to meter setting. replacement of film door foam seals.  click here for pictures    replacement of mirror foam bumper. cleaning the viewfinder of dust. *some restrictions on parts. (information) free return shipping. 90 day warranty 



gold camera repair service 

the gold repair service is our premium repair service.  
the mirror cage is removed to lubricate the shutter bearings and all internal parts that are deep inside the camera. click here for picture   the technician will take extra time to inspect, all those little gears, levers and springs inside your camera. he will also use an air gun to clean out dust, sand and film chips while he is deep inside the camera. internal parts that show excessive wear are replaced with good used parts. (does not include damaged shutters, see refurb.)  adjustments to shutter speeds. adjustments to meter setting. cleaning the viewfinder of dust. replacement of mirror foam bumper. replacement of film door foam seals. click here for pictures   free return shipping. 6 month warranty and most important, we just plain try harder to repair/save a camera that might need retirement. if a customer pays more for gold service, it means to us they are serious about restoration of their camera. bonus: as a bonus with the gold service we make approximately ten digital images of your camera when we first disassemble it. these are for your enjoyment to see what your camera looks like inside, and proof that your camera was disassembled for restoration. the images are jpg files saved at 1024 by 768 pixels. the images are burned on to a mini cd which is sent back to you in a jewel case.  
       




refurbishment camera service 

 the refurbishment service is not really a repair service, although cameras can be sent in for repair under refurbishment. the refurbishment is our best restoration service for classic 35mm slrs. restoration means a super detailed cleaning, inspection and lubrication service. the goal of refurbishment is to go completely through the camera, top to bottom, and get it ready for years of future service. the refurbishment service includes the gold service mirror cage removal / repair / lubrication / adjustments / seals replacement. click here for picture    the main extra features of refurbishment are: 
 gear trains are flushed with a cleaning solvent and then lubricated.  internal parts that show excessive wear are replaced with good used parts. (includes bad viewfinder prisms and most shutters.)   external parts that show excessive wear will be replaced at owners request with good used parts. (some owners prefer to keep the original appearance.)  any areas of internal rust or corrosion are removed.
 corroded or worn wires are replaced.  internal light and dust seals are replaced with new seals. preventive maintenance is preformed on the camera to fix future problem areas, for example, sealing parts that are known to often work loose and fall off into the camera causing it to lock up.   detailed cleaning inside and out.  6 month warranty bonus: as a bonus with the gold service we make approximately ten digital images of your camera when we first disassemble it. these are for your enjoyment to see what your camera looks like inside, and proof that your camera was disassembled for restoration. the images are jpg files saved at 1024 by 768 pixels. the images are burned on to a mini cd which is sent back to you in a jewel case.  
        

 warning light leaks:   check your camera film door foam seals. your pictures may be losing color contrast or getting red and yellow streaks.  to learn how to do this, click here for pictures   
 warning forcing camera:    never force the advance lever on a camera that is locked. you will only damage more parts, and may render the camera unrepairable. try moving the speed indicator to different settings. change the batteries. jar the camera by hitting it lightly with the palm of your hand. but, never force the advance lever if it is locked and will not move.click here for pictures

 acr warranty  
all labor and parts have a 90 day limited warranty on the silver service and a six month limited warranty on the gold service and the refurbishment service. this warranty is limited to parts and workmanship during the warranty period only. what the warranty does not cover: misuse, neglect, water damage, tampering or other external damage to camera or lens. also, the warranty does not cover loss of film(s), battery(s), warranty return shipping costs or any other damages whether incidental, consequential or otherwise. the warranty period begins on the day the customer receives the shipped photographic equipment.  (return to menu) 

some restrictions on parts replacement 
most camera repair shops charge extra for replacing broken parts. at acr we include the parts as part of the quoted price. for this reason we have to restrict some of the more expensive parts on the silver repair service. we will replace at no extra charge small parts such as rewind knobs with the silver service, but for larger more expensive items such as viewing screens, prisms, shutter parts, we require the gold or refurb service. if you are not sure about the level of service you need, contact us.
