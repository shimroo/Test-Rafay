experience the magic of the atrium














our most contemporary venue, the atrium, is neoclassical in style.  located in historic norcross, georgia, this unique space is a modern version of an ancient greek temple surrounded by a fragrant secret garden. beyond a vine-covered iron gate, the lush garden blooms year-round. in spring, full-grown lilac azaleas fill the air with their sweetness, followed by a shower of tiny white jasmine blooms spilling over the gazebo's filigree dome. summer brings seasonal rotating delights such as daylilies, gardenias, and fluffy blossoms of mophead hydrangeas, mixed in with repeat-blooming impatiens and hybrid roses. through the fall, the annuals continue to flourish until the first frost when they’re replaced with colorful winter pansies and bold white snapdragons.two courtyards add structure to the landscape. in the upper courtyard, a three-tiered fountain can be filled with floral sprays, creating an unexpected outdoor centerpiece. stepping stones placed in a graceful curve lead to the lower courtyard designed for outdoor ceremonies. a greenery-laden arbor shelters a garden bench, providing a cozy nook perfect for intimate moments and photographs. at one end of the lower courtyard, a stunning italian stone gazebo topped with an iron filigree dome awaits the happy couple. opposite the gazebo, a bed of blooming annuals offers a splash of color year-round. inside, an intimate mezzanine level overlooking the ballroom provides a private retreat with overstuffed sofas and additional chairs and tables. here, the groom and his groomsmen can relax with a drink before the ceremony. a stunning bridal suite awaits the bride and her attendants, lavishly furnished with gorgeous dark chocolate and cream-colored decor, and three back-lit mirrors. downstairs, a large dance floor is the center of the spacious ballroom. against one wall, a sleek custom-built bar further defines this posh, urban venue. for mother nature’s unforeseen weather changes, the open floor plan can easily accommodate indoor ceremonies for up to 150 guests, all while enjoying the beauty of the garden through two-story windows.  for the couple who envisions exchanging their vows amid an enchanting courtyard, and dancing the night away in a modern, sophisticated ballroom, look no further than the atrium!
