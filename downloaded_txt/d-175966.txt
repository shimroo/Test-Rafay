silo and milo 2025.0 are here!



        	news & announcements / 			november 22nd, 2024 
			        





silo and milo 2025.0 are here!

with this update, we’ve brought modifiers into milo! you can now see modifiers in milo simply by saving the file in .sib file from silo, so you no longer need to bake modifiers to render them.

we’ve also added a user-requested new uv generation type to silo: viewport projection. you can project uvs from any of the orthographic or perspective viewports, applied either to selected faces or a whole object.

finally, we spent time for this release focusing specifically on bug fixes and stability improvements based on user feedback, listed below. happy modeling!

pixelmash 2025.0 is live and ready for you to download!



        	news & announcements / 			november 20th, 2024 
			        





the just-released pixelmash 2025.0 introduces an enhanced copy/paste workflow that allows working across multiple apps seamlessly, plus bug fixes and ui improvements!

the previous release of pixelmash introduced our new area select tools, and our copy/paste improvements in this release build and expand on that. you can now easily copy and paste pixel selections rather than just whole layers (including copying pixels as rendered from vector layers), and you can also now copy and paste to and from the system clipboard to seamlessly work across different graphics applications.

other improvements in this release include bug fixes and ui improvements, including a new grid alpha setting in the view menu (under grid appearance). gi...

silo 2024.3 released: new boolean, path extrusion, and chain replicate modifiers, and more!



        	news & announcements / 			september 24th, 2024 
			        





we’re very excited to present silo 2024.3!

for this release we’ve added several new modifiers which use external target shapes, allowing for powerful new non-destructive workflows by letting you modify both the source and target shapes at any time. the boolean modifier lets you easily combine and subtract complex shapes, ideal for architectural models and much more. the chain replicate modifier uses the relationship between a source and target shape to create a repeating pattern, perfect for stairs or chains. the path extrusion modifier will extrude the source shape along the target path, perfect for flowing, organic shapes.

we’ve also added several workflow improvements and feature requests from the community, suggested b...
