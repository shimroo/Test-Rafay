about the cover

this confocal image of an embryonic mouse neocortex highlights immature and mature neurons (expressing rbfox3 in red), radial glia (expressing ptbp1 in green), and intermediate progenitors (expressing eomes in grey). xiangbin ruan and colleagues profiled rbfox gene expression patterns in the developing neocortex. they identified rbfox3 as a key neuronal marker that is expressed as early as the intermediate progenitor stage and regulates alternative splicing, which is important for brain development. see the article by ruan et al. for more information on how rbfox proteins regulate neuronal differentiation by antagonizing ptbp1 and coordinating isoform switching of transcription regulators during cortical development. cover image: xiangbin ruan.
