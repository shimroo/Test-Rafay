the dominion is a monthly paper published by an incipient network of independent journalists in canada. it aims to provide accurate, critical coverage that is accountable to its readers and the subjects it tackles. taking its name from canada's official status as both a colony and a colonial force, the dominion examines politics, culture and daily life with a view to understanding the exercise of power.
