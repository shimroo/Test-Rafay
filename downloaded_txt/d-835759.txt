message send mail all your fresh sprouts easily, under your control and faster than with a conventional seed sprouter, even in your absenceusefeaturestestimonials received on sprouters and sprouted seeds overlap on certain points:- difficulty to change the eating habits- lack of time or rigor to manage a sprouter on a regular basis- a priori incompatible personal organization (absences during the week, travels, etc.)- particular difficulties in germinating certain organic sensitive seeds (sunflower, buckwheat, brocoli etc.)- problems of too high temperature (in summer for example)- presence of midges, moulds... leading to the abandonment of sprouted seeds.the easygreen solves all these problems in no time! with a minimum of attention, you get maximum results. the operating principle is detailed below, for fresh and delicious sprouts every day on your plate.some advantages of the easygreen light sprouter: light, fully removable, fully dishwasher-safe or manually washable, economical and more efficient mister, direct access to the seeds in a few days.caution : the manual is not delivered with the sprouter, you can find:> download the set up guide here <                > the full user's guide here <                  🌱 operating principlethe easygreen sprouter maintains the humidity within the growth chamber: misting and regular aeration of the seeds guarantee unequaled freshness compared to a manual sprouter. no other sprouter ensures the aeration of the seeds and the evacuation of the heat linked to the phenomenon of growth.the programming is carried out using a mechanical timer which ensures between 5 to 8 daily misting cycles, lasting 15 to 20 minutes. in total, this represents a daily water consumption of between 2 and 3 liters, much lower than the quantities of water used to manually rinse the same quantity of seeds. the consumption of the device in operation (2 to 3 hours per 24 hours) is 18 watts.🌱 daily usewhat is left to do:- to monitor the water level in the tank, knowing that if you forget the mist generator will continue to operate without damage, it will then only provide ventilation.- to consume the seeds that have germinated and replace them with dry seeds.- to clean your easygreen once a week using a cloth, and 2 or 3 times a year for more thorough cleaning. note that the easygreen has an automatic cleaning cycle that can be implemented with white vinegar. see the full manual for more information.🌱 advantages of the easygreen- no more seed soaking, no more watering, monitoring is reduced to a minimum.- it is possible to grow on a daily basis certain delicate seeds that are difficult to succeed in a manual sprouter: unhulled sunflower, unhulled buckwheat, brocoli sprouts etc.- the easygreen continues to operate it's gentle misting during for optimum oxygenation your absences, holidays, trips: there is no longer any interruption in the production of your favourite sprouts.- this device has been designed to easily start a daily production of sprouted seeds, just replace the seeds consumed and put the tray back in place.- all the seeds benefit from perfectly clean and pure water, which is not the case with other automatic sprouters "recycling" the water and the enzyme inhibitors rejected by the seeds.- reasonable water consumption: 2 to 3 liters per day by choosing 8 daily cycles.- the easygreen has undergone many improvements since its creation, making it very efficient and economical to use.biovie has been importing it for a long time and has serious experience in advice and after-sales service issues. biovie is now the international manufacturer of the easygreen.🌱 own your easygreeneasygreen has been sold for 20 years in 32 countries around the world, including a scientific base located in antarctica. it is probably the best existing automatic sprouter in the world.by buying the easygreen you make an important gesture to improve the quality of your daily diet, you will consume food produced in your own kitchen, of unequaled freshness and vitality.for daily consumers, this is a big saving too! little sprouting trays in organics shops cost between 2,50€ and 5€, it can go very high very easily.  by buying and growing your own seeds, you can save up to 10 times what you'd buy at the supermarket.🌱 comparison easygreen vs other automatic sproutersother more economical sprouters exist on the french and european market. the easygreen differs from them on 5 essential points which determine the success of your sprouted seeds. if you are considering buying another system, find out about these points:  1) the easygreen does not use a fragile pump operating under pressure but a mister which sucks up the water by a natural spiral movement, thus improving the subtle quality of the water.the motor (18 watts) of the mist generator is placed well above the tank and therefore does not heat the water contained in it by contact. in addition, the principle of misting lowers the temperature of the water if it is high, which allows the seeds to be refreshed. the warmer or hotter the irrigation water, the more the development of mold or rot is favored.  2) the easygreen uses fresh water with each watering and not recycled water. seeds release enzyme inhibitors upon germination and it is essential that these unwanted substances can be flushed out and not recirculated.  3) sprouts are aired 6-8 times a day. the ventilation of the seeds is a fundamental point, it allows them to breathe in the best conditions and to evacuate the heat released by the germination process. lack of ventilation promotes the appearance of mold.  4) the easygreen has an automatic enclosure cleaning system  5) the roots of the sprouts stay confined in the easy-to-clean removable trays, and do not sneak into unexpected places.biovie is a global manufacturer of easygreendevice guaranteed for 2 yearsdimensions: 56 x 43 x 18 cmweight: 5,9 kg220v/50hzcontents of the

connectorthe main features of the easygreen in 9 points1. optimum ventilation: the seeds produce heat during germination. they need to be ventilated and refreshed to avoid the development of mold or bacteria. easygreen uses a patented technology which allows the application of fresh air and water droplets on the surface of seeds, thus ensuring their ventilation and watering. in reality, the seeds require little water but large quantities of air. the traditional sprouters bring a lot of water, but do not enable a regular renewal of the air in the growth enclosure.2. optimum growth: the growth inhibitors present in the seeds are substances of natural defense against diseases and insects. these inhibitors are released into the water when the seeds are watered. if you re-use this water, you re-water your seeds with inhibitors. easygreen uses a water that is clean, energized and fresh. it is important to have in mind that your sprouted seeds contain 80% water. in this respect, it is important to use a water of quality. any rinse water used by the easygreen is permanently drained out of the sprouter and does not serve anymore.3. precise adjustments: to control the humidity is essential for the strength of your sprouted seeds. easygreen uses a timer of 96 positions, which enables the user to adjust with subtlety its sprouter according to the local climate.4. nutritive solution: the easygreen tank enables people who wish, to add organic nutritional solutions, such as kelp algae liquid for example, at the end of growth of the wheatgrass, when the root web of the seeds is sufficiently developed. you can choose to grow your wheatgrass with or without support.5. easy cleaning: the tank may also periodically receives solutions like crystal vinegar or hydrogen peroxide for a complete, automatically made cleaning and disinfection.6. simplicity: the conventional sprouters often require a pre-soaking of the seeds. with the easygreen, just drop your dried seeds on the trays, the sprouter takes care of everything: soaking, rinsing, misting, oxygenating, ventilation and rinse water draining are made in a simple and automatic manner.7. water subtlety: easygreen uses a technology of water dynamization and oxygenation by conducting necessary water samples by a venturi effect. the water rises in a funnel-shaped, hyperbolic chimney by forming a vortex. beyond the qualitative aspect, this process, combined with the fineness of the mist (droplets of 6 microns) ensure a faster germination of 15% to 40% compared to the conventional methods. 8. earth: the trays can receive a substrate if you wish, for your wheat grass or sunflower crops for example.9. easygreen is versatile and enables you to germinate seeds, young sprouts, or barley or wheat grass. with regard to the principle of water dynamization by vortex (whirlpool) used by the easygreen, you can watch this video "the water masters" (2/2), broadcasted on arte tv channel, which refers to the work of the scientist victor schauberger: the water masters:http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7pi4a_les-maitres-de-l-eau-2_tech what they say about it            (4,8/5) out of 38 total ratings read
