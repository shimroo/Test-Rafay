tips from the blooms bros



it’s late fall in the wabash valley! here are some tips from our team to keep your lawn and landscape looking it’s best as we prepare for colder weather.attack! kill weeds in the lawn bonide weed beater ultra works all the way down to 40 degrees unlike most other weed killerscleanup! do a fall cleanup in landscape beds including pruning back perennials to allow fresh new growth next spring. also apply a fall lawn food to build up the lawn before winter.mow! on final mowing of the season lower the mower to two inches this helps prevent snow mold disease protect! clean gutters after leaves fall to prevent ice dams from forming and disconnect and drain hoses. don’t forget to check for leaks!
