             kevin durant wants to be an nba team owner and will look around at any opportunity after he retires. if he can help bring a team back to seattle, he'd be all for that. 

 "it's just the fact that i played there and i get so much love there," durant said. "more than any city in the league probably. look, it would be a great story. but it would be a lot of hard work, it won't be easy because it's seattle. after the press release and the first couple of weeks it's straight to work. i know people want to tie me into seattle a lot, and i love being part of that, but i'm not just waiting for that opportunity. any opportunity that comes around where i could become [part of] an ownership group or a front office or anywhere i could just help the team as of right now in my life i would go for it, but who knows what will happen at the end of my career?"
