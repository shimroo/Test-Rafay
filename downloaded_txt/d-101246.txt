we have used svh over 18 years now as our property manager and we can sleep well knowing that our property is being well maintained.   when we went through a damaging storm last winter, mark and his team were quick to get a repair crew in to assess the damage and helped us work through the insurance claim as well as the necessary repairs to get our vacation rental looking good and usable again!  we would highly recommend using mark and his team at svh as your vacation rental property manager.
