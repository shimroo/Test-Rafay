regen magazine reviews the darkness forever



jan 31, 2025




thanks to regen magazine, ilker yücel, and linda r. bess (not2bmesdw) for reviewing the darkness foreveranyone who hears collide can’t help but be drawn in. karin’s sultry alternative pop vocals contrast with statik’s melodic, scratchy noise, further bending the genre delineation that streaming services require artists to select when distributing their music. the darkness forever doesn’t have to rely upon karin to carry the weight of being a sassy sort of siouxsie sioux meets gwen stafani songstress; with the release of instrumental versions of these cover tunes on a separate album, statik’s industrially bent guitars, arpeggiated chords, and stomping beats saunter and slither from track to track, never ceasing to scratch an itch that many listeners probably didn’t realize they had. echoing daylight piano melodies defy the distant apparition of a reverberating pulse when cranked to full volume. dare i say, these instrumentals would fare well in the dark, alternative karaoke bar of your living room.the mood of the album opens with an orchestral, trancelike march to portishead’s “wandering star,” before an unapologetic version of “heart-shaped box” drones on pretty compositionally true to nirvana’s original. the unique choice of slouchy-sounding tom toms stood out in “criminal,” maybe sounding too close to the sound of a worn out djembe drum. the stupefaction award of cover song choices on this album would go to “rocketman.” many artists have covered the beloved elton john song over the years – even pnau’s mashup version “cold heart” made a poppy splash in 2021. this writer won’t speak for anyone else, but any version of that song conjures a forlorn sense of permanent grief every time i hear it.as the duo had done with 2009’s these eyes before, collide manages to create a fuller experience of the originals from one recognizable track to the next. whether any of the tunes on the darkness forever hit a personal note for either karin or statik, i confess that i find these cover versions refreshing in a gargle-with-nails kind of way, especially as both muse and peter gabriel are two of my favorite artists.

santa sangre reviews the darkness forever



dec 13, 2024




we’re not going to lie, it’s been tougher than every getting press to cover our latest release, so we’re happy to have a new review to post.  peter marks reviews the darkness forever on the website santa sangre.“channeled layers which appear on these tracks wickedly end slipping back into an invisible reality; those enchanted themes just do not end from statik and karin, they’re connection only grows stronger never given up something i wish others would hold onto as well: imagination. staying on such a path is not an easy option, thank you so much for refusing to give up!”read the full review here

new heela lyric video



oct 4, 2024




hello fellow cat lovers & believers in women’s rights,we have had a lot of unforeseen issues getting our new song f**k you meow out there in the world!! at every single turn it has been difficult; we have been censored, shadow banned, age restricted, the music has been removed & on and on. to be honest—it has been exhausting. we believe in the song and the power of music and art—so we are still doing what we can to get it out there.in an effort to keep the song going without restrictions-- we made a censored version. it seems sometimes you can swear and it’s okay? and sometimes not? (honestly we don’t know anymore). so to go with it—we have a brand new lyric video. we hope you enjoy!! absolutely any help is always appreciated ; engage with out content, tell some friends, share a post. send your cat photos!!in other news--it's bandcamp friday!!!! we would like to thank bandcamp for being one of the very few platforms out there that actually does not totally rip off the artists and gives them this day where all funds go directly to the artists. if you are not aware--releasing music has become increasingly difficult for so many reasons--so anything in support of an artist that you love is extremely important if you want those artists to survive.f**k you meow a new song collaboration between @collidemusic & @androidlust to stand up for women's rights.

"we just wanted to make the kind of music that we wanted to hear."once upon a time, somewhere around 1992, two people met at an industrial dance club. one was very thirsty, so they asked the other to get them some water. after the liquid reached the glass, the two began a conversation, which became a friendship, and then formed a creative union.the creative union became what is known as collide. the primary core of the los angeles based duo is statik and karin. statik is responsible for the sound orchestrations and overall production. karin takes care of the vocals and lyrics.the essence of collide is the coming together of two opposing entities to form a symbiotic whole ... combining the female and masculine energies, the cognitive and the subliminal, the strength and the mystery.to date, the duo have released eleven full length cds and a dvd -- beneath the skin, distort, chasing the ghost, some kind of strange, vortex, live at the el rey, like the hunted, ultrashiver (with dean garcia of curve, two headed monster, these eyes before, counting to zero, and bent and broken.  in 2020 they re-released their albums chasing the ghost, and some kind of strange as 2 disc blu-ray/cd special editions. "our eternal thanks to those who seek out and expose new music."  karin - vocals, wordsstatik - noise
