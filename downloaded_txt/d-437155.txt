in the spring of 1995, the golf club at yankee trace unveiled 18 holes of championship golf to rave reviews. the facility quickly earned 4 ½ stars by the prestigious golf digest ranking team. in 2002, original designer gene bates completed the masterpiece by gently meandering 9 additional holes through warm and friendly centerville, located in the southern tip of the gem city. the property has been crowned “the best golf course” in dayton for 20 consecutive years by the dayton daily news and is now recognized as a top 50 municipal golf course in the country and a top 5 public course in ohio.
