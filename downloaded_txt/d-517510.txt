kent rasmussen wineryour history





kent rasmussen winery was started in 1986 by kent and his wife celia ramsay. they have been famous for their stellar pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc under the kent rasmussen winery label, but also for the many interesting varietal wines they made under the ramsay label. kent and celia have retired this year (2023)! both are proud of their nearly 40 years of making wine. the ramsay label lives on via 689 cellars. visit ramsaywines.com for more details!
