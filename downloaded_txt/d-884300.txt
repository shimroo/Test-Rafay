looking backward to move forward





from 2005 to 2018, i wrote a blog called mom-not otherwise
specified. the blog title was a play on my son's then-diagnosis, which was
pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified, or pdd-nos, an autism
spectrum diagnosis that is no longer used.
the blog was about parenting and autism and my son, who was
five when i started writing. it was popular, and a few posts went viral, but
the older my son got, the less comfortable i felt writing about him. as time
passed and my thinking and perspective evolved, i worried that there might be
information in some older posts that would make me cringe now and, worse, might
lead parents of newly diagnosed children down some unhelpful rabbit holes.
in spring 2020, in the middle of the covid-19 pandemic, when
everything felt overwhelming and threatening, i decided to hide the blog from
the public while i figured out what to do.
four years later, i have a plan. bud is now 25 years old. he
has a lot going on, and so do i. i think it might be helpful for me to
systematically revisit the old posts and reflect on what has and hasn’t changed
in my thinking. right now, all of the original posts are in draft status. i’m going to start at the beginning, in february 2005, and revisit
each one. i will repost some of them. i’ll add commentary from today where it
feels appropriate. and i’ll keep some of the old posts hidden.
a caveat: when i started the blog back in 2005, the tagline
was “on raising a child on the autism spectrum, progressive politics, pop
culture, and coffee addiction.” the internet was a kinder place back then, so it’s
unlikely i’ll be reposting anything overtly political. and if i make any “pop culture” references, they will likely be distinctly gen x.i am, however, still addicted to coffee.the view from november 2024:yeah, so, that "it's unlikely i'll be posting anything overtly political" thing? i wrote that when i thought kamala was going to win. the gloves are off now. if he tries to get to any of us, he's going to have to go through all of us.

changing traditions





it seems that the christmas eve plan has been on bud's mind. i awoke yesterday morning at 6:00 a.m. with bud's face in mine."you don't sing 'happy birthday to you...'" he lilted as soon as i opened one eye. "you sing 'hap-py-birth-day-boy-je-sus!" he sang this out in the conga beat that oobi uses to celebrate birthdays so that his creator doesn't have to pay the high royalty fees associated with the more traditional melody.latin rhythms to honor the sixth anniversary of christ's birth. i can't wait to find out what comes next.the view from january 2025:just a note of clarification: in 2015, a federal judge ruled that the happy birthday song was in the public domain. sing away, oobi.

happy birthday, big boy jesus





bud hates babies. he has hated them since—well, really, since he was one. i think babies are too much like dogs for bud—they're unpredictable, they make loud noises, and they tend to divert the attention of the people whose attention bud wants.apparently in school today there must have been some mention of the upcoming celebration of the birth of baby jesus, because at dinner tonight bud announced, "i don't want birthday for baby jesus. just boy and girl."now, despite the fact that we are not overtly religious, we do try to connect jesus christ to bud's experience of christmas, and we continue a family tradition of having a birthday cake for baby jesus on christmas eve. so, we had an impromptu family meeting, and we've struck a compromise. this christmas we won't be observing the birth of christ at bud's house.we'll be celebrating christ's sixth birthday.

experience sharing





it seems declarative communication is catching on!like most kids on the spectrum, bud uses mostly imperative language—language used to make requests, ask questions, and state demands. i typically have to rely on other people—his teacher, the special ed team, nana—to fill me in on the specifics of his day. i knew that bud was eager to return to school (and to a predictable schedule) following an unsettling holiday weekend, but i was a little worried that he'd have a hard time settling in again. to my surprise, nana reported that drop-off on monday was a huge success. she typically hands bud off to his aide at the front door, and he and the aide walk together down the long hallway to his classroom. on monday, however, bud entered the building with gusto, said a quick goodbye to nana, threw back his shoulders, and strutted past his aide and toward the classroom. his aide raised her eyebrows and nana, then followed bud at a distance.on tuesday evening, i was toweling bud off after his bath and he seemed lost in thought. then his eyes sparkled, and he looked at me and said, "mama! i walk to kindergarten all by myself!"i almost fell over. he was proud, and he wanted to share his pride with me!"you did?" i gushed. "wow! what a big kid you are!""yeah!" he said. "i walk to the classroom all by myself! like this!" he threw his towel to the floor, lifted his chin, puffed up his chest, and then—all grinning teeth, pumping elbows and poking ribcage—he marched across the bathroom floor to steal a glance of his big-boy self in the full-length mirror.i could really get used to this experience-sharing thing.

i do declare





i posted yesterday about my efforts to give bud more processing time when i ask him questions. i neglected to mention, however, how hard i'm trying to ask him fewer questions to begin with.i've been working on integrating rdi into bud's life, and one of the goals in rdi is to shift the way we speak to children on the spectrum to use 80% declarative language and 20% imperative language. imperative language is the language that children on the spectrum tend to use most (99% of the time as opposed to 67% of the time for children with other types of developmental delays, according to one study.) imperative language is that which is used for instrumental purposes like making requests, asking questions, and stating demands. it is the language of a black-and-white world in which there is one correct response.declarative language, in contrast, does not have utilitarian functions; its goal is experience-sharing. declarative communication does not require a specific response; instead, its intention is to promote interaction and share thoughts, ideas, preferences, and emotions with another person. it is a form of communication that by its very nature says, "i am interested in you, and i hope that you are interested in me, too." and it does not come easily to children on the spectrum.as we work with bud and try to help him develop language, it is really declarative language that we're working toward. he knows how to ask for what he wants. he even knows how to say please and thank you. he will be able to "get by" in the world with that kind of language. but i want more than "getting by" for bud. i want to help him build a solid foundation from which to make greater leaps. i want to help him learn to ask, "how are you?", but more than that, i want to help him care how you are.and so, i try to role model declarative language for bud and give him small jumping-off points for experience-sharing conversation. instead of "bud, it's time for bed," or "are you tired, bud?" i try "you look a little sleepy," or "i'm feeling tired." instead of "what did you do in school?", i try "i love the picture you brought home in your backpack." instead of "bud, put on your shoes so we can go," i try "it's almost time to go; i wonder what we should do next." it sounds easy, but i find that 80% is a real challenge. imperatives roll off the tongue; declaratives take thoughtful intentionality.and that, i think, is the point.the view from january 2025:as it turns out, using declarative language is also effective when working with a person with pda. you can find more on that in this handout from pda north america and on speech language pathologist linda murphy's website.

silence is golden





yet more insight gleaned from the scerts seminar. during his presentation, barry prizant made frequent references to ros blackburn, a woman from england who has autism and often gives presentations at autism conferences. like temple grandin, blackburn is able to talk about autism in a way that gives neurotypicals real insight into life on the spectrum. one particular reference stood out for me.prizant said that he once asked blackburn to name the thing that other people did that was most frustrating to her. she answered that other people don't allow enough time for people with autism to answer questions. typically, she said, just as she is forming the answer the other person starts talking again. and not only that—they're not just repeating themselves, they are saying things differently.it struck an instant chord. i do it all the time. i hear other people do it all the time as well. we honestly think we're being helpful.we ask, "bud, what did you do in school today?"pause.we think, is he listening?we say, "hey, bud. was school fun today?""yeah."we think, good, he's listening. we repeat, "what did you do?"pause.we think, maybe he doesn't understand what i'm looking for.we ask, "what was your favorite part of school today?"pause.we think, he still doesn't get it; i'll be more clear.we say, "did you play with toys at school?""yeah."we think, here we go! we say, "what did you play with?"pause.and on and on it goes until we give up or have gotten enough yes/no responses to satisfy our need for the pretense of conversation.according to prizant, ros blackburn compares her experience of this sort of "conversation" to assembling a jigsaw puzzle. someone asks a question, and she begins to piece it together—what are they asking? what is the expected response? what do i think about this? how do i put that into words? the piecing takes her full concentration, so she is silent while she thinks. she is silent, in fact, for a long time; long enough that the other person decides they need to be "helpful". unfortunately, by rephrasing the question, it feels to blackburn as if the person steps in, grabs the puzzle she has almost completed, and hurls the pieces into the air. now she has to start over, this time trying to assemble the puzzle with a heightened level of frustration. (and we wonder why people with autism get dysregulated?)so i've been trying since the seminar to slow down my conversations with bud and to stop "prompting" his answers. the conversations go something like this:"bud, what was your favorite thing in school today?"pause.pause.pause.pause.pause."i play magic letter factory on the computer.""oh, that sounds fun. did any other kids play with you?"pause.pause.pause.pause.pause."sadie play me."pause.pause.pause.pause.pause."and margo, too."as the dalai lama says, "remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.

extreme dysregulation





it seems i attended the scerts seminar at just the right time.as most parents of children on the spectrum know, the holiday season can be a challenging time for kids with asd. bud is no exception. bud has been slowly winding up since halloween and hit full tilt earlier this week. it actually started as birthday obsession. bud's birthday is in september so it will be a long time before he celebrates another one, but he recently got a new caillou's birthday video and has been perseverating on having a birthday party. (specifically, he'd like a sesame street birthday with an elephant cake.) this week was nana's birthday, however, so there was a celebration, and some out-of-town family who hadn't seen bud since his birthday came bearing belated gifts for him, so my insistence that "it will be a long time before your birthday comes" stood in contrast to bud's real-life experience and only confused the issue for him.and that's not all. it was a two-day week at school, which included a charlie brown thanksgiving party. he spent a whole day with me at my office on wednesday. we have out-of-town guests staying at our house. his dad and i are home from work. we are eating meals at different times. we had our first significant snowfall. the tv has been playing football games instead of pbs kids. people are drinking and conversations are louder than usual. we cooked a turkey on the outside grill. bud's sleeping has been thrown off. i've been cooking and doing dishes and talking to other adults instead of focusing my time and attention on him. it has been an unpredictable, upside-down sort of week for bud and despite my efforts to talk him through each turn of events, the poor kid is simply on overload.so today we had a challenging thanksgiving at our house. and this is why i am very, very glad that i've just attended barry prizant's seminar. as bud went through his shrieking, throwing, banging, avoiding, refusing, protesting, ignoring, obsessing thanksgiving day, i was able to see his behavior for what it was: bud was not being aggressive or difficult. because of the wacky nature of the week, bud was experiencing extreme dysregulation.as prizant and the scerts model explain, when children are regulated, the are in an optimal state of arousal and are "available" for learning and engaging. when children are in extreme dysregulation (either because they have very low or very high arousal), they are no longer available for learning and engaging. trying to engage in a "teachable moment" with a child in extreme dysregulation is futile. the primary goal, instead, is to help the child achieve regulation.i kept the scerts philosophy in mind all day, trying in small ways to help bud adjust and regulate as he encountered obstacles. as we approached evening, however, bud passed the point of no return and all signs started flashing "meltdown ahead." i shuffled him quickly upstairs to the bathroom, away from the crowd and into his bedtime routine even though we were about an hour early. his dad joined us to try to provide extra support and comfort, but bud was having none of it."no! i don't want to go to bed! i don't want to brush my teeth! i want to play my toys!" he wailed.bud's dad approached him, speaking in a low soothing voice, and leaned in for a kiss. bud flailed wildly, belting his dad in the nose and sending his glasses flying across the room. his dad's face registered shock. bud's didn't show even a flash of acknowledgement that anything had happened. barry prizant's words flooded into my mind."most 'aggressive behavior' from children with asd is not really aggression; it's dysregulation.""but how do you know the difference?" someone in the audience asked. "i mean, obviously sometimes it's really aggression.""again, you have to look at the intention that's driving the behavior. ask yourself why the child is doing this. if he's doing it to hurt himself or someone else, it's aggression. if he's not, it's dysregulation."in a split second, i caught the glasses as they flew through the air and somehow (was it silently?) bud's dad and i agreed not to pursue a discussion with bud about the incident. bud's dad left the room quietly, and i continued helping bud through his nighttime routine, not rushing it, making it as predictable and normal as possible. we got to his bedroom, turned down the lights, started reading a book, and before i finished page 3, bud was sound asleep.one day down; 31 shopping days to practice the art of regulation ahead.the view from january 1, 2025:i've been debating whether or not to re-post this one because it provides a glimpse into a private moment in bud's childhood. today is new year's day, though, and as we come out of what seemed like an extraordinarily long holiday season, i recognize so much of what i wrote here almost twenty years ago still at play today. of course, now i am able to recognize not only how dysregulating the holidays can be for bud, but also how dysregulating they can be for me, and how each of our attempts to regulate can complicate the attempts of the other.i recognize also that what i called "extreme dysregulation" back then was a pda response: bud's nervous system responding to the demands of the holiday season—even the positive ones—as threats to his safety.we've come a long way in twenty years, though, and we have carved out ways to celebrate that trigger fewer threat responses. our holidays are slower paced and involve fewer people. our plans are always fluid, and we have alternatives ready if they're needed. we do only what we can and only what we enjoy, and we stop when we need to. we take breaks. we take naps. we eat in shifts. we still have difficult moments, but we avoid extreme dysregulation.the pda society had a great series on their facebook page leading up to the holidays, outlining twelve ways to make the holidays more pda-friendly. if this year was a struggle, you might consider bookmarking them for next year.also, one point of clarification on something that might be confusing as you read old posts and new updates. in 2005, when i wrote the original post, i was married to bud's dad. we split up in 2007 and he moved away, maintaining a relationship with bud by phone until his death in 2018. since 2014, i have been coparenting with my husband, brian, bud's stepfather and co-guardian. our family also includes brian's 13-year-old son/my stepson and two golden retrievers. for obvious reasons, none of them will appear in the original blog posts for many years to come.

happy thanksgiving





i spent yesterday writing a long post about bud's amazing development, and yet when i see it in action it still takes me by surprise.today was a school holiday, so i brought bud to the office with me. he loves coming to my office but usually only accompanies me after hours when no one else is around. today he was surprised to find a small number of coworkers there when we arrived. he was characteristically shy at first, avoiding their eyes and hiding behind my back as they said hello to him, but as the day wore on, he grew increasingly more comfortable.a safety officer whom bud had never met stopped by on rounds. "hey there, big guy!" he boomed."hi," said bud."how ya doin'?""i'm good. how are you?"wow.later in the day, another coworker whom bud doesn't know well stopped by to say she was leaving for the day. bud was at the computer in the room next door to me, and i heard her say as she walked down the hallway, "goodbye, bud! have a nice holiday tomorrow!"there were a few silent beats, then i heard bud's voice ring out down the hallway after her, "bye! happy thanksgiving!"happy thanksgiving, indeed.

resounding echoes





in a recent post, i discussed my (thankfully short-lived) concern that bud's classroom was adopting a square peg/round hole, just do your best to "pass," one-size-fits-all sort of philosophy. i based this supposition on a single element: a piece of representational artwork that bud brought home and that i knew could not possibly be his because bud does not do representational art.since the moment i clicked the "publish post" button, bud has produced nothing but...you guessed it, representational art. and he's not just producing it; he has developed a passion for it. on a nightly basis, he pulls out his markers and a stack of paper and gets working.but i'm noticing an interesting phenomenon. though he's producing representational art, he is not creating it from his imagination. so far, his artwork has been limited to what he has seen in videos: he draws the clues he's seen joe and steve draw on blue's clues; he draws the scenes he's seen oobi draw on noggin. in the same way that so much of his speech is derived from videos, he is scripting his drawings. i've begun thinking of it as visual echolalia.framing bud's drawing as echolalia also made me look at another phenomenon in a different way. in his blog, patrick fitzgerald searches for an explanation for his son dan's recent habit of opening books in synchrony with the opening of the book at the start of his disney movies. patrick describes dan's behavior this way: "he has gone around the house, gathering all the large books he can find. he then lays them out carefully around the room. as the movie starts and the on-screen book opens, he goes along his line of real books, opening them. at the end of the movie, as the on-screen book closes, he reverses the process." i recognized the behavior immediately, because it's similar to what bud does. he doesn't watch disney movies, but he does watch clifford the big red dog, and every episode has a "speckle story" that emily elizabeth reads to clifford. at the end of the speckle story, the pages flutter and the book closes. bud delights in recreating this grand finale again and again and again. it seems to be some sort of behavioral echolalia.at the scerts seminar i attended, barry prizant discussed the phenomenon of echolalia. too often, he said, people view echolalia as a problem because it is such unconventional speech and, as a result, they respond to it with statements like, "now stop all that silly talk." instead, we should look beyond the behavior itself and try to identify the function that the echolalia is playing for the child. the most important question when dealing with echolalia or most other "autistic" behaviors—the question that will help us remediate the problem instead of address the symptom—is "why?"when i look at the evolution of bud's echolalic speech, i see phenomenal developmental progress. bud's echolalia seemed to start as strings of words that didn't have any particular meaning to him, but that he used as a means of self-regulation. as bud developed, his echolalia became more complex, and he began to use it in meaningful ways. if we were playing ball, bud would pull out a line from a script that had something to do with playing ball and seemed somewhat relevant to the context. later, he advanced to the point where he could use mitigated echolalia, substituting specific references from the script with salient details from the real-life situations to approximate conversational meaning. (he still does this masterfully.) only then was he able to step out and take risks with creative language. prizant frames this pattern of development, which is typical of many children with asd, as movement from a gestalt mode of language acquisition (in which phrases and multiword utterances are the basic units of language) to an analytic mode (in which single words are the basic units of language). this sort of development, says prizant, is a very positive prognostic indicator for the child's continued language development.so what role is bud's echolalic language playing now? i believe that bud has used echolalia to create opportunities for what rdi's steve gutstein calls "productive uncertainty," and what i've called chaos and creation, to test the waters of communication to see if he's able to swim. he started using scripts because that was the form of language in which he had the most confidence. bolstered by his success, he was able to take a bigger risk and start substituting words. that risk had a huge pay-off and allowed him to have real back-and-forth communication for the first time. once he became comfortable and "safe" with that level of communication, he was finally ready to swim without his floaties and start to construct his own creative language.similarly, when i look at most of bud's "echolalic" behavior—recreating scenes from favorite videos—i see that it has been an important step in the development of his capacity for pretend play. i think that in many ways it started as a way to connect. because his real-life peers are unpredictable, socializing with them has been a struggle for bud. but the characters in his movies? they are his perfect playmates—predictable, consistent, and always at the ready. recreating scenes from their lives gives bud an opportunity to be a part of their lives. and, as with his language development, it has given bud the chance to take the risks and achieve the success that makes the idea of risk less scary and more appealing.my hunch is that, bolstered by his achievement in language and play, bud is using a similar process with his artwork. early on, bud was loathe to pick up a crayon, marker, or paintbrush. when his first tentative stray marks of paper earned praise, he got bolder and more intentional with his strokes and blobs. when those creations met with rave reviews he took the risk toward representational art but is starting with pictures that he knows have a "right answer." my hope, and my hunch, is that before long he will move into creating pictures from his mind.as barry prizant said, our attribution of a behavior—our perspective on the "why?"—frames our response to it. it's fascinating that when considered from a different angle, echolalia transforms itself from an annoying, frustrating example of disability into a valuable developmental process. prizant uses a quote from wayne dyer that i think sums it up nicely:"when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change."and change and change and change.

about me





mary


from 2005 to 2018, i wrote this blog, the title of which was a play on my son's then-diagnosis, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified, or pdd-nos, an autism spectrum diagnosis that is no longer used.

i pulled the blog out of the public domain in 2020, fearing that some of its content might be invasive to my now-adult son or filled with dated information that would be unhelpful to new readers. 

in october 2024, i started dusting it off and reposting some original posts with my updated perspective.
