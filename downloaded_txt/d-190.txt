the north american menopause society is now the menopause society
the evolution of women’s healthcare – how it is delivered and how women learn about their options—spurred us to strengthen the way we empower healthcare professionals to better serve their patients.
with that evolution comes a new name: the menopause society.
as a name, the menopause society more accurately reflects and highlights the inclusivity of our organization—inclusiveness in provider types and inclusiveness of providers—and the fact that we’ve never limited our membership to those from north america.
while our name has changed, our mission has only been strengthened. the menopause society will continue to be the definitive, independent, and evidence-based resource for healthcare professionals, researchers, the media, and the public, and we will continue to lead the conversation about improving women’s health and healthcare experiences during the menopause transition and beyond.
our website incorporates gender-specific language as commonly used in the published literature; we recognize that some persons may identify differently than with the gender and pronouns included.
