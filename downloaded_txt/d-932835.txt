	 oh no new baby on the way!
    


well it is the day after christmas and it was a good holiday for me.  i got this really ugly looking possum that i like to chew up and squeak.  but just as i was enjoying my day at "grandmothers" scarfing up food dropped on the floor i heard someone say baby is comming in 2 days.  eek!  i sure hope mommy has enough love for me too.  i hope the crying does not drive me crazier than i already am.  i guess i will learn to like my sissy alot more. stay tuned for the details....
