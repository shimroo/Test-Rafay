allah*
invites to the abode of peace




"and allah summons to the abode of peace, and leads whom he wills to the
straight path" (the qurán 10:25)
      
invoke your lord with humility and in secret. he likes not
the aggressors. and do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set
in order, and invoke him with fear and hope; surely, allah's mercy is
(ever) near unto the good-doers. (the qurán 7:55)





'terrorism' (wtc attack type). 'oppression'
          (israeli type). 'unjustified aggression' (american hegemony type).
      some by the misguided, some by the arrogant, but 'all' of these are just
      various kinds of 'mischief-making' which is strictly hated by god. those who
    continue to do such excesses in god's world, whether in the name of religion
          or without it, unless they repent sincerely and answer the
    just call of god, face a severe punishment from the almighty on the final
      day of reckoning when not a single soul will be dealt unjustly.
      "...we ordained for the children of
      israel that if anyone slew a person unless it be for murder or for
      spreading mischief in the land it would be as if he slew the whole people.
      then although there came to them our apostles with clear signs yet even
      after that many of them continued to commit excesses in the land."
      (the qur'an 5:32)
      


the war on
    iraq: the present attitude of
          the rulers of the united states of america reflects sheer contempt for
          the idea of democracy - 'the rule of the people'. while the majority
          world opinion including that of american public is strongly strongly
          against any war on iraq, president bush hardly seems to consider the
          public important.

 islam: reminding of god's original message





meaning of islam...


the literal meaning of the arabic word islam is
        'surrender to god'. 

more in the section the fundamentals of islam



 the message... 


islam calls all humanity to surrender to the will
        of god, the only true god of all humanity, because our lives, all our
        possessions and all that exists in the universe are nothing but favors
        and blessings from this one god.

the only purpose of our existence is to gain the
        approval of our creator, that is, to do that which pleases god and
        refrain from that which is abhorred by god. this life is thus a test of
        our surrender.

all
        human-beings will be held accountable for the deeds they commit in this
        world and will be rewarded justly for their deed.

this is the same message which was conveyed by all the
        prophets of god, and the message of islam is a reminder of the same
        message. 

more details in the section in explore islam



about god... 


the arabic word for god is allah
        and means 'the god'. islam emphasizes this simple pure notion of one
        god and refutes the concepts of trinity or plurality for godhead as
        false lacking any scriptural or scientific evidence. islamic monotheism
        (tawhid) is the most important concept to be understood as everything
        else relating to social, economic, political or moral/spiritual
        principles of islam are derived from it. 

more in our page on who is allah
        ?

islam demands that belief in god be based upon reason
        and contemplation and not on blind faith.

more in the the section curious minds



about the prophets... 


islam is the same religion which was revealed by
        god almighty to all the messengers and prophets of god (peace be upon
        them all) and does not claim to be a new separate religion. islam
        is the completion of god's guidance to humanity. 

in contrast to the other prophets of god who were chosen
        by god for a particular nation or tribe, muhammad (peace be upon him)
        was the last messenger chosen by the god for all humanity.

more in the section who is muhammad
        (pbuh)?



about the scriptures... 


god sent his guidance to men by inspiring men from
        amongst mankind known as prophets and to whom god revealed scriptures.

the qurán is the final scripture revealed by god to muhammad and it confirms the
        torah (taurat-scripture revealed to moses), the bible (injeel-scripture revealed to
        jesus) and the psalms (scripture revealed to david). peace be upon all
        the prophets of god.

more in the section what is the qur'aan ?



an invitation... 


god invites all humanity to embrace his last and final
        call to his chosen path islam. when the qurán was revealed, christians
        and jews were the people following the scriptures revealed to previous
        prophets and so they were called to embrace god's final
        revelation to his prophet muhammad (peace be upon him). prophet muhammad had
        started his prophetic mission by inviting the polytheists of makkah to
        the worship of one god before he had to migrate to medina.

islam however categorically states that there is no
        compulsion in religion (holy quran 2:256) and everyone is given
        freedom by god whether to accept his final call or not. the messenger's
        duty is only to convey the truth (holy quran 5:99).
