 this free
      booklet and e-tract is a challenge to the church. the bible gives
      us the example of christians working together in the gospel. do
      you actively spread the gospel in your church? well what if---we
      lived out the gospel--instead of just teaching it to ourselves?
      what if we visited the sick and homeless and fed the poor--instead
      of building a building which we use only for our own purpose? what
      if ministry was a gift given to every one of us---a function--an
      anointing--that we all worked in unity together? what if we simply
      loved god, loved one another, and loved our neighbor--in
      equity--as true brothers and sisters in christ?

 do you
      know anything about the history of the church? do you know how the
      church in the bible operated, and how things were changed, many
      years ago? this story is set in the future, but it is all about
      the past, and will make you question your ideas about what the
      church is, today.
 who we are.......


...."and so jesus gave us a new norm of
        greatness. if you want to be importantwonderful. if you want to
        be recognizedwonderful. if you want to be greatwonderful. but
        recognize that he who is greatest among you shall be your
        servant. (amen) that's a new definition of
        greatness.....by giving that definition of greatness, it means
        that everybody can be great, (everybody) because
        everybody can serve. (amen) you don't have to have a
        college degree to serve. (all right) you don't have to
        make your subject and your verb agree to serve. you don't have
        to know about plato and aristotle to serve. you don't have to
        know einstein's theory of relativity to serve. you don't have to
        know the second theory of thermodynamics in physics to serve. (amen)
        you only need a heart full of grace, (yes, sir, amen) a
        soul generated by love. (yes) and you can be that
        servant...." (dr. martin luther king, feb. 4, 1968)
