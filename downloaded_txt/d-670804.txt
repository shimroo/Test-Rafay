do your research 
when it comes to your home’s comfort, you want to make sure you’re working with a reputable contractor. furnace systems are a big investment, and you want to be sure that your system is installed or repaired properly. here are a few tips on how to research a furnace contractor before you make a decision: 
first, check out the company’s website. a professional company will have a well-designed website that includes information about its services and qualifications. you should also be able to find customer testimonials or reviews on the website. 
next, see if the company is accredited by any professional organizations, such as the better business bureau. this shows that the company commits to providing quality service. 
finally, give the company a call and ask questions about their services. a good contractor will be happy to answer any of your questions and provide you with a quote for their services.

make sure they’re licensed and insured 
as a homeowner, it’s important to make sure that any contractors you hire are both licensed and insured. a licensed contractor has met the requirements set by your state or local government and is allowed to perform work in your area.  
an insured contractor carries liability insurance, which will cover damages if they accidentally cause damage to your property. when hiring a furnace contractor, always ask to see their license and insurance information. this will give you peace of mind knowing that you’re working with a professional who is qualified to do the job and who will be held accountable if something goes wrong. 
ask for referrals from your family and friends 
when it comes time to hire a furnace contractor, one of the best places to start is by asking for referrals from your family and friends who have hired one in the past. this is a great way to get first-hand information about the quality of work and customer service you can expect from a potential contractor.  
furthermore, by speaking with people you know and trust, you can get a better sense of which contractors are reputable and which ones you should avoid. when getting referrals, be sure to ask about the specific services that were provided, as well as the overall cost of the project. with this information in hand, you’ll be in a much better position to find the right furnace contractor for your needs.

   throwing you smartphone is not the endpoint of these things. because many people in the market know about repairs, they can just snap them up for low prices, fix them cheaply, and then sell them for big profits which fuel the lively trade in broken smartphones.

    check your coverage first

    fix it yourself

    the best place to go is youtube or fixit wherein you will find an excellent set of step by step tutorials with instructions as well as the tools that you will need.  
    getting tools and parts 
    you need to secure the proper tools before you start. strange fixings are sometimes done by manufacturers to deliberately discourage self-repair. you will end up adding damage to your phone if you will not use the proper tools. ensure that you clean your workplace before starting the repair. 
    a word of warning 
    smartphones components can be tough to get because the inside of most smartphones is confusing and messy. you will feel that you will break parts if you press harder. some smartphones are also much easier to disassemble compared to others.  
    hire someone or use service
