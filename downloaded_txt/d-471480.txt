indigenous people have cared for this land for centuries. the lands that the upper valley land trust owns, conserves, and works on, and the land on which we all live, are the traditional, ancestral, unceded homelands of the indigenous people of the abenaki nation, a tribe of the wabanaki confederacy. 
indigenous people are not gone, they live here and are a part of the past, present, and future of our land and our communities. we honor with gratitude the land itself and the abenaki people, past and present.

‚ùÑhappy #fieldnotesfriday ! ‚ùÑthis week jason berard, vice president of stewardship, takes us on a walk through the woods where he came across a plethora of #animaltracks and signs! with all the fresh snow we have received this week, tracking conditions should be near perfect throughout the weekend. in the video, jason uses the term "subnivean zone" when describing the ruffed grouse`s roosting spot (also known as `snow roosting`). the subnivean zone is the area between the surface of the ground and the bottom of the snowpack. the word subnivean comes from the latin ‚Äúsub‚Äù (under) and ‚Äúnives‚Äù (snow). other animals, like mice and voles, take advantage of the insulation the subnivean zone provides by creating tunnels and spending most of the winter in them. want the outside delivered directly to your inbox?! sign up for field notes at uvlt.org and never miss out! #uvlt #landconservation  #community #uppervalleyvtnh
