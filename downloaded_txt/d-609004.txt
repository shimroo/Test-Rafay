being a screaming moderate is a tough way to charge through life.

	 time magazine got something right!
	 
    


i came across this article over at time.com – it’s worth reading. so what happened? did some people over at oxfam rent a sam kennison dvd and have an epiphany? it seems that after 50 years of feeding starving people, people are still starving. how could this be? not only are they still starving, but the situation is getting worse. does this sound familiar? it should. “helping” people by indefinitely giving them handouts is a sure recipe for disaster. free food, clothing, shelter and money should be short-term, emergency steps taken in dire situations and times of disaster. anything beyond the short terms will eventually lead to dependence and a loss of hope.

i'm just returning from a nice long vacation in mexico. there was no internet connection anywhere near the town where we were staying. besides, if this is what you had to look at every evening, would you have spent your time blogging? i didn't think so.i fell so in love with this place that i am planning a return trip to look for property that i might want to buy.

	 my views on 3 things
	 
    


since i've been remiss as of late, please allow me to charge out of the gate with several items in one post.1. tom junod praising a traitor. being a self proclaimed screaming moderate, i don't mind reading articles from either the right or the left. however, junod's recent article in esquire was just a bit too much "understanding" for me to stomach. junod casually explains away lindh's actions as those of a faithful pilgrim that just ended up with a gun in his hands in a war against us soldiers. he proclaims lindh's innocence and praises his faith. well i can't concur. a couple of months ago i attended the funeral of an american soldier killed in action. his name is not important. what does matter is that brave men and women are willing to fight and die for a just cause. they should be honored and the enemy combatants that are captured (even if they are us citizens) should be detained and punished.2. timetables for a pull-out of the iraq war. this is a bit silly if you ask me. why on earth would you set an arbitrary date based on assumptions that cannot possibly accurate and bring soldiers home before they can finish the task at hand. it would make more sense to set the date according to something meaningful, like a reading of tarot cards, a palm or tea leaves. that would have about the same accuracy as some politician's estimate on when the iraq government would be ready to take care of itself. stay in iraq. finish the job. leave when the time is right.3. national guard in new orleans. this city that i adore is in shambles. somehow the mayor got re-elected and what was his first move... to declare that he doesn't have what it takes to do the job by bringing in the feds. yes, the people that he blamed for making the mess have been invited back to finish the job. they may never recover.

to say i've been busy would be one of the greatest understatements ever. since my last post, i've logged about a dozen business trips to a handful of cities. unfortunately that shows no sign of slowing any time soon, other than my upcoming vacation. so i guess i should stop making excuses and start making time for something i really enjoy... this blog and the lovely instant feedback that fuels my ego so well. so in the immortal words of ll cool j... "don't call it a comeback!"

	 new blog
	 
    


i've received a bunch of email about capitalism bad; tree pretty and have decided to launch a reply blog since maia will not allow me to post replies to her articles. (fyi: none of my replies could be considered "trolling" or "attacking", they just simply don't comply with her beliefs, so she deletes them.) i would like to make this a group blog and am seeking fellow bloggers to take up the cause with me. if you would like to pitch in, email me and we'll see if our personalities work well together.i would like to see three types of posts on this new blog:direct replies to cbtp with quotes and what notdissenting views to those presented on cbtpsatirical original posts (but not mean spiritied) written in the same style as cbtpenjoy!

ok, our kiwi moonbat friend maia at capitalism bad; tree pretty has taken up the casue of a 20 year old college student in nz who gave birth to a baby, wrapped it in plastic, killed it and hid it in a campus garden. here is the original post along with my comments.________________________________________________________ that'll helpon saturday a 20 year old internation student was admitted to hospital with internal bleeding after giving birth. she did not have a baby with her. the hospital alerted the police, and the police found a dead baby.this afternoon she was charged with manslaughter, by failing to provide the necessaties of life.ok i can't even respond to that fact with any kind of coherence. charging that woman with manslaughter is just about the stupidest and least helpful thing anyone could do in that situation.for more background read these posts on interesting times   posted by maia at 11:30 pm     11 comments     links to this post________________________________________________________________in order to truly appreciate this entry, you should go to her site and read the comments.ok... if you read the comments, you will have seen that obviously, all of kiwi-land is full of nuts who wish to excuse this type of behavior.let me get this straight... a foreign national student comes to nz and decides that instead of taking advantage of free healthcare (including abortion on demand) she would go ahead and have a baby, kill it and hide the body. to me, this is murder, or at the least manslaughter. but our friend maia thinks that (a) she has suffered enough and should not be punished (b) no man should pass judgment on her because no man can "understand" what a woman goes through in childbirth and (c) anyone who disagrees with her is "stupid."maia, are you completely off your rocker? charging her would make it worse for whom? it certainly won't make it worse for the baby that was murdered. it very well should make it worse for the murdering mother! that is what punishment is all about! it should make it much worse for her! she should be made to suffer for her crime! she killed another human being! worse than that, she killed a helpless human being. how would you and all of your left wing crowd feel if a policeman had come up to an unsuspecting, paralyzed, mute, elderly, feminist and murdered her? would you say "oh, the poor cop. he has suffered enough, let him go home and watch rugby on his sofa." his victim would have been just as innocent and just as helpless. defending a criminal just because you share the same gender is laughable. what if all men decided that no woman should judge a man for rape because no woman can understand the strong sexual urges that men experience? does that sound like complete and utter bullshit? well, so does your excuse for this murdering student.it is arguments like this that give feminism a worse name than it already has. why don't women carry banners that say "we demand kind of equal rights!" or "equality for us as long as we can excuse ourselves from murder because of hormones"

just like there are two sides to every 45rpm record (you remember records don’t you), there are two sides to every story. if you don’t believe me, ask louisiana’s rep. william jefferson (d). after the fbi caught him on video taking a $100 thousand bribe, and after $90 thousand of that money was found in his home freezer, he still proclaims his innocence and fervently states, "there are two sides to every story. there are certainly two sides to this story. this is not the time, this is not the forum, to discuss it.”since rep. jefferson can’t seem to come up with a forum, i’ll volunteer mine. and furthermore, since he can’t lend his voice to his defense, i’ll do that for him as well.following is a spurious transcript of my recent interview with the distinguished gentleman from louisiana.dean swift: representative jefferson, it’s good to speak with you. why did you agree to this interview?rep. william jefferson: you promised me a cool grand and a box of reynolds wrap.ds: you’ve stated that you are innocent of the bribery charges being levied against you, can you explain this?rwj: yes i can. you see, i received an email from a nigerian man asking for my assistance in restoring him to the throne by providing him with my bank account information. in an effort to help my new friend, i forwarded this information to some close friends of mine in the fbi. they agreed that this new friend of mine definitely needed to be restored to the throne in order to provide intelligence about the evildoers around the world. so, the fbi gave me a briefcase full of cash to give to my friend, when ever i heard from him again.ds: so why was the money in your freezer, and $10 thousand light?rwj: i initially put the money in my bank account. and then i got another email from a woman in chad, asking for my bank account information so that she could get some money out of the country and help her father regain the throne of that nation. since the first deal with the nigerian was approved by the fbi, i figured this one would be just as good, so i went ahead and gave her my account info. and would you believe it! it was a scam! she stole $10 thousand from my account. so, to keep them from taking any more, i went to the bank and took out the remaining $90 thousand. the only safe place for me to keep it was (of course) in my freezer, wrapped in aluminum foil. you see, if you don’t wrap it in aluminum foil, the trilateral commission can pick up on the radio frequencies of emitted by large sums of money. once they pick up the signal, they can swoop in with their black helicopters and take the dough. also, halliburton corporation can use their private satellite network to detect the heat signature of cash piles. then, they can send in their private army to steal the cash and give it to president bush to use as a down payment on mind reading devices that he plans to use to steal another election for the republicans.ds: ok… well… i have to go now. do you mind it i borrow your tin-foil hat?rwj: be my guest, the next transmission from the mothership isn't expected for a few hours.

this is just too much fun! ok... here is the second installment of capitalism great; tree there to be cut down as natural renewable resource, whereby i take a post from capitalism bad; tree pretty (cbtp)and dissect it, argument by argument with lots of satire and cynicism. the original post follows (with my comments in red): ************************************************************************people should be freer than capital (people are freer, capital can't vote and certainly can't start a ridiculous blog filled with misguided thoughts)i wanted to write a little bit more about my position on immigration, because i think it's an issue that doesn't receive enough attention (wtf! the only thing i could thing of that would get more attention would be if michael jackson were to open a chain of day-care facilities). one commenter on my post wrote:but i have been surprised that many of the people that are vehemently againstcorporations outsourcing jobs to india and china have no problem with domesticoutsourcing to illegal immigrants driving down wages for many americans.this sort of rhetoric on immigration is really dangerous (it's really not dangerous at all. illegal aliens with criminal records are dangerous. i've never had my car broken into by a roving gang of rhetoric), because it drives a wedge between those with work permits and illegal immigrants, and it's wrong. the reason illegal immigration can drive down wages and conditions has nothing to do with the fact that people come from some country with bornwer skin (what the hell is bornwer skin? is that some kiwi thing that i don't know about?), in fact it has nothing to do with the immigrants at all, it's because the employers use the power they have over illegal immigrants. if all illegal immigrants were allowed to work legally then their wages and conditions would go up, because they could utilise labour legislation, and it would be easier to organise. (illegal aliens get the jobs they have because they will work for cheaper wages than other, legitimate workers. if they were afforded legal status, they would have no special advantages over other people in the labor pool. if all 12 million illegal aliens in the us today were granted citizenship, they would most likely find themselves out of work and replaced by new illegal aliens streaming over the border every day. these 12 million new citizens would then be eligible for unemployment, putting a further strain on our economy.)i don't actually care about american jobs any more than new zealand jobs, or chinese jobs and indian jobs (you should care more about nz jobs and get your nose out of our business). no borders isn't just rhetoric about immigration - it has to be a commitment not to priviledge one group of workers above another. (every employer in every business in every country should absolutely privilege certain workers over others. employers should favor workers who pay taxes, are willing to follow directions, work hard and increase productivity when needed.)i also oppose tarriff reduction regimes for different reasons than this commenters (huh?). while the arguments about relationships between tarriff changes in the first world and job losses (and not just in the first world, but that's a longer post) are important. the real reason i oppose tarriff reductions is that they give companies more power. the more free companies are to move around, the more they can leverage from different localities to move where they are. improved transport has meant that manufacturing can reasonably easily be moved from one location to another. this has given manufacturers the power to leverage zones where no labour legislation, or most other forms of legislation, apply to them. it's this power, not the job losses, that i object to. (so let me get this straight, you like freedom for laborers to move around to whatever country has the better wages, but you don't think companies should have the right to move around to get the best labor prices? are you nuts? let's think about that for a bit. if the labor pool moves freely to the countries that have the highest wages, like the usa, and the companies in other nations, like china and mexico can't move around, then the usa would grow in population and power to a degree that is unimaginable. every factory in the us would be at full capacity because there would be no labor available anywhere else. with the abundance of labor, we could reduce wages because of oversupply and further dominate the world. hey i'm starting to like this girl's thinking. with this kind of oversupply of labor, we could implement a mandatory draft of all the unemployed and with our newly huge army we could invade everyone else in the world and take their natural resources for ourselves. then, once we owned the world, we could ship out all of the undesirable people back to the countries from whence they came and start all over again! damn maia you're on to something here!)i don't actually believe that 'no borders' could be achieved under capitalism (no maia, say it aint so! your plan is awesome, let's get working on it!), neither could women's liberation (does she mean we should have to liberate our women? does than mean that american women’s should get the right to vote and drive and have jobs? what kind of radical is this kiwi chick?), but steps in that direction are worth fighting for.also posted on alas posted by maia at 9:32 pm 1 comments links to this post *****************************************************************8anyone else care to weigh in on this? i have to stop, my side hurts too bad from uncontrollable laughter and my fingers are sore from typing.

it’s wednesday and time for the first edition of capitalism great; tree there to be cut down as natural renewable resource. in this post, i will take a post from capitalism bad; tree pretty (cbtp)and dissect it, argument by argument. since this is the first installment, let me offer some back story on how this came about.i was reading mean ‘ol meany one day and came across cbtp. the name was so intriguing, that i had to check it out. what i found was a blog of lady from new zealand who seems to have all of the answers for her country, my country and just about everything else. it is her assertion that capitalism is the root of all evil. her name is maia and we have never met. i hold no feelings of ill will towards her and i wish her good fortune. i do however disagree with everything she has written. it was her site that jogged me out of my writer’s block, and for that i am grateful. i recently posted a comment on her blog, and being the voracious defender of free speech that she is… she has asked that i no longer post on her site. i will do my best to honor her wishes while still asserting my right to express my opinions in public forums.ok… on to today’s retort.on may 3rd, maia penned the article ningun ser humano es ilegal. according to her site, she didn’t know the meaning of this phrase when she used it as the title of her postps i stole the title from a banner; i don't speak spanish. i hope it's not toohideously wrong.it took me about thirty seconds to get a translation (no human is illegal) and of course, i don’t’ agree with the statement. we all know that being human is not a crime (although with some humans, perhaps it should be). but we also know that in a society of laws, when humans break these laws, their actions are illegal. there is not a single person of significant authority in our nation that will aver that any of the illegal aliens in our country are commiting an illegal act by virtue of being human. the crime being committed by the illegal aliens is that they intentionally ignored the established immigration laws which were rightfully enacted by the duly elected government of the usa, period. these people in the strictest sense of the word are indeed criminals, i.e. they have committed a crime.following is her entire post (with my comments in red) __________________________________________________________________ningun ser humano es ilegal (pero algunos seres humanos son criminals)wow, wow, wow, wow. i've been busy the last couple of days (were you working for a capitalist enterprise and making evil money or were you sponging off of other working people?), and only just had time to find out what happened on may day (illegal alien spring break). i'm out of town at the moment (did you spend any capitalist money and harm the environment with auto exhaust in order to get out of town?), and i'm sitting in an internet cafe going through the indymedia protests, looking at photos, and almost crying over how unbelievably amazing the american mayday immigrant right protests were (what was amazing is how most of america felt no ill effects from this day that was supposed to show americans how we “couldn’t live without” illegal aliens – hell, i was even able to eat at an ethnic restaurant without any noticeable change in service).that photo is from san francisco, and those links each go to a different indymedia sites. you can also find out more information, here, here, here and here.what really got to me (and made me all emotional) was the solidarity (i never get this solidarity issue. why do immigration protestors want a bunch of other protestors horning in on their rally? why do people against the war, for the impeachment of bush, against the oil companies and pro anarchy think they should join a protest that about amnesty for criminals in the usa?). immigration is a workers issue (no, it’s a universal issue that effects governments, businesses and individuals. it is so important that a myriad of laws and institutions have been established to control a sustainable immigrant population), and it doesn't just affect illegal immigrants.the photos from chicago, which had the biggest protests, showed that people understood that (the photos show that a bunch of people, who can’t agree on just what the issue is, who wore matching shirts and blocked traffic, inconveniencing the rest of the people who were just trying to go about their daily business of being productive citizens). as a history geek, i was particularly excited the chicago. may day marks the campaign for the 8 hour day, and the haymarket riots (which were started when anrachists and socialists set off a bomb at a an otherwise peaceful protest, killing a police officer who was protecting the crowd of protestors), and the state murder (arrest, indictment, trial and execution) that followed. the people who fought for the eight hour day were mostly immigrants and those organising now are continuing that fight (no, those organizing today are fighting a multitude of issues for selfish reasons. some are seeking amnesty for crimes that they committed. some are seeking to overthrow the government of the usa. some are seeking to take back california and parts of arizona and texas. some are seeking the halt of fur production. some are trying to raise awareness about gay rights. and some are just kicking back and talking about how cool it is to be in a protest rally).this photo is from chicago, near haymarket:ps i stole the title from a banner; i don't speak spanish. i hope it's not too hideously wrong. (if you honor these people so much, at least capitalize the spelling of their language… spanish)posted by maia at 8:53 pm 0 comments links to this post _________________________________________________________________it always amazes me how someone from another country, halfway across the world, thinks they have the answers to a problem here. maia, how would you react if 12 million people illegally entered new zealand? hmmmm... since your country only has a population of 4 million, that might be a bit harsh. ok, how about this, what if 163 thousand illegal aliens (4% of your population) descended on wellington and began taking jobs from nz citizens? it would destroy your economy and there would be riots in the streets. wow, that was fun. stay tuned… more on friday!
