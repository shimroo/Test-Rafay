hurricane helene update (monday october 29, 2024) 



time after time, storm after storm, our deltec homes are left standing – and after helene devastated our hometown of asheville, nc, thankfully so are we. 



				although our facility is near the french broad river, luckily it is on high ground and escaped the devastating flooding. the catastrophic impact of helene on our mountain community has only strengthened our commitment to building world-class weather resilient homes. please reach out to learn more.
