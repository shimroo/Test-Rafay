welcome to the spring lake inn, where history and modern comforts come together for an unforgettable vacation experience. our inn is charming yet elegant, casual yet private, providing a perfect retreat for those who need time to unwind and enjoy the jersey shore. built in 1888 as the grand central stables of spring lake, nj, the inn is just a block from the ocean and the 2-mile uncommercial boardwalk. start your day with our delicious breakfast spread in the grand dining room and enjoy a continuous hot tea service. relax on our irresistible 80 ft. victorian porch. our 16 spacious guest rooms and suites offer luxury features such as gas fireplaces, ocean views, jacuzzis, 4-poster beds, sleigh beds, refrigerators, and smart tvs with digital cable. fine dining, boutique shopping, and spa services are just blocks away. spring lake, new jersey, is one of americaâs most charming seaside towns, where time seems to stand still at our “mansion by the sea.”
