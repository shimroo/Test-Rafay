why study forestry at nau?
students pursuing forestry degrees benefit from a natural environment that includes theâ worldâs largest ponderosa pine forest, the highest mountain range in arizona, and the red rock country of sedonaâall conveniently located close to flagstaff. you’ll study with distinguished scientists who are recognized leaders in forestry, and who share with students their knowledge and expertise. in addition, a low student-faculty ratio means personal interaction, attention, and advice that you simply won’t find in programs with larger classes.

our clubs and organizations offer students professional training, interaction with forestry experts, public service projects, and opportunities to socialize with other students.
we offer over 50 scholarships (>$200,000) a year to our forestry students.
