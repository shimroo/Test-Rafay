for nightlife.

april 2013.


so what are you waiting for? come out and play, dine, and 
experience new orleans!
 


may 29, 2010dear ray and kim,what an expansion of the soul and senses last week was!
exactly what was needed by two fog-chilled san franciscans to savor the world 
anew!
to hear the very best music flowing out in the streets day and night—part of 
the intimate fabric of a city’s character, climate and a whole 24/7 way of life.
music, n’awlins cooking, the relaxed conversation with strangers, the ever-present sense of water surrounding.

it was as perfect a six days as i can remember.
thanks, and our very best from noe valley, the fillmore, pacific heights, and browser 
books! 


this is the real new orleans

you might have heard people say that new orleans is like san
francisco,
savannah, charleston, paris, or marseilles. it’s not.


the biggest difference is that the streets are exploding with live
music all
year round.


you’ve never seen such “street theater”. our most cherished visitors
come for
our food, music, architecture, history, artists, and writers.


the ambiance is very much like the french caribbean.


we live in the old french area, much like my creole ancestors did.
they came from france and spain in 1718 and 1793, respectively.


my mother and father grew up speaking french just a few houses away
from us.


our district, faubourg marigny, is a quieter version of the adjacent
french
quarter—the main difference being that you can actually sleep at night
here. 

it’s the safe, artist/gay residential area with about 70 bed and
breakfasts.


within a couple minutes’ walk of our front door, you have access to
restaurants
such as marigny brasserie,
feelings, horn’s, mona’s, wasabi, adolfo’s, and bars such as the spotted 
cat, d.b.a., checkpoint charlie’s, phoenix—not to mention an
overabundance of galleries and antique shops. you can read more about this in our 
frenchmen street guide.



jackson square is a mere 15-minute stroll through the adjacent french
quarter.



in the opinion of many, faubourg marigny, our neighborhood, has become
the more
bohemian extension of the french quarter,
increasingly becoming the neighborhood of choice for writers, painters,
musicians, street entertainers, and artists of all sorts.

throughout the old french district, you will see artists painting on
the
streets, musicians “jamming”—french doors of bars and restaurants
flung open,
beckoning you to enter.

this is the real new orleans. our nearby country club offers a large
pool, full bar, and lunch and dinner most of the year at a daily
rate.

we love to host nice, relaxed people—people who enjoy new surroundings and experiences—people who can 
“go with the flow”.

we try to steer clear of the formal, pretentious crowd—no “putting on airs” here.

no children or pets, and there is a 3-night minimum and a limit of two persons to a room.

we met in copenhagen, got engaged in helsinki, got married in canada, and now run our b&b in new orleans. ☺

please come stay with us if you think we’re your kind of place.



and remember that our place is quirky and “funky”, with a “decrepit 
new orleans vibe”—kind of “run-down,” authentic, old new orleans charm—and chock-full of interesting stuff all around.

la dauphine

rã©sidence des artistes

    is a very laid-back guest house for the budget-minded traveler. no “attitude”. 
    located in the bohemian, artsy part of town, four blocks
    from the french quarter, and a mere 12-minute streetcar ride to the
    convention center. for your safety and serenity, no unregistered guests
    are allowed in the rooms. no cooking is allowed and there is no kitchen
    access. a mellow, village-like atmosphere prevails throughout the
    neighborhood.
  


    hallway
  

la dauphine

rã©sidence des artistes

    the rooms feature queen-size, four-poster beds, cable tv, dvd, 
    ceiling fans, central air and heat—all this in a charming,
    yet unpretentious, renovated, victorian, 100-year-old house. very
    relaxed and quiet, and a continental breakfast is included. on-street
    unrestricted parking is usually available in front of the house. 
	tanuki, an intelligent and friendly japanese shiba inu dog, also lives in the house.
  



languages spoken are: 
english, (yesâreally), french, german and danish. ray has lived in paris and bavaria, while kim has lived and worked in israel and his native
denmark.

rates are higher
for
events such as mardi gras, halloween and southern decadence (labor
day).
each room has its own private bath.
there is a guest refrigerator in the common area. 
62 rooftop solar panels help to power the 3,000-sq.-ft. house.
a three-night minimum is required.

you will be well
cared
for!

directions from
airport:
take i-10 east
into new
orleans. follow i-10 into city staying in right lane and take
what looks like
an exit with slidell posted above (it’s still i-10).
take the esplanade
  avenue
  exit (the next one after the vieux carrã© exit), and turn right.
  go one
  and a
  half blocks to esplanade avenue, and turn right at the traffic light.
  proceed
  less than a mile to our street, dauphine, and turn left. go 5–6 blocks
  to 2316
  dauphine to la dauphine (on the right).
(unbelievably,
half the
taxi drivers at the airport do not know the streets of the french
quarter—even with a million tourists a month heading there. so be prepared to
direct
them.)

bob dylanâs poetic words about new orleans
there are a lot of places i like, but i like new orleans better. 
    the city is one very long poem. 
    gardens full of pansies, pink petunias, opiates. 
    flower-bedecked shrines, white myrtles, bougainvillea and purple oleander stimulate your senses, make you feel cool and clear inside.
    everything in new orleans is a good idea. 
    bijou temple-type cottages and lyric cathedrals side by side. 
    houses and mansions, structures of wild grace. 
    italianate, gothic, romanesque, greek revival standing in a long line in the rain. 
    roman catholic art. 
    sweeping front porches, turrets, cast-iron balconies, colonnadesâ30-foot columns, gloriously beautifulâdouble pitched roofs, 
    all the architecture of the whole wide world and it doesnât move. 
    all that and a town square where public executions took place. 
    in new orleans you could almost see other dimensions. 
    thereâs only one day at a time here, then itâs tonight and then tomorrow will be today again. 
    chronic melancholia hanging from the trees. 
    you never get tired of it. 
    after a while you start to feel like a ghost from one of the tombs, like youâre in a wax museum below crimson clouds. 
    spirit empire. wealthy empire. 
    one of napoleonâs generals, lallemaud, was said to have come here to check it out, 
    looking for a place for his commander to seek refuge after waterloo. 
    he scouted around and left, said that here the devil is damned, just like everybody else, only worse. 
    the devil comes here and sighs. 
    new orleans. exquisite, old-fashioned. 
    a great place to live vicariously. 
    nothing makes any difference and you never feel hurt, a great place to really hit on things. 
    somebody puts something in front of you here and you might as well drink it. 
    great place to be intimate or do nothing. 
    a place to come and hope youâll get smartâto feed pigeons looking for handouts.
