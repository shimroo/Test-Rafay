page content​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​assisted living communities serve individuals who typically need help with every day activities and some health care services but do not require 24-hour skilled nursing care services for extended periods of time. these communities offer a unique mix of companionship, independence, priv​acy, and security in a home-like setting. the philosophy of assisted living is built on the concept of delivering person-centered care and services to each individual resident. person-centered care means that the care and services meet residents’ specific needs and preferences.​the american health care association represents assisted living providers through its national center for assisted living (ncal). ncal is dedicated to serving the needs of the assisted living community through​ n​a​tio​nal advocacy, education, networking, professional development, and quality initiatives.​​​
