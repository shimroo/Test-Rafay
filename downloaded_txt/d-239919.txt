                mobility for all
            

our mission is to produce "happiness for all" through the pursuit of "mobility for all". we intend to achieve this by building a unique partner ecosystem for a future society in harmony with nature. in practice, this means applying and sharing our know-how to benefit people, the community and our planet in order to build a better tomorrow.
through our commitment to quality, continuous innovation and respect for the planet, we aim to exceed expectations and generate happiness for all. by developing and manufacturing the largest choice of innovative, safe, sustainable, and high-quality mobility products and services, we want to provide universal, inclusive and accessible mobility solutions for everyone.























                a holistic approach to mobility
            

                as we transform into a mobility company developing connected, automated, shared and electrified (case) technologies, we will provide goods and services that go beyond cars, vans and trucks. our objectives align with our environmental challenge 2050, the un’s sustainable development goals, and the eu’s green deal. as pioneer of the hybrid prius, and with a track record of over 27 million electrified vehicle sales globally, we embrace a holistic approach to environmentally-friendly vehicles and applications. our technologies include hydrogen, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric powertrains.  
            























                sustainable business
            

                we are following the sdg lead through our social and employment practices, guided by three goals. the first is to promote an ‘inclusive and diverse society’ – an idea which starts with toyota but extends to our partners and customers. the second goal is ‘employment equity’. our commitment to long-term sustainable employment starts with ensuring fairness and opportunity for every toyota employee in europe. it also includes employment and development opportunities, through education and re-skilling. the third ambition is to improve society through continuous ‘sustainable innovation’, within tme and externally.
