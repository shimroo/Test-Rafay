trusted standards
many national and international regulatory bodies for sports require the use of equipment made to nocsae standards. some examples are the nfl, ncaa, national federation of state high school associations (nfhs), international federation of american football, the united states polo association (uspa), usa football, usa lacrosse as well as the federal dodea which oversees and regulates military base athletic programs for the children of military families around the world.

realistic testing criteria
nocsae helmet standards are based on criteria that consider not only peak g‘s but also the impact’s duration during the event. this is an accurate way to assess the severity of an impact.

strict & substantial qc/qa requirements
nocsae standards are the only personal protective equipment standards to incorporate very specific and highly demanding levels of compliance.

accredited third-party certification
this is the most stringent and unbiased way to determine standards compliance because the third party cannot have any connection to manufacturers or products they certify.

post-sale testing & recertification
our standards provide a way to check the performance of (previously certified) used equipment—which is a key to supporting athlete safety.

we are the only sport equipment standards developer to require product certification by a third-party certifier.nocsae does not certify or approve equipment. our standards are the basis for certification by safety equipment institute. sei is a separate iso/iec 17065 accredited organization.

research funding
our mission is to commission research, establish standards for athletic equipment and encourage the dissemination of research findings on sport injury and prevention.
accordingly, the nocsae grant programs fund investigator-initiated research that advances education, health, and safety in sport.
we award grants to organizations of all types (universities, colleges, small businesses, and so on) within north america. our large grant and small grant programs allow an investigator to define the scientific focus or objective of the research based on a particular area of interest and competence.
