carol hollfelder animal shelterthe capital campaign project that made this facility possible is one of renewed purpose, hope, dedication, and pride. ‘build new beginnings’ was something carol herself was familiar with in her own life and the life of our organization. carol understood new beginnings and a need to recreate herself after a motorcycle accident left her paralyzed. with the use of specially made hand controls, and the fight to be able to use them in racing, she quickly established a reputation as a remarkable driver. determined to pave the way for a new beginning, carol’s passion for racing blossomed into a lifelong adventure. the generosity and support of carol’s parents, tom and bea hollfelder, has helped build this facility and has ensured that the aspirations of humane society of sheboygan county become a reality. hssc is honored to dedicate this building to be named “the carol hollfelder animal shelter”.carol’s love for animals has forged a legacy dedicated to pet’s health and well-being in our community for generations to come with the humane society of sheboygan county carol hollfelder animal shelter.
