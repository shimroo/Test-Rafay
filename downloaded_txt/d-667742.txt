sikia is located right next to the seashore of the pagasitic gulf on the colourful green peninsula of the pelion mountain. you will find sikia between the picturesque villages of kato gatzea and kala nera in a 30 hectares olive grove.
sikia succeeds today to keep its typical greek character and to offer all modern international standards and requirements. alongside the campground we offer hotel rooms and apartments that manage to balance the unique pelion architecture with all the modern comforts.
through the shady olive grove, the guest can reach sikia beach, situated in front of the camping. sikia offers a sandy beach for both children and adults. there is also a rocky bay for snorkling and swimming. as part of the offered facilities is the family taverna, the seaside bar and a grocer’s shop. among others there is also a multi-purpose sports field for basketball, mini football and volleyball.
