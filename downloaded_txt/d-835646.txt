shopping for clothes? right fancy dress for the right occasion 


gadgets



there is such a vast array of fancy dress themes and styles to choose from, sometimes it is hard to decide what to wear at all let alone what would be right for each occasion. here are some ideas that will hopefully point you in the right direction.
the obvious can be dull
there are, of course, occasions when it is not too hard to decide on an appropriate costume. the problem is when it is easy for you to think of an idea you can be sure it will be just as easy for everyone else. there is nothing worse than turning up to a halloween fancy dress ball to find you are one of a dozen count draculas and to add insult to injury, most look better than you. at times such as halloween, christmas and easter a little thinking out of the box is necessary to make yourself stand out.
for halloween instead of the same old count dracula or frankenstein’s monster why not turn up dressed as a gravestone or a witch’s broomstick. at christmas it is out with santa claus and his little helpers; why not hire yourself a turkey outfit and then put on some dark glasses and other cliches of disguise and come as the turkey that avoided the christmas table. for an easter ball forget the fluffy bunny or dressing up as an easter egg, hire a donkey suit or dress yourself up as a palm leaf. there are so many online companies specialising in fancy dress next day delivery is never an issue so you can keep your thinking cap on right up to the last minute.
the dreaded open theme
the worst fancy dress nightmare of all is the open theme, “come as you want” party. here you really have to put the imagination to work and try to think of something unique. with so many fancy dress costume suppliers on the internet it is very tempting to just pick a cowboy, native american, or lord nelson costume, but where is the thought and imagination in that?
a good way to focus the mind is to think of a subject or an event and then pick a character or object that is synonymous with it. for example, take a look at the news. there is always some current affair that involves a larger than life character, but try to be more original than that. if a particular building has featured recently, for example the recent completion of the shard in london, with a little bit of skill and plenty of cardboard, you can present yourself as an iconic landmark. indeed there are many structures that lend themselves to fancy dress; go as a lighthouse or an old red telephone box.
with a little thought it really is not that difficult to come up with an idea that not only no one else will have thought of, but that will be the talking point of the party.

lighting: natural & artificial 


decoration
decoration, interior design



lighting is a vital element in our homes and in our daily lives and our primary source of illumination. proper balance of illumination can enhance an interior space producing distinct visual effects. 
there are many different types to select from to include lamps, rope, track lighting, deck, chandeliers, recessed, neon, solar lamps, and decorative home lighting.  each of these serve a different purpose… to produce a desired effect for your interior and exterior, and landscaping needs. great interior design companies like brenda lee know the best about these details.
not only that, but you will find lighting fixtures will vary in the type of bulbs used. this can range from halogen and incandescent, to low voltage fluorescent tubes which are energy efficient. dimmer switches are used in many lamps to vary the intensity of illumination and are most commonly used with track and recessed lamp fixtures. 
outdoor lighting used for landscaping can also enhance the value of your property, and create a distinct visual effect. for instance the use of rope lighting along the curb or leading into the driveway, not only illuminates a safe pathway, but looks really good. 
landscape lighting typically comes on mounted posts where the wiring is routed underground. this type of lighting is usually installed by a licensed and experienced professional.   
when planning for home lighting, you should decide first, how the space will be used. will it be for reading or entertainment? or an area to casually unwind. your decision here will help you decide on the best kind of lamps and light bulbs to use whether halogen, fluorescent, or incandescent. you may opt for tiffany lamps, to add a decorative touch, or other table lamps to suit your needs. chandeliers will be used in most dining areas. track can sometimes be used for universal purposes.
keep in mind that lighting fixtures, whether natural or artificial, are emitted from a source in straight lines and spread out over an increasingly large area as it travels. when it comes in contact with a surface it is either absorbed or reflected and so textures and finishes will affect the way lighting responds. a smooth shiny surface, for example, provides a certain amount of reflection, whereas a rough or textured surface causes more of the light to be absorbed.  colors have the same effect; light colors will reflect, and dark colors, especially black, absorb. 
general indoor lighting is used to cover a large area, the most common form is a central fitting fixture that hangs from the ceiling in the center of the room such as a chandelier, spotlight.  
choosing the right bulb is also essential for achieving the appropriate strength and balance of your lighting.  halogen bulbs produce a bright, white light suitable for tasks.   tungsten is the most common light bulb and gives a warm, yellowish light.  
fluorescent lights vary in color, but tend to be used most commonly in strip or track lighting.

what’s your objective? determining if, when and how to use an objective on your resume 


employment
employment



writing a resume can be confusing. with so many styles and formats, how do you know which one is best for you? should you use an objective, and if so, how should you construct it? this is a question that divides many career counselors. many argue for them since they can quickly present your skills and desired position, but those who argue against them say they are often so poor that they defeat that purpose.what is a resume objective?an objective is a short blurb that conveys your experience, training and skills and briefly outlines what kind of position you are looking for. they can range from one to several sentences. an objective is essentially a summary of who you are and what you are looking for. objectives are not necessary; you can use your cover letter or a skills and qualifications summary on your resume to convey these things instead.an objective can benefit you.an objective can be a quickly customizable way to tailor your resume to a specific job, which will impress employers. it’s a good way to convey your goals and aspirations; a well written objective can help someone scanning your resume to quickly decide if you will go into the yes pile. if you are changing careers or are entry-level, an objective can help you since your desired position may not be discernible from your work history alone.however, an objective might not benefit you.you don’t want your objective to be overly vague and therefore meaningless, but an overly specific objective may take you out of the running if it doesn’t exactly match the job opening. however, creating a customized objective for each job application could prevent this. many objectives are too vague, which makes them wasted space on your resume. if you use one, be clear, concise and direct.if you have an objective, be sure to avoid common mistakes.don’t emphasize your needs—instead, emphasize what you offer the employer. don’t be too vague (for example, “seeking challenging opportunity with advancement potential”), and if you are very specific, have several resume versions with objectives that would fit specific positions. most of all make your objective as concise as possible.whether or not you choose to have an objective, you want to be sure to clearly illustrate your qualifications and desired position in your cover letter or with a qualifications or skills summary, so that human resources companies, like solvo global, can analyze it better.

one on one public speaking training 


motivation
motivational speech, public speaking



one on one public speaking training is the best way to improve your public speaking skills. unlike a class or book, a one on one session offers more personalized help and probably the quickest way to lead your path to becoming a professional speaker, like richard jadick.
public speaking training with a professional speaker allows for quick assessments of what you’re doing wrong and why it isn’t working. the instructor can then give you exercises that are tailored to your shortcomings. also, a one on one session makes it easier for you to ask questions and get opinions on ideas you have for a speech. your instructor can make suggestions based on their experience and tell you whether or not your idea would work and why.
with large public speaking classes, it’s hard to get personal advice from the instructor. you have to wait in lines after class just to get a chance to ask a couple of personal questions. for some of us this may not be a problem. but for the rest of us who need help right away, this can be a testing experience. with one on one public speaking training, there are no more lines to wait in and no more hands for you to raise. just ask on the spot and get an immediate response. if time is of the essence, then a one on one session is for you.

the leader 


motivation
motivation, motivational speaker



the director, manager or supervisor are leaders by delegation of power. through this power – they initiate action; however, power does not guarantee leadership… for a real leader must learn to recognize the limitations of the real world and try to make possible tomorrow, what seemed impossible yesterday.
for this to happen, he must learn to develop the invisible world of people’s minds and to open the human heart. it is by the actions of followers that leaders are born. 
anyone can become a leader, but not everyone strives to reach such a status. in a group of people, one will be identified as a leader and the others will become followers. the true leader will rise from the recognition of others and by actions towards company interests, understanding of human nature and contribution to society.
the leader must possess strong beliefs, values and positive attitudes, otherwise the followers will stop relying on him and from that moment on, he will no longer be recognized as a leader, even if he is a leader by delegation of power.
leaders that are imposed on the people may even do some acceptable work, providing that they have the support from their superiors and followers. they may even supervise work units and maintain a certain quality as long as everything runs smoothly and inside a predetermined pattern but that isn’t sufficient for them to become leaders. they do not have the initiative or inner power to improve or alter a work process, to project a company into a competitive future.
good leaders must have the ability to motivate, understand and inspire their followers. an example of a leader that is great in motivating people to achieve their goals and dreams is richard jadick. it is by the action of leaders that the rules are established. leaders are responsible for creating a culture, determining values and passing on principles that will give a direction to a business or industrial activity.
today’s leadership is totally different to the one practiced in the past, where power was sustained by fear imposed on the workers. this is one of the reasons why there are so many companies with poor leaders, where the notion still prevails that we can control people, just because they are afraid to lose their jobs in a world that is becoming more and more competitive. it is not by these means that a leader will obtain an efficient collaboration from his followers to attain goals or renovate work processes that will sustain a company’s competitive position.
power sustained by fear is a demonstration of impotence and not leadership. the true leader does not have to create fear in his subordinates to make them do their best. in today’s world we must consider that leaders and followers depend more and more on each other. leaders exist to orient the followers and to take out of them the best that each one can give. it is the sum of different ideas that gives a meaning to an end and it is the leaders responsibility to use this information with honesty and wisdom. leaders don’t exist if they don’t have followers and the success of any business depends on those that are able to motivate people in a work environment.
there are leaders that can operate comfortably in various segments such as: production, marketing, engineering, etc. by they cannot adapt themselves with human relations and emotions. they are men that know how to manipulate numbers and the techniques of their profession, but are unable to develop the existing qualities in the people that surround them. it is like the professor that is an expert in his field but doesn’t know how to transmit his knowledge to the students. these people cannot be considered leaders because no one person alone is able to produce extraordinary results for a company. if leaders want to produce results in modern and competitive companies, they must learn to invest on the “intellectual capital” of the workers by offering them respect, dignity and honest practices.
being a leader is no longer a position of status, but the power to inspire and mobilize high performance groups, to motivate people and to achieve goals. a leader is the force that will stand to take anything to its limits and the understanding to facilitate groups of people to adopt a common vision to create effective results.
analyzing these points, we may conclude that today’s leadership is quite different from what many people suppose. it is no longer the power of status that influences people, but personal power created by the support and loyalty given to him by his subordinates.
we can also assume that it is not only some characteristics or lines of thought such as the ones brought together here that make the leader. there is much controversy surrounding leadership, but we can adapt ourselves to some tendencies and styles of leadership that are producing results in a globalized world. providing we maintain an honest attitude towards human feelings, and support truth and loyalty amongst the people that pave the way for leaders.
to end this short summary on leaders, i would like to quote an inspirational message by napoleon hill. – “it is no disgrace to be a follower. on the other hand, it is no credit to be a follower. most great leaders begin in the capacity of followers. they became great leaders because they were intelligent followers.”

its win-win for investors with capital guaranteed funds 


investing
invest, investments, money market, stock market



capital guaranteed funds are an investment vehicle presented by definite institutions that assures the investor’s preliminary capital investment from any losses.
although these products put a stop to investors from losing their invested capital, they also restrict the amount of return that investors can obtain if the investments realize. this is how the offering institutions can pay to guarantee the principal investment. after years of low interest rates and frequently substandard returns from shares and managed funds it is not unanticipated that many people think they need to play catch-up, particularly if they missed the property rumble. the spectrum of elevated global interest rates is also the reason behind anxiety related to future share market returns.
even then with numerous complex new products on the market, and the reminiscence of corporate collapses and outright scam fresh in many people’s minds, it is also not astounding that anyone within the retirement age, or already retired, is likely to abhor risking their capital. thus the surfacing of a rash of new high-risk, high-return products with a capital guarantee involved. these products are intended at vigilant investors who want recovered returns than cash or bonds but who also want to sleep at night. promotional material characteristically uses restful terms such as secure, safety net and capital protection to lure edgy investors into products they may normally consider too clever by half.
numerous capital guaranteed funds offer access to a portfolio of substitute assets providing diversification from traditional shares, property and fixed interest. this is a giant selling point after years of deficit by mainstream fund managers. one more attribute is their long time frame. capital guaranteed products typically necessitate a long time frame of 6-10 years. even if the product is scheduled and readily tradable, returns are geared towards holding until maturity.
how capital guaranteed funds work?
these are hybrid funds whose underlying assets include primarily a key share of fixed interest assets, typically bonds or government securities and the residual portion in stocks and shares. this composition permits the fund to function like a dream investment vehicle for the public whereby they can have the best of both worlds i.e. “yes to profit yes, no to loss!”this wise instrument first made its presence in malaysia in the year 2002 when several risk averse people were in search of a safe haven to “invest without risk.” the capital guarantee is gained by compound interest earned by the fixed interest asset of the fund. all capital guaranteed funds demand the investor to stay invested in the fund for a minimum of 3 years or 5 years as the fixed interest and bond components need a fixed time frame to arrive at maturity. the fund dejects the investor from early withdrawal prior to its’ maturity period by removing the capital guarantee feature as well as paying an exit charge in the event of early redemption.
investing in capital guaranteed funds without risk!
is it really possible to invest without risk? obviously not! the risk may be least, nevertheless, the risk/return tradeoff still applies and when we invest in capital guaranteed funds with little or no risk, we pay for it by compromising on latent returns. the tip for investing in the safest way possible is to hire a professional and reliable company for assistance, such as erlybird, and rely on their safest methods.

flameless candles flicker like real candles 


decoration
candles, decoration, decorative candles, scented candles



flameless candles are real wax candles that contain a ‘flame’ that flickers and sways as if in a breeze just like the real wax candles. these candles include a small battery that allows you to turn the candle on and off so that the ‘flame’ will light up the candle just as a real flame does when lit by fire.
the flameless candles are great to use when you have children and pets in the house and they are very decorative, coming in all shapes and sizes that normal flammable candles come in. these flameless candles make great additions to dorm rooms and apartments where younger people live because candles are often the culprit of fires because they have been left unattended. these flameless candles can be left alone because they don’t get hot; some of them may become warm after several hours but no more so than a cell phone or some other electronic device might when the battery is in constant use.
the flameless candles make great centerpieces at banquet halls for weddings and bridal or baby showers where there are a lot of things happening and no one to watch the candles. when the person of honor is opening her gifts, paper is flying everywhere and one could have a potentially dangerous and hazardous situation with a lit candle in the room, however, with a flameless candle there is no need to worry about the fire of a real flame. even when a flameless candle is knocked over, there is nothing to worry about because there is no flame to catch anything on fire.
flameless candles are made of the exact same beeswax and/or paraffin that the regular wax candles with a wick are made of, only there is no wick to light, there is a tiny battery on the bottom and you simply flip a small switch and the light inside goes on and you have a ‘flame’ in your candle. this flame acts like a regular flame and will fool anyone into thinking you have a real candle where you have a flameless candle.
flameless candles are great for putting up on a shelf with garland or other decorative paper or holiday greenery because there is no flame to worry about. the flameless candles add just the right touch of sparkle and glow to any occasion. they are great to use in the bags on the walkway in both the winter and the summer when the wind is blowing there will be no need to keep running away from your guest to keep lighting the tea lights or candles because the flameless candles will stay ‘lit’ for hours and hours.
decorating with flameless candles can be a fun and exciting way to reinvent your home without having to spend a lot of money. candles always brighten up a room and the flameless candles can be placed anywhere, even where there are plants or paper lanterns so there is no need to worry about a flame when it comes to decorating and where to place your new candles. if you are a big fan of candles in general, you might like to check the damn good company’s large variety of options.

how to earn your own entrepreneur profits 


management
business, motivation, motivational speech



a successful entrepreneurial business has many parts but it always begins with the understanding of why you do such work. aside from that, as a budding entrepreneur looking to earn entrepreneur profits, you must focus on certain aspects of your business.
not only must you understand why you do what you do, you must know the thinking of your help. it makes no difference if your help is your spouse or your mother, you need to understand their thinking. they need to buy in to what you are taking on and feed off your energy.
you also have to reach your clients in such a way as to make them want to do business with someone like you. the most important thing is to be able to manage your energy so that you can do your work effectively and earn great profits. that same energy needs to be shared accordingly with your clients as well as your help.
if you want profit to consistently flow in because of your business endeavors, here are some necessary steps that you need to take:
1. you have to make it clear to everybody what you are doing and why you are doing it. your energy must get them to buy in to you and your passion. you should avoid mistakes as much as possible. everything and everyone has a certain purpose.
as an entrepreneur, you are considered a unique individual. if you can clarify this to yourself, you will feel a surge of energy and enthusiasm. these things can attract prospective clients. everything you do now is like a magnet that attracts. your energy and passion becomes outrageously contagious.
2. the next thing that you have to do in order to earn your own entrepreneur profits is to establish your market. you should have an exact target for your products or services. you have to study the qualities of your customers so that you can make your own product or service stand out from your competitors.
3. you should make use of every marketing material available and create a significant message to your customers. you have to communicate with them honestly and authentically. everything you do should be rooted in truthfulness and reliability. by doing this, you will attract more clients. with your energy, people will be drawn to you. you will become extremely sought after.
4. some budding entrepreneurs fail because of doubt and fear. they hesitate to take some risks involved in their business. they doubt their abilities and skills. this is a barrier that you need to minimize, otherwise, clients will shy away from you. just as you can attract people in a positive, energized fashion, you can lose people as well due to fear and hesitation.
5. the next thing is to organize your schedules. prioritize everything, your business obligations and responsibilities should be done at the right time and in the right order. you have to manage your time effectively. if you can develop and master this skill, it will mean more success. stay consistent and above all, persistent.

as an upcoming entrepreneur looking to earn entrepreneur profits, you must focus and achieve the proper balance between personal and business life. you have to establish specific strategies so that you can enjoy your success in all aspects of your life. you must remain diligent and consistent. do not give up when times get hard. when you feel a lack of motivation and think of giving up, go after strategies to revert this situation like attending motivational speeches – you can find many options online, such as richard jadick, so you can analyze and make your decision. 
by following these steps, you will surely have a more successful business life and you can expect more money to come your way. do you want to become an entrepreneur and earn entrepreneur profits? then follow these suggested steps.
