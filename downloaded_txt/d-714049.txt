casewv secures funding for home repairs in monroe county



community action of south eastern west virginia, inc. (casewv), is happy to announce that we’ve been awarded $335,680 from fhlb pittsburgh through their 2024 affordable housing program. james king, president of the bank of monroe, submitted the grant application on our behalf as the fhlb member bank. all funds will be utilized to make needed repairs to twelve homes in monroe county and includes repair and administrative costs. michelle dalton, housing director for casewv and native of monroe county, conducted surveys over several weeks this summer to obtain information on the housing needs within the county. this survey was an integral part of the funding application, and we appreciate those who took the time to participate and our community partners who helped in this process. the twelve homeowners will be selected from those surveys, as well as from our existing waiting list. we plan to use local, licensed contractors and information on submitting bids will be forthcoming.
