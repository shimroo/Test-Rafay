welcome to the

college of visual & performing arts






 




who we are
the j.t. & margaret talkington college of visual & performing arts (tcvpa) is the
                                    beating heart of texas tech university. we are a creative community with the resources
                                    of a world-class public university. our students from all over the world shine with
                                    texas-sized ambition, curiosity, and compassion.
our college cultivates confidence-building artistic journeys with an infinite number
                                    of destinations. we are theatrical sound designers, independent filmmakers, and modern
                                    dance teachers. we are gallery owners, experimental sculptors, and art historians.
                                    we are symphony conductors, opera singers, and broadway performers. we are researchers
                                    exploring the intersection of the arts with multiple disciplines.
our schools provide a supportive visual and performing arts education. new students
                                    join a community of 1,100 arts dedicated undergraduate and graduate students—including
                                    d.m.a. and ph.d. candidates. the arts are relevant, critical, and essential to contemporary
                                    life. an education in the arts inspires students to communicate through artistic tradition
                                    while embracing and creating innovative technologies as vehicles for individual expression
                                    and social change.
