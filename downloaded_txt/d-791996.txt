												wave of terror washes over democrats after trump wins louisiana election these socialists know foretells their 2020 destruction											


												sorcha faal											

november 18, 2019


an intriguing new security council (sc) report circulating in the kremlin today deliberating the significance of future foreign policy decisions in light of a stunning poll showing 85% of russian peoples have a negative view of relations with the united states, states that this abysmal finding in regards to the world’s two biggest nuclear armed powers that have no choice but to get along with each other, lays right at the doorstep of the american socialist democrat party—who are best described as a demented group of radical leftists so enraged that president donald trump won his election victory in 2016 they blamed president putin calling it an “act of war exactly like pearl harbor” that erupted into world war ii—and nearly three whole years later, stills sees these deranged socialist lunatics living in a world having no basis in reality—best exampled this past saturday by their reaction to an election in the state of louisiana that saw these socialist democrats maniacally celebrating fake news headlines like “louisiana delivers trump a black eye” and “trump’s fading superpower on display in louisiana governor loss”—whose true facts of, though, showed democrat governor john bel edwards receiving 774,469 votes to beat the 734,128 votes received by his republican opponent eddie rispone—a 70-year-old businessman who financed his campaign with millions of his own dollars in a vicious campaign ran against his republican primary opponent us congressman ralph abraham—did see trump holding rallies for rispone that near entirely erased his 22-point polling disadvantage against governor edwards—but whose most significant event of this election, saw the vast family and supporters of republican congressman abraham outright refusing to vote for rispone—thus shifting the true measure of trump’s influence in this election to louisiana secretary of state kyle ardoin—whom trump also supported at his rallies and won his election with 867,449 votes—which is 92,980 more votes than governor edwards won his race by—and should secretary of state ardoin have run for governor, would have seen him winning it.  […]

								“deep state” blackmail war turns deadly sights on us military factions supporting trump							


								by sorcha faal in sorcha faal															
another ominous security council (sc) report circulating in the kremlin today says that the “apologies being whispered into our ears” by western diplomats who are expelling russian diplomats in mass over a poisoning charade in the uk that no evidence exists for, proves that this invented crisis is “due to a colossal blackmail and pressure campaign” initiated by the american shadow government “deep state”—and whose deadly sights have now turned on the usmilitary and intelligence factions supporting president donald trump—as evidenced by the “false flag” terror attacks on travis air force base and, at least, 6 top american military and intelligence agencies over this past week.  […]

imagine supreme court rulings consistent with an illuminati doctrine written over 200 years ago; a doctrine calling for a totalitarian world government run by a cabal of international bankers. imagine rulings also consistent with the 24 protocols of the more infamous work based on it but falsely attributed to an entire people, the protocols of the learned elders of zion. that is the true horror, and why the latter may be…the most prophetic and terrifying forgery in history.

fail: washington post hoax on trump’s “top secret time travel project” 
the washington post bravely risks it all to reveal that by 2016, donald trump used his access to gen. michael flynn to quietly direct darpa, then in secret works with cern in switzerland, to commission the first  time machine ever constructed. the result? an epic rap battle between trump and anne frank.

hearst boasted fake news is the enemy of the people, causes warsnewspaper publisher william randolph hearst boasted in a cable to his photographer in cuba "you furnish the pictures. i'll furnish the war." sure enough, his papers started the spanish-american war. back in the day fake news was called yellow journalism, but it is one and the same, the enemy of the people. 




was 9/11 a nuclear event? 

 view online or download pdf.  1,000 times more damning than 9/11 commission’s 28 pages’, ‘american holocaust: 9/11 an irrefutable nuclear event, over 42,000 deaths and counting — veterans today nuclear event evidence compilation leaked fbi 9/11 evidence against bush, clinton, blair and netanyahu too staggering to ignore. if a picture is worth a thousand words, here’s some culled from thousands implicating them all, saudis included.



uncle sam sayeth unto thee 

despite its failures, the truth is the press still can save us, and even the shadow elites admit it. in the meantime, don’t count on it. remember that there is no jailer more powerful than one who can imprison your mind, and that enslavement is the job of the news broadcaster dedicated to creating a fear-based reality and not reflecting life it as it really is. 
remember that citizen journalism works, and never rely on a single source.



rare candor from the corporate media 

“there is no such thing… in america, as an independent press… if i allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. the business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. you know it and i know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? we are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes… our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. we are intellectual prostitutes.” john swinton,new york times chief editor 1880
