join us for another great outdoor adventure!august 2024 edition


adventure sports outdoors
 like many american success stories, aso had humble beginnings. harry’s love for the outdoors began as a child learning to hunt and fish across central illinois. in 1984, harry began broadcasting a one hour radio talk show called “the red nose gang”. in 1993, harry introduced his down-to-earth media style to television, airing illinois sports outdoors on pbs affiliate wtvp. illinois sports outdoors made it into print in 1996.
        today adventure sports outdoors covers the entire outdoor world. with aso online we reach around the world to inform, educate, and entertain. in december 2016 we will produce our 20th year anniversary edition. as harry and cathy pass the torch to andy bugos the new generation of adventure sports outdoors has arrived. andy is enthusiastic and ready to live his dream in the outdoor world. cathy and i couldn’t be happier to pass along our great tradition of adventure sports outdoors magazine to andy.
