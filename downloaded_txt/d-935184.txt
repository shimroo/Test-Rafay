unleash creativity using your home equity!

at wayne bank we offer innovative banking solutions designed to help you achieve your goals. if you have strong home equity, but are stretched for cash in other areas, consider a home equity loan or line of credit. with home equity loans and lines, you can leverage the equity in your home to cover a variety of expenses like home improvements, new vehicle, emergency needs, medical expenses, college tuition, etc.
recently, with a relatively low number of homes for sale, many homeowners are opting to renovate their current space instead of moving to a new one. to reflect this trend, wayne bank is waiving closing costs on heloc (line of credit) products for a limited time! unleash your creativity and renovate your home without the stresses of selling and moving.
get started today!

*promotion offered to those customers who do not currently have a heloc and have a loan to value ratio under 75%. minimum credit line of $10,000 required.variable interest rate based on credit score, adjusts monthly. primary residence only. subject to credit check and approval. limited time offer. follow along    jha icon
