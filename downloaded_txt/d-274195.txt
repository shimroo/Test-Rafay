historywhat is the michigan moose associationour roots can be traced to 1888 and the founder of the moose, dr. henry wilson, who successfully established the first lodge in louisville, kentucky. in the early years, the moose was to serve a modest goal of offering men an opportunity to gather socially, to care for one another’s needs, and to celebrate life together.the moose is about celebrating life together, serving those within our local communities, supporting children in need who deserve a second chance, and standing by our senior members as they enter their twilight years.the moose fraternity’s presence is felt in over 1,400 communities across nearly 50 states and four canadian provinces, plus great britain. as a primary mission of the moose, our members support mooseheart child city & school. mooseheart cares for children in need who deserve a second chance at life, from infants through high school. another mission of the moose is the care of senior members of the fraternity. moosehaven, located in florida, is a five-star rated retirement community completely funded by the men and women of the moose. additionally, in support of the areas in which our lodges reside, the moose organization contributes between $75 to $100 million worth of community service annually.within our local lodges, you will find a wide array of activities in which to participate both as an individual and as a family. from holiday parties, dances, sports, themed dinners and live entertainment, the moose has much to offer.
