alejandra march 2024

                    excellent 5 star resort for families, couples, newlyweds, singles. lots of activities for all ages! thanks to sandra, hetty, and joanne. yoga with anna and water aerobics 
                    with emberto are the best on the island. love this place and return often. the breakfast lunch and dinner at water's edge onsite are all very delicious. and so is lilianna, 
                    the waitress extraordinaire! there are 3 happy hours, when drinks are 2 for 1. the pool and the beach are superb. come early and come often!

                    another amazing and relaxing stay. great mental health break from reality. if i win the lottery - i am never leaving this place! the people at costa linda are amazing - of course the 
                    beach is a 12 out of 10. love that the alhambra casino and its shops (all of which are so clean and kept up) are a 4 minute walk away. the costa linda retailers; coffee shop, jeweler 
                    and market store shops on site are tops. and finally, the spa is well worth your time. oh...almost forgot great food at eagle's nest restaurant and not bad prices. lastly, when you 
                    think costa linda can't keep it up or get better- they do...

                    a great week at the costa linda. this year we did things a little different and probably enjoyed our week even more. it was just my wife and i for the first time and we decided to 
                    just stay at the resort for the week, no exploring and no taxis except for the airport and ling and sons. we went out to eat every night but at the waterâs edge, elliotiâs, pizza bobs 
                    and walked over to matthewâs and kokoa. everyday we sat on the beach and just enjoyed what aruba and the costa linda had to offer. everything at the resort was great from the front 
                    desk to housekeeping to the restaurants to the landscaping. we love the costa linda and the staff and look forward to our return.
