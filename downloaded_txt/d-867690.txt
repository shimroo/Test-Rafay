*~*~*~*~welcome*~*~**~

i'm very happy that you have found the homepage.  maybe you are interested in the breed or maybe you are looking for the proper puppy for you. maybe you already have a miniature schnauzer. you might be my relative or friend or maybe someone just gave you my link. in every case, you are warmly welcome to my website!

we are a christian family that loves schnauzers. loves the breed and sleeps with one nightly.
i breed black miniature schnauzers and sometimes have i may have a salt/pepper or a parti.  i guarantee everyone of my babies for 5 years. if you haven't got health and a breeder you can count on, it doesn't matter how beautiful or friendly a miniature schnauzer puppy is. schnauzers can have many genetic conditions that are often un-foreseen. my goal is to produce the best quality, not quantity. a high quality miniature schnauzer is the combination of the steadfast health, the character with right temperament and the look of a schnauzer.

one misconception about a mini schnauzer is that they should be small. breeders are selling these undersized schnauzers as teacups. this is not right. a undersized mini schnauzer is not a desirable characteristic that should not be passed on to offspring.
a breeder should compliment the breed standard and they should look like a schnauzer.

the mini schnauzer was originally bred in germany as a working dog, the miniature schnauzer is a breed known for its fearlessness as well as its fitness. facing tasks in both sport and as a watch dog, the schnauzer is versatile breed that responds no matter what the calling may be. today in the u.s., most schnauzers have taken on the role of companion, and just like their ancestors, they excel in their purpose. they are a very tough and sturdy dog which makes them wonderful for children. 

because the miniature schnauzer was originally used as a working dog, its appearance should be strong and stocky, but not overweight.

the miniature schnauzer was bred to work at many types of jobs. many of the characteristics that were highly desirable for work still remain today. they are fearless guard dogs with a keen sense of alertness and superior level of fitness.
although no longer employed solely as working dogs, miniature schnauzers are a unique breed that has taken the role of a wonderful family companion.

here you have a good chance to get to know my breeding principles, my health testing, beloved dogs and other activity. if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail me for quickest response at schnauzersoftaylor@hotmail.com



****please note that schnauzers of taylor reserves the right to first pick in any litter regardless of deposits.

about us






purchasing a puppy is a long term commitment. schnauzers of taylor knows that you may have a lot of questions that need answering. this list is by no means meant to be complete, but maybe will give you ideas for your own questions or maybe answers to ones you already have.
about us:
it’s not the income or is it financially lucrative to raise pups, it’s actually very expensive to raise a litter properly. we breed a few litters every year with a holistic approuch. we usually operate in the red; it’s just a great big hobby. i have many times wanted to stop, as it can also be heart breaking. puppies get sick, and despite vaccinations and all the best veterinarian care, they can die. moms may have problems whelping, low calcium and caesarians are necessary, all kinds of things can go wrong when you take care of live animals. but there are so many wonderful people who love their dogs, more than anything in their lives. these dogs provide companionship to sick children, the elderly, the lonely. they give joy and excitement to young people and adults who enter them in dog shows, trials and train them. many of our pups are trained and are used with children and sick people in hospitals and retirement centers. there is no end to how much love, pleasure, excitement and plain old companionship these dogs can offer. so, as long as i can help to provide joy to any family, i will continue to breed the best pet possible and educate the puppy buyer how to feed, raise and train his new pup.

about our lines:
my lines were picked for temperament and health. we specialize in companion pets only. what i want is for anyone to be able to own a beautiful, healthy mini schnauzer as a pet (homes must be approved). our mini schnauzers are in the akc standard of a mini. mini's are 12x12 to 14x14 (measured from shoulder to start of tail). we can not guarantee size and color but know that our pups will be healthy and lovable. we will have classic colors with our newest parti for some variation. our schnauzers are not hyperactive but can be protective. they do not bite but do bark when appropriate. the lines are clean from knee or eye problems (cerf certified. yes, my lines do have grand champions in them but that does guarantee a good pet. when i researched my parents i wanted good, long, and sound lines without health issues. we do regular blood test on our dogs, dna testing and all pups are vet checked at 3 days, 3 1/2 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks. our dogs are played with and walked usually every other day. the dogs live in our house, outside and are a part of our family. we do not have kennels because we do not have many dogs in our home. mentally and physically the lines are excellent. these pups are not to be sold as show quality but are perfect enough to be trained.



about the fur babies:
all puppies will have been de-wormed at 1,2,4,6 and 8 weeks and raised in our in home nursery. we also use preventative at 2,4,6 and 8 weeks to prevent coccidia. puppies are started on a "super dog" program on day 3 to day 16. this is a neuro stimulation that helps build stronger puppies and smarter adults. we proudly have been using this program for over 5 years where many breeders are just beginning. shots are given at 6 weeks and we recommend titers for next series from you vet. tails and dewclaws are docked (we will leave tails intact but puppy must have deposit paid in full by their 3 day old birthday). ears are always left natural. schnauzers of taylor does not advocate the cropping of ears. most vets will not do puppies until 4 months of age and therefore most puppies sold with ears done are being done by the breeders themselves. they either do not stand right or fall early in life. the puppies are raised in our puppy nursery just located off our living room that is temp controlled. they are played with, cuddled, dressed up in doll clothes and occasionally are slept with. sorry, but we can not be responsible for spoiling your new fur baby. a 5 yr year health guarantee is available for such health problems that can be unseen and would prevent a long healthy life with you (genetic defects).  all puppies will receive a new puppy packet. we also can include lots of bonus material, blankie, special toy and litter box training and me......a breeder who cares about my puppies for a lifetime.
pups are raised on fresh fruits, meat and vegis upon weaning and a high quality kibble.


schnauzers of taylor also request that our dogs never be placed in a dog pound or shelter. if for some reason you can not keep them, we need to know. we will assist in placement or help with approval of new home. our babies are an important part of our family and place them with them becoming the same with yours.we have a be-back open door policy and they are always welcome back to our home.


we will do everything we can to try and reduce any risk that could cause un-forseen health issues in your new puppy. just as with children, there are no guarantees as to a perfect and healthy life. we can only try and predict a new puppies health based on past litters. sadly, sometimes that doesn't always work but i will guarantee that i will be a breeder that will stand by my guarantee and help you obtain a new puppy if the time should ever arise. 



my first schnauzer pepper was such a joy and blessing for me in my teenage years. i don't think i would of survived them without him. pepper was bought from a pet store and i remember my parents pulling every last penny they had to buy me this $300 dollar puppy. little did we know how in love we would be with the schnauzer breed after that. pepper lived to be 14 yrs old. 



local pick up only:  we want to meet each of our parents face to face so we welcome visits. if you are in another state, a option is for you is to fly into austin and return your miniature schnauzer puppy with you in the plane's cabin. schnauzer puppies are small and can ride in a carrier that fits under your seat. there is a $75 service fee, which covers my expense for the trip to the airport to deliver the pup to you. we also have lots of people drive to our home to pick up their schnauzer puppies from other texas cities such as dallas, ft. worth, plano and corpus christi, and also from surrounding states such as alabama, georgia, mississippi, oklahoma, louisiana, and arkansas. 





deposits and visits:
before birth:
we do not just allow home visits without a approved questionnaire and vet reference. this is for our safety and our dogs safety. 
at birth:
a deposit of $400 to hold your puppy at time of birth and finial payment at pick up. you are welcome to come and visit when your puppy 6 weeks old. in the event that something un-forseen happens here i will gladly refund your deposit. by placing a deposit on your puppy you and i are agreeing upon the contract and health guarantee.
if puppy is 6 weeks or older you will be required to purchase in full. if you want the puppy's tail left intact you will be required to pay the full balance for the puppy before their 3 day old birthday. this will require you to have first pick. 



we hope that we can help you find that special new family member. they are ours for such a short time but yours for a lifetime......

waitlist and deposits***










before birth wait list


by being placed on our waitlist you are agreeing to wait for one of our special babies in any future litter. litter wait times can be up to 8-12 months. we will not take a deposit until we have a puppy in hand for you. you will be asked to fill out our pre-questionnaire and you will be contacted in the order of receiving. 







after birth








once your puppy is born then a $500 deposit is required. you must also be approved with a vet reference before a deposit request will be sent.

puppy pick day will be offered at 6 weeks of age. we will offer a  facetime appointment. 

we will make recommendations as to which puppy would be the best fit based on our observation. 


because we are so confident in the way we hand raise our puppies that we stand behind them 100% and know you will be just thrilled with your baby.





***deposits/payments are non-refundable. 

once you place a deposit, i stop advertising for that puppy. it takes me a lot of time to relist and resale a older puppy. some things happen that are unforeseen and beyond our control. if you have placed a deposit on a puppy and the puppy dies, you may choose another puppy if available or i will refund your deposit.....these are things of nature that happen beyond our control.




final balance


final balance is due by 6 weeks. checks can be accepted but need to clear before pick up date. (there is a $25 returned check fee)

pickup date will be set by me when i feel that puppies are ready to leave. if a puppy 

stays with me longer due to you not being able to pickup a $30 fee per day will be added and must be paid upon pick up (this will be enforced).  your puppy is welcome to stay and complete 1-2 weeks of puppy boot camp if you choose. 

if you fail to pick up your puppy any money paid will not be refunded.


i will not hold a puppy without a deposit. i will not hold a puppy for you to decide to purchase without a deposit. pups are sold to approved homes on a first come first serve basis. thank you for understanding our rules. because our waitlist are long please make sure you are prepared for a puppy before contacting me and placing a deposit.







visiting us




what is your visitor's policy? the health of our dogs and puppies is important to us so we take every precaution to protect them. 


unfortunately young puppies don’t have fully developed immune systems and are susceptible to life threatening illnesses, including parvo.



*parvo and distemper is horrible this year!!!*







when diseases like parvo strike, they can kill a whole litter in a matter of hours. disease germs can be carried on people’s clothing and shoes and even your car tires.


for this reason, we ask that you “visit” us online rather than in person, so that you may safely see our dogs and watch our puppies grow. i just can not take the risk of losing my litters and take this very seriously.

we do photograph our puppies regularly, and post the photos on facebook or send them by email.  

we love to facetime and can show you your baby anytime.

pictures are taken at birth, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks to the people on our reserve list with little updates on how puppies are doing. sometimes we share a sweet story or two about them.




 at pick up you will be invited to our home. when you come that day to pick up your puppy we ask that you do not visit other litters on the same day, or go places where there may have been dogs who you don’t know (pet stores, parks, rest areas, vet clinics, etc). we also ask that you remove your shoes before entering our home and wear clean clothing. we will ask that you use hand sanitizer and remove your shoes. if there is more than one puppy for you to choose from we will facetime so this may happen. 







the positive side is that you can be assured that when your puppy is born here, we will do everything possible to minimize his/her exposure to deadly diseases. 

all sales transactions are done face to face and in my home; puppies are no longer allowed to be shipped. 

please note that the support never stops here. we are more than willing to answer any questions at any time regarding your dog. please never hesitate to call or email. and we would love to get updates and pictures of your puppy with their new family! 



thank you for helping us protect the health of our puppies. 



i guarantee that you will be completely satisfied with your new puppy at pick up 100%, if not i will gladly give you your deposit back before the puppy leaves. 



refunds

occasionally circumstances are such that a puppy does not work out in his or her new home for various different reasons or maybe later on circumstances arise where the person can no longer care for their dog, in these or other similar situations we are more than happy to take the puppy or dog back until a new home can be found, but we do not offer exchanges or refunds. 











************************










schnauzers of taylor reserves the right to have first pick on any litters.





************************shipping options********

we do not ship our babies. we will gladly meet you at austin bergstrom  airport for a $75 fee.

*~*~puppy boot camp*~*~










do you have or want a puppy but don’t have the time or knowledge to start to   train them?



have a puppy who needs training?


if you think you’ll have the time and the environment to get them 
through puppyhood successfully then i recommend you take them home at 8 
weeks. if you’re afraid you’re not going to have the time or the skills 
to do it then we recommend basic training and 
socialization here. it’s well worth it..


this is a great program for new and first time puppy owners who have a new 
puppy at home but don’t have the experience or the extra time it takes to 
properly start to train and socialize a new puppy. at schnauzers of taylor 
 “puppy boot camp” your new puppy will get a start on what they  need 
during this very important stage of development. puppy socialization start, potty 
training start,  introduction to the leash, car rides, strangers, 
little kids, teenagers, big scary men, loud noises, other dogs, packs of dogs, 
house rules as well as an introduction to hearing the very  basics like sit, down, back, leave 
it etc.

we offer 1 or 3 spots in each one of our litters for our 1-4 week puppy training program to our puppies only.  this program includes 
potty training and very basic obedience and more importantly extensive socialization. 
after all you can easily teach a 1 year old dog with limited training to go 
outside but you can not so easily socialize them to like kids or car rides if 
they’ve had little to no experience with these things as puppies. early 
socialization is key to a happy, healthy family dog. ( 


early socialization not only helps to build up their confidence but it helps 
to eliminate the chances of phobias and even aggression developing as adults. 
the most common cause of unprovoked dog aggression is the lack of proper early 
socialization during the most crucial time of a dogs life.. the first 3 
months of age.


window of opportunity


puppies are most accepting of new experiences between 3 and 12 weeks old. 
after that age, they become much more cautious of anything they haven’t  yet 
encountered. from about 12 to 18 weeks old the opportunity to easily socialize 
the puppy ends-and with each passing week it becomes harder to get a young dog 
to accept and enjoy something that he’s initially wary of. after 18 weeks old, 
it’s extremely difficult, and sometimes impossible, to teach a dog to 
like something new, or help him become comfortable with something he 
finds frightening.




we use dr. sophia yin’s socialization  in our program in order to make sure that 
your puppy is introduced to all kinds of new experiences in a positive way. at 
the end of the program we provide you with a printout of all the new exposures 
we introduced them to and how they reacted to them, this is meant to help you to 
learn what your puppy might need to work on more in their future. 
all 
puppies are different.


perhaps surprisingly, failure to properly expose a young puppy to certain 
situations or types of people during this brief period can result in his being 
forever fearful of them as an adult. early socialization—or the lack of it—is a 
vital determinant of a dog’s lifelong behaviors. without proper socialization, 
it is unlikely that a pup will become the adult dog he could have been, whether 
as a competitor in canine events or as a happy, well-adjusted family pet.


“basically, an adult dog’s temperament and behavior habits, both good and 
bad, are shaped during puppyhood—very early puppyhood,” says veterinarian 
and leading animal behaviorist dr. 
ian dunbar, author of before & after getting your puppy. 
further, dunbar notes that behavior issues are the number-one cause of dogs 
being relinquished to shelters.


if you have a new puppy but not the time.. then you should sign them up for 
some sort of puppy training asap or puppy play dates with all kinds of different 
people and dogs.. do it either with us or with another program either way… just 
do it. as a dog lover and dog breeder i can not express the importance of 
this..it really is worth the investment in the long run. picking the perfect 
puppy is just step one.

if you have a new puppy in need of training and 
socialization..


in regards to training we begin the sit, down and leave it commands 
as well as basic puppy manners in our home and family 
atmosphere. 

we can not guarantee at what level of training your puppy will leave here but we do begin the training process for you. the older pups get the easier they retain what they learn.



basic puppy boot camp is either 1 or 2 weeks which includes basic crate training, socialization and head start potty training. $250 per weekmax training is for 4 weeks of crate training, house manners, socialization and basic obedience training. the 4 week program costs $1000 for the full 4 weeks. puppy boot camp max is $1000 for 4 weeks of house training, socialization, vet checks and required vaccinations

we recommend insurance on your pet and for about $20.00 a month you get no cap on accident or illness coverage plus lots more. you wouldn't go without insurance and neither should your pet. accidents happen quickly or health problems that arise may make you choose between treatment or non-treatment just because of cost. bad food and over vaccination are just a few culprits also.

jelly bean update



i wanted to send a couple photos of jelly bean and a short update since she's been with us.she is a wonderful, sweet black mess and we love her! she is best friends with our 10 year old schnauzer cocoa and our children adore her. she is now fully house trained and is obsessed with food. she knows how to sit and stay and we are still working on the leash. she's little but has a big bark when she wants to. i have now groomed her myself twice and she's very well behaved with the clippers. here's a couple photos of her now that she's 6 months old. thank you, laura
