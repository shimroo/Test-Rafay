does ai innovation spell the end for credit brokers?

ai strategies for scalable, secure and compliant banking


                                                delving into effective strategies and tools for secure and compliant ai integration in banking, emphasising the importance of open-source models, the role of generative ai, the advantages of synthetic data, and the influence of regulatory frameworks.
integrating ai in banking involves more than just adopting new technologies; it requires aligning these technologies with specific banking use cases to maximise benefits and mitigate risks related to data security and compliance. open-source models facilitate this transformation by offering a collaborative platform for innovation and transparency, essential for building trust and ensuring the safe use of ai in banking. 
the journey from proof of concept (poc) to production in ai and machine learning is often lengthy and complex. this extended timeline highlights the challenges organisations face in integrating ai into their operations. embracing new tools and technologies and learning to utilise them effectively is crucial for overcoming these challenges and applying ai to day-to-day operations, leading to significant benefits in efficiency and innovation. 
when looking at other markets, the united states has become a hub for tech giants, focusing on fostering innovation, while regions like japan remain cautious, reflecting their unique regulatory landscapes and societal risk appetites. this diversity in regulatory approaches presents both opportunities and challenges for firms operating globally, necessitating a nuanced understanding of each market’s unique dynamics. 
this webinar report summarises the discussion of a finextra webinar, hosted with red hat, by a panel of industry experts. discover: 

    how ai is enhancing innovation, efficiency, and security; 
    synthetic data and regulatory impact; 
    what factors are holding organisations back from fully adoption ai-driven services; 
    balancing innovation and regulation; 
    and more.

impact study

are you ready for cbpr+? accelerating modernisation and efficiency through iso 20022


                                                challenges and strategies for financial messaging professionals to be cbpr+ compliant by november 2025. 
financial institutions’ iso 20022 for cbpr+ migration timelines vary enormously, yet the deadline is the same for all financial institutions – whether they have fully adopted iso 20022 or are yet to make significant progress. by november 2025, iso 20022 will become the sole globally recognised standard for interbank cross-border payments, and the new mx messaging format will fully replace the old mt messaging format. 
concerningly, adoption has not picked up as significantly since the co-existence period began in november 2023. in january 2024, the iso 20022 adoption rate of the top 175 financial institutions stood at 19%. by december 2024, this number had grown to 32.9%. it’s clear that institutions need to significantly accelerate their migration efforts over the next few months – or risk the consequences of non-compliance. 
iso 20022 is not just a compliance update – the data-rich format enables organisations to enhance their analytical capabilities, improve their service offering, improve straight-through processing, strengthen anti-money laundering
and compliance efforts, and more. 
this impact study explores readiness for the impending iso 20022 for cbpr+ deadline and features commentary from experts at finastra and visa. it answers: 

    what needs to happen between today and november? 
    what are the main challenges institutions have been facing? 
    how can they streamline successful strategies to hit compliance by november and beyond? 
    what happens in november 2025 for organisations that have not made the deadline? 

 
join the finextra webinar, 'the iso 20022 for cbpr+ deadline is looming: are financial organisations prepared?', hosted with finastra, to learn more.

bank legacy transformation: exploring the solutions


                                                where do banks stand with legacy transformation today? what are the market factors and changing consumer demands that make transformation increasingly crucial?
legacy transformation is not a new challenge for banks. however, as technology capability continues to advance, along with it the potential for innovation and new business models serving a digital customer base, the pressure of no longer being constrained by legacy infrastructure intensifies.
despite being the central nervous system for banks’ operations for decades serving a business purpose, legacy systems have become inadequate, and those trained to use them may lack the skills needed to meet sophisticated demands
for real-time and seamless experiences.
here’s how banks can decouple their systems from each other to evolve and grow, untangle technology challenges to drive digitisation, and invest in technology and employees to ensure obstacles to rapid and gradual modernisation are removed.
this impact study, produced in association with veritran, will:

    consider frameworks that prioritise initiatives based on their impact;
    explore specific recommendations for each of these challenges;
    propose strategies on how to integrate systems that will address data silos;
    highlight clear roi examples, efficiency gains, and enhanced customer outcomes; and
    emphasise that there is no need for legacy system abandonment and modernisation can be conducted gradually without disruption.
