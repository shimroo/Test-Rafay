i have tried to rebuild all content onto a fully functional wordpress site in an orderly fashion, trying to keep the feel of the original website to the extent possible while modernizing it. i was working with brother johnny over the last several years trying to “fix” his old website, but apparently there were many compatibility problems. i have consolidated the messages in a sermon manager ensuring functionality. for videos i intend to use a first amendment free speech platform (rumble) to make sure that some of his controversial content does not get banned, and ensure the historic preaching will be available to future generations.. 
on 08/31/22 i have completed converting over all the content that was still available. i have the downloaded content from his original websites, and will see if there are additional messages or content that was lost or abandoned. you can contact me (missionary bob hoffman) by using the contact form.

homeland security high alert!
thank you for visiting this site. with urgency i say to our preachers and to our churches that we need some homeland security, as we have been invaded with this purpose-driven gospel. this threat to old time religion is at high alert. we need some “john the baptist” preachers that have their minds on the homeland: the church home, the family home, and the homeland that we are going to soon lose….
our churches are in competition to see how many missionaries they can send abroad. but, it’s our homeland here in our country, that if we don’t get some fired-up preaching, believe me, you will have to stand alone. so, you better count the cost now!
this web site is not for sissies. the preachers that you will hear on this site will separate you from the limp-wristed preachers of our day…. so, if you think the church is at high threat level and that the threats are too many to silence old time sin-hating, hell-raising, devil-hating, sheep-loving, and wolf-killing preaching, then you’re at the right place to have your ministry changed…. because, the closer to the light you get, the more heat you will feel; not from the world, but from the brethren.

if jesus had preached the same message that most preachers preach today, he would never have been crucified.


most preachers have for their second vehicle a u-haul truck and has more road maps than sermons and his nickname is “hot wheels”.

your servant, brother johnny, b.a.d.f.
