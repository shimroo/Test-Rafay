welcome to my place on the
web. virtually everything here comes with source code and at least a
passing description. nothing is guaranteed to work for you. i have
enough trouble just getting things to work for me. the most redeeming
feature is that it's all free (and worth every penny!).

people named eric phelps


scripting languages
how to write a simple plain text file that can leverage what's built
in to windows to solve real-world problems.






win9x batch
programs 
the beauty of doing things with batch is the
simplicity of the limited command set. there are few enough
commands that anybody can learn it. the challenge is in using
these limited commands to accomplish anything useful!
windows
scripting 
it's way better than batch, it's standard with windows 98 and
newer, it's free for win95 and nt4, and unlike batch, it works the same
(for the most part!) across all windows platforms.





real programs
when i had no other way to solve a problem, i wrote these. they
worked on my computer. if they work on yours, you're welcome to them.







   bar codes
i needed some bar codes with text below them. i couldn't find any free
ones, so i created my own. then i released them all to the public
domain. better than free!
 
commtool

i kept locking up my serial ports and modem while writing comm
programs.
i wrote this to forcibly take control of ports opened by the win16 api
so i wouldn't keep having to reboot. the coolest thing is that it can
change
port settings while another program is using that port (without
knocking
the other program off!).  

ffind

i used to be a big bbs guy. i wrote this to search bbs file
descriptions,
but i've found it does great at searching data dumps from our
communications
analyzers too!  

mappoint
asp 
sample code showing how to use mappoint 2001 or 2000 as a cgi or with
asp. you should already know how to do database operations before you
try
this code out. 

pong

sure, pong for excel 97. the little ball bounces around your
spreadsheet
and you chase it with your paddle. add it to any spreadsheet.
demonstrates
"callbacks" under vba. this will not work under any other version of
excel.  

probeme!

run a unique port probe on your own computer to see what winsock ports
are in use and which are available. 

q193998

a way to read binary files if you don't have ado. and sample code
showing how to do it if you do have ado! 

schedule

automatically launch programs, scripts, or documents whenever you want.
no shareware nagging, no task bar clutter. any combination of day,
date,
month, etc.. how many other schedulers can launch a program every
friday
the 13th? 
setini

a little utility i wrote to modify windows ini files from dos before
windows comes up. it really cut down on the complaining windows did
when
the network wasn't there or some other fool problem.  

shutdown

do you need to shut windows down, log off, or reboot under program
control? and have it happen either as a screensaver or as a scheduled
task?
here is my solution. 

tnef 
i get stuck receiving file attachments from outlook users who don't
know how to turn off the "application/ms-tnef" file encoding. so i
wrote
this to help me pull files out of the otherwise useless mess that
"ms-tnef"
is. 

webget

i needed a scheduled batch file to pull a file off the web each night.
it should have been simple. but it was a secure web server. login
required.
so i wrote webget (basically a wrapper for msinet.ocx) to allow me to
get whatever
i wanted. you can use it from a batch file or automate it from vba or
the
windows scripting host.

 


commlink

i needed to hack a proprietary communications protocol, so i wrote
this. if you have two serial ports and have access to the target
computer's
rs232 line, you can grab and analyze all the data. there are better
ways
to do this now, but they weren't around when i wrote this...
crlf

i got tired of being on the losing end of the text differences between
the unix, dos, and macintosh operating systems. i wrote a couple of
utilities
so i could convert from anything to anything. 

headers

i was writing a cgi program and was getting nowhere fast. the problem
seemed to be in my headers, but i had no way of looking at them or
comparing
them with known good headers. now i do! now i can check out the
otherwise
hidden headers in any web page or cgi i want. 

nofonts

have you ever used excel to create an html table? did you ever wonder
why it was so big and took forever to load? this program removes all
the
font info from an html table, reducing it's size to about 25% of what
it
was. 

pop3

retrieve your email automatically. or delete spam. or kill
modem-choking
big messages without downloading them. run it standalone, from a dos
batch
file, from windows scripting or from vba. the really cool thing is that
you can read messages in your normal mail program or read the same
message
in several different mail programs at the same time.
filecap
/ prn2pbm 
i work with equipment which can print to a serial printer. but i have
no serial printer. with the filecap program and a null modem, i can
capture
the output from my equipment into a "prn" file. with the prn2pbm
program,
i can convert the prn file into a usable graphics file. 

setup

not a very original name, but it's a very simple program. it just
installs
all palm "pdb" and "prc" files that happen to be sitting in the same
directory. 

slideshow

not just a slide show, it shows you several different ways you can
build a self-running slide show yourself. handy to know when building
training
modules for your intranet. the goal here is to make things so the user
doesn't have to have to have any special software and you don't have to
have any special server. 

uncheck

after a major crash, i found myself looking at lots of "file0001.chk"
type files. after hours of trying to identify each one, i wrote this to
automate the process. it copies chk files into whatever type they
really
are. 

word
search & replace 
we had a zillion word documents that needed several phrases and words
replaced. word 97 vba automated the whole thing.
 







security  
tips on how to get your pc secure and keep it that way. no, you can't
just buy a computer and use it on the internet.


about me  
every personal page i know of has a link to a mind-numbing collection
of pictures and ramblings about the poor
lifeless nerd who created the web page. why should i be different?

fediverse
  because i gave up on facebook.
favorites  
not my bookmarks, but a collection of urls that are either interesting
or useful. interesting or useful to me. not to you. so there.

world's
smallest political quiz   you know what party you're
registered to vote in, but do you really fit in there? take this
ten question quiz and you might be surprised. afterwards, check 
xkcd out for a laugh.
