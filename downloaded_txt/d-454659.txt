about the skatepark – kona since 77′
kona skatepark was built in jacksonville, florida usa in the late 70’s, skaters from across the nation made the trek to the sprawling concrete mecca and helped shaped skateboarding to the way it is today. since 1977 kona skatepark has been one of the most iconic skateboarding parks in the world, and you can experience it in jacksonville’s arlington neighborhood. kona has survived three economic recessions and all the ups and downs of the action sports industry. that has made it the “longest surviving privately owned skatepark” in the world via guinness book of world records. kona has been home to a lot of “firsts” and groundbreaking moments like the invention of the modern “vert” ramp, which has probably impacted skateboarding the most.
in 1979, the ramos family with the support of the community reopened the park out of bankruptcy and they dedicated to “the youth of jacksonville.” the skatepark features concrete hills and a “snake run,” where guests can take a seemingly infinite number of paths. it’s even recreated in a level of tony hawk’s pro skater 4 game. from the thriving skateboard community, spirit and culture, more than 20 professional skateboarders have come out of jacksonville, fl in the past 40 years. when you come to a place like this you’re going to have a great time, whether you’re 7 or 80, this is a place you can find that kind of a connection with. now that the skatepark is old enough, people can look back and pick out those impactful moments. though it’s impossible to simply pick one moment that is above all the rest – kona skatepark is a big part of skateboarding history and continues to create more of those moments each year.
