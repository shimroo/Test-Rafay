what is a civil rights violation?

civil rights violations include everything from police misconduct and wrongful death to sexual assault and civil rights claims against government entities. this field of law often overlaps with personal injury and criminal defense.
examples of civil rights violations:

 in-custody deaths. in the united states, in-custody deaths are a far-too-common example of a civil rights violation. this is where a person who has been charged with a crime is fatally mistreated or neglected while in police custody.
 housing discrimination. a landlord refusing a tenant housing because of their race or religion is another example of a civil rights violation that would warrant a lawsuit.
 workplace harassment. sexual assault or harassment by an employer or superior is another common example of a civil rights violation. 
 physical assault. physical attacks attributed to a person’s race, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion constitute civil rights violations.

jl										

top-rate & trustworthyâ¦ hands down, tim scott is the gold standard in criminal legal
defense,â a praise that i do not give lightly as a fellow practicing criminal defense attorney.â 
multiple attorneys i respected referred me to tim, whom they would trust if their own family
needed criminal legal assistance.â after observing his skill level, work ethic, and genuine care for
our family, i can say without reservation that tim should be the first person you call if you need
legal help.										









mh										

the best exceptional trial lawyer in americaâ¦ you both went beyond being professional skilled attorneys and you made me feel like you invested personally in me and treated me and my family as friendsâ¦ you truly care about our family and what we are going through.
although both of you are fierce contender in the courtroom, your calm and humble manner, helps to put us at ease. both of you are the best exceptional trial attorneys, and kind and gracious.										









royce & family										

over $1 million settlement with compassion & decencyâ¦ they controlled everything from the go time when we endorsed our case to them. assuring us not to worry about the case and concentrate on my wife and familyâs recovery. atty. tim responded very promptly on our inquiries even on his personal / vacation time and never leaves us hanging in the air. he listen to everything we said and answered with full of information and optionsâ¦ the best there is.. we cannot thank them more especially with their compassion, generosity, excellent services, professionalism and very big help.										









carlos										

i met marcus years ago. i can undoubtedly say that he is the reason i was able to become who i am today. not only did he help with my case, but he showed me much more than any lawyer before. he actually cares. i was facing charges for some wrong decisions i made in the past, but thanks to him i was able to leave that in the past and move forward to better myself. he stands out from the rest by communicating with you and treating you as a person not a criminal. he will fight till the very end for what is right not what is easy. iâm telling you.. this is the lawyer you need.										









jon										

my name is jon p. in october of 2019 i was arrested with over 100 lbs of narcotics at the mexican border i have more than 5 felony convictions and the judge would not set bail because of fta and preponderance of evidence. my sentencing guidelines are 30 years to life six months later i was released on $5000 everything has gone way above expectations for me. i thank my lucky stars to have dedicated fighter marcus bourassa representing me. i would not want any other lawyer.										









mayra										

highly knowledgeable and well respected attorney! mr. scott helped my family at a very scary time. his legal background, knowledge of the federal system and the local representatives gave my family a much needed peace of mind. our circumstances required a person who had federal, criminal and military understanding, he fit all those categories and i highly recommend him.
