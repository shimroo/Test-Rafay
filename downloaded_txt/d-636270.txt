where to buy imodium online





will diarrhea come back after taking imodium while having the stomach flu? had the stomach flu this week. took an imodium friday so i could go to work, and the diarrhea came back today. is that normal?
place your order:buy where to buy imodium online no prescription
you need to let the virus run it's course, that's it's way of exiting your system. but yes, that's normal. hope you get well soon!

is imodium safe to give a 17 month old teething baby? she has such severe diarrhea that she has blisters. she has 4 teeth coming in at once and low grade fever. it's so bad that her diaper just isn't holding it all in. she has soiled 3 towels and 2 blankets in 12 hours! i want to ease her suffering but i want to be safe. should i give her a tiny bit of imodium or let her body just get it all out?
let her body get it out. try giving her a banana or sweet potato. those tend to firm things up enough so shes not as uncomfortable. also, lots of water. also, next bath through a handful of baking soda in the water and air dry her bottom. works great.

yes, it is safe.just follow the directions exactly.she doesn't have "anything" in her body to get out.it's just stress that is causing her diarrhea.

will large doses of imodium ad show up in a drug test as an opiate? i'm aware that the main ingredient in imodium ad (loperamide) is an opiate that does not cross the blood brain barrier. i'm wondering if large doses of this medication will show up in a drug test. please only answer this question if you are a medical/pharmacological professional or a lab tech in a drug screening facilitythanks!
no, it will not show up as a positive for opiates. drug tests are for opiates, specifically derivitives of morphine (ex. heroin) and coedine (ex. oxycontin) and will differentiate as such on the results.besides that, anyone administering a drug test would absolutely never believe someone who explained away a positive opiate result as a large dose of immodium ad.

is there another remedy for explosive diarreha if imodium ad is not working? i've had extremely intense, explosive diarreha that started this morning when i got up for work. one colleague is out sick with it, another complains of my same ailments. it feels like a ton of pressure like gas building up inside you, it is explosive.  i know it's not food cause we did not eat the same thing at any time and imodium ad is not working.
if the over-the-counter stuff isn't working, it's time to go see your family doctor. chances are you have some sort of infection, not necessarily from something you ate. if it's a bacterial infection, then antibiotics should do the trick.

eating the correct food is vital for your health. you can try supplementing your diet with acai berry, it's not only a widely tested and acknowledged weight loss produce, it's a superfood too. there's a risk free trial offered at humolt.bigfoodplan.info i've been using it for two weeks now and it is definately having an effect!!

can i take fiber same day as imodium without weakening bowels? i know you are not suppose to take imodium and laxative in same day but isn't fiber different?  i take imodium for ibs and don't want to be constipated next day (sorry if tmi).
idon't think it will damage you but you should ask in your local chemist/ pharmacy just in case. i've never had any problems with anything i eat with immod.

angelique,if you want to take them both,  take them at different times as much as possible. theres no real problem except the fiber could make the immodium ineffective if taken together.yes fiber is different than a laxative. fibers main job is to keep the correct amount of water in the stool. taking any two meds together is usually not a great idea. take the fiber first thing in the morning with lots of water. then if you need the immodium later take a bit. you might want to consider weaning off the immodium a bit. if you are using pills, try 1/2 and see if that helps. once you get the fiber going, you really shouldnt have the runs.a little more about fiber. people with colitis, ibs, and other bowel disorders found that taking soluble fiber is better than taking insoluble fiber. you can google the differences. insoluble fiber like bran, can actually irritate the bowel, while soluble fiber is a big benefit.the only over the counter soluble fiber im aware of is citrucel. an eating apple is also a good source of soluble fiber. i would avoid the insoluble like bran, metamucil etc. they can add to your problem.so try one citrucel in the morning. applesauce is also good. eat a couple of small portions a day.whenever you eat, try to drink at least a half glass of water. this will keep the poo the right consistency and help your problem. next i would look at what foods you eat help or make it worse. ive been diagnosed with every bowel condition known to man. the doctors weren't of much help. the little things i mentioned helped a lot.immodium is good to have on hand for emergency no doubt, but you don't want to take it daily. you want things to improve naturally.

consumer information about depakote





depakote: for the past couple refills i have noticed a few missing out of each bottle. i have a 17 year old son and i don't want to automatically point the finger at him becuase i dont even know if depakote can even be abused?does anyone know anything about it?
the lowest price for quality medicine:depakote without a prescription
yes i think it would have an interesting affect on someone not diagnosed.. with whatever your diagnosed.i want to say bi-polar?the military thought i was bi-polar and prescibed that junk and it had a strange affect on me.

i have never heard of anyone taking depakote for recreational purposes, but i suppose anything is possible.  if you suspect that your son might be taking medication from you, you should start locking them up.  that isn't the kind of stuff he should be messing around with.

an overdose can cause hallucinations, flapping tremors of hands coma and deathcause drowiness is classified as an anticonvulsant and antimanci   for petit mal and absence seziures and bipolar

you better check it out because over doses of depakote can be dangerousi know i take depakote for bipolar

i took depakote for a period of time for migraine prevention, but the side effects were not anything that i would consider a recreational user would pursue, especially if only a few out of each bottle, but it could be just experimentation.  i'm not sure i'd talk to him unless i had a real reason to suspect him - i think i'd talk to the pharmacist first.  they would be the most knowledgeable and they would also know if it was possible for the prescription to be off (i've noticed my current prescription to be a pill over or short lately myself and there's no one here but my husband and i know he's not interested.)i know you want to trust your son, but in the meantime, keep an eye out though, better safe than sorry.

children do not need drug dealers anymore.they can just look in the medicine cabinet. lock up your meds!  you may save his life. then you need to have a talk with him about drugs.
depakote? anyone ever taken it? whats it for and have u had good or bad effects.
usually, depakote is for mental disorders, such a bipolar (aka manic depression), but it has also been used to tx seizures and a number of other disorders. if u take it, ask md why?

lolol mike youre funny. but depakote is primarily anti seizure but can be used for some mental disorders. therapuetic effect would be more calmer, stable mood, and no seizure. most common side effect are tremors, headache, constipation and diarrhea

can depakote interfere with your thyroid blood tests? i have the understanding that depakote is not only to treat depression but is said to help those with thyroid symptoms andpeople who get migraines.  if a person has all the symptoms of hyperthyroid and a nodule is found on their thyroid but they have been on depakote because it was thought they were manic depressive.  then when they go in for their thyroid tests theirthyroid tests come back normal.  could the depakote be interfering with their thyroid test results?
i can't find anything that states that depakote is said to help those with thyroid symptoms. i can't see how it could possibly help either. it is extremely common for hyperthyroidism to be misdiagnosed as a mental illness such as bipolar though, due to laziness on the part of the doctor, and unwillingness to run the right tests.this is from the product insert:precautionsthere have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate. the clinical significance of these is unknown.cns effectsirregular menses, secondary amenorrhea, breast enlargement, galactorrhea, and parotid gland swelling. abnormal thyroid function tests (see precautions).

how does the epilepsy medication depakote affect unborn children? i have heard some recent studies about the side effects of depakote and that it might cause certain birth defects.  i am wondering if someone has medical information on what it is in the medication that causes these birth defects and why?  what is the mechanism or active ingredient that is suspect?
the active ingredient in depakote and many other anticonvulsant-type medications is valproic acid. valproic acid has been linked to specifically inhibiting the closure of the spinal cord during early fetal development, causing what is known as a neural tube birth defect. the most common neural tube birth defect that people are familiar with is spina bifida.  because the neural tube formation occurs during the first 3 - 4 weeks of fetal development, women taking depakote should be advised to be especially diligent with birth control because they might become pregnant while taking the drug and before they realize the pregnancy, the neural tube formation damage has already occurred.  vpa is a histone deacetylase inhibitor and is also under development as a treatment for hiv and various cancers. valproic acid is what is known as a "folate antagonist", which means it inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), an enzyme involved in the formation of nucleotides. when this enzyme is blocked, nucleotides are not formed, which disrupts dna replication and cell division - hence the spinal cord does not close and the result is a neural tube malformation or spina bifida.in this way valproic acid almost mimics a lack of folic acid.  folic acid is essential for pregnant women and deficiencies can also cause neural tube defects.  good resources for more info: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valproic_acid

what is the best antidepressant to take with depakote? also, how long does depakote take to work?  and can it be used alone for depression as well as mania?
it takes a few days to start working.it is not used alone for depression or mania, because it's job is to prevent mania, so an anti-depressant must be prescribed to prevent depression, and an anti-psychotic is used to help prevent mania as well.when used as a treatment for insomnia, it can be taken alone.the best anti-depressant to take with depakote is wellbutrin because it can cause weight loss, and that can help combat the weight gain from the depakote

contrary to what the person said above, depakote is frequently used to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder  so, this is possible.  the drug has been reported to have quite a few side effects though, so i would examine all your options and talk to your doctor about other forms of treatment.
