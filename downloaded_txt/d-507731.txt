						5 stars. we were celebrating my parents 60th wedding anniversary and the day of the event we realized we had no cake. i called them up and ordered a chocolate cake with white frosting and coconut. they created this specialty cake for me with only six hours notice and it was the most amazing cake we've ever had. it was so moist and delicious. if you've never been in that bakery, i would definitely recommend going. they had tons of great treats and goodies with a huge selection.					









ellen d.★★★★★  


						on november 5th, you made [a] cake for my grandson’s first birthday. i have to say that this was the most delicious cake that i’ve ever eaten. everyone at the party agreed. not only was it delicious, the edible decorations that you did were the perfect coloring that i wanted. i believe it was emily who took my order & she communicated to you perfectly as to what i wanted. she was so patient with me. she helped me with a cake in june also that was wonderful. i will happily continue purchasing my custom cakes from you, along with a lot of other delicious things in your store. thank you so much for these wonderful cakes. i look forward to my next special occasion so i can order another cake.					






beatriz a.★★★★★  


						my husband and i went here for one night to celebrate our anniversary and we so pleased. top notch hospitality, extremely clean and awesome views and grounds. there's a great restaurant and indoor pool on premises and even a 1 mile hike! with breakfast included; can't go wrong. we plan to make this a tradition.					






andrew h.★★★★★  


						so glad my wife and i chose here instead of a franchise hotel. beautiful and peaceful, amazing breakfast real buffet with service included, and the older room was very clean and felt like a cottage.					






anton d.★★★★★  


						i recently had the pleasure of photographing liz & brian's wedding at stroudsmoor country inn and i cannot recommend it highly enough!
firstly, the location is absolutely stunning - the inn is nestled in the heart of the pocono mountains, surrounded by breathtaking scenery that made for the most picturesque wedding photos. the staff at stroudsmoor went above and beyond to make sure every detail of their wedding day was perfect.
i would highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a picturesque, stress-free, and unforgettable wedding experience. 5 stars all the way!

scott w.★★★★★  


						what a wonderful and delicious place to eat! we went on a saturday, so it was the “grand buffet”. this was our first time going here, and saturday is definitely the day to go! the buffet was quite incredible. everything was so fresh and on-temp, and the staff were incredibly professional. it’s not the cheapest place around, but i would still call it an absolute value!					






anand m.★★★★★  


						hidden gem! beautiful property in a lushly wooded mountainous area. special shout out to katelyn, our hostess at breakfast for being so kind and hospitable...would definitely visit again and again.					






lisa m.★★★★★  


						we will be back!! i met my sister, niece, brother and sister in law from queens new york and upstate new york at stroudsmoor. it was a short visit only two nights but we will be back. it is a great meeting spot for all of us. front desk staff was very helpful in explaining the dining room hours, and the location of our rooms. the rooms were all next to each other. the rooms were clean and beautiful. each decorated so different. our dining experience was perfect. breakfast was included each morning and a special prime rib dinner was enjoyed on wednesday night. the staff in the dining room was attentive in every way. at checkout the front desk asked if we would like to make another reservation. we will be back. thank you for making our family get together memorable. the landscaping is well kept.					






pocono builders association★★★★★  


						i feel it important to let you know of the outstanding service the pocono builders association received on wednesday, november 8th, 2023. we had our annual builder & trade professional awards at the ridgecrest location.  i want to acknowledge ryan...not only for his professionalism but also for his ability to have the event's bigger picture always on his radar, in turn making the evening go off without a hitch.  ryan as well as maddy provided the association with the highest quality service with a smile making me feel comfortable to go to them with any questions i had. lastly, ryan and maddy are excellent ambassadors for the stroudsmoor inn, and i would be remiss if i did not bring this to your attention. have a wonderful weekend.

stroud area regional police - chris s.★★★★★  


						i am reaching out to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude for the exceptional support and service we received during our olsen christmas wish event at your magnificent venue.

for the past couple of years, we have chosen stroudsmoor country inn as the setting for our christmas wish event, and it has proven to be an excellent decision. the growth of our event required a venue that could accommodate our needs, and your establishment has exceeded our expectations in every aspect.

i want to extend special commendations to malia, who played a crucial role in in coordinating and organizing the event. she expertly handled the logistics, including the seating chart, which can be particularly challenging for an event like ours where attendance can be unpredictable. malia's professionalism and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly.

additionally, i want to express my gratitude to ryan, who was our go-to person during the event. ryan's dedication and attentiveness were truly remarkable. he not only facilitated a seamless event but also went above and beyond by introducing an ice cream station and a s'mores station, much to the delight of the children in attendance. his quick response to any additional needs, such as extra tables and chairs, contributed to the overall success of the evening.

we feel incredibly fortunate to have stroudsmoor country inn as our event host. your staff's commitment to excellence and the warm hospitality provided an unforgettable experience for the families in need that we aim to support during the christmas season.

once again, thank you for contributing to the success of our christmas wish event. your efforts have made a significant impact, and we are truly grateful for your support.
