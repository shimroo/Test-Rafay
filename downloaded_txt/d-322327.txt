how the department of sociology launches your career“the years i spent in the university of oregon were among the most transformative and fulfilling of my entire life, in large part due to the outstanding support and guidance i received from my former faculty and graduate student colleagues. since graduation, i’ve held both tenure-track faculty and director level administrative positions, and i am currently professor and head of sociology at lake michigan college—a role in which i have a direct and positive impact on my community through my teaching and scholarship. i was lucky to find my purpose in life early; all i ever aspired to be is a professor. after the years of hard work, particularly as a black and arabic, and first-generation college graduate and professional, i am now living a dream that truly started when i first stepped foot onto the university of oregon campus. the training i received in the uo sociology program, and the people i was fortunate to meet there, were instrumental in helping me to make that dream come true. go ducks!”—david martin, phd in sociology, '17
