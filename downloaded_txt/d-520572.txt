hey doc, so not sure if this is some sort of record or not, we weren’t expecting it to work right away… but we’re pregnant! thank you for your miracle work!
hello dr green and julie, we just wanted to thank you for your vasectomy reversal services. you operated on my husband in december 2018 after over 13 years from having had his vasectomy. we were blessed with a pregnancy and i just delivered a healthy baby girl. i cannot thank you enough for your amazing skills, professionalism and personalized care you gave us as well as affordable prices for your wonderful services. you are a miracle worker and we just wanted to thank you for helping us complete our family.
we added a second baby to your success stories ❤️❤️ the 2 are because of dr. greens fantastic work
wanted to send a note thanking you and dr. green. dr. green did my husband’s reversal 4 years ago. the surgery was a success but dr. green was concerned about scar tissue and when we had an analysis done we didn’t have good quantity or quality. well, i’m happy to say that after 3 years things turned around and we got pregnant! this wouldn’t have been possible without you! thank you from the bottom of our hearts for what you do! we still talk about how great it was to deal with you both. both of you were friendly and extremely accommodating. here are a few pictures of our baby boy, who is 5 months old 🙂
good afternoon!!! on october 17, 2019 my husband had the vasectomy reversal after 15 years of his vasectomy. there were no promises of him being able to have kids again. today april 16, 2020 i can let you know that i’m almost 13 weeks pregnant and i’m due october 24th, 2020. exactly one year after his surgery!!!! we are so great full of the doctor and staff. when the baby is born we would like a photo with the doctor and team if it’s possible. once again thank you very much!!!
dr. green performed my procedure 6 weeks ago and my wife just got a positive pregnancy test today. please tell him thanks and nice work!
i hope that this message finds you well.  i just wanted to update you.  we are now 33 weeks along and due soon.  we are elated that we would be meeting our princess soon.  we will send you some photos.
so thankful for you doing his surgery. 
we would just like to send thank you; to you, dr. green and all the staff at the surgical center.  my husband had the reversal in december 2018 and we got pregnant on the first attempt actually. we are elated to announce that we are 10 weeks pregnant and everything looks good so far.  thanks to dr. green and his expertise.
our experience was excellent.  everything was smooth and happened just like they told us it would happen.  dr. green is a wonderful person and a very competent professional.  great staff works for him.  after a year and 5 months of my husband’s reversal, i conceived my baby and 9 months later gave birth to a beautiful and healthy boy, a special blessing in our lives.  thank you dr. joshua green, you were amazing.
after having a vasectomy done 10 years ago and another urologist giving me a 20% chance and went so far as to tell me not to even bother to reverse it, my wife and i still had big faith that god was going to work with us. me being 42 and my wife being 33, we thought it was almost impossible but we still went for it. then dr. green did the reversal.  i thought i was going to have to wait 10 months or maybe a year and a half but my wife was already pregnant 3 months after dr. green did the reversal surgery. the baby is 100% healthy and now the baby is about to be 1 year old on june 24, 2019.  thank you lord and thank you dr. green you are the best.
it was a great experience beginning with the first phone call.  we were in between two doctors and we chose dr. green because of how soon we were able to schedule an appointment and because how great we were treated.  when you call his office, you  speak to the same person (julie) and it always feels great to be remembered by name.  aside from the great service, the surgery was a success.  highly recommenddr. green and his staff.
there are no words that could express the experiencewe had with dr. green and his lovely caring wife.  the staff at the surgery center went above and beyond our expectations as well.  from the initial inquiry onlineuntil the post op visit, this was the most amazing experience we have every had with any medical care.  highly recommend dr. green.  mond blowing experience and i know he is a perfecetionist and if he cannot fdo it, nobody can.  thanks again, dr. green.
very good expereince.  they were on top of everything with me.  julie was very helpful with any questions.  i feel my recovery was exactly as prescribed by dr. green.
i have dr. green to thank for my 2 daughters.
i saw dr. green for the first time the day before my surgery and he was thorough and explained my surgery to me.  i had a vasectomy reversal and dr. green successfully performed what i was told by others to be a very difficult surgery with a high failure rate.  my wife and i are forever thankful for the skill of dr. green.  we now have an two beautiful babies.  i would highly recommnd dr. green.
dr. green. thank you so much for making this miracle happen. 11+ years after my husbands vasectomy and you were still able to make this successful a procedure. a year after surgery and we found out we were pregnant.
dr green,
we would like to thank you again and share with you that we are currently 10weeks pregnant with 2 confirmed ultrasounds and a strong fetal heart rate. every one that has helped us through out our experience with your services has been wonderful!

r.v.hi dr. green, it’s mrs.____.  you performed my husband’s vasectomy reversal in december.  i wanted to share with you that i am 16 weeks pregnant and feeling great.  thank you for everything.  we’ll send pictures soon.
mmexcellent.  amazing.  i’ve never met a more passionate doctor.  the skill it takes for this procedure is intense.  we are so thankful for such wonderful care.  we are hopeful for the future
e.fbest physician experience ever.  the level of skill dr. green exhibits combined with the personal care and concern by not only dr. green but the staff at the surgical center exemplifies how medical care should be.  dr. green even saw me on a holiday weekend the week after surgery to ease my mind regarding some post surgical inflammation. he took his time on the initial consult to answer all of our questions and concerns in a manner that made me comfortable with the procedure i was anxious about.  he visited me in my hotel the day following the procedure as i was an out town patient. i cannot express how impressed i am with dr. green and the team he has assembled.
thanks
