take backthe classroom



at take back the classroom, we believe parents deserve the right to know what content is available to their children in public schools. to empower parents and community members, we are creating a powerful online, searchable database that exposes over 400 pornographic books found in school libraries across more than 13,000 districts in the u.s. this comprehensive tool will shine a light on the widespread issue, awakening communities to how deep the problem runs—and this is just the beginning.we not only provide knowledge, but we also offer free resources and actionable steps to help parents identify, remove, and prevent inappropriate content at the local level—just as we’ve successfully done across the nation. our database will give parents and concerned citizens the tools to advocate for their children’s safety in schools.
