welcome to the darlington golf club


not many golf clubs can boast they share the same designer as one of the world’s leading courses but that is the case at the darlington golf club. founded in 1908 and designed by dr alister mackenzie, the designer of the augusta national, home to the us masters, the 18-hole parkland course shares many similarities to the masters’ track.

huge rolling greens, lush, tree lined fairways and unforgiving semi rough challenges golfers of all abilities.

after a tiring days golf relax in our clubhouse where full bar and catering facilities are available or, weather permitting, sit on the patios and enjoy watching fellow golfers on the 1st tee or 10th green.

the clubhouse opening hours vary depending on the time of year but if you have any special requirements or would like to hold an evening function, then please do not hesitate to contact us and we will do our best to accommodate you.
