hello and welcome. here is a collection of fractal images,
grouped by theme. all thumbnails link to larger images. come
inside and have a look around ...

1: be
mine  hearts and flowers.
2: puppy dog
tails   images of childhood.
3: fractal
forest  into the woods.
4: fractal
soup  let's do lunch.
5: to
dance  music and motion.
6:
contemplation  from a quiet place.
7:
metalworks  iron, gold, and steel.
8:
multiplicity  even more images.
a variety of fractal generating programs were used to create
these images. some very good ones are ultra fractal (shareware),
which has photoshop-like layering capabilities, and two programs
by stephen c. ferguson: grafzvizion v4.2 and sterlingware
v1.7. you can find these and other programs created by him at
iterations et
flarium24. i encourage anyone to give these a try. fractals
are absolutely fascinating.
below are some ultrafractal parameters available for download,
as well as a few (a tiny few!) for sterlingware v1.7 and
grafzvizion v4.2. they are all packaged in .zip format. included
are several of the fractals in this gallery, along with a few not
shown here:
ultrafractal .upr parameters
sterlingware .loo

grafzvizion .gzv
parameters
thanks for visiting! i plan to expand and update these pages.
 i hope you'll stop by again.
