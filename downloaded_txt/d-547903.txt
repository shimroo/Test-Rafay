i have created a life where i am able to do all the things that i love the most - music, film and being able to help others through coaching. musicas a musician, i am currently the lead violinist for the trans siberian west coast tour.  my favorite music memories include touring with dee snider (twisted sister) and gnarls barkley and performing at the grammys. while i was living in los angeles, i performed regularly with american idol band, the tonight show, the ellen show and played with mary j. blige, jay-z and alanis morrisette. more about my music.coachingas a certified performance coach i work primarily with artists, musicians, presenters and creatives on how to perform to their potential and create a new reality for themselves. after a breast cancer diagnosis at age 24, i have dedicated my life to living outside my comfort zone, and i enjoy helping empower others to find their purpose and fulfill their dreams. more about my coaching. travelone of my greatest passions in life is traveling and you can see more about my trips in the travel section of this site. i have been lucky enough to travel the world as a travel host and videographer. some of my inner travel includes attending 10-day silent meditation courses. more about my travels.
