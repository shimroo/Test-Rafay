the silent video above depicts six scenes of campus: an aerial view of old dorm block among green trees and grass, with the portland skyline in the background; a birdâs eye view of eight students playing a pick-up soccer game; three students sitting in the grass, surrounded by trees; two students walking across the blue bridge over reed canyon, a watershed with a lake and lush green trees; a close-up of two hands browsing a shelf of bound theses in the thesis tower; and several small groups of students lounging on the lawn in front of old dorm block on a sunny day.
