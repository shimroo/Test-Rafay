please place your order as soon as possible, especially during busy season.


orders for items that need to be special made can not be shipped until they are ready, even if you ask for air shipping. for example, if an item takes 3 weeks to make, and you are a week away via ground shipping, it will still take 3 weeks and a day with air shipping. however we do try to bump up rush orders as much as possible, provided that it does not cause us to compromise on other orders or on quality. 



payment information for orders within usa we accept checks and/or most credit cards. for international orders, we may require more information. if paying by credit card, please do not include credit card number in email. instead include a telephone number on your email where we can call you back.
date needed? (we will try, but read note above)       
            

any other information you think we might need to process your order correctly.
