about
who we are




              we are the premier organization based on timeless principles, committed to developing and inspiring leadership, team building, and networking for young men ages 12 â 21.
            

              by epitomizing timeless values, and accepting the challenge of leadership â both of character and of action â the young men of demolay transform themselves into citizens of the highest caliber. if you can dream it, you can do it in demolay.
            

              with thousands of members worldwide, our approach is simple: give them the tools to lead, and the guidance to succeed.
            

              our success over the past one hundred years wasnât due to just sheer coincidence. our members take ownership of their demolay experience. from generating ideas, planning events, coordinating logistics, and executing their plans, each demolay chapter is responsible for defining their success. all of this is accomplished under the mentorship of trained advisors, selected from the local community, enabling each chapter to be uniquely tailored to support the interests of its members.
            






              but words are insufficient to describe demolay, it must be experienced. give it a chance and we know you will discover what we already know, demolay is the greatest youth organization in the world.

love of parents

                  select a core value to learn more, and you will see these are basic beliefs that we should all practice in our daily lives.
                









love of parents

                  our parents will be there for us through every obstacle we will ever endure during our youth. one of the great lessons of demolay is the lesson of love of parents. demolay members cherish their parents and hold family teachings close to their hearts. our members strive to repay the love and care of their parents through kindness and civility. 
                









reverence

                  an individual's religious beliefs are their own. we encourage our members to carry out their teachings while also respecting the views of others, no matter how different they may be from their own. 
                

                  no demolay will ever be disrespected or shunned due to his religious beliefs, as we are all children of the universal father.
                









courtesy

                  demolay members are taught to be kind to everyone and be courteous to everyone, no matter if they are at a demolay function or out and about in their personal life. 
                

                  a demolay is kind and courteous toward others. not only in public, but also at home and among friends.
                









friendship

                  true friendship binds our members together so they may build a lifelong brotherhood. to be a friend is one of the highest honors, but being a brother involves strong ties of loyalty and trust. 
                









fidelity

                  the order of demolay teaches faithfulness to a promise, cause, or belief, and to continually support each chapter member. 
                

                  fidelity means to be faithful and loyal to all of our obligations in life. by being faithful, our members earn the respect and trust of everyone with whom they come in contact. 
                









cleanness

                  cleanness extends beyond physical hygiene. it encompasses being purposeful with our words, careful of our actions, and respectful with our thoughts. 
                

                  we practice to keep our thoughts, deeds, and actions clean in all manners realizing that things we could say or things we do could have negative impact on other. 
                









patriotism

                  demolay encourages each member to be patriotic towards his country and mindful of those who serve to protect it. whether through service or by being an exemplary citizen.

f.a.q
frequently asked questions



what is the purpose of demolay? 

the major purposes of demolay include:
â¢ providing an opportunity for a young man to be with good friends
â¢ providing leadership training by first-hand experience
â¢ providing a young man with a balanced program of activities
â¢ helping young men become good citizens



what type of activities do you have? 


                besides the regular business meetings, the major activities of a demolay chapter can be broken down into three categories: social, civic, and athletic.
â¢ social activities range from all types of parties, to going to the movies and any fun activity the young men choose to do.
â¢ our civic activities are focused on serving the public, whether collecting items for a charity or lending assistance to the local community.
â¢ athletic activities include basketball, softball, bowling, rifle, volleyball, and just about anything else in which enough interest is shown.




is demolay a religious order? a fraternity? a secret order? 


                demolay does not recognize or advocate any particular creed or faith but teaches only a profound faith in one living and true god. (reverence is one of the seven core values).
demolay is not a greek letter fraternity and should not be confused with high school or college fraternities. while demolay international has secret signs, words, and modes of recognition, it has no secrets from the world so far as its central purposes are concerned.




who runs the chapter? 


                a demolay chapter is run by the officers and members of the chapter with advice and guidance given by the advisors. the officers consist of the members themselves with the principal officers, including the president, being elected by the membership. to help supervise, each chapter has an advisory council comprised of interested masons, senior demolays, parents and supporters. one of these council members is designated as the âchapter advisor" and is the main advisor to the chapter members. they are a friend that each member of a chapter can look to as a person that can help him with problems. the advisory council does not run the chapter; rather, they assist the officers when needed.
              



what are the requirements for membership? 


                the requirements for membership are simple. to join demolay international a young man must:
â¢ be between the ages of 12 and 21
â¢ believe in god
â¢ be of good character and reputation
â¢ apply for membership




what is the induction like? 


                the degrees of demolay are serious and very impressive. they contain no horseplay, hazing, embarrassment or ridicule.
the induction consists of two different ceremonies: the initiatory degree and the demolay degree.
the initiatory degree is a service of consecration in which you dedicate yourself to unfaltering love of god, home and country.
the demolay degree is historical and spectacular and is presented in a dramatic form. it is a portrayal of the trials and final martyrdom of the exemplar and namesake of the order, jacques demolay. this degree teaches a compelling lesson in fidelity and comradeship.
                parents are invited and encouraged to witness the induction.
              



how much does it cost and are there any dues? 


                under a life membership program, a person is required to pay only one all-inclusive induction fee. the fee is set by the chapter and you will be informed what the fee is for the chapter you are looking at joining. there are no dues required after the payment of this fee, which is paid before being inducted.
