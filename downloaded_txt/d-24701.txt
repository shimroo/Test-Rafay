build the programs


					next, we build local programs designed to offer immediate relief, short-term care and long-term growth in the areas that will best benefit the community.
				



invest in the community


					then, we offer the local programs to the local community working to continually optimize their efficacy via spiritual, physical and emotional service.
				












	 


	 


	 




the salvation army is different in every local community

				because every local community is different.
			




find your local community


	 









why the salvation army?




breadth of service


				from immediate relief, to short-term help, to long-term, sustainable change, we are dedicated to serving the physical, mental and spiritual needs of the poor, the lonely, and the lost.
			




trust


				with 82 cents of every dollar dedicated to directly supporting the needs of the community in which it was received, the salvation army is committed to stewarding every donation with integrity.
			




longevity


				since 1891, we have been working to provide sustainable solutions for the most vulnerable. we stay not just until the job is done, but long afterwards, to ensure that the healing continues.
