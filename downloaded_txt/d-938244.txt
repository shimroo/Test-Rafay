beware of criminal defense “pretenders”:  any law firm or attorney can have dm cantor’s phoenix criminal defense attorney website information re-written by artificial intelligence (ai), and then they can post it online as their own “knowledge base.”  but they cannot falsely list our jury trial complete acquittals, or board certifications as their own.  also, many attorneys claim that they “specialize” in defending criminal charges, but only a “board-certified criminal law specialist” is allowed by the state bar of arizona to use this title as their own, per the arizona board of legal specialization.


the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction
being convicted of an offense in a criminal court can have life-long consequences on a defendant, which can occur long after incarceration is over (such as while on probation, or even after being fully released from all requirements).  depending on the type of conviction, some of these collateral consequences can include sex offender terms while on probation, computer restrictions, and potentially having to register as a sex offender.
other consequences of certain types of misdemeanors, such as domestic violence criminal damage and certain felony convictions can include the revocation of professional licenses; restrictions on what type of job you may be able to get; being banned from living in dormitories, or certain apartments; having to notify employers if you are required to register as a sex offender; and a litany of other highly-restrictive and embarrassing factors.  check out the link below for a full list of collateral consequences to various criminal convictions.

the ultimate dui and criminal case defenses in arizona
1. dui/vehicular crime specific defenses
2. sex crime specific defenses
3. assault/violent crime specific defenses 
4. drug crime specific defenses 
mitigation
“mitigation” is a term that refers to anything that can potentially prevent charges from being filed, reduce the charges that are filed, or reduce the amount of punishment that is imposed on any charge that is ultimately upheld.  when representing a person for criminal allegations, we immediately begin the mitigation process in order to convince the detectives to shut down the investigation.  we will also use this to convince the prosecutor to decline filing charges, or to greatly reduce charges.  the prosecutor will look at both statutory and non-statutory mitigating factors when making their decisions.  the criminal defense team at dm cantor knows these factors inside and out, and we know how to put together a compelling “mitigation package.”
depending on the case type, the items we will use in these mitigation packages could include an accident reconstruction report; blood alcohol or drug retesting; dna analysis; independent autopsy reports; computer forensic analysis; polygraph examinations; psycho-sexual risk evaluations; and private investigator/attorney investigation into the facts alleged by an accuser.
we also include a complete history of the defendant’s background, which could include medical records, rehabilitation/substance abuse counseling records, any individual educational plan (ieps) that may have been in place during a defendant’s lifetime; and lastly, we will include a “proportionality review,” which includes similarly situated cases and how they were either “turned down” for prosecution, or greatly reduced. whether you have been charged with misdemeanor dui, domestic violence, criminal damage, etc., or if you are facing more serious felony charges, then you will need a top-rated phoenix criminal attorney to defend you. call dm cantor and speak with a highly-skilled phoenix criminal lawyer today! check out the link below to see a full list of statutory and non-statutory mitigating factors.

what we do when we represent you
when you hire dm cantor to represent you to defend allegations of criminal conduct, or actual charges for a crime, we always keep our “core purpose” in mind when we represent you: “we are here to help people navigate through the toughest times of their lives.”  when we perform our duties as a criminal defense law firm, we always keep these three principles in mind: (1) do hard work, (2) have excellent trial skills, and (3) – perhaps the most important of the three – have high touch client service. 
when we represent people in the pre-indictment/pre-charge investigation stage of their case, we will immediately bring them in to do a detailed timeline and biographical interview regarding their life, and what allegedly occurred in the incident.  all of the meetings will occur in the privacy of our office, and they will be conducted by the dm cantor pre-charge team.  this team can conduct most of the investigation work, but sometimes we will use private investigators to assist us.  we also will look into using a polygraph examination, and also potentially forensic experts who can analyze any computer devices and phones which may be helpful to the investigation.
if a person is currently charged with a felony, then we will still begin with a complete timeline interview and biographical information interview.  we will then begin putting together a mitigation package at the same time as we begin to defend the case.  any and all court dates, you will need to be with us at the charged county superior courts, or federal court,  unless we have obtained permission from the judge to allow you to travel or remain out-of-state/county.
if the judge does approve our “motion to modify conditions of release,” then you would be required to sign an affidavit after each and every court date avowing that you know of the next court date and that you will stay in contact with your dm cantor defense team.
beware:  always seek out a different law firm if the one you have chosen assigns serious felony crime cases to a single legal associate who may have never conducted a jury trial regarding the criminal offense charge they are defending.  if you truly want to win your case, then it is absolutely necessary to have at least one certified criminal law specialist amongst a team of criminal defense attorneys who are assigned to specifically handle your felony charges. 
dm cantor always assigns all three partners and certified criminal law specialists to each and every pre-indictment criminal case that we handle.  in addition, dm cantor always has a minimum of one partner and certified criminal law specialist co-assigned on every, single charged major felony or sex crimes case.
in the link below, you will find information regarding a dui or vehicular crimes case, a misdemeanor or felony criminal charge and its case progression.  this should answer 99% of your questions.


arizona criminal defense attorney faqs
what if i live in another state and i am being accused or charged in arizona?
if you have been charged or indicted for a felony in any arizona county superior court, then you will be required to appear at any and all court dates.  however, we can file a motion to modify conditions of release after the first one or two court dates, which will allow you to remain out-of-state, as long as we are appearing on your behalf.  we can then show up to all pre-trial conferences, as long as you sign an affidavit you are aware of the next court date and that you will keep in touch with us.
if you have only been accused in arizona, and not charged, then you, and are in the pre-indictment/precharge investigation stage of your case, and we can conduct all meetings via zoom or by way of telephone.  we will have you create a new email account that has the word “legal” in it, in order to have it secured by way of the attorney/client privilege.  lastly, if we need any polygraph examinations, neuropsychological evaluations, or anything of that nature, those can be conducted in your home state.
if i am charged, do i have to wear an ankle monitor?
per ars 13-3967(e)(1), the judge is required on certain felony charges to impose an electronic monitoring device “where available.”  however, we have seen situations where many judges will not impose this restriction. in addition, if your charge is in an outlying county (in other words not maricopa county), then many times they do not have electronic monitoring available, and they will not impose this condition.  the dm cantor felony criminal defense team has been highly successful at having this requirement “lifted” in various circumstances.
if i am charged, can i be around my kids or grandkids who are under 18?
if you have been accused of sexual assault of an adult (not a minor), then normally restrictions of being around your own children or grandchildren, or anyone under 18, will not be imposed.  however, if you are charged with a sexual crime against a minor, then these conditions will be imposed, forbidding you to have contact with anyone under the age of 18.  we have been very successful in filing motions to modify conditions of release to allow defendants to have contact with their own children or grandchildren who are under 18 years of age while their case is pending.
if i get charged and you get the charge dismissed, can i seal the arrest/court record?
most felony records can be sealed, however pursuant to status ars 13-900, et seq., a person cannot “set aside a judgment of guilt” (i.e., what qualifies as an “expungement” in arizona), if their conviction involves a “sexual motivation.”  in addition, most sex crime convictions cannot have their record “sealed” under arizona law.  however, if the charge is reduced down to an offense which does not require a finding of sexual motivation, and the person is not required to register as a sex offender, then it is possible to get that conviction “sealed” after five (5) years from the successful conclusion of probation.
does any other law firm in arizona have more board-certified criminal law specialists, or complete acquittals at jury trial wins, than dm cantor?
dm cantor is the only law firm in all of arizona that has 3 board-certified criminal law specialists.  we also have the most “complete jury trial acquittals, and the most dismissal/reductions for all criminal case types in the state of arizona.  if you read our “victories” section on our website, you will see we list all of these dui and criminal case results.

what to do if stopped for a dui
click here for information to prepare you if you are ever pulled over for a dui





what to do if accused of a crime in arizona
if you have a feeling that you are being accused of a crime (especially if this occurs during a phone call with the accuser), hang up immediately.  a common tactic utilized by detectives in arizona involves the “confrontation call.”  this is where the alleged victim “confronts” the accused, and attempts to get them to make admissions over the phone.  the first admission they will seek is that there was, indeed, an “incident.” they will next attempt to get the accused to “apologize for what they did.”
unfortunately, many people will apologize and say they are sorry that the other person “feels that way,” but the detectives can take this as an admission of guilt.  also, it is best practices to immediately set your social media to “private settings.”  we would also advise that you “de-friend and unfollow” your accuser and his or her friends.
in addition, do not speak with your friends or family (or your spouse – if applicable) about these allegations until you’ve had a chance to speak with us in the privacy of our office.
remember, 95% of all evidence comes out of a person’s mouth when they make statements that can be incriminating (whether intentional, or the result of being misunderstood).
beware:  avoid a criminal defense firm that does not have a single board certified specialist on their staff.  also watch out if they have an “of counsel” attorney (i.e., a attorney who has their own law firm, but “contracts themselves out” to other firms for work), and then that law firm places the “of-counsel attorney” on their staff for the mere purpose of using that attorney’s name and specialization only to attract potential clients.

lastly, call dm cantor immediately!  we will not talk about specific facts over the phone line, but we will get some general information and get you in to meet with us in-person as soon as possible.  our meeting will be in the privacy of our office, and you will meet with a minimum of one partner/board-certified criminal law specialist during your free consultation.
