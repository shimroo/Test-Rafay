“my club experience is like having a big family you never imagined to have. when i’m at the boys and girls club i feel at home because you can be an open book to everybody and nobody won’t judge you. if i had the chance to change the name, i would change it to the family club, because every time i walk inside the club, they would always check up on me and would ensure that everybody has had something to eat before they leave the club. so, do you know the real meaning of the boys and girls club? it’s a family.”zyrese | youth of the year 2024
