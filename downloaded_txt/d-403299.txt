        wonderful life

        commitment  your family will make a long-term one to your new pet

        love  your rescue will give it freely and unconditionally

cherish, 
          our humane education program, 
          offers great tips for teaching kids (and their parents) about valuing 
          pets!

take action to save their lives!     
          
each of us can make a difference to stem the tide of unwanted pets, 
          one dog at a time.     *adopt a rescue 
          or shelter dog.  
          so many wonderful pets are given up each day through no fault of their 
          own.  adopting your next companion instead of purchasing a puppy 
          helps save the life of one very deserving animal.  *keep your 
          pet safely confined and wearing identification.  
          prevent your pet from becoming lost by never allowing him to run 
          loose.  it takes a little effort to leash walk your dog, but that 
          effort is essential to prevent your pet from becoming lost.   *spay 
          and neuter your pet.    make sure your pet doesn't 
          contribute to  pet overpopulation.  children do not need to 
          experience the "wonder of birth" by having a companion animal 
          reproduce.  instead, take them to the shelter to see the many 
          animals with litters who are left homeless.   
          *make a real commitment.  before bringing a pet into your 
          home, make sure you are ready for a lifetime of responsible care and 
          dedication.        

great training tip
often our goal in training our companions is to get them to 
          "stop" doing a certain behavior, like jumping up on guests.  but 
          a more effective approach involves giving the dog an alternate 
          behavior that is more rewarding.  for example, when a visitor 
          comes to the door, ask your dog to "sit" and then give him a treat.  
          if the dog jumps up, ask your visitor to ignore him and walk away.  
          encourage your visitor to keep any greeting low key as to not overly 
          excite your dog.  each time a visitor comes, repeat the sit and 
          treat.  your dog will eventually come to associate the arrival of 
          a visitor with the treat - and will immediately initiate the "sit" 
          without your command.

great book
          every day thousands of dogs and cats across america are brought to 
          animal shelters and thousands of others are euthanized because they 
          have been deemed unadoptable or because their time is "up."  the 
          scale of this mass execution makes the problem seem distant and almost 
          impersonal.  but authors diane leigh and marilee geyer believe if 
          we could all see each one of these animals as a living, breathing 
          individual, perhaps we might really come to understand the problem and 
          work to do something about it.  in one at a time, a week in an 
          american animal shelter, the authors have documented the story of 
          some of the animals who entered a typical american shelter that week.  
          it's an astonishing achievement, and one that must be digested in 
          pieces.  the authors spent time getting to know the dogs and 
          cats, learning why they were brought to the shelter, and then 
          essentially waited to see what their fate would be.  some were 
          never claimed by owners.  litters of kittens competed with other 
          litters, equally irresistible.  the authors make the point that 
          stopping the flow of unwanted animals is the real issue that must 
          be addressed, not whether a shelter is forced to euthanize due to 
          space constraints.  their stories are riveting, often 
          heartbreaking, sometimes uplifting and will forever change the way we 
          look at our commitment to our pets.   www.novoiceunheard.org

how to adopt
here's how the schnauzer rescue process works:







              a schnauzer is picked up at a shelter or 
              turned over by an owner interested in rehoming his/her pet.  
              (note:  please contact
              
              linda@schnauzerrescue.net  if              you would like to have us find 
                a wonderful home for your schnauzer).

    each dog is checked by a veterinarian, given all shots, spayed or neutered, 
    tested for heartworms, and treated for any medical condition detected.

    our dogs then live in foster homes where they are socialized and evaluated 
    until they are adopted into a permanent home.
our dogs will be posted here and at our pet finders website
                http://www.schnauzer.petfinder.com
                as they become available for adoption. applications are 
                reviewed, reference checks are completed and applicants are 
                interviewed.  the applicant who best suits the individual 
                dog's needs is selected to adopt. 
the process can take as little as several days or as long as 
                several months (particularly if there are health issues 
                involved).  the average time from when a dog is placed in a 
                foster home until it is adopted is 2-3 weeks.
