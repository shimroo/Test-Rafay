why use jalbum?



integrity
unlike competing image sharing services, we don't lock your photos into one single place. you have full control of the management, storage and presentation of your images. furthermore, your precious metadata is managed using open standards = no lock in. host your images with us or with any web hotel you like. your galleries will work - even without us.



convenience
being a desktop software, jalbum makes it natural and convenient to manage large amounts of images on a regular basis. you shouldn't have to start by uploading your images and videos to an online service in order to pick the best ones for presentation and add captions. this is better done locally, and it works offline too!



safety
the albums generated by jalbum do no rely on server-side scripting, which ensures no harmful code can sneak into your server by these pages.



ease of use
even though we offer loads of features, making a good looking gallery is still as easy as dropping images onto jalbum and pressing one button.



diversity
competitors offer few choices for stylish presentations (typically only css variations to the same functionality). with jalbum you have a rich variety of templates / themes (we call them skins) to choose from, each offering unique functionality as well as presentation.



trust
we've been in business since 2002. to date, there are over 120 million galleries published world wide. jalbum also enjoys an extremely high user satisfaction score of 4.7/5 in trustpilot. many of users have been with us for decades.
