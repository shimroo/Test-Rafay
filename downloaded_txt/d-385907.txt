seduced by palestinian propaganda





the following op-ed by hanne nabintu herland concerns the norwegian government’s persistent soft spot for the palestinians. it was originally published in aftenposten, norway’s largest newspaper, on january 15th, 2013, and has been translated by the author.naïve checkbook diplomacyby hanne nabintu herlandtorgeir larsen, a junior minister for the norwegian labor party, admits in norway’s largest newspaper aftenposten on december 28, 2012, that norwegian authorities closed their eyes to the realities of the middle east. too often they thought they were in the service of stability, but later found out that was not the case.regardless, this acknowledgement of norwegian naïveté must lead to tangible changes in foreign policy in order to be of real value.the junior minister asked me what i meant by my leading article on december the 20th (“in bed with the enemy”) in which i stated that norwegian checkbook diplomacy is de facto supportive of terrorist organizations that display significant intolerance towards christians, jews, gays or other minorities who are not considered “sufficiently islamic”.let’s take a look at the statistics: norway is one of the smallest countries in the world, and one of the largest contributors to the palestinian authority (pa) and others, with annual donations of over 700 million nok. especially since the current left-wing labor government took office in 2005, the donations have exploded. what are these sums spent on?recently the remuneration for suicide bombers was tripled. the hamas terrorist who killed 30 israelis in 2002 by now receives 20,000 nok a month, according to the times of israel last september the 9th. those who have carried out the worst attacks against innocent civilians receive the highest pay.intelligence and terrorism information center figures from 2005 show that palestinians have conducted 25,770 terrorist attacks, 147 suicide attacks leading to 1,100 dead israelis and 7,500 wounded between 2000 and 2005. fatah conducted 214 acts of terrorism in 2003-2004 alone, according to 2005 terrorism review.

gates of vienna news feed 1/18/2013





many more foreign hostages than originally reported were taken by the al qaeda terrorists at the amenas gas plant in algeria. the algerian government says that 100 out of 132 were freed, and some sources say that 30 or more hostages were killed. the british government offered the algerians manpower, equipment, and expert assistance to expedite the resolution of the crisis, but was refused. american, british, and french nationals are thought to be among the dead.in other news, the latest figures from angola indicate that at least 250,000 chinese nationals have migrated to the country. the angolan government says that work permits were issued for the chinese to assist with development projects.to see the headlines and the articles, open the full news post.thanks to andy bostom, c. cantoni, ds, eg, insubria, jd, kgs, mary abdelmassih, paul green, steen, vlad tepes, and all the other tipsters who sent these in.notice to tipsters: please don’t submit extensive excerpts from articles that have been posted behind a subscription firewall, or are otherwise under copyright protection.commenters are advised to leave their comments at this post (rather than with the news articles) so that they are more easily accessible.caveat: articles in the news feed are posted “as is”. gates of vienna cannot vouch for the authenticity or accuracy of the contents of any individual item posted here. we check each entry to make sure it is relatively interesting, not patently offensive, and at least superficially plausible. the link to the original is included with each item’s title. further research and verification are left to the reader.

babel on the danube





as a follow-up to tuesday’s post about the majority-minority public schools in oslo, the following brief account reports the latest statistics on the cultural enrichment of schools in austria. vienna is the most fully enriched location, and seems to be in roughly the same situation as oslo.many thanks to hermes for the translation from unzensuriert.at:austria — the number of german-speaking primary school students has declined dramaticallythe number of pupils with a first language other than german has doubled from 1995 to 2011. this is what the recently-issued “national report on education” shows. during this time, the percentage of “monolingual german” children at primary schools dropped from 88% to 76%.the doubling in the number of multilingual students is evident in virtually all provinces in austria. in carinthia, lower austria, salzburg, tyrol and vorarlberg, the rise is a little lower, in upper austria is a bit higher, and in burgenland it remained on average. the styrian province is the only outlier, where the number of children with a different native language has tripled from about 5,000 to 16,000.barely any students with german as mother tongue in viennathe nationwide statistics conceals the dramatic developments in vienna, because german is hardly spoken in the primary schools of the federal capital. the district in vienna where this is most blatantly visible is margareten, where the proportion of immigrant children has risen to 89 % — that is, 924 out of 1038 children have as their mother tongue something other than german. the districts rudolf fünfhaus and ottakring have a proportion of 80%, brigittenau 79% and meidling at least 70%.for a complete listing of previous enrichment news, see the cultural enrichment archives.

here we go again





note: the following post accompanies takuan seiyo’s latest piece. both are being kept “sticky” until tonight. scroll down for other posts that have appeared since wednesday.certain posts at gates of vienna, among them those by takuan seiyo, tend to attract the attention and comments of people who are preoccupied with the jews. they frequently refer to “holohoax” in world war two, often supplementing their scornful references with obscenities or derogatory epithets.i generally delete such comments without publishing them. one of them came in this morning, the second or third such screed submitted on takuan seiyo’s latest post. before i deleted it, i sent it to takuan, just to show him what was coming in. he suggested that i go ahead and post it, followed by his response.so here’s the comment by “anonymous” [typos in the original]:some interesting points, a lot of waffle and some errors. your stated view that the ww2 ‘holocaust’ resulted in the old 6 million dead jews is well past its sell-by date. top class, modern historians now regard that figure as grotesquely disproportionate. the red cross and the german government counted less than 150,000 for all deaths in all camps other than those behind russian lines. it’s now commonly called the holohoax. it is one of the most successful internationsal businesses of all time.a response from takuan seiyo:you have the temerity to post this kind of nazi apologist garbage in a comments thread of an article by a writer whose gentile grandparents had been murdered in a concentration camp and whose gentile mother spent two years in a labor-extermination camp, was a state witness in the post-war trial of its commandant, and relayed her wartime experiences to this writer directly. moreover, a writer who was born and grew up one hour by car from auschwitz and three kilometers from the plant where the firm hoch und tiefbau ag had built the crematoria for that camp. in which, alone, 2.5 million people were murdered, 1 million of them jews. and that’s according to the testimony its commandant rudolf hoess, based on data from ss-obersturmbannführer adolf eichmann.moreover, you desecrate the memory of witold pilecki plus other polish officer escapees from auschwitz who produced written reports, e.g. jerzy tabeau and kazimierz piechowski — all of them of impeccable “white” credentials way beyond what you and other white nat lunatics may ever aspire to. i am omitting here reports by jewish escapees, for example the vrba-wetzler report, as well as the fate of the jewish part of my family during the war, so as to skirt the whole specious joooos-tainted-it aspect of your comment.it’s true that legitimate modern-day attempts to calculate the number of the holocausts’ victims produce a range of numbers. the lowest for auschwitz, for instance (by the polish historian franciszek piper), cites 1.1 million victims, in contrast to the 2.5 million estimate — interesting, however, that even in that much-reduced number the jewish victims component remains the same 1 million as in the bigger total-victim figures. the highest figure cited for auschwitz is 4 million.

the bee and the lamb, part 9 (continued)





note: takuan’s post (which was originally published last night) is to remain at the top for a while, so i made it “sticky”. however, much has happened since it went up, including the blogger outage. scroll down for a report on that. see also: two forthrightly anti-semitic islamic leaders in norway, judicial coddling in germany, and part 3 of the imran firasat interview.more new posts will be added below this one. oh, and don’t mess around with jim.the essay below is the conclusion of the ninth part in a series by takuan seiyo. see the list at the bottom of this post for links to the previous installments.left: pierre-auguste renoir, dance at le moulin de la galette, 1876right: george grosz, metropolis, 1916/17the bee and the lambpart 9 (continued)by takuan seiyoa whole new road to serfdomthat which is not seen (continued)for over 60 years, white mea-culpists have had a firm grip in all fields of cultural mind imprinting: education high and low; paper media, then electronic, then digital media; all forms of entertainment, the plastic arts and music high and low, and religious instruction and worship too. their main endeavor has been to enforce their compulsory (e.g. k-12) and discretionary (e.g. television) self-flaying on account of long-ago slavery, colonialism, imperialism, male supremacism, racism, antisemitism, and so on.it’s the evils of the iberian inquisition — which were evil — but not the evils of the japanese equivalent in which, in the 40 years up to 1597, 50,000 christians were publicly crucified, burned or beheaded. nor the evils of the worldwide islamic inquisition which — not in the 16th century but now, in the 21st, condemns muslim apostates to barbaric execution. it’s america’s destruction of the snail darter but not mussulmanism’s destruction of the bamyan buddhas or its proposed destruction of the sphinx and the pyramids, let alone its obliteration of all the pre-rome cradles of christianity but for remaining ruins in the middle east and dust of the desert in north africa.it’s the evils of feudalism and industrial workers’ exploitation in europe and america, but not the strict confucian evils of northeast asia. there, a member of the ruling class in china had, essentially, a free hand with anyone of the lower classes, a japanese samurai could test his sword by cutting down an insolent peasant, and farmers were so squeezed by their fief holders that they habitually sold their daughters to bordellos for the few coins it provided for next season’s seed.feminism, socialism and anti-antisemitism should have arisen in saudi arabia or yemen, algeria or peshawar, for good reasons. instead, aggressive white androphobes of all genders which i can no longer count are decimating the philogynous and egalitarian west. equality psychos are tearing down the most egalitarian society that ever existed (except for initial communist experiments, before they turned bloody). american jews, at the apex of the greatest fortune and philosemitic tolerance their long diaspora has ever bestowed on their kind, are busy supporting all the ideologies and policies that demolish their safe harbor and build up their muslim, black and third world enemies. they will come to rue their tacit assumption that better the antisemite you don’t know than the few hundred imputed and real ones catalogued at adl.one would be hard put to find a nation not based on the invasion of another people’s territory and their mass slaughter. yet poisoned american madmen proclaim “no thanks for thanksgiving” as though the indians themselves did not fight endless genocidal wars from peru to canada, with torture, ritual murder or slavery for the captives and, at times, cannibalism too.leftoid masochists and the christian meek call for returning hawaii to the hawaiians and capitulating before a massive mexican reconquista of one-third of america. the self-defined “feminist-tauist-neopagan-post-structuralist-deconstructionist-socialist” useful idiot gillian schutte begins her new year 2013 dear white people by “wholeheartedly apologizing for what my ancestors did to the people of south africa and inviting you to do the same.”yet the magyars don’t seem to feel much guilt over the illyrians, pannonians, sarmatians and celts whose land and lives they took in the 9th century, to form hungary. the rightful etruscan landowners are not bearing angry placards in front of the vatican. the japanese are not planning to relinquish hokkaido to its original owners, the ainu. the tall, white and fair-haired chachapoyas of the andean forest have, alas, no remnants left to sue the incas for genocide in a peruvian court of law. the aztecs, whether in jalisco or los angeles, don’t agonize over having taken what would become mexico city from its original culhuacan owners, with lots of grisly details. yet for 38 years neil young has been reminding adoring audiences about “cortez the killer”, discreetly omitting tlacaelel the killer and the killer people whom cortez killed.hitler’s willing executioners: ordinary germans and the holocaust (1996) is a book by daniel goldhagen presenting the thesis that the german nation as such was composed of willing executioners of the jews because of a unique “eliminationist antisemitism” in the german people, with long historical roots. however, even that great moral abyss of western civilization — the holocausts — stands out more in its industrialized and organizational features than it does either in the quality of its hatefulness or its relative or even absolute volumes. and holocausts they were, for in addition to the nearly 6 million jews, the germans also murdered over 21 million civilian slavs, and that’s counting russia, ukraine, poland, lithuania, belarus and czechoslovakia alone.in absolute numbers, the total number of world war ii non-german civilian victims of nazi germany is smaller than the 50 million victims of the bolsheviks in russia, or mao’s 70 million in china, or the mughal-muslim genocide of hindus — the latter have their own holocaust day on august 14.in relative numbers, in just one year, 1994, the hutus and tutsis in rwanda, killed off a total of one million, in a population of 7 million. 75% of the tutsi population was erased. is it more humane to go by a stroke of a blunt machete than by a whiff of zyklon b?the khmer rouge murdered at least 2 million cambodians between 1975 and 1979: one quarter of the population, by a conservative count. is it more humane to die by wallops from a cambodian pickaxe handle than by a bullet from a german mauser?inscription on the back (in german): “ukraine 1942, jewish aktion, ivangorod.”there is a special horror attached to the third reich, because those were 20 th century europeans, christians, and in many ways the smartest, most civilized people on earth. but the holocausts do not prove that whites are worse than other people, just that they are no better. the history of the third reich also proves that with the right formula of economic blowup, misery and humiliation, sparked by charismatic evil, no people are immune to such horror, at no time.

“the jews ruin things”





our norwegian correspondent the observer sends his translation of an article and interview with two respectable high-profile muslim leaders in oslo, who have strongly negative opinions about jews and the worldwide jewish conspiracy. the observer notes:a new trend seems to have developed in the islamic community in norway: grab hold of a journalist and speak your mind on issues such as stoning, adultery, apostasy and jews — and don’t hold back.this article deals with the twisted views of the imam and the chairman of norway’s largest mosque. it should also be pointed out that this is the same mosque that the norwegian police apologized so profusely to last year for the fact that we have freedom of speech in norway.the translated article from dagsavisen:imam blames jews for media coveragecontroversial: many norwegians have a negative view on islam due to jewish domination of the media. this accusation is made by the imam and by the chairman of norway’s largest mosque.we are visiting central jamaat-e ahl-e sunnat, the mosque with the largest member base in norway, to talk to its spiritual leader. the mosque was founded in 1977 and currently has more than 5,000 members. the cultural center in grønland in oslo can accommodate 2500 people during prayers. the spiritual leader, imam nehmat ali shah is not fluent in norwegian, so every now and then chairman, ghulam sarwar has to translate from punjabi.“but we have the same opinions,” says sarwar while the imam nods and smiles — he looks both stern and benign at the same time.the subject of the interview is the relationship between the major religions and norwegians’ attitudes toward islam. the imam begins by explaining that all three heavenly religions, judaism, christianity and islam, are sacred to them. many people are unaware of this fact, says sarwar.then a statement is made that many will find far more problematic.“the jews ruin things”“schoolchildren visit the mosque regularly and some of the students may think that we are against christianity,” says sarwar. both of them believe that the school visits confirms their views that norwegians in general have an inaccurate impression of islam and muslims.“students, journalists and people like you ask the same questions over and over again — about forced marriage, hijab and whether females can become imams.“no one can be forcefully compelled to marry in islam, but parents can assist in finding the right partner, and no, women cannot become imams. people are ignorant because they get their information from the media, and the media only write negatively about islam. judaism has a better grip on the media,” says sarwar.“why do the media only write negatively about islam?”“because the media has jewish roots. the jews control the media and that’s detrimental. only a handful of people were behind the movie about mohammed in the u.s. and they didn’t have a lot of money. so who was financing them, who was backing them?” asks sarwar, referring to the anti-islamic film the innocence of muslims, produced by a christian egyptian copt living in the usa.“anxious people”“who are the jews behind this in your opinion?”

don’t mess around with jim





a big tip of the bodissey pickelhaube to our commenter jolie rouge, who has provided us with a brand new acronym. the occasion was an observation about bbc 17/01/2013 this week (the link only works in the uk):andrew neil and michael portillo are joined by former un secretary-general kofi annan and alastair campbell.interesting conversation — acknowledging the geopolitical threat to the west.note the aggressor is not named other than by geographical location (e.g.) north africa, afghanistan and surprisingly the inclusion of turkey.amazingly they manage to avoid the jim words — jihad, islam and muslim.i think jim could have great utility for our enterprise: it’s concise, pronounceable, handy to use, and easy to propagate.who will be the first major western politician (not counting geert wilders) to break the greatest cultural taboo of our time, and mess around with jim?

gates of vienna news feed 1/17/2013





tonight’s news feed is unusually fat, due to the inclusion of last night’s items, which were never used because of the blogger outage.yesterday a group of al qaeda terrorists assaulted a natural gas plant in algeria and killed two foreigners while taking 41 other hostage. today algerian special forces staged a helicopter raid on the plant, killing a number of the hostages — between six and 34, depending on whose figures you believe — in the process of taking out the terrorists. among the foreign hostages were american, british, french, and japanese nationals.in other news, germany has begun repatriating its foreign gold reserves, which are stored in vaults in paris, london, and the united states.to see the headlines and the articles, open the full news post.thanks to c. cantoni, erick stakelbeck, fjordman, insubria, jb, jd, jerry gordon, kitman, mcr, the observer, vlad tepes, and all the other tipsters who sent these in.notice to tipsters: please don’t submit extensive excerpts from articles that have been posted behind a subscription firewall, or are otherwise under copyright protection.+commenters are advised to leave their comments at this post (rather than with the news articles) so that they are more easily accessible.caveat: articles in the news feed are posted “as is”. gates of vienna cannot vouch for the authenticity or accuracy of the contents of any individual item posted here. we check each entry to make sure it is relatively interesting, not patently offensive, and at least superficially plausible. the link to the original is included with each item’s title. further research and verification are left to the reader.

lethal judicial coddling





the following article tells a brief tale about immigrant-on-immigrant violence in cologne, with muslims of immigrant background dealing it out and russian immigrants as victims.jlh, who translated the piece, sends this brief note:it shows the attempts by a turk to protect a russian family and being killed for his trouble. an example of what happens to the good guys among the immigrants if they don’t toe the line.the translated article from quotenqueen:dead thanks to judicial coddlingthe unwillingness of german judges to lock up unsocialized walking time-bombs already known to the police has claimed a victim in cologne on new year’s eve. two criminal foreigners, free to terrorize their neighbors despite drug-related and violent crimes, killed a turkish husband and father who tried to get them to behave. it happened in a sector of the city called bickendorf — a district notorious for years for immigrant violence and bordering on the thoroughly islamized ehrenfeld. there was also knife-play at night in the immigrant milieu of right-bank cologne-vingst, where “antifa” pastor meurer is collecting for the building of a mosque and reading masses against pro-köln. but no one was killed.the kölner express reports:

imran firasat is a pakistani ex-muslim who collaborated with terry jones on the movie the innocent prophet (watch it here). the spanish government recently revoked his status as a political refugee in spain, and he is due to be deported to pakistan, where he will face the death penalty for blasphemy. there is currently a push to persuade the canadian government to grant him and his family political asylum.mr. firasat was interviewed recently on alerta digital tv. the video below shows the third part of the interview, and includes segments in english of a statement by terry jones. previously: part 1, part 2.many thanks to our spanish correspondent hermes for the translation, and to vlad tepes for the subtitling:transcript:

meteorological update from dymphna





we are in the midst of a winter weather warning (also known as crystallized climate change) here at schloss bodissey. that means i am watching big, fat flakes accumulating on everything — though the driveway is still clear.  prior to that, we awoke this morning to heavy rains. it is our good fortune that there was never any period of transitional ice. thank heavens!why am i talking about the weather, you ask?  because this heavy wet snow may well eventuate in a power outage. should that happen we would have no way to tell you why when, once again, no one seems to be home.if the power does go out, i’m confident it won’t be for long.  our rural electric cooperative is exceptionally good at handling these kinds of weather ‘events’; if we do go out, it won’t be for long. and thanks to the generosity of our donors several years ago, we installed a gas cook stove so we can cook and have — thank heavens, again — hot coffee during the outage.yes, we are careful regarding the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning if we were to use the stove for heat. however, given how leaky our storm windows are, i’m not worried.here’s what noaa says:

sharia patrols in london, revisited





yesterday we reported on a group of young muslim men who accost pedestrians in certain parts of east london. they insist that their turf is a “muslim area”, and require that non-muslims observe the appropriate dress code and the islamic proscription on alcohol while they are there. the original post included an embedded video taken by the group and posted on their youtube account.since then youtube has yanked the video, on the grounds that it was “intended to harass, bully and threaten.” however, for the sake of the historical record of these dire times, vlad tepes has preserved a (slightly augmented) copy at mrc tv:

outage report





as you all know by now, our blog was suddenly removed last night between 8 and 9pm est for no apparent reason. blogger never provided any explanation before, during, or after the outage. i assume it was an internal technical problem at google.below is a portion of a mass email i sent out earlier today to dozens of people who had written to us to ask what happened:blogger “removed” our blog suddenly last night. one second it was there; the next it was gone. if we had violated their terms of service, we should have received an email, according to their own established procedure. but we received no email.i retain my “dashboard” account, as does dymphna. and, as you can see, i still have the gmail account. there is no “deleted blogs” link on our dashboards, as there should be if the blog had been deleted deliberately through a normal procedure.late last night i began the process that one always goes through with blogger: we posted requests on the help forum. that’s really all that can be done; you can’t talk to human beings where google is concerned. we actually received a response, which is unusual with google. based on the replies, there seems to have been a major problem with blogger last night. many other blogs disappeared in the same fashion.i anticipate that this is most likely a technical glitch on google’s part, based on the number and types of blogs that had the same thing happen to them last night. but we should know for certain within another day or two.it’s also possible (but far less likely, in my estimation) that we were taken down for political reasons. if it was a deliberate take-down, we will migrate to another platform with our own domain. we back up the entire blog frequently, so only a few posts will be missing when we restore.
