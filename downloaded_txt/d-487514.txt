	 open letter to crown heights
	 
    


chn:
my dear friends & neighbors:please hear me out, don’t throw this away – i realize there are many papers arriving at your door daily nevertheless i ask please hear me out? several people in this community have caused housing to skyrocket by flipping real estate!! they buy houses from long time residents and flip the homes for astronomical profits. they compete with other members of the schunah for the sole purpose of flipping for a huge profit! years ago when a friend or neighbor was looking for a house and we knew of one we were thrilled to pass on the information. today unfortunately there are yungelight canvassing the neighborhood for available homes so they can flip for profits ranging from $50,000 to $380,000. once ‘mr. roberts’ becomes aware of the price his new neighbor paid he will seek the same or more.there is no excuse for this shameful greed! this is not like selling a container of milk for a higher price. this cannot be considered “regular business practice”. if one merchant in the neighborhood sells an item for a higher price then there is always an option of going to another shop. the same is not true with housing. if a lubavitcher wants to buy a house in his or her schunah there is no other schunah to shop in. obviously not the same as the guy selling milk or potatoes.therefore to excuse oneself with the warped logic that it is business like any is totally unacceptable.some of you are reading and thinking “oye, what’s it my business” either because you already have a house or you have no intention of buying one. you are so wrong! it is your business! yungelight are buying houses at these inflated prices because they have growing families and need a place to live. however, they can hardly make the monthly payments. each mortgage payment becomes a huge struggle.eventually this filters down to many of you. the one struggling cannot pay tuition for their kinderlach. the grocer, butcher, baker etc are not getting paid so they in turn cannot pay their tuition and suppliers (many of which are from this schunah also). this financial drain and strain filters into many more areas than you can imagine. marriages are suffering and children are not getting the attention they need and deserve! that is why you cannot say “what’s it my business”!years ago machne israel wanted to buy three private houses behind 770. they offered between $200,000 and $300,000 to the owners – then a well known gevir with the best of intentions offered more money and the rebbe did not allow it. the rebbe did not want to start this trend of paying exorbitant prices for housing. not because the rebbe was overly frugal ch’v, the rebbe was very realistic and practical. now we have the so called chassidim causing the very difficulties the rebbe looked to avoid. the flipping must stop and each one of you should shun those committing this selfish -disgraceful practice!ask the flippers if they have been donating some of this blood money to the mosdos that are all suffering as a result of their selfishness. remember – the melamdim and teachers who are with your kinderlach for many hours each day are suffering from this and their money worries detracts from their quality of teaching. if teachers get paid – their worries are eliminated and in turn this filters down and benefits the students. the flipping problem is your business and buying from flippers must be stopped!
my best regards, 
shimshon stock.

	 yeshiva dorm under questioning
	 
    


ex:
the yeshiva students' use of a local residence has prompted questions from borough officials. during its may 15 meeting, borough council members heard from housing officer edward goetzmann, who has looked into the use by yeshiva me'on hatorah students of the house at 53 n. rochdale ave. the yeshiva is located in the borough on homestead lane. goetzmann said he recently received phone calls about the use of the north rochdale property from mayor beth battel and resident bert ellentuck,among others. he said he has seen yeshiva students traveling up and down rochdale avenue and going in and out of the house. "there are more people there than there should be," he said. goetzmann said he has notified the property owner, paul brottman, who is in the hospital, about the matter. "the question is, what is the building being used for?" goetzmann asked. phone calls to yeshiva me'on hatorah vice president josh pruzansky went unanswered. goetzmann said brottman had previously called him to say he had a new tenant who wanted to move into the home quickly. an inspection of the home only turned up a few minor problems, none of which is dangerous, according to goetzmann. after inspecting the property, goetzmann told brottman he could issue a "permissible continuing occupancy" permit. he said he made it clear to brottman and to rabbi yisroel eisenberg, of the yeshiva, that the house is zoned as a single-family occupancy dwelling. he also said the rabbi is somehow related to the tenants. according to goetzmann, there are no sprinklers in the house. but if the house is being used as a boarding home, he said, it would need to have them.......he also said the residence may have changed from a single-family home into a house where 12-14 boys sleep each night. he said the state considers a boarding home any place where five unrelated persons over the age of 2 1/2 live together.

	 israeli conversion crisis
	 
    


haaretz:
fears of a historic rift between the chief rabbinate and orthodox rabbis overseas have been sparked by the chief rabbinate's recent decision not to recognize conversions and divorce decrees (gets) by most orthodox rabbis abroad. the rabbinate confirmed that rabbinic courts in israel have been instructed not to recognize conversions and gets authorized by overseas rabbis until those rabbis pass rabbinate exams in israel. this means that jews who underwent an orthodox conversion abroad will have to convert again in israel in order to be recognized as jews by rabbinic courts. jewish women who received a get overseas and wish to remarry in israel will have to ask their ex-husbands for another get if the first one was approved by orthodox rabbis not recognized by the rabbinate.........under the new policy, diaspora rabbis must be examined by a special rabbinic court panel appointed by the chief rabbinate council for their conversions and gets to be recognized. rabbis seeking recognition for their gets are required, in addition to the exam, to attend a brief training program in which they join the deliberations at rabbinic courts and learn how to register gets. the rabbinate will still continue to recognize conversions and gets by a group of some 50 senior orthodox rabbis around the world. these rabbis, whose names appear on a list prepared several years ago by previous chief rabbis, will not be required to take the exams.

unorthodox biography
talk feels compelled to give a tip of the, um, black hat to the yeshiva world blog, which can be found at www.yeshivaworld.blogspot.com.
this nameless blogger has got a lot of chutzpah, opening a warts-and-all window onto the world of the orthodox hasidim who live in the orange county community of kiryas joel, as well as brooklyn, rockland county and israel.
during last month's funeral services for grand rebbe moses teitelbaum, yeshiva world provided a translation of the words that prompted a fist fight between members of two kj factions in the village's main synagogue: a member of one faction was urging his followers to "break their bones!"
that's not all. last week, yeshiva world linked to a jewish wire-service report citing a 35 percent surge in the amount of beer-drinking among the ultra-orthodox jews in israel.

	 r' mattisyahu salomon visits ohio
	 
    


harav matisyohu salomon shlita was in beachwood, ohio speaking for the yad chaim mordechai kollel, directed by the rosh kollel rav yankel velvel katz, son of the telzer rosh hayeshiva harav mottel katz zt"l.

the kollel opened 10 years ago and b"h has close to 100 baalei batim learning every night. there are over 200 different baalei batim that learn there during the week. there are 16 full time avreichim headed by the rosh kollel, rav yankel velvel katz and the rosh chabura rav alexander charlop.

in the past years, the kollel has brought in rav rueven feinstein, rav malkiel kotler, rav yissocher frand, rav aharon feldman and other roshei yeshiva, shlita.

the evening began with close to forty people making siyumim on different mesechtos that were learned during the year. rav matisyohu shlita began by saying how overwhelmed he was by the atmosphere of torah in the air and how tangible it was.

he commented that he normally doesnt say his own peshotim, but he couldnt find any pshat on the significance of the eshan mikivshan, the smoke ofrom a furnace that klal yisroel witnesses by har sinai. he suggested that it was the ribbomo shel oilam giving testimony that there will be torah after the smoke of ww2.

his main message was from his rebbe, reb leib gurwitz, the ry of gateshead. the midrash says that hashem asked all the nations if they wanted the torah and they all first asked: "what is in it"? hashem answered to each of them something that was their weakest charachteristic and they had to refuse. klal yisroel said "naaseh v'nishma." the ribbono shel oilam was impressed and said "mi gila raz zeh"? who revealed this secret to them? only the angels can say we will do even without knowing what it is that will be required of them. reb leib asked an extremely penetrating question. if klal yisroel would have asked, what is in the torah, what would hashem have answered us? what is our weakest charchteristic? the answer, he claimed is the possuk "lo selech rochil b'amecha." don't be oiver the issur of rechilus and loshon hora. could we have claimed that we will not speak one word of loshon horah?
the answer is that we had one secret. while it is true that each nation could not have kept that particular mitzva and klal yisroel as well - that is with the capibilities that they had at the time. however, with the acceptance of the torah, hashem gave us those abilities to overcome these desires and then things which we thought were impossible will become possible and even geshmak. this comes with a true commitment and only if none makes a serious and honost commitment. this is what the yom tov of shavuos is about.
(thanks to our ohio reporter for gathering this information!)

	 monsey - new townhouses?
	 
    


tjn:
the very real sounds of revitalization may soon be heard throughout the village's downtown.
alan gestetner, president of monsey-based cole development corp., who has proposed building a three-story structure with 62 townhouses and a community center at north main street and maple avenue, said he plans to start demolition in the summer. "no later than august," he said yesterday. the village board, which approved the $15 million housing development as part of its overall urban renewal effort, agreed last week to transfer a former bathhouse on maple avenue to cole to be demolished, the four-bedroom townhouses are expected to cost $300,000 to $350,000 each. the proposal also includes a 7,000-square-foot commercial component and feature two horseshoe-shaped buildings facing memorial park. the entrance would be on lawler boulevard. gestetner has vowed to provide space for little angels day care center, which operates on the site, either at the new development or elsewhere in the village. "we're definitely going to hold them to that promise," said mercy anim, the day care's director........
