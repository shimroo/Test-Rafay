kai eckhardt
kai eckhardt is an afro-european musician who has made a significant contribution to the evolution of
                                the electric bass since 1989. heavily influenced by the emerging fusion of funk, rock and jazz in the late
                                70's, kai developed a unique style on his instrument long before attending berklee college of music in
                                boston - the renowned music college- from which he graduated with honors in 1987. under the
                                guidance of tiger okoshi, bob moses and gary burton, kai was introduced directly to pioneering
                                guitarist john mclaughlin, who at the time was forming a new trio together with indian born
                                percussionist trilok gurtu.
                            
kai has performed at distinguished venues around the globe such as the royal festival hall in
                                london, the philharmonic in munich and the esplanade in singapore. festival engagements include
                                montreal jazz festival, north sea jazz festival in the hague, womad world music festival in spain and
                                glastonbury in the u.k. kai has performed for dignitaries on some occasions like the king and queen of
                                norway. in the educational field, kai teaches clinics and master classes internationally. engagements
                                include berklee in boston, the musicianâs institute in hollywood, the bruckner conservatory in austria
                                and amsterdam conservatory in the netherlands. perhaps the most notably unique band in kai's
                                career was the pioneering jam-band garaj mahal, which he co-lead between 2000 and 2010, producing
                                9 albums and performing roughly 1000 concerts in the u.s and canada.
                            






joseph escobar
joseph escobar is a pianist, composer, arranger, and teacher based in el cerrito, ca. his biggest musical inspirations from jazz include musicians like miles davis, herbie hancock, kurt rosenwinkel, brad mehldau, bill evans, ella fitzgerald, gerald clayton, sullivan fortner, art blakey, john coltrane, esperanza spalding, and many others. he also draws inspiration from many other diverse sources, such as classical, indian classical, rock, progressive metal, latin jazz, tango, electronic music, and (perhaps) his first love, jrpg soundtracks, with the works of nobuo uematsu, hitoshi sakimoto, masashi hamauzu, and yasunori mitsuda. he performs around the bay area with up-and-coming jazz/hip-hop fusion artist oddity (as a co-composer and performer), and with the jam band frictal, with bassist noah zisser, guitarist stu silverman, and drummer carson fratus. he also has a jazz project with his younger brother and tenor saxophonist michael escobar as part of the escobros group, performing their own original compositions. he's a noted homebody and constantly dodges gigs and parties (while, paradoxically, simultaneously wishing to be invited to them) which is probably why you haven't heard of him.
                            
now that the lengthy part of the bio (where a bunch of names are listed for the reader to gloss over) has come to an end, he can inform his valued readers that he loves time spent well with friends, puns and wordplay, abstract discussions, benign mischief, super smash bros, and all types of art across different media. he struggles daily with the unending existential absurdity of the world we all inhabit, while somehow remaining mostly upbeat. he believes the us should pay reparations for slavery, and that custody and care of federal lands should be given to the tribes from whom they were taken. none of this has much to do with his music, per se, but shouldn't it?
