ivy nursery was founded in 1975 by clare and george carter, both of whom have master's degrees in landscape architecture from the university of virginia.  the nursery is situated on seven acres on scenic rte. 250 west, three miles west of the university of virginia, and a quarter of a mile west of the boar's head inn and farmington country club. our philosophywhen we started ivy nursery, immediately after graduation from the architecture school, we founded it on three principles. first, to offer the healthiest, freshest, and most beautiful plants we can find. second, to choose our staff based on their knowledge and experience in landscape architecture, horticulture and gardening, and in choosing staff, to emphasize kindness, empathy and a love of helping others. and third, to give the best horticulture and design advice we can.
