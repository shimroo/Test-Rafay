exceptional service
here's what some of our members are saying...



2/13/2025marcus medaltoday i was reminded why i have banked with mccoy fcu for almost 25 years. i called and spoke with charlotte, at the lb mcleod branch. her customer service skills were above reproach. she took her time to both identify the issue and then to resolve it. she is to be commended and recognized as a great asset. in my estimation she would make a excellent coach for the newer customer service representatives.2/12/2025lorelai'stravel boutiquethank you jacqueline for terrific customer service today! as new members my daughter and myself had a lot of questions about opening accounts. we appreciate your patience and understanding.2/10/2025adelaida ramosexcellent service by claudia sala. she help us with a concern about loan. she explain step by step. it's wonderful to know that her friendly and very professional.  thank you claudia  sala for taking time to help us bank members. god bless you and for your beautiful personality.  thank you!!
