peter
cushing was one of the most beloved and important actors for the genres of 
horror and fantasy films. he began in british theater before making a name for
himself in hollywood with such films as 'the man in the iron mask' and 'a chump
at oxford'. cushing returned to his native england during world war ii and soon
after became a television star with such hits as 'nineteen eighty-four', 'the
creature' and 'beau brummell'. 
   to
his fans however, mr. cushing is recognized mostly for his work with hammer
films. he began to star in many of hammer's horror and fantasy films
starting in the late 1950's, which consequently breathed new life and energy
into the nearly forgotten genre of classic horror films. these films gained such
favor and popularity with the public, mr. cushing was quickly catapulted to
international stardom. such classics included 'the curse of frankenstein',
'abominable snowman of the himalayas', 'horror of dracula', 'the mummy',
'captain clegg', 'the revenge of frankenstein', 'the evil of frankenstein',
'sword of sherwood forest', 'frankenstein must be destroyed', 'dracula a.d.
1972', 'frankenstein and the monster from hell', 'legend of the seven golden
vampires', plus many more. he also appeared in films for amicus - hammer's
rival. some of these classics included 'dr. terror's house of horrors', 'dr. who
and the daleks', 'daleks' invasion earth 2150 a.d.', 'i monster', 'asylum', and
'tales from the crypt'. it has been said that everyday, somewhere in the world,
a peter cushing film is being shown. these films are still watched today by
countless life long fans who grew up watching peter cushing, and to the delight
of younger viewers discovering for the first time these well made, classic
horror films. mr. cushing capped off his career in the late 1970's with star
wars. from then on, he made only a handful of films with biggles being his
last in 1986. 
  
still very active in retirement, mr. cushing wrote two autobiographies, received
the o.b.e. ( officer of the british empire) in 1989, helped in raising money for
cancer research, along with painting, collecting books, and bird watching in his
spare time. 
  
always the professional, mr. cushing's final work was the hammer documentary
flesh and blood. his contribution and dedication to the films he
appeared in will never be equaled. the generous, kind and gentle nature, he
showed off-camera to his co-workers and fans is legendary. peter cushing truly
was the gentle man of horror. this is his official site under the guidance of
his former secretary, mrs. joyce broughton.
