monroe la dentist
meet dr. david finley
some patients drive hours, coming from neighboring states, to have dr. finley create smile makeovers for them. but for people here in monroe, he is a trusted family dentist who takes care of all their dental needs—everything from basic cleanings and checkups to invisalign invisible braces, one-appointment crowns, and taking out wisdom teeth.
while he enjoys all facets of dentistry, he is most famous for his beautiful smile makeovers. he is one of fewer than 60 dentists in the world to earn accredited fellow status from the american academy of cosmetic dentistry, and he has also won a total of 9 medals, including 4 gold medals, in the aacd international smile gallery competition.
