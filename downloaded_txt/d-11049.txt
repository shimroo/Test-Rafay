at metlife, protecting your information is a top priority.

you may have seen recent news coverage of customers of financial services companies falling victim to social engineering scams. scammers impersonate a trusted company to convince their targets into revealing or handing over sensitive information such as insurance, banking or login credentials. this scamming can happen via text, email or websites set up to look like the trusted company.
