i just realized that i miss blogging, the long form. ever since i started twitter-ing last 2006, i have been not been blogging regularly. or maybe i missed typing my thoughts because i did email my high school batch before blogging this.just came from binondo with my high school friends ayn, honey, therese and emmylou. man, we walked for hours! from the recto lrt2 station, we walked to the binondo church. i don't know how many kilometers we walked but thank goodness it wasn't so sunny this morning. thanks too typhoon isang for not raining down when we were walking. thank you to the nice and kind people we met along the way who gave us the right directions. screw the pedicab drivers who wanted to charge us p50 each to pedal us to the binondo church.when we reached the binondo church, we saw that it was prepared for an afternoon wedding. the decoration in the aisle was soooo pretty. we wanted to hop and down the aisle. it was that pretty. but of course we didn't. we just said our prayers and left. we chose a different door to exit and we saw the purple fire trucks parked nearby. so we turned on our tourist modes and had our pics taken with the famous purple fire trucks of manila.then we crossed the street to the eng bee tin shop. this place is famous for anything ube. ube hopia, ube siopao, ube candies, etc. i've always thought that they are just offering hopia and sipao. but much to our surpise, they have lots of products. haw flakes, mikiron, coconut pies, tikoy, candies and other chinese delicacies. while inside the shop, it rained so hard that we could hardly see through the rain. so we decided to eat in the nearby tasty dumplings for lunch.i almost wanted to puke at the thought of eating at tasty dumplings again for the 2nd time this week. but i had no choice since i didn't want to get wet and eventually worsen my cough. i had a hard time ordering because i haven't eaten anything from this restaurant except for porkchop rice. i ended up ordering spareribs rice, steamed dumplings and silver roll bread. i recommended to my friends that they order porkchop rice and wintermelon juice. only therese ordered porkchop rice but all of them ordered wintermelon juice. they liked the silver roll bread i ordered for everyone. since it was my birthday yesterday, i picked up the tab :)(i am so sleepy. i will finish the story tomorrow.)

in the office bulletin board, there's a birthday list. only the ones celebrating their birthday on the current month are posted there. so every month, there's a new list.i just don't get it why people put comments like "gwapo", "pogi", or "date tayo!". there are highlighted names. i am not sure though if it was done by someone else or by the celebrant himself/herself. there are also encircled names. and some have even put non-existent birthdays like may 32. oh come on! that is so jologs. really. it is so jologs. i'm sorry for the term but i find it such a jolog attitude. don't you guys have better things to say or write? there's the whole cyberspace to vandalize. speak out there, just not in the office bulletin board where everyone can witness how jolog his/her officemates are. if you want to date someone, ask him or her personally. not in the bulletin board. if you want to proclaim your admiration for someone or even admiration of oneself, shout in your bathroom! not in the bulletin board. not in the birthday list.ugh!

this happened after eating merienda-after-dinner:me: wow! your tummy is so big. you're like a buddha na.nigel: if i make my tummy bigger, will i get older?hahaha. he wants to get older because he knows he can do a lot more things that he's not allowed now. he always hears the reason "when you're older." so he thinks of ways to get older. haha :)

junjun, jules brother, got an iphone from his uncle. when he was showing it to me, tiger said, "you can't tell mom. you promise me not to tell mom. it's a surprise."i said, "okay, i promise."but i don't think tiger believed me so he made a follow-up. "you promised not tell mom."and i replied, "yeah, and hope to die."he didn't say i can't blog about it. *wink*
