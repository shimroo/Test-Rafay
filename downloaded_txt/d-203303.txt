avionics west gps training
aircraft navigation has been revolutionized by modern gps receivers driving color moving map displays.  these displays can import weather, fuel, traffic, and radar information to
assist in the flight.  information from the systems is used to drive autopilots that can fly a complete flight in both horizontal and
vertical modes.  but this complexity comes at a price -- they must be understood thoroughly so that their operation doesn't become a hazard
to the flight rather than the formidable assistance they can provide. 
you can learn to use your system with my gps training classes and /or my
gps manuals ;click on this link to order or send  requests to thomassen@avionicswest.com.


in 2001, when gps was very new for aircraft navigation, i partnered with tom
rodgers of avionics west in santa maria (california) to teach gps classes at
his shop.  he was flooded with gps installs, and with questions on how to
operate them, and i was a recently retired physicist, with lots of teaching
experience and a strong interest in learning âall about gpsâ.  classes began in
early 2002, using garmin 430/530 units (and later, gns 480âs) installed in
docking stations for up to 18 students. for the first three months i had the
idea that i needed to teach the operations described in the garmin manuals, the
âknobologyâ of how to execute each of them.  but half the questions i got from
students were not of that type, and it slowly became clear to me that there was
a whole other side to gps that i hadnât appreciated.  most of the difficulties
my students have with any gps are not how to operate the device, but in
understanding how it works -- the foundations of a gps. these involve flight
legs, leg sequencing and suspension, autopilot signals (analog and digital)
from flight legs, discontinuities between legs, and the addition of procedure
legs into a plan.  what problems arise and how do you solve them?

gps for pilots

    to explain what i mean by the basic fundamentals of a gps i've written the manual âgps for pilotsâ
    which also gives examples  to illustrate common problems pilots typically encountered and their solutions. i
    explore these issues on garmins (430w/530w 480, 650/750, and g1000w),
    the chelton efis units, and the avidyne 440/540.  color screen
    shots from sims for these devices are used extensively.  autopilot
    use on flights is illustrated from many of the units in use today.
    it covers tracking lateral courses with either analog commands from
    your cdi, or digital  commands directly from the gps.
    both gps and baro-vnav vertical commands are described both from
    the gps side (commands issued) and autopilot side (modes to use).
this manual is available for $20 plus shipping ($3 in the us).
aviating and aviation
 a modern glass cockpit is the center or your aviation and navigation
system. the heart of that system is a gps with a full set of capabilities, and
which communicates with just about everything else in your system. for using
the full set of gps capabilities, it needs information from an air data
computer (adc), an attitude and heading reference system (ahrs), and
magnetometer. it provides needed parameters to your ads-b system, can display
satellite weather, stormscope strikes, and radar images. traffic infomation
from both ads-b and a traffic advisory system (tas) can be blended and displayed
on the gps and an efis. your unit may allow choosing between satellite weather
and ads-b weather. engine and electrical systems information can also be shown.
baro-vnav systems are appearing in more gps units, and the digital autopilots
needed to fly the vnav slopes (not the gps slopes) in your flight plan are
increasingly available from multiple companies. to understand what all these
auxiliary systems can do, how they work and what it means to a pilot in terms
of operations you can carry out, i've written the manual "
aviating and aviation
" in the modern world". that manual, and the gps for pilots
manual are shown here. this manual is available for $20 plus shipping ($3 in the us).

my manuals

    from my point of view, i think of gps understanding in 3 different ways;
    the first is the set of basic ideas and fundamentals common to all units,
    and the above manual is devoted largely to that topic. without these
    basics, learning is incomplete.  a second view is the âhandbookâ of
    operations represented by manuals from the manufacturer, which ignores most
    of the issues raised by understanding the foundations of gps.  the third
    view is the practical use of gps, represented by my manuals, which mixes
    the first two views but presents material as pilots expect to learn it; in
    building-block fashion, with scenario based examples used liberally.


written from my perspective as a pilot, instructor, and
educator, my current manuals are
  all in full
color, with several hundred simulator screen shots. manuals are available for the chelton efis system, g1000w, gtn 650/750, gns 480,  and gns 430w/530w. they are printed on
glossy paper with a 14 font for easy reading, have heavy glossy covers, and are
plastic spiral bound so they lay flat or easily fold over. these manuals are
$30 plus s&h ($3 in the us), except the 430/530 and 480 manuals, which  are out of print and available as a pdf file for $25 (email me to order: thomassen@avionicswest.com). the gps 175, gnc 355/355a, and gnx 375   all have the same gps unit, so all are covered by a single manual. the 355/355a has an added com, while the gnx 375 instead has ads-b in and out. this manual is $25 plus s&h ($3 in the us.

training classes
full day or hourly classes are offered on the chelton efis or garmin 400/500
series or 480 gps units, using docking stations to run them in their respective
demo modes on the desk.  powerpoint presentations for the specific unit,
describing all operations of the device, are used while  students (up to 3 at a time)
follow along on the gps.  training on the gtn 650/750 and g1000 is also available using computer simulators. the courses all begin with a "getting started"
section and then proceed to cover all of the major uses of the device: using
maps; getting information from it's database; making and editing flight plans;
using the autopilot; importing datalink, fuel, and traffic information; adding
procedures and flying them; and any other subject specific to each device.


to take a class, send me an e-mail (click here or send to thomassen@avionicswest.com) to work
  out a schedule.  classes are held in grass valley, ca.  fly
commercially to sacramento (ksmf) and rent a car (1.2 hours), or fly to the
grass valley airport (kgoo) where i will arrange transportation.  i
personally conduct all classes.
gps articles
there is a commonality among gps receivers in the principles behind them. 
  here are links   to my articles on various fundamental concepts that bear on how a gps works.  these
  include the concept of flight legs, sequencing, autopilot commands from legs,
gps altitude, vertical courses, etc.  click on them to learn more.

about the author/trainer
i'm keith thomassen, the author of the manuals and the workshop trainer. i
earned my first pilots certificate in 1958 and pursued a professional career of
scientific research and teaching while expanding my aviation
interests.  with a phd in electrical engineering from stanford university
i carried out fusion energy research at stanford, mit, the los alamos national
laboratory, and the lawrence livermore national laboratory.  during my
career i held professorships at mit and uc berkeley, and also taught courses at
stanford, ucla, and harvard.  i am a flight instructor, with airplane,
instrument, and glider ratings.  on retirement i developed a strong
interest in all things gps, have been giving gps classes since 2002, and have
written for several aviation magazines in addition to publishing the manuals
described here. i am available for talks to flying clubs, for fbo seminars, and
educational talks on various avionics topics.
dedication
this website formerly belonged to my training partner tom rogers, at one time
the owner of avionics west in santa maria, ca.  after selling that business
he moved to tennessee where he maintained this site for his business, avionics
west of tennessee.  tom was a great friend, and his passing in october,
2009 left us all saddened. with his business now closed, this site will be used
to promote gps use and understanding, with articles and items of interest as time goes on.  we
miss you tom.
