with josh white jr in 
													dallas, texas

 






													happy new year friends!



													i hope you all had wonderful 
													holidays!



													the last year certainly took 
													its toll. during its closing 
													days we said goodbye to yet 
													another old friend, josh 
													white, jr. josh was a 
													beautiful soul and an 
													amazing artist. it was my 
													privilege to share the stage 
													with him more than once and 
													it was impossible to be in 
													his company and not feel the 
													joy of his spirit. he will 
													be deeply missed.


 
 
 


 




													this year's new 
													beginnings-next step holiday 
													feast was a great success!

 



													 



													we had a wonderful time 
													assembling the new 
													beginnings-next step family 
													for a seasonal get-together 
													the week before christmas. 
													along with great food and 
													the warmth of kinship, we 
													were able to help our 
													returning citizens with some 
													of their christmas shopping 
													by providing them with $100 
													target gift cards. none of 
													this work would be possible 
													without the donations of my 
													fans and friends. thank you 
													from the bottom of my heart!



													i'd like to share a new 
													lyric with you. it was 
													written in response to two 
													conversations i had 
													recently. one was with a 
													dear jewish friend who feels 
													trapped between two mighty 
													tides within her spirit. one 
													of these currents consists 
													of the powerful retributive 
													impulses and fears she deals 
													with in the face of this 
													country's rising white and 
													"christian" nationalism as 
													well as the barbarism and 
													horror that was unleashed 
													upon her beloved israel. the 
													other force is the deep and 
													unshakable goodness of her 
													heart and her impulse to 
													condemn all violence (even 
													that which is framed as 
													just), striving to reject 
													hate in the face of 
													everything. the fact that 
													she trusted this ongoing 
													struggle to me touched me 
													very deeply and, to me, was 
													proof of the essential 
													beauty of the spirit that 
													drew me to her as a friend 
													from the start.the 
													other inspiration for this 
													song is a former gang member 
													who is currently finishing a 
													long sentence in prison. he 
													is part of one of my weekly 
													new beginnings groups and as 
													we approached the holidays, 
													he confided that he dealt 
													with the deep sadness that 
													this season always brings to 
													our incarcerated brothers 
													and sisters by spending all 
													day christmas eve preparing 
													a giant "boona" feast for 
													the men on his pod.
													now for those like me who 
													werent familiar with the 
													term, boona is slang for the 
													many ingenious (and i'm 
													assured, delicious) dishes 
													that offenders prepare from 
													basic ingredients available 
													in the average prison 
													commissary. things like 
													ramen noodles, canned tuna 
													(tuna boona is famous!) 
													mayonnaise, cheese powder, 
													crushed crackers, canned 
													sausages, and honeybuns are 
													combined to produce 
													epicurean delights.
													my friend begins by 
													orchestrating a tier-wide 
													offender donation-drive to 
													which all the residents 
													contribute some ingredient 
													(this is important as 
													involving the generosity of 
													all is crucial to the 
													mutuality of the event), and 
													then (and he had 
													verification from group 
													members who have dined in 
													years past) spends hours 
													transforming this relatively 
													unappetizing litany into the 
													most eagerly anticipated 
													meal of the calendar year. 
													this yearly act of 
													extravagant generosity lifts 
													him from his sorrow and 
													enables him to find some joy 
													even on the most difficult 
													of days.anyway, what 
													my two friends shared, about 
													fighting through their own 
													different kinds of darkness 
													ended up becoming these 
													words:


when your wounds become 
													your wings by 
													john flynn


													not so long ago there was a 
													timei could not gaze on 
													yours or show you mine
													but you learn to bear the 
													tears of thingswhen you 
													let your wounds become your 
													wings


													the blood upon your feathers 
													starts to shinewith the 
													dawn as silently you climb
													above the arrows earthbound 
													archers slingwhen you 
													let your wounds become your 
													wings




													and what the world below 
													would call your scars
now lift you closer 
													to the morning stars
when a 
													heart so broken by the past
													stays open to love's 
													kindnesses at last




													stronger for the frailites 
													that you've known
													shaped like clay not broken 
													like a stoneyour once 
													clenched throat begins to 
													laugh and singwhen you 
													let your wounds become your 
													wings


not turning from or 
													tempted to disdainothers 
													who would shelter from their 
													painin the prisons of 
													their suffering'til they 
													let their wounds become 
													their wings


and what the world below 
													would call your scarsnow 
													lift you closer to the 
													morning stars
when a 
													heart so broken by the past
													stays open to love's 
													kindnesses at last




													shame falls like your shadow 
													far belowjoy is 
													just a quiet thing you know
													coming into kinship with all 
													thingswhen you let your 
													wounds become your wings




													unhealed and yet no longer 
													afraidsomehow 
													resurected and remadethe 
													spacious sky is wild and 
													welcomingwhen you let 
													your wounds become your 
													wings

with 
															john legend before 
															singing at a get out 
															the vote event 



													hi friends,hope you 
													had a great thanksgiving!
i continue to be humbled 
													by the incredible teachers i 
													find among many of the 
													incarcerated and returning 
													citizens i work with in new 
													beginnings and next step. 
													gratitude for simple things 
													seems to be a way of seeing 
													the world for many of our 
													guys. take this text message 
													i received from someone who 
													was released from prison 
													back in september:
													"good afternoon john i just 
													wanted to share my joy with 
													you i'm cutting green beans, 
													prepped the turkey, and gave 
													my little guy his dog treat 
													and tears are running down 
													my face cause this time last 
													year i was getting ready to 
													serve a bunch of guys in 
													white, man this is such a 
													great feeling ... i need to 
													share this cause it's too 
													exciting (sic) not to but 
													for two i have to give 
													thanks to god, you and new 
													beginnings for this joy 
													thank you"god bless 
													all the folks whose 
													donations make it 
													possible for me to devote so 
													much time to my work with 
													nb-ns. as greg boyle 
													contiually points out, we go 
													to the margins, not to 
													change the people we meet 
													there, but to be changed by 
													them. i can attest to this.
as for beth and me, we 
													got together with about 
													sixty family members (the 
													first time since the 
													pandemic) and had a blast 
													catching up, meeting the 
													newest members of the clan, 
													eating, and singing the old 
													songs. it's no secret that 
													my political leanings don't 
													match up with most of my 
													extended tribe, but none of 
													that mattered a lick, as we 
													just basked in the glow of 
													something much. much deeper. 
													it was a joy!




i hadn't met my 
															little cousin 
															before, but music 
															changes everything. after 
															we got done all the 
															after dinner singing 
															and put away the 
															guitars, he toddled 
															over and climbed on 
															up..


													.as many of my 
													friends predicted, i 
													couldn't help but write 
													something to mark the 
													passing of my old friend and 
													hero kris kristofferson. the 
													new song is called "kris's 
													rules, and its chorus 
													quotes kris from a magazine 
													interview i read many years 
													ago. i originally 
													showed the new lyrics to 
													kris's wife lisa to make 
													sure it was ok to quote him 
													in my song. lisa not only 
													graciously permitted this 
													but suggested that i list 
													kris as a co-writer (i had 
													intended to attribute the 
													lines as "used by 
													permission"). adding kris's 
													name as a co-writer to a 
													song of mine is truly one of 
													the biggest honors of my 
													songwriting career. here are 
													the lyrics:kriss 
													rules by john flynn and kris 
													kristoffersonjust a 
													couple days ago i heard 
													youd slipped away no 
													one but my old guitar to cry 
													with so i playedall 
													those songs you wrote and 
													after id sung each one 
													througha voice inside me 
													seemed to say boy, now its 
													up to youwhat is that 
													supposed to mean i asked to 
													no one therethe sadness 
													like my question seemed to 
													hang in empty airbut 
													then as if your spirit stood 
													there with me in the room
													i could hear you telling me 
													just what i had to do
tell the truth sing with 
													passionwork with 
													laughter love with heart 
													tell the truth sing with 
													passionwork with 
													laughter love with heart
you used to remind us 
													all what william blake had 
													saidthat sorrow and 
													confusion haunt the living 
													and the deadshould they 
													turn their backs upon the 
													lives theyve been called to
													for poets, saints, and 
													fools like me the way to 
													honor you istell the 
													truth sing with passion
													work with laughter love with 
													heart tell the truth 
													sing with passionwork 
													with laughter love with 
													hearti have no place 
													to lay this heartache or my 
													gratitudeso ill just 
													keep on doing what i think 
													im called to doblessed 
													because i came to know a 
													hero as a friendwho 
													tried to help me understand 
													what matters in the end
tell the truth sing with 
													passionwork with 
													laughter love with heart 
													tell the truth sing with 
													passionwork with 
													laughter love with heart
just a couple days ago i 
													heard youd slipped away
"kris's rules" will be 
													included on my next album, 
													but for those who'd like to 
													hear it sooner, here's a 
													link to an early cell phone 
													video  

													https://youtu.be/jtfsjruwdxo?si=x5hxjd1uzl9y4pwy
i'll kick off the 
													christmas season with two 
													special shows this weekend. 
													on friday december 6th, i'll 
													be in kennett square, pa

10/13/24hi friends,
just a quick note to share 
												some thoughts and a new song.
news of the loss of kris 
												kristofferson hit many of us 
												hard. it was no secret that kris 
												was a hero and a friend. one 
												of those who reached out to me 
												after hearing the news was my 
												friend greg boyle at homeboy 
												industries. father g is fond of 
												saying, "death is a punk". i 
												always liked that line a lot. to 
												me it means that death thinks it 
												takes everything. but it's wrong 
												because it can't touch the 
												gratitude, and it sure as hell 
												can't take the love.i 
												won't try to sum up what kris 
												meant to me in this note, but he 
												and his amazing wife lisa have 
												been incredibly generous to me 
												for going on twenty-five years.
												it had been a while 
												since i last saw my old friend. 
												attached is a photo from that 
												visit on his bus after a show in 
												glenside, pa. 







i'll always feel very 
												blessed by kris's friendship and 
												faith in me. there simply was 
												nobody better to have in your 
												corner. my thoughts and prayers 
												remain with his family and 
												friends.if you'd like to 
												hear some of my favorite 
												kristofferson tunes as well as a 
												few stories about kris, here's a 
												link to a special online event i 
												did. i'll warn you; it gets a 
												bit emotional at one point:

https://youtu.be/xeil6no9oqu?si=3g4r8rsyuvqrw4us
over the years, kris was 
												kind enough to sing on many of 
												my recordings. one of them, 
												"malala" was about the youngest 
												person to ever win the nobel 
												peace prize. given the 
												unparalleled stakes of the 
												upcoming election, i decided to 
												rewrite the lyrics to "malala" 
												and re-sing the song (of course 
												minus my old friend's wonderful 
												harmonies).here's a link 
												to the new video of "kamala". (i 
												assure you that this will be the 
												first and last time you will get 
												to see me dance!) please check 
												out and share: 
https://youtu.be/vomsgtb1ynw?si=wfln2cqllaflfhln
and, of course, vote!!
peace,

													closing the 61st 
													philadelphia folk festival


hi friends,hope this 
											note finds you well!i had a 
											blast at this years philadelphia 
											folk festival where i got to mc the 
											friday and saturday evening main 
											stage, and then close out the fest 
											on sunday night.my sunday 
											night set was special to me since 
											one of my younger brothers attended 
											(the first time any of my siblings 
											came to one of my performances in 
											many years). i don't think it 
											betrays any confidences or makes my 
											extended family special to admit 
											that we don't always agree on things 
											these days. that's the main reason 
											why i included a new song in my set 
											that night. i shared the 
											lyrics of "what would my brother do" 
											in my last post card. here's a link 
											to my performance of this song on 
											the martin guitar stage:

											https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7itdx_rgou
if you'd like to check out my 
											whole pff set you can find it here:

hanging with some new 
													friends at camp dreamcatcher


and now for a change! with this 
											note i'm temporarily putting aside 
											my near-constant efforts to raise 
											money for new beginnings-next step 
											in order to... you guessed it... 
											raise money for another cause that 
											is very dear to my heart. camp 
											dreamcatcher is a therapeutic summer 
											camp for children whose lives have 
											been infected or affected by 
											aids/hiv. i've been involved with 
											dreamcatcher for twenty-eight years, 
											both as a fundraiser as well as 
											singing for the kids at camp each 
											summer. 




going "over the edge" 
													for camp dreamcatcher



at 1pm on september 28, i 
											will once more attempt to rappel 
											down the side of an eight-story 
											building in kennett square, pa in an 
											effort to raise $1000 for camp. (at 
											this writing i'm $150 short of my 
											goal, but neither camp nor i would 
											mind exceeding the $1k goal.) 
those who follow this page may 
											remember my admitted discomfort with 
											heights. (ok, fear, alright? there i 
											said it! let's call it what it is! 
											fear of heights!) anyway, my 
											rappelling experience last year led 
											me to the write the song "i'd rather 
											die while i'm alive". god knows what 
											this year holds in store. i hope you 
											will consider supporting this very 
											worthy cause and donating to my 
											fundraising page: (https://www.classy.org/fundraiser/5623307)
											after my (now annual) 
											afternoon bullfight with gravity on 
											9/28, i will be heading to 
											villanova, pa to perform that 
											evening at my favorite house 
											concert, musical lairs. i've 
											probably been playing ml for as long 
											as i've been working with 
											dreamcatcher. it's always a special 
											show with a wonderful audience. i'm 
											looking forward to seeing lots of 
											old friends! here's a link for info:
											
											http://www.musicallairs.org/
in the meantime, this coming 
											saturday, september 21st, i will be 
											appearing in a free 6pm concert at 
											our lady of guadalupe church in 
											doylestown, pa. (https://www.olguadalupe.org/events)
on october 11 i'll be in leola, 
											pa.
											
											https://www.musicatmapleandmain.com
my work in the prisons goes 
											well. the men in our newest support 
											group at the james t. vaughn 
											correctional institution continue to 
											astonish me with their courage and 
											willingness to invest deeply in the 
											idea that there is not only a better 
											way to live, but that together we 
											can help each other find that way. 
											as one young man said in group last 
											week. "i've never been where i'm 
											trying to go". welcome to 
											the journey, brother!peace,


ps. i'm currently slotted 
											for a couple shows in texas in early 
											january. the problem is that i 
											currently don't have quite enough on 
											my dance card to offset the costs 
											involved (air-fare, car rental, 
											motel). if you have any leads on a 
											house concert down there please give 
											them (or me) a shout. 



 




6/21/24
at the kerrville folk festival



										hi friends,

										hope this note finds you well!

										my recent shows in texas and oklahoma 
										went great! it was wonderful catching up 
										with old friends and making a few new 
										ones. 



										with alt-country music legend ray wylie 
										hubbard
 
as i came off stage at kerrville i ran 
										into ray wylie hubbard. ray seemed to 
										think i needed to be playing more shows 
										in texas and we traded cell numbers in 
										order to kick around some ideas. 

										it was only a few days after i got back 
										to delaware that this swap of contact 
										info inspired a new lyric:

										______________________________________________

										butt dialed 

										i got butt dialed by ray wylie hubbard
										i got liner notes by kris kristofferson
										
										i rode upon the city of new orleans 
										with arlo and the whole dang guthrie 
										clan
										i have shared the mic with willie nelson
										
										backed up old pete seger on harpoon
										i got butt dialed by ray wylie hubbard
										guess folk music is bound to pay off 
										soon

										when my son was just thirteen or 
										fourteen
										he kidded me about my career goals
										said dad the antithesis of a rock star
										must surely be a folk music black hole
										and though from time to time there have 
										been moments
										when i admit i thought the kid was right
										something in my pocket just vibrated 
										and i cant second guess my life tonight
										

										i got butt dialed by ray wylie hubbard
										i got liner notes by kris kristofferson
										
										i rode upon the city of new orleans 
										with arlo and the whole dang guthrie 
										clan
										i have shared the mic with willie nelson
										
										backed up old pete seger on harpoon
										i got butt dialed by ray wylie hubbard
										guess folk music is bound to pay off 
										soon

										i get a chance to sing and speak out 
										boldy
										to say things that i think need to be 
										said
										i get to exorcise the ghosts and demons
										that otherwise would haunt my heart and 
										head 
										i get to sleep on all manner of couches
										and make all kinds of friends across 
										this land
										theres probly better ways to make a 
										living
										but theres no better way to live my 
										friends 

										than get butt dialed by ray wylie 
										hubbard
										and get liner notes by kris 
										kristofferson 
										and ride upon the city of new orleans
										
										with arlo and the whole dang guthrie 
										clan
										i have shared the mic with willie nelson
										
										hung out with ramblin jack in old 
										saloons
										i got butt dialed by ray wylie hubbard
										guess folk music is bound to pay off 
										soon
										this folk music is bound to pay off soon
john flynn's lyrics

										music 
______________________________________________

										in other news, i'm delighted to announce 
										that i'm now being represented by the 
										gary good entertainment and speakers 
										bureau 
										(https://www.garygood.com/). as 
										an agent and promoter gary good has 
										worked some of the most successful 
										artists in the business. he's a great 
										guy and i'm really excited about some of 
										the ideas he has for getting me back out 
										on the road a bit more than i have been 
										these past few years.

										new beginnings-next step is also 
										breaking new ground. we are now running 
										support groups in yet another level five 
										prison. last week we held our first new 
										beginnings meeting inside the james t. 
										vaughn correctional facility in smyrna, 
										delaware. 

										while i'm very grateful that the 
										delaware bureau of prisons has allowed 
										us this wonderful opportunity to begin 
										building relationships with some of the 
										men inside vaughn, what i'm most excited 
										about is that they have approved two of 
										our phenomenal returning citizens as 
										volunteers to accompany me inside the 
										facility for this weekly group. 


										with ty mathis and anthony jackson after 
										our inaugural new beginnings 
										meeting at 
										the james t. vaughn correctional center
										
										(photo by nb volunteer cruce stark)

										the vaughn facility is unlike gander 
										hill prison in that many of the men we 
										will work with will not be leaving 
										prison soon (or possibly ever). since 
										our focus has traditionally been on men 
										who were "short" (nearing the ends of 
										their sentences), i consulted with our 
										next step members to see if they thought 
										we could bring anything of value to 
										those who may still facing lengthy 
										periods of incarceration. i was assured 
										by our returning citizens that freedom 
										begins interiorly and that weekly new 
										beginnings groups could be of great help 
										to those still facing a lot of time 

										these longer sentences notwithstanding, 
										between howard r. young, the plummer 
										center and james t. vaughn, we are 
										already seeing an increase in the number 
										of weekly bus passes and grocery store 
										gift cards that we distribute to our 
										returning citizen members. to date, 
										almost all the money that nb-ns raises 
										comes from my friends and fans. if you 
										are one of our regular donors, you have 
										my deepest gratitude. if not, please 
										consider going to our web site at 
										www.newbeginnings-next step.org
										and 
										donating. we are a registered 501(c)(3) 
										and your donation would be completely 
										tax deductible. feel free to write me 
										for more information. or call 1-877 i 
										got out. you can also visit our web site 
										at 
										www.newbeginnings-nextstep.org.


										i have some exciting shows coming up.
										

										friday night, june 28th, i will be 
										sharing a co-bill with my friend craig 
										bickhardt at a free outdoor concert in 
										bryn mawr, pa. (www.brynmawrtwilightconcerts.com)

										this summer will also find me performing 
										in wilmington, delaware; chester 
										springs, pennsylvania; middleberg, new 
										york; the omega institute in rhine beck, 
										new york; and at the highly anticipated 
										return of the mighty philadelphia folk 
										festival (www.folkfest.org). 

										please visit my web site for updates on 
										these performances. 
										(www.johnflynn.net/shows)

										i'll leave you with another new lyric. 
										this one has been kicking around in me 
										for a while. the seed for this song was 
										planted during a zoom conversation i had 
										with folksinger/activist charlie king 
										after a podcast he and i did with john 
										mccutcheon. (https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/nerfa).

										i haven't recorded this one yet but am 
										thinking about it since it seems we 
										could all use a little reminder to look 
										deeper than the labels we too often 
										mistakenly slap on each other. 

										much love,

										john with quincey thomas and corie 
										priest



										hi friends,


										the photo above captured a very proud 
										moment outside a courtroom in dover, 
										delaware as my friend quincey thomas has 
										just been recommended for a pardon. it 
										was an absolute honor to be invited to 
										stand with q before the pardon board.
										

										i first got to know quincey fourteen 
										years ago in my new beginnings group in 
										the howard r. young correctional 
										institution. it has been one of the 
										great privileges of my life to walk with 
										him as he's rebuilt his life in the 
										decade since he left prison. not only is 
										quincey a current member of the new 
										beginnings-next step board of directors 
										(one of two returning citizens on our 
										board), but he is one of our new 
										volunteer prison group facilitators as 
										well. q continues to show me the meaning 
										of words like courage and resilience. 
										the paperwork for his pardon is now 
										going before the governor for signature.
										
										congratulations, q! were proud of you!


										i've got some exciting shows coming up!
										i'll be performing this saturday, april 
										13, at the 
friends quaker 
										meeting house in fallsington, pa at 
										3pm.my special guest will be 
										singer/songwriter amy duckett wagner. 
										you can get more information at
										
										www.fallsingtonmeeting.org. 

										next month i'll be in guthrie, oklahoma 
										as well as kerrville, texas where i'm 
										not only performing, but i get the honor 
										of emceeing the opening weekend of the 
										kerrville folk festival's annual new 
										folk competition for emerging 
										songwriters. (this competition is so 
										prestigious that they didn't even accept 
										me as a contestant back when i was just 
										starting out! so it feels especially 
										sweet to be asked to be part of it now.)
										




										i had an amazing time performing with 
										christine lavin and emily drinker last 
										month at the colonial theater in 
										phoenixville, pa as we remembered our 
										old friend gene shay and raised over 
										$30,000 for the philadelphia folk 
										festival. speaking of which, i'm excited 
										to announce that i'll be appearing at 
										the philly folk fest this summer. this 
										festival is a treasure. i hope my 
										friends in the philly region will come 
										out and see me.




										my streaming shows continue online 
										(about) every other friday night. you 
										can tune into "my b.a.d." (busk after 
										dusk) on april 19 and may 3rd at 7pm on 
										facebook (https://www.facebook.com/singwriter)
										

										or youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@singwriter272).
										


 


										peace and good on you,

the guys loved the new nb-ns hoodies 
										we gave out for christmas... 
										proud to know each of these men  
										(including our beloved webslinger and 
										new beginnings-next step group 
										facilitator rotten dan who's also 
										sporting our official logo ballcap)

										hi friends!

										hope 2024 is off to a great start for 
										you. it's shaping up to be very busy for 
										me.

										i've got some exciting shows coming up 
										this year, both locally and nationally. 
										i'll be telling you more about these in 
										coming weeks and months. but for now, i 
										hope my friends in maryland will come 
										out and see me this weekend. i'll be in 
										aberdeen this saturday night, january 
										20th.

										(https://www.eventbrite.com/e/heart-soul-concert-series-tickets-616081756117?aff=erellivmlt&fbclid=iwar23qis48me-mq_mxs4d9_incmejv_vomagnn_kzai5iwsv0ptecdiujsm4)
										

										then, i'll be returning to one of my 
										favorite house concerts in the whole 
										country the following day when i visit 
										rockville, md on january 21st to perform 
										in the folk 'n great music series. 
										reservations can be made through this 
										link: 


										https://www.folkngreatmusic.org/reservations-info/?fbclid=iwar1c_cafuu-2tgptafpmsgiujeglmk9uxoymmjewzejjjh0qyzjyvnwujkk

										i sure hope to see you.

										in other news , we're wrapping up the 
										recording of (i think) my fourteenth 
										album. i truly believe it contains some 
										of the best songs i've ever written, and 
										my friend harvey has once again blown me 
										away with his production. i can't wait 
										for folks to hear this one. stay tuned!

										i'd like to take this opportunity to 
										thank all of you who donated to my 
										non-profit new beginnings-next step in 
										2023! your ongoing support is making a 
										real difference in the lives of the men 
										we work with. in the past year, new 
										beginnings-next step has had some 
										exciting developments, including:

										the formation of a second weekly peer 
										support group at the howard 
										r. young correctional institution. this 
										group is run by an entirely new 
										volunteer team (in 20 years, this is the 
										first time weve sponsored a group in 
										which i am not directly involved. i 
										realized that we needed to move beyond 
										my personal participation in every group 
										if we are to meet future challenges).

										 the introduction of a new group 
										facilitator who himself was a former new 
										beginnings member and did thirteen years 
										in prison. he now goes back inside with 
										us each week to help men prepare for the 
										challenges of freedom. this man is a 
										hero and powerful symbol of hope to our 
										incarcerated members. (i hope someday to 
										have many more returning citizens on our 
										volunteer teams. this represented a big 
										change in doc policy which took me years 
										of lobbying to bring about.)

										 the approval by the new warden 
										in georgetown, de to begin a new 
										beginnings group at the sussex 
										correctional institution. 

										also, recently three 
										returning citizens who had each just 
										competed extremely long prison sentences 
										were recently flowed down or 
										fast-tracked for 
										early completion of probation. when 
										asked why, their probation 
										officers sited weekly attendance at our 
										next step meetings as indication of the 
										mens serious intent to make a fresh 
										start. word about us is evidently 
										getting around. 

										your donations helped us provide weekly 
										bus passes and grocery store gift-cards, 
										as well as other special-needs items, to 
										our returning citizen members. i hope 
										you will continue to follow and support 
										the work of new beginnings-next step as 
										we continue our fight against recidivism 
										by accompanying men from incarceration 
										to freedom. we believe people change 
										because of relationships. you help us 
										make these relationships possible. 

										much love,

									hi friends,




									i hope you all had a wonderful thanksgiving!

									my annual holiday show to benefit camp 
									dreamcatcher will take place on saturday 
									december 9th at the kennett flash in kennett 
									square, pa. they tell me i've been doing 
									these shows for something like 27 years now, 
									so i guess this definitely qualifies as a 
									tradition. i hope you'll come out and help 
									support this very special therapeutic summer 
									camp for kids dealing with aids/hiv. there's 
									more information here:
									
									https://www.kennettflash.org/event/john-flynns-annual-holiday-concert-to-benefit-camp-dreamcatcher/kennett-flash/kennett-square-pennsylvania/

									on thursday december 14th, i'll be 
									performing a few songs at the screening of a 
									very special documentary called "the long 
									journey home" that deals with the challenges 
									combat veterans faced as they returned from 
									vietnam. the film will be shown at jamey's 
									house of music in. lansdowne, pa. you can 
									find out more here:
									
									https://www.jameyshouseofmusic.com/

									there's a lot happening with new 
									beginnings-next step these days. there's 
									been so much interest in the peer support 
									groups we run for incarcerated and returning 
									citizens that we've added a second weekly 
									meeting at the howard r. young correctional 
									institution. we're also continuing in the 
									plummer community correctional facility, and 
									starting in january, we've been approved to 
									begin weekly new beginnings meetings at the 
									sussex county correctional institution down 
									in georgetown, delaware. 

									these new groups will mean more guys to help 
									with weekly bus passes and grocery store 
									gift cards in the new year. i always try to 
									do an annual fundraising concert for nbns, 
									but a variety of reasons made that 
									impossible this year, so i will be 
									performing a special "my b.a.d." (busk after 
									dusk) on friday night, december 15th, at 7pm 
									for nbns. you can watch the show on facebook 
									(https://www.facebook.com/singwriter) 
									or youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@singwriter272). 
									and i hope you will consider making a 
									tax-deductible donation to the work of our 
									non-profit new beginnings-next step inc. 
									through this paypal link:









									i've recently been reminded that gratitude 
									in life doesn't follow joy as much as joy 
									seems to be a byproduct of remaining 
									grateful. i believe this to be true and i'm 
									deeply grateful for all your support in my 
									work.


									peace and good on you,



 

going "over the edge"

										hi all,

										just a quick note to tell you i survived 
										my fundraising adventure with camp 
										dreamcatcher where i managed to face up 
										to my discomfort with heights by 
										rappelling down the side of an 
										eight-story building in kennett square, 
										pa. it was truly an amazing experience. 
										i was especially gratified to exceed my 
										fundraising goal for camp, and would 
										like to thank all of you who donated so 
										generously!

										i had a blast opening for my longtime 
										friend dar williams last friday at the 
										arden gild hall in wilmington. dar is a 
										deeply committed and extremely generous 
										artist. i really enjoyed getting to hear 
										her again, as well as share some of my 
										songs and stories with her audience. i 
										was especially heartened by the 
										enthusiastic response to the three brand 
										new tunes i included in my set. 

										in other news, new beginnings-next step 
										is proud to be taking part in delaware 
										peace week, nine days of free statewide 
										events to promote community solutions 
										that will bring delawareans more 
										peace. please join me at the episcopal 
										church of saints andrew and matthew on 
										wednesday night october 11th (and yeah, 
										i know there's a phillies game!), where 
										several of our returning citizen members 
										and volunteers will speak about creating 
										hope and building resilience through the 
										power of relationship. the church is at 
										719 shipley st, wilmington, delaware, 
										19801. i'm deeply proud to be friends 
										with all the folks who will be speaking. 
										i anticipate a very special evening and 
										i hope you'll think about joining us.

										finally, ill be doing a house concert 
										in flourtown pa at another chance café 
										on october 28th. reservations are 
										required. for more info simply email 
										concert hosts eric & jenny at:
										
										anotherchancecafe22@gmail.com with 
										subject line reading "john flynn house 
										concert at another chance cafe.

										below, i'll leave you with the lyrics to 
										another new song. thanks for your 
										continued support of my work.

										peace,



										a simple song of peace 

										a couple nights ago i dreamt i wrote a 
										special song
										it wasnt complicated and it wasnt very 
										long
										i took my old guitar and went and played 
										it in the streets
										and people gathered round to hear a 
										simple song of peace

										what started as a tiny crowd would soon 
										become a throng
										and everyone who heard me sing began to 
										sing along
										their voices then were lifted up and 
										carried on the breeze
										til all across the land was heard a 
										simple song of peace

										from east and west from north and south 
										i heard a single choir 
										the singing seemed to take away our fear 
										though times were dire
										then news came from around the world 
										that war and violence ceased
										as love at last was set free by a simple 
										song of peace

										i shook my head remembering the long and 
										lonely years
										when every song i wrote would seem to 
										fall upon deaf ears
										yet all those moments of self-doubt had 
										somehow lead to these
										tears filled my eyes then as i sang that 
										simple song of peace

										a child in the crowd came up and tugged 
										upon my sleeve
										he said youre only dreaming john and 
										now its time to leave
										and just before i woke i whispered to 
										myself oh please
										when you wake do not forget the simple 
										song of peace

										i woke and lay in darkness in those 
										hours before the dawn
										anguished to discover that the song of 
										peace was gone
										'til birds outside my window started 
										singing in the trees
										and i smiled to hear again a simple song 
										of peace

										theres a simple song of peace in each 
										and every thing
										rocks and birds and trees and waters if 
										were listening
										were all radios tuned in to quantum 
										frequencies 
										the universe is singing us a simple song 
										of peace

										usually win when i sing...).





										september 23, 2023

										hi friends,

										a while back i wrote a song called 
										"trust the rope". now, it looks like i'm 
										going to have a chance to put my money 
										(or at least my body) where my mouth is.

										on friday morning, september 29th, i 
										will attempt to rappel down the side of 
										an eight story building in kennett 
										square, pa to raise $1000 for camp 
										dreamcatcher. 

										those of you who have followed my music 
										know that i've been involved with 
										dreamcatcher, a therapeutic summer camp 
										for kids dealing with aids/hiv, from 
										their start 27 years ago, doing annual 
										summer concerts and winter fund-raisers 
										for their kids. the courage of the young 
										people i've met at camp over the years 
										has never failed to inspire me. indeed, 
										that's partly why i'm doing this. you 
										see, i'm not real crazy about heights.

										about a year before he passed away, i 
										met bruce utah philips, who invited me 
										to his home and showed me an immense 
										tree house he was having built in a 
										redwood that towered above his backyard. 
										he explained that hed always had a 
										terrible fear of heights, and knew he 
										was running out of time to do something 
										about it. 

										i'll be thinking of bruce friday morning 
										as i lean back and... step off. i hope 
										you'll consider supporting my little 
										waltz with gravity by making a donation 
										here:
										
										https://fundraise.givesmart.com/vf/dreamote/johnflynn?fbclid=iwar22a5qw-m_e-p59sfjrid_twhttwxbhp6sltu3svrr4cbqx5jpyri3zlyg

										honestly, the whole thing has been 
										weighing on me a bit. we irish 
										appreciate a bit of dark irony, and at 
										one point i laughed out loud when it 
										occurred to me that, should anything go 
										wrong, at least i'd die while i was 
										alive. of course, i can't let the idea 
										for a good song title go to waste. this 
										is one of two lyrics that followed:


										id rather die while im alive 

										my neighbor harolds 93 hes such a 
										happy dude
										says every day above the grounds a gift
										hes had his share of tough breaks but 
										hes filled with gratitude
										says john thats the way i got to live 
										if

										im gonna die while im alive
										i want to live not just survive
										we get to make a choice and id
										rather die while im alive

										once a giant oak tree fell demolishing 
										his house
										the roof went crashing down upon his 
										head
										i ran inside the rubble found him 
										laughing on his couch
										if thats the price for loving trees he 
										said

										id rather die while im alive
										i want to live not just survive
										we get to make a choice and id
										rather die while im alive

										you can call god him or her, he doesn't 
										give a damn
										universe or higher power even son of man
										harold says love brought us here and 
										love is why we stay
										and without love wed just all begin to 
										fade away

										my neighbor harolds 93 hes such a 
										happy guy
										says every day above the grounds a 
										chance
										to read a book or crack a joke or look 
										up at the sky
										there aint no way hes sitting out the 
										dance

										hed rather die while he's alive
										he wants to live not just survive
										says we all get a choice and id
										rather die while im alive

										we get to make a choice and id
										rather to die while im alive


										on friday night at 7pm, you can tune 
										into my b.a.d (busk at dusk) concert on 
										my facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/singwriter/) 
										or youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@singwriter272) 
										to hear how it all went down. 

										in other news, ill be part of the 
										greenwich village folk festival this 
										sunday, october 1st. here's a link to 
										the online show:
										
										https://greenwichvillagefolkfestival.org/live-stream.php

										i'm also looking forward to opening for 
										my old friend dar williams at delawares 
										arden gild hall on october 6th-

										see you soon (i hope)!

										peace and good on you,

										hi friends,

i'll be doing a 
										concert this week at delaware's 
										beautiful bellevue state park. (https://destateparks.com/concerts/bellevue).


										_____________________________________
 



finishing the rock hall triathlon 
										on the eastern shore of the 
										chesapeake bay a few days after my 66th 
										birthday

										_________________________________


										last week, i received a photo on my 
										phone. i haven't reposted it because i 
										don't want to violate anyone's privacy, 
										but it was a beautiful picture of two 
										men shaking hands.

										one of the men in the picture is a good 
										friend, a new beginnings-next step alum 
										who i'd met in prison seven or eight 
										years ago. although this gentleman moved 
										out of state shortly after prison, he 
										has continued to be an integral part of 
										our returning citizens community and is 
										a regular attender of our next step zoom 
										meetings. 

										my friend has also been very successful. 
										he started with a job flipping burgers 
										and has parlayed hard work and 
										incredible perseverance into a regional 
										manager position for a well-known 
										chicken chain where mentors and impacts 
										the lives of the many young people he 
										hires. he often shares his personal 
										history with these kids so that they 
										will know that today's story doesn't 
										always have to be tomorrow's. anyway, 
										this evening my friend sent me the 
										picture of a man he'd met who was living 
										on the street. 

										my friend notices the world and will not 
										simply step over someone down on their 
										luck. he remembers too well what it 
										means to be in that situation himself. 
										the homeless man was beaming and wearing 
										the uniform of an employee. he was 
										shaking my friend's hand, having just 
										started his new job. the caption beneath 
										the photo read 'this is how we save 
										lives'.

										i've met so many men that the world has 
										at one point judged to be disposable. in 
										new beginnings- next step we reject that 
										label. and we send each other pictures 
										as proof.

										on the day before my 66th birthday, a 
										relative of mine asked me how i could 
										possibly choose to have gray whiskers on 
										my face' especially since my hair color 
										hasn't really changed too noticeably 
										yet. i wasn't sure if he was suggesting 
										i color my beard or shave it off, but he 
										simply couldn't understand how i could 
										opt to look so' old. 
 

										birthday candles can always be a cause 
										for some reflection and this question 
										certainly contributed to that impulse.
										

										what does it mean to be old' beyond the 
										date on your drivers license i mean. how 
										does it affect your life' what is, as 
										william james would say, the cash value'
										

										i know that's a big question and one 
										that would change from person to person. 
										so far, my family and i have been very 
										lucky with health stuff, so that lets me 
										focus on other aspects of aging. 

										i guess what i'm trying to say is that, 
										at this time in my life, i believe i'm 
										writing better, worrying less, and 
										loving more deeply. i'm experiencing 
										more awe and gratitude each day than at 
										any time in my life since i was a boy' 
										i'm enjoying knowing my kids as adults 
										and cheering them on as they embark of 
										their own journeys, and oh yeah, 
										moreover i'm a freakin' grandpa, which 
										is one of the best gigs in the world.
										

										and, just my opinion here, if there's 
										one thing this society could use it's 
										more folks who embrace rather than avoid 
										the role of elder. i think it's 
										something that our young people both 
										long for and need. so, there's a reason 
										to do this aging thing as well as we 
										can.

										of course, it takes longer to do some 
										stuff. and i do find the occasional line 
										to my song playing hide and seek with my 
										memory as i'm performing. also, and this 
										is hard, at this age you've begun to 
										lose folks. friends. relatives. the 
										world is diminished with these losses. 
										and i realize the goodbyes will only 
										continue and grow more frequent with 
										time. 

										but that's kind of the deal, right' you 
										hit the lottery and beat the four 
										hundred trillion-to-one odds against you 
										ever drawing breath in this universe, 
										and you have to accept at some point 
										that there will come a time to pony up. 
										and strange as it seems, even this can 
										make this whole ride more precious. more 
										sacred. also (i know this isn't for 
										everyone but) i've got a faith, maybe 
										more of a trust, that even death doesn't 
										get the final word. 

										so, i guess, at least for the time 
										being, i'll keep the beard (but without 
										the shoe polish).

										________________________________
 

										i'm really excited about how the next 
										album is shaping up. below are the 
										lyrics of a couple of my newest songs. 
										one was inspired by an anonymous prayer 
										i received from my friend greg boyle at 
										homeboy industries. the other came from 
										an article in the new york times last 
										week about the commissioning of a new 
										ferry up in new york. they named the 
										vessel after a hero of mine.




sight (for sore eyes)

i have not come to 
										save you
										for when i look at you
										i do not see a damsel in distress
										i have not come to change you
										your desparado soul
										is perfect as it is though i confess

you say i'm a 
										sight for sore eyes
										but i think you and me are both half 
										blind
										you can't see the goodness that's inside 
										you
										i can't see quitting on a friend of mine

i have not come to 
										heal you
										you don't need to be cured
										the scars we bear are holier than 
										shrines
										if tears can teach our eyes to 
										see with tenderness
										the wounds that we've been tempted to 
										despise

you say i'm a 
										sight for sore eyes
										but i think you and me are both half 
										blind
										you can't see the goodness that's inside 
										you
										i can't see quitting on a friend of mine

maybe love ain't 
										nothing but a mirror
										one that shows you who you really are
										maybe mine can show you someone
										you have been a stranger to so far
										

i have not come to 
										fix you
										for i know deep inside
										you're not and never have been 
										powerless 
										but i will share the darkness
										that you are walking through
										until you find the light that you 
										possess

you say i'm a 
										sight for sore eyes
										but i think you and me are both half 
										blind
										you can't see the goodness that's inside 
										you
										i can't see quitting on a friend of mine
										no i ain't quitting on a friend of mine

for all whose 
										labors carry them from staten island's 
										brim 
										all day and night she leaves saint 
										george for lower manhattan 
										to dock at whitehall terminal across the 
										new york bay
										she'll take you there and back again the 
										good ship dorothy day 

you'll hear a 
										mighty groaning as she casts off all her 
										lines
										and makes way past the island where the 
										lady's torch still shines
										four thousand and five hundred souls 
										she'll carry on her way 
										there's never been a ferry like
										the good ship dorothy day 

named for a woman
										who refused 
										to let the world ignore 
										the  rights of workers, the cries of the 
										hungry and the poor
										in a world sick with fear
										she taught that love's the only cure 
										the only cure

taste the salty 
										spray and watch the freighters gliding 
										by
										hear gulls laugh as steel and glass fill 
										up the gotham sky
										not a penny for your passage will you 
										ever pay
										when you board the good ship dorothy day

she stood out at 
										the margins with the lost and with the

										she went to jail for human rights she 
										went to jail for peace
										they called her saint but she said i'll 
										not be dismissed that way
										that's why they named the good ship

she was a woman
										who refused 
										to let the world ignore 
										the  rights of workers, the cries of the

										in a world sick with fear
										she taught that love's the only cure 
										the only cure

										breathe the air and feel the rolling 
										beneath your feet
										rest yourself and let the crossing be a 
										brief retreat
										from your cares as you recall the woman 
										for whom they
										named this craft the good ship dorothy 
										day

an anarchist, an 
										activist, a convert to a creed,
										the founder of a movement who took care 
										of those in need
										a seeker for the better who would leave

										hi everybody!

										hope you're all doing well! we're having 
										a beautiful spring here in the mid 
										atlantic and i'm busier than have been 
										for quite a while. i'll singing up in 
										new england next weekend (info below) 
										and i'm releasing two singles in advance 
										of the road trip. both songs speak 
										directly to urgent issues that confront 
										us. "slaughter of the innocents" wasn't 
										originally a planned release. i wrote 
										the song last year after uvalde, but 
										hesitated to share it. afterall, i 
										already put a song out a song after 
										sandy hook just over ten years ago 
										called "you can't tell". i would have 
										never envisioned the need to write and 
										record a second song about the massacre 
										of school children in my country. 
										(tragically naive, huh') anyway, i had 
										to get it out there. 

										the release of "here be dragons", my new 
										song about global warming, was however 
										planned to come out now in time for 
										earth day. you can check them out here:

										we've recently started two additional 
										weekly groups for men in reentry. one at 
										the plummer correctional center (where 
										we had been for many years before the 
										pandemic) and one at project new start 
										on the campus of widener law school. 
										project new start provides classes for 
										returning citizens, primarily to help 
										them find and hold jobs upon release 
										from prison. i've always been a big fan 
										of theirs and was delighted to find that 
										they were interested in integrating 
										weekly new beginnings meetings for their 
										pupils.

										another new development - which for me 
										is very exciting... recently, a dear 
										friend of mine became the first 
										returning citizen to begin working with 
										me as a weekly new beginnings volunteer 
										inside a prison.

										including returning citizen volunteers 
										in our work inside the penitentiaries 
										has been a dream of mine for many years. 
										but a couple things always stood in the 
										way of it becoming a reality. the first 
										was the department of corrections' 
										policy prohibiting the 
										formerly-incarcerated from volunteering 
										inside prison for at least seven years 
										after the completion of their release. 
										while many of our next step members 
										remain close, a lot of life happens in 
										seven years and very few men remain 
										active in our program for that length of 
										time. families and jobs, all the things 
										that constitute successful reentry, 
										intervene and responsibilities increase 
										to the point that they simply don't have 
										the time - or the urgent need - for 
										weekly involvement. they are not 
										returning citizens. they are not 
										returned citizens. they are just 
										citizens. and this is as it should be.

										just prior to the pandemic i sat with 
										the commissioner of corrections and the 
										chief of the bureau of prisons and 
										explained that, as good a job as i felt 
										my teams were doing, volunteers who had 
										been through and overcome the challenges 
										of incarceration and reentry would raise 
										our game immeasurably. my example of aa 
										meetings being run by folks who had 
										never taken a drink seemed to resonate 
										and i was eventually told that the 
										number of post-prison years would be 
										reduced to three.

										my next obstacle was one i didn't really 
										anticipate. i have worked with hundreds 
										of incarcerated and retuning citizens 
										over the years and they are truly some 
										of the most courageous people it has 
										ever been my privilege to know. but when 
										i approached several about going back 
										into prison as weekly volunteers, they 
										all said no. some balked at the 
										intrusive paperwork needed to obtain 
										security clearances. some simply said 
										they'd never go inside a place like that 
										again. 

										one of our guys, greg, did agree to go 
										back inside as a guest speaker. although 
										the policy had been altered, real change 
										often happens slowly, and the warden 
										would only grant him one-time access. 
										greg's talk and subsequent q&a in the 
										prison chapel drew a huge crowd 
										(including the warden). he spoke 
										eloquently of his time in the prison, of 
										what our program had been to him ' how 
										he had found some peace for the first 
										time in his life ' and how he had 
										navigated the many pitfalls that awaited 
										him and threatened his recovery when he 
										got out. the reception he got from the 
										offenders present was incredible and, 
										afterwards, men in doc whites closed in 
										around him like he was a rockstar. he 
										was a symbol of hope, and there may be 
										nothing more powerful to a man in 
										prison. greg's talk only strengthened my 
										resolve that we needed returning 
										citizens as facilitators. 

										six months ago, i approached my friend 
										ty about joining our tuesday night team 
										at gander hill. like greg, ty is one of 
										my heroes. he's been out about four 
										years now and has been unwavering in his 
										commitment to staying out of prison. 'up 
										to staying free' as our t-shirts say. ty 
										immediately shot down my request. 'no 
										offense, john. but no way', he said.

										seven or eight weeks later i ran into ty 
										on the street and as we were catching up 
										he said, 'by the way' yes.' i instantly 
										knew what he was talking about. he said 
										the idea had taken root in his heart and 
										he wanted to go back inside with us. 

										when ty got cleared and finally walked 
										with us through the long bleak hallways 
										and sally ports of gander hill, i 
										watched him carefully. he was clearly 
										anxious. his eyes went everywhere. 
										especially to the faces of the men. 
										whenever we'd pass a line of offenders, 
										ty would say, 'what's up, fellas' (about 
										this he later said, 'i had to speak to 
										them. those men were me').

										ty's presence in group was powerful. 
										relaxed but with the low voltage hum of 
										electricity. he spoke in open, 
										unguarded, and deeply truthful ways. 
										word of his presence had preceded him, 
										and we had our biggest post-pandemic 
										attendance so far. 

										i've been running these groups in prison 
										for almost eighteen years and never once 
										had a man say as ty did, 'you all know 
										what i'm talking about. you all know 
										what it's like when they turn the lights 
										off at night and you turn to the wall in 
										your bunk while tears roll down your 
										face.' at these words each man in the 
										room lowered his gaze and nodded 
										silently. 

										as the men pressed in around ty at the 
										end of last night's group, one older 
										african american gentleman who'd been 
										"down for a minute' (which in the 
										understated language of prison means had 
										served a significant amount of time) 
										declared it the best group he'd ever 
										been to. i thought of steven stills' 
										words. something's happening here. and i 
										can't wait to see where it takes us. 
										welcome to the team, ty! 

										in other news i was honored to be asked 
										to take part in a recent "wisdom of the 
										elders" podcast for the northeast 
										regional folk alliance. the other guys 
										on the panel were my friends john 
										mccutcheon and charlie king. i found it 
										to be a genuine and surprisingly 
										emotional conversation. i'm including a 
										link:

										hello friends,

										i wanted to pass on some lines recently 
										sent to me by my friend father greg 
										boyle, the founder of homeboy industries 
										and author of the best-selling book 
										"tattoos on the heart". i had written to 
										father g seeking his advice as i second 
										guessed some recent decisions regarding 
										one of our returning citizens who was 
										slipping quickly back into a devastating 
										opiate addiction. father pointed out to 
										me that i was making the situation too 
										much about myself (this is a lesson i 
										seem to have to learn repeatedly). his 
										(very) early morning email from los 
										angeles gently reminded me that in 
										dealing with our brothers and sisters, 
										especially those whom our society has 
										casually disdained or demonized, heroes 
										are rarely required. he went on to 
										assure me that our shared humanity does 
										assign to us a humbler but far more 
										essential role. a role beautifully 
										illustrated by these simple words:

										an unnamed medicine woman writes this 
										prayer.

										"i will not rescue you,
										for you are not powerless.
										i will not fix you,
										for you are not broken.
										i will not heal you,
										for i see you in your wholeness.
										i will walk with you through the 
										darkness,
										as you remember your light."

										as father g wrote, "i'll have what she's 
										having".

										below are a few upcoming appearances. i 
										hope to see you soon.

										love,

delaware news journal cover story

										hi friends, 

										i hope this note finds you well. 

										things here definitely haven't been dull 
										as beth and i are recovering from our 
										first bouts of covid. fortunately, we 
										were both fully boosted and came through 
										just fine (although more than a week 
										after quarantine i'm still quite a bit 
										slower on my morning trail runs). 

										i truly enjoyed working with the 
										wonderful christine lavin as a co-emcee 
										of this year's 60th annual philadelphia 
										folk festival. among the highlights for 
										me was getting to introduce the amazing 
										livingston taylor who had given me some 
										very honest feedback on my fledgling 
										efforts as a songwriter some forty years 
										ago. rather than take the easy way out 
										and offering some (at that point) 
										probably unmerited praise of my early 
										efforts, livingston took the time to 
										listen thoroughly and then challenged me 
										to work harder and aim higher; to study 
										the greats and go more deeply into my 
										craft . i took his words seriously, and 
										rather than latch on to some obvious 
										potential for discouragement, i 
										internalized and took up his challenge.
										

										i always felt livingston helped me 
										become a better songwriter and always 
										wanted to tell him this. so, it was a 
										real gift to get the opportunity to 
										acknowledge this debt publicly and thank 
										him for this songwriter version of tough 
										love. i also told the crowd during my 
										introduction of livingston at philly 
										that i had always tried to take a lesson 
										from him and pay it forward' so rather 
										than merely offer easy and perhaps 
										insincere praise to young writers who 
										had sought out my opinion over the 
										years, i also had tried to be as gently 
										honest as i could with them about their 
										work. livingston got a good laugh out of 
										my admission that this approach had 
										certainly pissed a lot of people off.



with the great livingston taylor
i wanted to take this 
										opportunity to share something i was 
										recently privileged to witness. a dear 
										friend of mine's daughter is currently 
										in the hospital. she is struggling to 
										recover after being critically injured 
										by three stray bullets on the streets of 
										wilmington. he is a long-time member of 
										new beginnings-next step and, on a 
										particularly difficult day for him 
										personally, he joined us via zoom at one 
										of our returning citizens meetings. 

										when we asked how he was holding up he 
										said, "honestly, not good' you know, you 
										just do what you have to do. you keep 
										going. "

										then someone asked if they were any 
										closer to finding his daughter's shooter 
										(the incident had also claimed a 
										16-year-old boy's life). my friend said, 
										"i don't think so, and i really don't 
										even want to go there. i pray for him 
										whoever he is because i know what he's 
										going through. when you do something 
										like this, it's a terrible thing to 
										carry. it affects you and your whole 
										family. he's suffering, i can promise 
										you that. i've been there. you can 
										pretend you're as tough as you want but 
										you have to do a lot to yourself to get 
										to place where you won't feel that kind 
										of pain. 
										so, yeah, i don't even go there. i mean 
										if he gets picked up and spends his life 
										in jail it will just tear up his family 
										the way we all tore up our families when 
										we went inside. just more pain, more 
										suffering. i don't know how that solves 
										anything. there was a time, you know, 
										when i'd have been all about settling 
										the score. but all i want to do now is 
										stay here and love my daughter. it took 
										me a long time to get to this place, to 
										get some wisdom, but i finally 
										understand."

										we all sat in stunned silence, humbled 
										by what we had heard, and because no 
										words would come, the silence became a 
										period of wordless prayer as we remained 
										together in that circle and sent love to 
										our brother and his wounded child.

										i've heard many preachers, poets, and 
										therapists speak of the path my friend 
										is now walking. but i'd never spoken to 
										someone who was at that very moment 
										clinging to that path with every fiber 
										of their being while being buffeted by 
										the howling winds of a hurricane. i've 
										often said that many of my spiritual 
										teachers had been behind bars. now you 
										know why.


										below are some upcoming shows. i hope to 
										see you out there soon.

										much love,

sailing to philadelphia...

										hi friends! 

										just wanted to let you know about my 
										annual benefit concert for my non-profit 
										new beginnings-next step. it will take 
										place on july 27th at the beautiful and 
										historic hedgerow theater in media, pa.
										

										new beginnings-next step helps 
										incarcerated and returning citizens 
										prepare for and deal with the challenges 
										of reentry after prison by fostering 
										relationships of deep community and 
										trust. our members often refer to us as 
										family. i was just reminded that this is 
										no mere hyperbole or metaphor when a 
										recently hospitalized returning citizen 
										told me he'd listed me as his next of 
										kin on his admission forms. 

										the evening will feature three of our 
										members as guest speakers. i know each 
										man well and am deeply proud that they 
										will be there to share their stories 
										with the audience. there will also be a 
										wine, cheese, and confection reception 
										prior to the concert. donations for the 
										show are $35 and you should act quickly 
										if you're interested in attending as 
										half the tickets sold out the day the 
										show went online. here's a link' 

										https://www.hedgerowtheatre.org/john-flynn-benefit-concert'fbclid=iwar0kh7g2u2xwh2m17ib3wpxzw9fi_gs9bnvkw6rcgfuaivmmgftsq8j5xq8

										as pandemic restrictions have ebbed and 
										evolved, new beginnings-next step has 
										finally been resumed face-to-face groups 
										both inside and outside northern 
										delaware prisons. this year we have been 
										asked to expand our footprint to other 
										facilities within the state. i deeply 
										appreciate your continuing support and 
										faith with all of this. it allows me to 
										continue work that has grown very dear 
										to my heart and it has made qualitative 
										differences in the lives of some of the 
										most vulnerable and marginalized members 
										of our society by helping us say that no 
										human being is disposable. 

										in other happy news, i've been asked to 
										take part of this year's 60th annual 
										philadelphia folk festival on august 
										20th and 21st. i'm really looking 
										forward to what will feel like a very 
										large family reunion. hope you can make 
										it!

										peace, 
										john

										moments after finishing the 2022 
										delaware marathon




										hi friends, 

										just a quick note to remind you that 
										i'll be at the kelly music center in 
										havertown, pa this saturday, may 7th (https://patch.com/pennsylvania/haverford/calendar/event/20220507/1818356/kelly-center-presents-john-flynn).


										last week's concert down at sussex 
										correctional institution went great! i 
										even got to introduce a brand-new song 
										that the guys seemed to love. here are 
										the lyrics:


										prophet's song by john flynn

prophet's song 
										by john flynn
										call me jonah for i too have been 
										swallowed by a whale
										they think they own ya when they got you 
										locked inside their jail
										when this world sees you only for the 
										worst things you have done
										it goes and feeds you to the monster 
										called leviathan

										leviathan, this wayward prophet's song 
										at least
										will rise again from the belly of the 
										beast

										i fell when my crew gave me to keep from 
										going down
										and that's when i knew i would have to 
										learn to swim or drown
										you turn to stone when you are robbed of 
										every dream and wish
										there's no atonement in the rancid 
										gullet of a fish

										leviathan, this wayward prophet's song 
										at least
										will rise again from the belly of the 
										beast

										resurrection means you make another 
										choice
										tell corrections this world's gonna hear 
										my voice


										like a comet i will streak across the 
										firmament
										the state will vomit and i will be 
										spewed out on the cement
										where no shadows give me any shelter 
										from the heat
										in secondhand clothes i will shout my 
										lyrics in the street

										leviathan, this wayward prophet's song 
										at least
										will rise again from the belly of the 
										beast

										leviathan, the prophet's song has never 
										ceased
										to rise again from the belly of the 
										beast

										call me jonah i too have been swallowed 
										by a whale

										 ' 
										2022 flying stone music

										the sci concert was an effort to 
										introduce myself to offenders in a new 
										prison where we will soon begin a weekly 
										new beginnings peer support group. from 
										all indications, it was a success as the 
										event seemed to garner a lot of 
										interest. a reporter and videographer 
										from the delaware news journal covered 
										the show. the paper is doing a story an 
										in-depth look at reentry and has already 
										interviewed me and several of my guys 
										for the piece (all these interviews went 
										well over ninety minutes!) i'm looking 
										forward to seeing what comes of all this 
										and will share it with you on this page 
										when it comes out.


										at long last, the phone is beginning to 
										ring again for bookings. that's why i'm 
										excited to announce my association with 
										lydaco music and bookings, who will now 
										be handling that stuff for me. if you're 
										interested in having me come play in 
										your area, please give my new agent 
										vicki a call (https://lydacomusic.com/).



										i'll be closing the heritage festival on 
										june 5th. (https://haverfordhistoricalsociety.org/heritage-festival/)

playing at the united for ukraine 
										rally in havertown, pa

 


										hi friends, 

										i hope this finds you well after so much 
										time. things are finally picking up 
										around these parts. and quickly.


										i'm excited to be back running 
										peer-support groups at the howard r. 
										young correctional institution here in 
										delaware. it's been wonderful to 
										reconnect with some of the men whose 
										incarceration has stretched through 
										these past two difficult years. i've 
										also been asked begin groups at several 
										other prisons and i'm currently working 
										to set up an introductory concert down 
										at sussex correctional institution in 
										order to introduce myself and our 
										non-profit, new beginnings-next step, to 
										the offenders downstate in georgetown.
										

										of course, nb-ns has continued working 
										with our returning citizen members 
										during the pandemic, if mostly via zoom, 
										but i've found that each aspect of this 
										work enriches the other. it was long ago 
										decided by our members that although 
										what is said in a meeting is treated as 
										confidential, all new beginnings and 
										next step groups are considered to be 
										part of the same circle of trust. thus, 
										the connection with our incarcerated 
										members, their stories, and their 
										challenges, resonates strongly with the 
										guys whove come home. and vice versa.
										

										thanks to those of you who've continued 
										to support my work with incarcerated and 
										returning citizens. i've seen the 
										difference these groups have made in so 
										many lives and am anxious to continue 
										this journey i set out on when i began 
										volunteering at gander hill prison 
										seventeen years ago. here's a short 
										video that combines some of my concert 
										work with a few thoughts from some of 
										our guys:


										https://www.youtube.com/watch'v=tic-papq9i8&t=9s

										i was recently honored to be asked by 
										the vietnam veterans of america to write 
										and perform a song at the vietnam war 
										memorial on national vietnam war 
										veterans day. here's the video for the 
										song i composed. it's called "deeper 
										family" and has recently come out as a 
										digital single. here's the video: 
										(https://www.youtube.com/watch'v=f4xdagi4mou).
										

										you'll be able to stream the ceremony 
										and my performance live from the wall at 
										1pm on march 29th: 


										www.facebook.com/vietnamveteransmemorialfund, 
										or
										

										www.honorvietnamveterans.org


										in other news, i'm excited to announce 
										that my bookings will now be handled by 
										the lydaco talent agency (https://lydacomusic.com/). 
										give them a shout if you'd like to 
										explore getting this old man and his 
										guitar out to your neck of the woods 
										this year.


										in the meantime, i'll be back on the 
										road this weekend!


- friday night, march 18th, i'll be


in new london, ct (www.fridaynightfolk.org)


- saturday night, the 19th, i'll be 
										in brockton, ma  (www.javawockyuu.com)

- sunday, 
										march 20th, i'll be at the public 
										library in middleburgh, ny. for info on 
										this show call 
										(518) 827 4953.


										although i'll be in connecticut this 
										week, you can catch me online most 
										friday nights for my weekly b.a.d. (busk 
										at dusk). these are viewer-supported 
										shows streamed from my home here in the 
										first state. they've been a wonderful 
										way to stay in touch with many of you 
										during the past couple years (not to 
										mention keeping my voice, fingers, and 
										memory in semi-decent shape... well 
										maybe not the memory so much). you can 
										find these shows, old and new, on 
										facebook (https://www.facebook.com/singwriter) 
										or on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucy27woswhjiq89wv5p0y03q)
 

upcoming, i'll 
										be in catonsville, md on april 7th
										

										(http://uptownconcerts.com/)
										 and in 
										may i'll be returning to the kelly 
										center for music in delaware county, pa.

										 

hope to see 
										you soon. take care of yourselves and

i was 
										running down the road trying to loosen 
										my load... and 
										took a first place medal in wxpn's 
										musicians on call 5k in the 
										over 60 age group. 


hi friends,
										

hope this note 
										finds you well and that you had a great 
										thanksgiving! i was blessed to spend it 
										with beth, our kids and our grandkids. 
										even got to do a post-dinner zoom with 
										some of the extended clan -with whom we 
										usually gather- for some after dinner 
										picking and singing. the world aint 
										back to where it was but in many 
										important ways it never really changed 
										all that much. love is still love. maybe 
										more so.

										not too much news. we had a bit of a 
										plumbing event when a pipe in the 
										ceiling burst during a nor'easter that 
										brought several inches of rain to 
										wilmington. the timing led me to 
										initially misdiagnose the cause of the 
										water pouring through the ceiling of our 
										den and saw me trying to put a tarp over 
										our second story ridge vent at 10 
										o'clock at night in the middle of the 
										storm. i took a bit of a tumble but came 
										away with nothing more than a gashed arm 
										and a slightly diminished fondness for 
										ladders. my thanks to the mr. mullins of 
										mullins builders for showing up the next 
										morning to help me figure out what why 
										my walls were gently weeping and to my 
										buddy bill hartnett for the quick 
										plumbing fix, thanks also to beth for 
										her proficiency with butterfly bandages 
										and materials and logistics management 
										and my buddy rotten dan and his neighbor 
										al for showing up with all manner of 
										power tools and goodwill. the 
										reconstruction of the room is proceeding 
										nicely. i've even been allowed to help. 
										among my early assignments was the 
										reapplication of insulation to the 
										ruined walls a task which only saw me 
										stapling my leather work glove to my 
										hand once. thank god for good and 
										talented friends! here's dan and i 
										installing the new tin ceiling-
 




										i'll be doing a show in front of an 
										actual three-dimensional audience at the 
										kennett flash on saturday december 11th. 
										(https://www.facebook.com/events/243852204405499/'ref=newsfeed). 
										half my proceeds from the evening will 
										go to camp dreamcatcher, a therapeutic 
										summer camp for kids whose lives have 
										been affected by aids/hiv. (https://campdreamcatcher.org/).
										

										i'm continuing to stream my b.a.d. (busk 
										after dusk) shows on facebook and 
										youtube every friday night at 7pm est. 
										these shows are live but (most) can also 
										be viewed at a later date. they are 
										viewer supported. donations can be made 
										via 
										paypal.me/singwriter or mailed to me 
										at p.o box 8273, wilmington de, 19803. 
										thanks to all who've generously 
										supported my b.a.d.s over the last year 
										or so.

take care of yourselves... and 
										each other. 

										much love,
										john

										here's a link to a video for my new 
										single "girl with the blue transistor":

										https://youtu.be/o6t70zb6ie4


 
hi friends,

my new single "girl with the blue transistor" is a song about a young girl from south philadelphia whose life was transformed by the ubiquitous, newly-portable radio that served as a musical lifeline for the teens and tweens of the early sixties. even though "the boss jocks said no girls", helen leicht never gave up on her childhood dream of being a dj. never quite the same once the music kissed her, she went on to become a trusted tastemaker and beloved broadcasting legend on philadelphia's storied fm landscape. artist-writer john flynn credits leicht with being one of the first to play his music on the radio. he and producer harvey transcend flynn's folk and americana roots to indulge their mutual love of music from the period in order to create a jangly, joyful power-pop canvas.
girl with the blue transistor comes out officially on october 8th. you can stream or purchase the track at all the usual digital providers. due to the fair shake they give artists, my current favorite is bandcamp:

																																				speaking of helen, i will be running for "team helen" on sunday october 17th at wxpn's musicians on call 5k. you can sign up to support this great cause here: 
https://runsignup.com/race/pa/philadelphia/wxpn5krun
i had a great time as we remembered the amazing phil ochs during last week's greenwich village folk festival. the show included a whole bunch of great artists including holly near, christine lavin, rod macdonald, tom paxton and reggie harris. former music critic for new york post, ira mayer, posted a nice reaction on fb mentioning what a treat it was to be introduced to "... john flynn in particular". you can stream the show here:
https://fb.watch/8uqmtxw6mj/

																																				don't forget to check out my b.a.d. (busk at dusk) which streams every friday at 7pm. these shows are always on my facebook "band" page follow me there (https://www.facebook.com/singwriter) for weekly reminders. we also stream on youtube. here's a link for this week: https://www.youtube.com/watch'v=s2anypnxbwk

																																				my new cd is back in stock and for sale on our merch page.

										august 30, 2021


										after my annual concert i had requests 
										for elbow bumps from some 
										of the kids of camp dreamcatcher, a 
										therapeutic summer camp for
										 kids whose lives have been affected by 
										hiv/aids. you can see the 
										smile right through my mask.



										hi friends, 

										i had a wonderful time playing and 
										helping to host this year's philadelphia 
										folk festival. and true to form the day 
										after fest found me back at camp 
										dreamcatcher for my annual concert. 
										during the performance we were of course 
										socially distanced, but very much heart 
										to heart. i've been playing at camp ever 
										since it began 25 years ago. many of the 
										amazing young volunteer counselors are 
										former camp attendees themselves and 
										have therefore known my songs since they 
										were little kids. 

										it always feels like coming home when i 
										get to dreamcatcher. after my show last 
										week, i was talking to camp founder, 
										patty hillkirk, about my first 
										appearance there. even though a lot had 
										been learned about aids in 1996, i admit 
										to being a bit anxious as i stood with 
										my guitar at the front of that raucous 
										mess hall on that muggy, rainy night. 
										that slowly changed however as, during 
										the show, a frail looking little girl 
										sporting cornrows and one of the 
										brightest smiles i had ever seen was 
										signing something to me as i sang. her 
										tiny hands were so expressive, and i was 
										of course curious to know what she was 
										saying. after the show i went down and 
										introduced myself. through her counselor 
										she told me her name was danielle. she 
										then asked me to kneel down, which i 
										did, and she threw her arms around my 
										neck and imparted one of the best hugs 
										i've ever received. i asked her 
										counselor what danielle had been saying 
										to me for the entire hour i'd been 
										singing. she's been saying "i love you', 
										he told me. sometimes you don't know 
										something inside you was broken until 
										the moment it gets fixed. i've been 
										going back to camp dreamcatcher for 
										repairs ever since. 

										they tell me danielle never actually 
										"heard" me sing or play that night a 
										quarter of a century ago. aids had 
										claimed her hearing. of course, i can't 
										say one way or the other, but she 
										certainly felt the music and maybe 
										that's more important. i do know that 
										she would "feel" it again some years 
										later.

										when danielle was a teenager a series of 
										devastating strokes almost took her 
										life. she was hospitalized and the word 
										we got was that she was completely 
										non-responsive. still, when patty 
										hillkirk and i went to visit her, 
										something inside told me to take my 
										guitar. when i arrived at the hospital, 
										i was assured by the staff that i was 
										wasting my time. i opened my guitar case 
										anyway and sat close enough to danielle 
										to be able to lay her slender arm across 
										the face of my martin as i strummed it 
										softly and sang for her. it didnt take 
										long, and i still get goosebumps 
										thinking about it. her eyes never opened 
										but as i played, danielle began to 
										smile. her smile quickly became a soft 
										chuckle. finally, she began to laugh out 
										loud. the harder i strummed the guitar, 
										the louder danielle laughed. as i 
										continued to play and sing, patty yelled 
										for the docs and nurses. the hospital 
										staff came running in. they were at a 
										loss to explain what was happening. the 
										damage done by the stroke was supposed 
										to be permanent. this shouldn't be 
										happening they assured us, and it 
										probably didn't mean what we thought it 
										meant. all i knew was that i was 
										involved in the communication of joy 
										(and maybe that's always part miracle!) 
										i finished my little concert and kissed 
										danielle's forehead telling her that i 
										loved her. the next day, we received 
										word that danielle was sitting up, 
										awake, and communicative. shes doing 
										well to this day. 

										the new cd wild beat the wings has been 
										getting some great response. it is 
										currently in the top ten of current folk 
										releases on kansas public radio, and 
										folk music notebook's ron olesko calls 
										the album "powerful... an extraordinary 
										album from one of the folk music 
										community's most beloved performers". i 
										got to sit down (on zoom) with ron for 
										an extensive conversation about the 
										album last week. here's a link to that 
										interview:
										
										https://soundcloud.com/wfdu-ron-olesko/john-flynn-on-traditions-82921'fbclid=iwar3qzs0nyntqkjxggkgtproay-zqurjamkefcwm7s5q6_itkxdylhdfm3hq

										wild beat the wings is available for 
										purchase here on our
										merch page, 
										or for download at this link:
										
										https://johnflynn1.bandcamp.com//releases


										i'll be resuming my friday night busk at 
										dusk performances on september 3rd at 
										7pm. hoping you'll tune in through my 
										facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/singwriter)
										or on youtube at:
										
										https://www.youtube.com/watch'v=q6hmy_pa77c


										i'm scheduled to do an outdoor show here 
										in wilmington, de this coming thursday 
										evening, september 2nd, at bellevue 
										state park (https://www.destateparks.com/concerts/bellevue). 
										this is a make-up date from an earlier 
										show that was rained out. fingers 
										crossed. 

										hoping our paths will cross again soon.

										hi friends, 

										due to last week's understandable 
										decision to move to an entirely digital 
										venue, i wont be hosting the 
										philadelphia folk festival as previously 
										announced. i am, however, delighted to 
										have been asked to perform a one hour 
										set on the pff virtual martin stage this 
										weekend. hope youll look in and 
										continue to support this increasingly 
										global yet authentically philadelphian 
										musical experience. 

										tickets are available here:

										https://folkfest.org/59½-annual-pocket-sized-philadelphia-folk-festival-digital-tix/

										my new cd wild beat the wings debuted at 
										#20 on the folk charts this month. 
										the album is available for purchase here 
										on our merch page,
										
										or for download at this link:
										
										https://johnflynn1.bandcamp.com//releases



										my thanks to the philadelphia phillies 
										for again hosting new beginnings-next 
										step at citizens bank park a couple 
										weeks ago. our returning citizens and 
										their guests had a great time rooting 
										the phils on to a dramatic 
										come-from-behind walk-off win, and the 
										ballclub even let me sing in the seventh 
										inning stretch. this continues a stretch 
										of appearances (vet stadium, cbp) for my 
										favorite team that goes back over a 
										quarter of a century, although this was 
										my first time performing on ukulele.




										my version of "take me out to the 
										ballgame" was even credited with lifting 
										the mood of the crowd by nbc 
										philadelphia sportswriter jim salisbury 
										



										 

										in other news, i've decided to resume my 
										weekly b.a.d. (busk at dusk) shows 
										starting friday, september 3rd at 7pm. 
										you can email song requests to me 
										through this page. check here or on my
										
										facebook or youtube pages for 
										streaming links. 

										i really appreciate the emails i've 
										received from folks inquiring about me 
										coming back to do shows in their area. 
										as you've probably surmised, i've never 
										been good at the gig booking part of 
										this job. if we can find a way to string 
										together a few appearances in your 
										region of the country, i'm in. 

										thanks for your continued support of my 
										work. i hope our paths will cross again 
										soon.

										peace,
										john

big news: john will be hosting 
											the 2021 philadelphia folk festival


											hi friends, 

											i hope this note finds you well. a 
											lot has happened since i last wrote. 
											here's a quick update

											my new cd wild beat the wings will 
											be released this week and is 
											currently available for purchase 
											here on our merch page, or for 
											download at this link:
											
											https://johnflynn1.bandcamp.com//releases
											

											you can check out the new video to 
											the album's first single "circle of 
											love" here:
											
											https://www.youtube.com/watch'v=csemsra25bw

											i'll be celebrating the release of 
											wild beat the wings here in 
											wilmington by kicking off the 
											bellevue state park's summer concert 
											series at 6:30 p.m. on thursday july 
											8th. (https://destateparks.com/concerts/bellevue). 
											it will be the park's first concert 
											since 2019, and my first time on 
											front of a live audience since my 
											concert at the sussex correctional 
											institution in march of 2020.

											i'm honored to have been chosen to 
											host this year's philadelphia folk 
											festival, filling a role that was 
											long played by my dear old friend, 
											festival founder gene shay. this 
											will be an emotional event for me on 
											a lot of levels. i'm really looking 
											forward to this chance to listen to 
											(and play) some music as i reconnect 
											face to face with a lot of old 
											friends. to paraphrase the great 
											jerry lee louis, there'll be a whole 
											lot of huggin' going on...

											speaking of friends, thanks to all 
											of you who supported my online shows 
											last year. the friday b.a.d. (busk 
											at dusk) series not only brought in 
											some much appreciated weekly bread 
											during a time when all my live shows 
											vanished, but it kept me in 
											reasonably good performing shape, as 
											well as in touch with what turned 
											into a great little online 
											community. we went through a lot 
											together last year; a deadly 
											pandemic, an existential election, 
											an insurrection... somehow it helped 
											just having some friends drop by on 
											friday nights and say hi. although 
											i'll be taking the summer off from 
											these online shows (with the 
											exception of some zoom concerts 
											which you can read about on my 
											schedule page:
											
											https://www.johnflynn.net/shows.html) 
											i plan to resume them in some form 
											come september. more to come on 
											this...

											as i was getting ready to write to 
											you today my cell phone rang. it was 
											a guy i'd worked with in prison a 
											decade ago. i had been able to help 
											him get a housekeeping job at a 
											local hospital when he got out, and 
											he quickly became one of their most 
											beloved employees. he worked there a 
											couple years before addiction got 
											the better of him and, after some 
											stints in rehab, he lost his job and 
											relocated to florida where he 
											continued alternating between 
											recovery and relapse. 

											hes now living in texas and has 
											been clean for four years. hes 
											attending an online college and has 
											a 4.0 gpa. hes been working at a 
											cash register at a dollar store for 
											several years. (i remember when he 
											applied for this position. we had a 
											long talk on the phone one night 
											where he confessed to me that he had 
											great misgivings about it since it 
											entailed counting money with people 
											staring at him.) he was just made 
											assistant manager of his store! he 
											was so proud and it filled me with 
											joy to hear it in his voice. 

											he gave our little non-profit new 
											beginnings-next step much of the 
											credit for his success and thanked 
											all of our volunteers for never 
											letting him give up on himself. nbns 
											has taken some hard hits recently. 
											the streets - as well as the 
											pandemic - have taken a great deal 
											from us. its important to remember 
											that- no matter what any given page 
											reveals- there are often many more 
											chapters to be written in a lifes 
											story. yeah. i think i needed that.
											i've included some information about 
											the new album below. i hope to see 
											you soon.

											peace,
											john



											john flynn- wild beat the wings
											

											john flynns thirteenth solo album, 
											wild beat the wings, is some of his 
											strongest and most adventurous work 
											in an award-winning career spanning 
											four decades. the new album features 
											flynns trademark heart and lyrical 
											artistry juxtaposed against a 
											background of bolder production and 
											harmonic choices as the life-long 
											marathon runner belies his 64 years 
											by arguably singing better and 
											stronger than ever. 

											like so much new music these days, 
											wild beat the wings is the byproduct 
											of months of the found, focused time 
											imposed by the covid restrictions, 
											which flynn addresses in the 
											country-rock offering space 
											station. even the cover art for 
											wild beat the wings can be traced to 
											flynns enforced status as a 
											homebody as he rediscovered his 
											drawing pad and inked the stark but 
											lovely cover image of his wife beth 
											rescuing a mourning dove on their 
											northern delaware back porch. the 
											title song of the album recounts the 
											story of the doves escape from a 
											swooping raptor by crashing through 
											a screened- porch door. disoriented 
											and terrified, the trembling bird 
											failed to relocate the open door and 
											required tender human hands to help 
											it return to the sky. the song is a 
											metaphor for all loving 
											relationships as it pertains to the 
											need to create paths to greater 
											freedom. unsurprisingly to anyone 
											familiar with flynn's canon, 
											restorative justice themes are 
											explored on wild beat the wings as 
											he follows up his 2020 blm hip-hop 
											single how many bodies. circle of 
											love challenges those of all 
											political and cultural stripes to
											
											enter into relationship (its the 
											circle of love... may it grow ever 
											wide until no one is standing 
											outside) . an american cage 
											mourns this countrys callous 
											disregard of the ideals nobly 
											expressed in the emma lazarus poem 
											enshrined on the statue of liberty. 
											stranger in a strange land is an 
											elegiac reflection on the toxic 
											polarization so deeply dividing our 
											country. 

											flynn's writing has always mined the 
											light as well as the shadow and wild 
											beat the wings includes some 
											lighthearted offerings in stayin 
											young (is sure gettin old) about 
											the unending and futile attempt to 
											stave off the inevitable, the song 
											of my becoming, a quasi-buddhist 
											meditation on unitive consciousness 
											written for flynns first 
											grandchild, and everybody needs a 
											friend, the true story of an 
											elephant who was rescued by singer 
											cher from a desolate and solitary 
											existence in a pakistani zoo. 
											flynns roots as a former nashville 
											staff writer are evident in "the 
											eyes of marie". 

											the album extols young passion in 
											the love song it dont get no 
											better (than this), even as flynn 
											admits the error of the songs 
											foundational assumption (but i was 
											wrong... love grows old... love 
											grows strong). wild beat the wings 
											heads for the barn with the 
											rollicking anthem folk me, which 
											reveals a tongue-in-cheek flynn at 
											his rambunctious best as he 
											celebrates his love for his chosen 
											musical genre (just need to let 
											something earnest get under my 
											epidermis). 


											continuing his successful musical 
											partnership with harvey as producer 
											and house band (harvey provides 
											all the instrumentation other than 
											flynns acoustic guitars and 
											harmonica), wild beat the wings is 
											recently preceded by a 2020 album of 
											cover tunes called take cover that 
											the two friends put out under the 
											band named hondo jenkins (an alias 
											flynn once played bars under). take 
											cover required flynn  a 
											self-professed technical luddite  
											to learn the basics of rudimentary 
											home recording while challenging him 
											to develop previously unsuspected 
											vocal chops. (contravening the old 
											saw do not attempt this at home 
											flynn found summiting, for example, 
											brian wilsons high harmonies to be 
											easier in the privacy of ones 
											domicile  think singing in the 
											shower but with protools!) in fact, 
											unlike most preceding albums, flynn 
											provides a lion's share of 
											background vocals on this record). 
											the unpretentious joy of the take 
											cover project is continued on wild 
											beat the wings with an audacious 
											interpretation of the john 
											lennon/beatles classic and your 
											bird can sing. 

											in recent years flynn has split his 
											time between music and new 
											beginnings-next step, a non-profit 
											he created in order to help 
											incarcerated and returning citizens 
											avoid recidivism in the state of 
											delaware. this work garnered him the 
											prestigious phil ochs award as well 
											as a champion of justice/ 
											humanitarian award from the national 
											association of criminal defense 
											lawyers (former recipients include 
											stevie wonder, julian bond and 
											sister helen prejean). 

											far from diluting his musical game, 
											flynn's years of re-entry work with 
											those whom our society deems the 
											most disposable has only sharpened 
											his considerable tools, and wild 
											beat the wings is evidence of this 
											honing. it is beautiful, meaningful 
											work by a master craftsman who has 
											lived up to his gift and stayed true 
											to his calling.

											birds of the air nesting in your 
											hair is a sign you must be right 
											with the world." 
											- br. david schlatter, franciscan 
											friar


											hi friends, 

 


											spending time outdoors has always 
											been an important part of my life. 
											it seems to have a beneficial effect 
											on me physically, mentally and 
											spiritually. as you know i'm a 
											life-long runner, but i have serious 
											doubts that i'd have stayed with it 
											this long if it didn't get me out 
											under the sky for an hour each day. 
											(i'm not a big treadmill fan.) 

											although each season has its own 
											charms, this spring has been 
											especially welcome here in northern 
											delaware and i've taken my daily 
											meditations out beneath the trees in 
											my backyard whenever possible. there 
											the birds and squirrels (along with 
											occasional foxes and deer) keep me 
											company as they await my daily 
											refilling of the birdfeeder that i 
											bought for beth as an anniversary 
											present last summer. 

											that's where i surreptitiously 
											grabbed the above photos. i had been 
											sitting for about twenty minutes 
											when i heard something moving at my 
											shoulder. i slid my phone out of the 
											pocket in my jeans, opened the 
											camera app, and found our lovely 
											little sister sitting quietly on the 
											back of my chair. she seemed to be 
											studying me with great intensity. i 
											guess i passed muster because 
											moments later she surprised me by 
											alighting on me and gently beginning 
											to explore my mane as a possible 
											nesting site. i must say i've seldom 
											felt quite so honored, although i 
											suppose it could simply be an 
											indication that i need haircut.



											in other news, i, along with all of 
											my new beginnings volunteers, have 
											received our second vaccinations and 
											are awaiting clearance to return to 
											our work in the prisons. the 
											commissioner of corrections informs 
											me that this is imminent. i look 
											forward to reconnecting with so many 
											men who've endured an incredibly 
											difficult and dangerous year inside 
											the walls and taking up again the 
											important work of helping them 
											prepare for real and lasting freedom 
											upon release. 

											thank you for supporting my weekly 
											online shows, the friday b.a.d. 
											(busk at dusk) over the past eight 
											months. your donations have played a 
											role in insuring that nb-ns remains 
											ready to jump back into the fray in 
											the fight against recidivism here in 
											delaware. i never imagined i'd have 
											so much support for these shows or 
											envisioned my little series lasting 
											this long. i've also enjoyed the 
											opportunity to share some of the 
											music that shaped my own writing. 
											songs by kris kristofferson, george 
											harrison, jackson browne, cat 
											stevens, john prine, bob dylan and 
											so many others have made these 
											weekly concerts a joy for me (as 
											well as an occasional adventure!)

											speaking of the online shows, this 
											week's b.a.d. (april 30) will not be 
											seen due to a family obligation. we 
											will resume our "regularly scheduled 
											programming" next week and plan to 
											continue through the month of may, 
											or until the new album is released. 
											i and am deeply grateful to all 
											those who have contributed to make 
											it possible for me to keep 
											performing during these difficult 
											times. see you on may 7th.


											in the meantime, mask up, vax up, 
											pray up, and keep your heart open.

											much love,


											john

												hi friends, 


 
												i hope youre hanging in there. 
												above ive attached a link to a 
												recent article. it gets a few 
												things wrong (like the names of 
												the prisons) and im pretty sure 
												i didnt say some of what it 
												claims i said in exactly those 
												words. but it does capture what 
												has come to be a somewhat 
												liminal time in what jimmy 
												webbs brilliant song if you 
												see me getting smaller, im 
												leaving calls my borderline 
												career. i guess thats exactly 
												where a lot of us are during 
												these unsettled and difficult 
												times. what keeps coming back to 
												me is just to keep following my 
												heart, keep writing my songs, 
												and keep trying to stay open to 
												the blessings and goodness that 
												surround me. many of you have 
												played a part in these by 
												supporting my music and my 
												reentry work. ill always be 
												grateful.

										hi friends,

										hoping this note finds you safe and in 
										good health. weve had a bit of a close 
										encounter with the vid here as a 
										family member became feverish and tested 
										positive last week. (if i seem 
										distracted during last friday nights 
										show, now you know why.) fortunately, 
										our patient seems to be recovering just 
										fine as we wait out our mandatory 
										quarantine. although im grateful that 
										weve so far been spared some of the 
										truly dire aspects of this illness, it 
										has become clear to me in a whole new 
										way that we are all truly in this 
										together. and if any good can come of 
										this awful year, perhaps it will be a 
										deeper solidarity born of this 
										increasingly inescapable realization.

										i know that times may seem especially 
										bleak right now. our nation is stalked, 
										not only plague and hunger, but by an 
										almost living enmity. not since the 
										civil war have we been so widely driven 
										by anything approaching this level of 
										contempt for each other. i pray that 
										what is being willfully unleashed by the 
										faithless and cowardly men who are 
										trying to tear this country apart right 
										now will not manifest itself in 
										violence. but i admit that prayers alone 
										may be no match for the relentless and 
										unparalleled intensity of the 
										disinformation and hate mongering were 
										now witnessing each dayespecially given 
										the prevalence of mental instability and 
										despair in this country. perhaps thats 
										where the message of christmas comes in'

										my friend, pastor brian joyce, wrote to 
										me asking if i would record a version of 
										i heard the bells on christmas day for 
										his congregations christmas service. 
										brian explained that the songs 
										originsof which i was unaware made it 
										a special favorite of his. 

										i must confess that i never paid much 
										attention to this particular carol. i 
										only knew the bing crosby-era versions, 
										and had little attachment to them beyond 
										their genial conjuring of some 
										sentimental childhood memories. (i do 
										have a strong fondness for ralph the 
										dogs rendering in an old muppets 
										holiday special.) ive since learned 
										that the songs words were written by 
										american poet henry wadsworth longfellow 
										on christmas day in 1863 as he 
										contemplated the incongruity of the 
										seasons message of peace in the midst 
										of a time in which our land knew so much 
										bitterness and blood. none of the 
										versions id ever heard of the song 
										included longfellows fourth and fifth 
										stanzas:

										then from each black, accursed mouth
										the cannon thundered in the south,
										and with the sound
										the carols drowned
										of peace on earth, good-will to men!

										it was as if an earthquake rent
										the hearth-stones of a continent,
										and made forlorn
										the households born
										of peace on earth, good-will to men!

										the final section of the song becomes so 
										much more powerful when preceded by 
										these verses. surely we can now even 
										more immediately identify with the 
										authors anguish in verse six:

										and in despair i bowed my head;
										"there is no peace on earth," i said;
										"for hate is strong,
										and mocks the song
										of peace on earth, good-will to men!

										hate does indeed seem strong these days. 
										and it only invites and encourages that 
										which feeds it. which is why the message 
										of this songs final verse has taken 
										such a hold on me this season: 

										then pealed the bells more loud and 
										deep:
										"god is not dead, nor doth he sleep;
										the wrong shall fail,
										the right prevail,
										with peace on earth, good-will to men."


										the days will soon begin to grow longer 
										again. as they do, let our hope be 
										renewed. may this season mark a new 
										re-turning from the current darkness 
										of our path. 

										may love guide us,
										john

										hi friends,

										as i write on this thanksgiving eve, im 
										humbled by the many blessings in my 
										life. not the least of these is the 
										constantly growing circle of my 
										extended and extending family.

										these new ties of kinship arent being 
										discovered through one of those genetic 
										testing services (which only told me 
										what i already knew  that im about 80% 
										irish). rather, they are revealed in 
										relationships made sacred by the gift of 
										trust constantly bestowed upon me in my 
										work with the systemically marginalized; 
										those whom our society often regards as 
										disposable. in these relationships each 
										small offering of my time or presence is 
										rewarded disproportionately with 
										gratitude, tenderness, and  for me a 
										real sense of a deeper belonging. as 
										father greg boyle of homeboy industries 
										wrote to me recently, in the end we 
										all have the same last name love.

										during this holiday of plenty, may we 
										continue to work and pray for truer 
										understandings of these extended family 
										ties, especially with the estimated 
										fifty million of our brothers and 
										sisters in this country who are having 
										difficulty securing enough food right 
										now.

										theres never been more work to do. so 
										many walls to tear down. so many bridges 
										to build. its truly all hands on deck 
										time. so, whatever you bring with you, 
										whether its a strong back or a calm 
										voice, a big checkbook or a small 
										prayer, know that you are welcome and 
										very much needed at the family table.

										im truly grateful to all of you for all 
										the support youve given me in my work 
										this year. i hope you have a happy, 
										healthy and safe thanksgiving.

										much love,
										john
 

										 

a little 
									program note:

 
									  i'll be taking a break from my b.a.d. 
										shows. on friday november 6th, 
										i'll be streaming live from the stage at 
										the sellersville theater's as part of 
										their new series called soundbooth 
										sessions. (https://theater.st94.com/) 
										i'm really looking forward to this show. 
										not only do we artists have to find a 
										way to keep going through these 
										difficult times, but the venues we've 
										relied upon to support us all these 
										years do as well. plus, it will be good 
										to stand on a stage again even if it's 
										in an empty theater. (of course, i 
										didn't always draw that well in 
										sellersville, so i've had some 
										experience at this!) anyway, come hell, 
										highwater, or both next week, whether it 
										is for existential solace or ecstatic 
										celebration, i hope you'll join me. i'll 
										resume my weekly busk at dusk shows on 
										november 13th.

									hi all,

									just a reminder to tune in to my b.a.d (busk 
									at dusk) livestream show at 7pm on friday 
									october 30th. i've got admit i 
									had some real reservations about taking this 
									weekly gig on; number one being the 
									unforgiving little counter at the bottom of 
									the facebook videos that show you how many 
									people are watching. i've been very grateful 
									that so many folks have loylally supported 
									this series and have regularly reached out 
									to let me know how much they've appreciated 
									a chance for us to all get together each 
									week. 

									one amazing note i just received at my po 
									box this week said' 

'you're bad concerts have been such a 
									wonderful replacement for a live concert 
									face to face, you bring such joy' songs 
									that amuse me, make me think, tear at my 
									heart, impel me to go out into the world and 
									do good. we love you, john. keep it up.'

i mean, what more could any singwriter 
									ever need or want' 
see you online!

									much love,
									john

									hi friends,

									in my continued'apparently successful' 
									attempt to show as much or more income in 
									recent years as the president of the united 
									states, this is just a reminder about this 
									week's b.a.d. (busk at dusk) show. this 
									week's request, 'querencia', will be 
									performed for bud manning, and i'll be 
									including a cover of a long-time favorite, 
									eric andersen's 'thirsty boots', as well. a 
									new request will be drawn each week.

									you can find me on friday night at 7pm edt 
									on youtube: 

									https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucy27woswhjiq89wv5p0y03q'view_as=subscriber

									or facebook: 

									https://www.facebook.com/singwriter/videos/348644556420421/
									the facebook link may look like it doesn't 
									work right up until the concert begins. i'm 
									assured it does. it's a 'bug' they've 
									claimed to be working on for the past couple 
									weeks.

									if you're enjoying my little weekly show, 
									please help me grow the audience and 
									consider inviting a friend or two to check 
									it out. (it will never be easier to drag 
									someone to a 'coffeehouse' then it is right 
									now!) as always, everyone's welcome and 
									there is no charge for viewing whatsoever. 
									but, like any good busker, i'll have my 'tip 
									jar' available at:
									
									https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/singwriter. 
									if you're not into paypal. good 
									old-fashioned checks will also be gratefully 
									cashed. just mail to me at po box 8273, 
									wilmington, de 19803.

									ten percent of the take will be donated to 
									new beginnings-next step, inc.

									i've recently been asked by the chief of the 
									bureau of prisons here in delaware to 
									prepare to go back inside and resume work 
									with our offender groups. this will not 
									affect our b.a.d. scheduling in the near 
									future, but it may mean an alteration down 
									the road as friday afternoons were being 
									considered for our new beginnings group at 
									sci down in georgetown, de (two hours south 
									of my home' so, really, just around the 
									block for a folk slinger!) 

									stay tuned, and please let me know if you 
									have any preferences if we need to consider 
									different nights for the show.

									hope to see you soon. may you and yours stay 
									safe and well.


									much love,
									john

									hi friends,

									what kind of a world do we live in where 
									folk singers are becoming are on your 
									screens more than your local weather 
									forecasters' 

									just a quick note to remind you that i'll be 
									doing another online show this friday 
									evening at 7pm (edt). i've decided to call 
									this little weekly concert series 'john 
									flynn's busk at dusk (b.a.d)' because that's 
									kind of how i'm thinking of these shows. 
									just imagine that at the end of a long hard 
									week you find me strumming some tunes out 
									front of your abode, just camped out there 
									on of your digital sidewalk, with some 
									neighbors gathering round. 

									we had a great time last week. it turned out 
									to be fun seeing all the comments stream in 
									during the show, like a little party' 
									reconnecting with old friends, singing old 
									favorites and trying out some new stuff. 
									i've received lots of song requests which 
									i'm still going through. i'm planning to 
									pick one or two for this week, and then put 
									the rest in an old top hat. each friday i'll 
									draw out a new request during the show 
									(which will give me seven whole days to 
									relearn it!) if you have anything you'd like 
									to hear, just email it to me or send it as a 
									comment during the show. 

									if you missed last week's inaugural b.a.d., 
									you can find it here: 


									https://www.facebook.com/singwriter/videos/644330343155027/uzpfsty3mduynjk3ndoxmde1nzmymjyzndaymtk3nq/'fref=search&__tn__=,d,p-r&eid=ara4amvry1-fxix1mxvl2p-snq7qhn5pgvfwxadwarfjiroyqam-1gnhisvrvf2zvg-estcm8hwupvdc

									several people told me they don't much like 
									using facebook, so from now on i'll also be 
									streaming all my shows simultaneously on 
									youtube. you can find the concerts at these 
									links:

									facebook: 

									https://www.facebook.com/singwriter/live/

									youtube: 

									https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucy27woswhjiq89wv5p0y03q'view_as=subscriber

									like i said last week, this show is free. 
									everyone's invited and there is no charge 
									for viewing. but, like any good busker, i'll 
									have my guitar case open on the sidewalk 
									next to me to catch any spare pocket change 
									or crumpled bills. so, if you'd like to stop 
									by the 'digital tip jar' just google me at:
									
									http://paypal.me/singwriter ten percent 
									of the proceeds will be donated to new 
									beginnings-next step.

									in other doings, i'm attaching a link to a 
									video of a new song that i plan to release 
									as a single next week. 'how many bodies' was 
									a completely unguarded response to what 
									we've all been witnessing and (in my case) 
									remaining silent about for far too long. my 
									thanks to my musical partner harvey for the 
									amazing production and video:

									finally, i've been asked to participate in 
									an observance of this year's united nations 
									international day of peace. the program will 
									be virtual ' starting at 3pm edt on sunday 
									september 20. to reserve your free ticket, 
									go to idpboston2020.eventbrite.com or 
									you can livestream it on the cooperative 
									metropolitan ministries facebook page. 
									please visit
									
									www.idpboston.org for more information.

									hope to see you soon. stay safe.



									 
one of my first streaming concerts for my 
									friends at focus music' even cats dig me!
 
hi folks,

									due to some persistent friends, fans' and, 
									yes, persistent bills, i've decided to take 
									the plunge into the new and exciting world 
									of live streaming concerts. (you have no 
									idea how big a step this is for a guy who 
									can barely do more than send emails on a 
									computer.) i'll be 'attempting' my first 
									weekly foray into this arena this coming 
									friday night, september 11, at 7pm edt. you 
									can watch all the fun here:

									https://www.facebook.com/watch/'v=644330343155027&extid=mfslmcmhjbsmim5c

									friday night's show will feature songs of 
									hope, including my old song, "i will not 
									fear" as we again mark this special date in 
									our collective history. there will be no 
									admission price asked or expected for 
									streaming the show, however, donations will 
									be gratefully accepted through paypal (pay 
									to john@johnflynn.net) or by mailed check 
									(john flynn, p.o. box 8273, wilmington, de 
									19803).

									along with a few special songs i'll pick out 
									for you each week, i will also plan to work 
									up a request or two, so if you have 
									something of mine ' or even someone else's- 
									that you'd like to hear, send me an email 
									and i'll see what i can do. 

									by the way, i really mean it when i say no 
									admission price is needed. a friend wrote to 
									me recently that she wouldn't be attending 
									these shows because 'since the virus came 
									along' things had become very difficult for 
									her money-wise. i told her what i'll tell 
									you all ' you're already on the guest list. 
									us 'singwriter' types have had to deal with 
									the economic challenges of this period same 
									as lots of other folks. mostly, however, i 
									just need to start singing to some friends 
									again on a regular basis. so, if you're a 
									little squeezed right now, don't feel 
									lonesome. tune in to the show friday and 
									we'll ride this out together for a little 
									while. 

									i'll be donating a small portion of the 
									proceeds from these friday night shows each 
									week to new beginnings-next step. it won't 
									be a lot, but your donations to nbns at my 
									concerts accounted for a hefty percentage of 
									our fundraising, and i haven't been able to 
									do any live shows for going on six months' 
									so every little bit help can help. 

									speaking of nbns, the international 
									leadership association recently asked me to 
									write an article about the confluence of my 
									music and my work with incarcerated and 
									returning citizens. the article i submitted 
									was called 'the song i didn't play'. it's 
									about a concert i did last year at the 
									howard r. young correctional institution, 
									and they liked it so much that the ila is 
									including it in their 2021 publication, a 
									grassroots leadership & arts for social 
									change primer for educators, organizers, 
									activists & rabble-rousers. if you're 
									interested, you can read my article here:

									i hope i'll see hope online friday evening, 
									and in person real soon!

									much love,

										performing the national anthem for the 
										philadelphia phillies outside citizens 
										bank park. (this was soundcheck, i of 
										course removed my paint-stained bandanna 
										for the recording.)




											and then, here i am listening for it 
											in the stands'





										hi friends,

										i sure hope this note finds you all safe 
										and well!

										this will be a short one because things 
										are kind of crazy around here today. a 
										lightning strike brought a large tree 
										down on the side of our house and garage 
										causing an ongoing parade of calls and 
										visits from (among others) the fire 
										department, the gas company, the hvac 
										guy, tree removal guys, etc. still, 
										we're all fine and i'm grateful that my 
										favorite old tree seemed to go out of 
										its way not to do more damage. not sure 
										i'll be too sorry to see the back of the 
										year 2020 however'


 

										i'll be performing all three days of the 
										2020 virtual philadelphia folk festival. 
										like everything else these days this 
										great old festival is fighting for its 
										survival so you're support of this event 
										could make a real difference. here's a 
										link: 
										https://folkfest.org/
 


 




 

										my new band, hondo jenkins, has just 
										released an album of (mostly) cover 
										tunes that speak to the times we're in. 
										i formed the band in lockdown with my 
										longtime pal and producer harvey (https://harveythehandyman.com/bio). 
										the album was recorded in our respective 
										bunkers with harvey patiently coaching 
										me (someone who is often challenged by 
										the technical complexity of email) 
										through the use of pro tools like in one 
										of those old movies where the guy at the 
										mic in the control tower tries to tell a 
										civilian how to land the airplane. i 
										believe the project is a shining example 
										of what a singing 'social worker' and a 
										philadelphia aor radio legend turned 
										handyman can accomplish if they really 
										put their minds to it (and are not 
										allowed to leave their homes for weeks 
										at a time.)


 

										the name hondo jenkins is one that i 
										once occasionally employed in situations 
										where i was contractually prevented from 
										performing under my own name. (fathers 
										of four can become very creative when 
										there are bills to be paid.)


 

										take cover includes reinterpretations of 
										iconic songs that speak to these 
										unsettling days. existential distress is 
										addressed in the beatle's 'help' and tom 
										petty's 'free fallin''. for lockdown 
										fever we have the animals' 'we gotta get 
										out of this place", the bee gees' "new 
										york mining disaster 1941' and brian 
										wilson's 'in my room' (with vocals 
										featuring - i assure you - the highest 
										notes i've ever sung before!) for social 
										distancing we included the left bank's 
										'walk away renee'. and covid testing is 
										addressed by mickey newberry's classic, 
										"i just dropped in (to see what 
										condition my conditon was in)'.


 

										george harrison's 'all things must pass' 
										and u2's "i still haven't found what i'm 
										looking for' speak to some of the "big 
										picture' questions posed by such 
										uncertain times. and we remember those 
										whom we've lost recently with versions 
										of bill withers' anthemic 'lean on me', 
										john prine's 'that's the way the world 
										goes round', and ' for our old buddy 
										gene shay ' mike nesmith's 'papa gene's 
										blues'. (i noticed that my good friend 
										rich warren at midnight special has been 
										playing an advance copy of this track 
										recently. thanks, rich!)


 

										the inclusion of steven still's 'for 
										what it's worth' will certainly need no 
										explanation. and to round out the 
										collection, we've included petty's 'wildfowers', 
										eric kaz's (via bonnie rait) 'river of 
										tears", and one of my recent compostions, 
										"space station', about the new normal of 
										'five o'clock briefings from mission 
										control" and putting "on your space suit 
										when you go outdoors'. (i'll be 
										performing this one in a couple weeks at 
										this year's virtual philadelphia folk 
										festival.)


 

										i handle the lead singing chores on take 
										cover, about which grammy winning 
										producer frank liddell (lee ann womack, 
										miranda lambert) writes' flynn is 'so 
										good at interpreting and making songs 
										his own, as well as taking great songs 
										and painting them in a new light.'


 

										take cover is available on all major 
										commercial streaming platforms.


 

										when i was a kid, performing songs i 
										loved on my guitar always seemed to get 
										me through tough times, especially when 
										i'd get sent to my room (which is kind 
										of how this has all felt at times.) this 
										album was kind of a return to that for 
										me. we had a great deal of fun recording 
										these songs and i truly hope you'll 
										enjoy them.


 

										i'm also enclosing a link to a video of 
										my newest composition, 'the very stable 
										genius song (donald's remarkable 
										achievement) which was inspired by the 
										recent feats of intellectual derring-do 
										performed by our country's nominal 
										current president while being 
										interviewed on fox news:

										https://youtu.be/gjjgfjcbuf0

										our work in new beginnings-next step is 
										proceeding as best it can. the good news 
										is that st. francis hospital will be 
										allowing to resume our face-to-face (or 
										at least mask-to-mask) meetings next 
										week. our volunteers and returning 
										citizens are all ecstatic about this. 
										it's been too long since we saw each 
										other on anything but a computer screen.


 

										i was recently glad to hear from a man 
										i'd worked with in prison for the last 
										couple years. he had just been released 
										and called our easy-to-remember phone 
										number ' (877) i got out ' and told me 
										he was starting work in a couple days 
										but had nothing to wear. thanks to your 
										support, i could head right out and 
										purchase work boots and new clothing for 
										him, which, along with his new nbns 
										backpack, t-shirt, bus pass and shop 
										rite gift card, i dropped off at the 
										half-way house where he's now staying. 
										he told me he never knew anyone in the 
										world actually cared before. of course, 
										he's just at the beginning of a long and 
										difficult journey. but at least he's 
										making a good start and that can mean 
										all the difference.


 

										stay well. looking forward to seeing you 
										all down the road somewhere. 

										much love,
										john

march 11, 2020 
									probably the last show for a while' 
									sussex correctional institution, georgetown, 
									de

									hi friends,

									so quite a bit has happened since i last 
									checked in. i pray you guys are all well and 
									taking care of yourselves. as for me, life's 
									going on pretty much the same with a few 
									minor adjustments here and there. of course, 
									any shows i've written to you of have been 
									postponed.

									our next step returning citizens support 
									group meetings are on hiatus since we didn't 
									want to risk either the health of our 
									volunteers (who are even older than me), or 
									that of our economically vulnerable members 
									who can ill-afford any wage loss due to 
									prolonged illness. we are reaching out to 
									the guys by phone each week and making our 
									weekly bus passes and grocery store gift 
									cards available through the mail. as things 
									evolve, we will certainly try to help when 
									we can 'and as we can 'with the resources 
									you've kindly made available to me through 
									your donations at my concerts and paypal 
									offerings at newbeginnings-nextstep.org. 
									(please don't see this as a solicitation 
									right now. i know many have been adversely 
									affected by the economic implications of the 
									virus. just know that i'm grateful for your 
									support!) as far as the prisons, although 
									they have been closed to all visitors in 
									delaware, they have remained open to new 
									beginnings, and i will continue to run 
									groups for as long as i'm permitted inside.

									offenders are incredibly worried about 
									coivd-19; some because they're trapped in a 
									problematic (in the best of times) 
									healthcare situation, some because they're 
									seriously immune-compromised, many because 
									their loved ones are among the most 
									vulnerable, and a few because they bear the 
									weight of the nascent stages of spiritual 
									awakening to the point that they fear being 
									deprived of the chance to go home and try to 
									make amends to those whose lives they have 
									wounded. (this last fear seems to be the 
									worst and was shared with tears last week by 
									one of the toughest looking men i've ever 
									seen.)

									i know this social distancing stuff 'and 
									what looks to me like an impending and 
									inevitable national lockdown 'has a lot of 
									folks freaked out, especially those who live 
									alone. a long time ago the good sisters 
									taught us about 'the mystical body of 
									christ' and what they called 'the communion 
									of saints'. my buddhist friends use 
									different language but talk about the same 
									kind of thing. quantum physics now tells us 
									this real and vital interrelationship of all 
									things goes beyond mere space and time, 
									beyond religious dogma, and certainly beyond 
									temporary shelter-in-place policies. we are 
									all connected. no one is alone. not really. 
									feel me'

									when i got home from prison the other day, i 
									wrote to new beginnings founder, brother 
									david schlatter ofm, and asked him to point 
									me to something in scripture i could take 
									back into my guys. brother david sent me a 
									couple things which i'll copy below. people 
									read the bible in different ways and at many 
									levels. some literal. some symbolic. i don't 
									wish to get into a hermeneutical discussion 
									here. i simply offer these ancient and 
									inspired words in the hope that taking them 
									into the silence of your heart and mediating 
									on them brings some comfort in these trying 
									days:

									you who dwell in the shelter of the most 
									high,
									who abide in the shade of the almighty,
									say to the lord, 'my refuge and fortress,
									my god in whom i trust.'
									he will rescue you from the fowler's snare,
									from the destroying plague,
									he will shelter you with his pinions,
									and under his wings you may take refuge;
									his faithfulness is a protecting shield.
									you shall not fear the terror of the night
									nor the arrow that flies by day,
									nor the pestilence that roams in darkness,
									nor the plague that ravages at noon.
									though a thousand fall at your side
									ten thousand at your right hand,
									near you it shall not come.
									you need simply watch;
									the punishment of the wicked you will see.
									because you have the lord for your refuge
									and have made the most high your stronghold,
									no evil shall befall you,
									no affliction come near your tent.
									for he commands his angels with regard to 
									you,
									to guard you wherever you go.
									with their hands they shall support you,
									lest you strike your foot against a stone.
									you can tread upon the asp and the viper,
									trample the lion and the dragon.
									-psalm 91
									and...

									but now, thus says the lord,
									who created you, jacob, and formed you, 
									israel:
									do not fear, for i have redeemed you;
									i have called you by name: you are mine.
									when you pass through waters, i will be with 
									you;
									through rivers, you shall not be swept away.
									when you walk through fire, you shall not be 
									burned,
									nor will flames consume you.
									for i, the lord, am your god,
									the holy one of israel, your savior...
									- isaiah 43:1-3.

									i hope to see you soon. 

									peace. 

									and much love,
									john
									  
may 16, 2020


after a while in lock-down, my own 
									grandkids were asking, 'who is this old 
									man''

									hi friends,

									i hope this note finds you well. we're all 
									hanging on for all we're worth out here in 
									little old delaware. 

									first the news: i'll be doing a digital 
									concert for the philadelphia folk song 
									society on sunday afternoon, may 17th '

									https://folksongsociety.wufoo.com/forms/pfs-presents-john-flynn-517-at-3pm-edt/

									my concert will be live on facebook:

									https://www.facebook.com/groups/233186384616328/

									new beginnings-next step is forging ahead as 
									best we can. although we still haven't been 
									able to get them up and running inside the 
									prisons, our returning citizen zoom meetings 
									seem to be of some value to our members in 
									their re-entry journeys. recently my board 
									of directors charged me with asking our guys 
									is they'd be willing to speak on the record 
									about the value of our groups and the men 
									have been very generous in their willingness 
									to do so. here's a link to a very short clip 
									from a recent meeting in which my friend 
									nick does just this:
									
									https://www.facebook.com/john.flynn.771/videos/10223002645473802/

									knowing and working with men like nick is an 
									honor. they often carry burdens that would 
									have buried me many times over, and yet they 
									keep going and keep striving for a better 
									way. i think if there's any credit for their 
									success it remains entirely with them, so 
									i'm not always sure how much help we really 
									are. what i do know is they continually 
									renew my hope and spirit. thank you for your 
									ongoing support of this work.

									i can't remember a time since my teens when 
									i've turned to my guitar for as much solace 
									as i have in the past couple months. 
									(perhaps my love of music began as a way of 
									rebelling against being sent to my room as a 
									kid' and, in a way, isn't that what we've 
									all experienced to some degree recently') 
									since i didn't have a lot of original 
									material ready to finish my current record, 
									my producer harvey and i have been working 
									on an album of cover tunes which we'll be 
									releasing soon under the name hondo jenkins. 
									we've had a blast and got some great takes 
									on songs by tom petty, u2, john prine, 
									george harrison, the animals, the four tops, 
									the monkees, the bee gees'. we even give 
									kenny rogers and the first edition a go with 
									a revamped version of the again famous 
									(thanks to the big lebowski) 'just dropped 
									in (to see what condition my condition was 
									in)'.

									the cover story for the new band goes like 
									this: hondo jenkins is the recently formed 
									duo of ellsworth hondo and vance parnell 
									jenkins; childhood friends  who grew up on 
									the road, traveling across the country as 
									their respective parents sought ever-elusive 
									stardom while touring with the vaunted 'up 
									with people' road show. 

									their ecstatic  musical pairing is the fruit 
									of a (dubious) midlife attempt to overcome 
									the bitterness and soul-crushing cynicism 
									that their parents bequeathed them as they 
									endeavor to fill interminable hours 
									presented by the current corona virus 
									lockdown. 

									hondo jenkins spans the mason-dixon line 
									both musically and geographically. 
									ellsworth recently left a position as the 
									assistant manager of a popular fishtown, pa 
									bowling alley due to his long-held suspicion 
									that the music business could provide a more 
									accommodating lifestyle than that heretofore 
									conferred by professionally sanitized rented 
									footwear. 

									until march of 2020, vance p. was the head 
									salesclerk at a music store in smyrna, 
									delaware. upon the store's unceremonious 
									shuttering under the designation 
									'non-essential business',  vance took it 
									upon himself  to 'borrow' some moderately 
									expensive recording equipment for the 
									duration of the work stoppage. 

									file swapping and musical hi-jinx ensued. 
									the scamps are currently hard at work 
									completing their soon to be released 
									shelter-in-place album called, take cover.

									the real story is:
									like many of us these days, john flynn and 
									harvey have too much time on their hands. 
									hondo jenkins is a name that john 
									occasionally used to play regional cover 
									bars when he was contractually prohibited 
									from appearing under his own name. with the 
									exception of the flynn-penned 'space 
									station', take cover is a collection of 
									cover tunes that john and harvey are having 
									a lot of fun putting together as harvey 
									patiently coaches john (a true techy-luddite) 
									through the intricacies of remote recording 
									on pro tools like one of those movies where 
									the guy in the control tower talks a 
									civilian through the steps of landing a 
									aircraft. ('pull back! pull back! you're 
									coming in too hot!') on some level the songs 
									all seem to speak to our shared moment. 

									here's a peek at a rough mix by this new 
									folk-rock super group. i picked this 
									particular song to honor my old friend, 
									legendary folk dj, gene shay, who we lost 
									recently to covid-19:


									https://soundcloud.com/john-flynn-39/papa-genes-blues

									speaking of gene, his passing hit our local 
									music community very hard. he had always 
									believed in me and seemed determined to use 
									any device at his disposal to get me more 
									exposure. somehow he continues to accomplish 
									this even now, as cbs news's lovely tribute 
									to him featured footage of the two of us 
									working together. first time i was ever on 
									network tv! i mean out of hundreds 
									(thousands') of hours of video of this guy 
									on stage, they picked him working with me' i 
									don't know how, but i know he had something 
									to do with it. i'll sure miss him.



									i was honored to have been asked to write 
									something about gene's passing for the 
									philadelphia folk song society, which i'll 
									post below.

									hope to see you online tomorrow and in 
									person real soon. please take care of 
									yourselves and stay well.

									much love,

									john

									this one stings (some thoughts on the loss 
									of gene shay) 

									by john flynn

									i've lost friends before. we all have. so 
									why did the death of my old buddy gene shay 
									from complications brought on by covid-19 
									hit me so hard' why did this sting a little 
									deeper' why was this pain sharp enough to 
									cause that involuntary gasp during these 
									interminable, mind-numbing weeks of 
									collective national breath-holding' maybe it 
									was our shared history. gene and i had been 
									down a long road together. 

									so many shows. so many festivals, and 
									conventions. i guess many of us in the folk 
									community share that sense of deep time 
									connection with him. gene was a locus, a 
									trans-generational touchstone. listening to 
									ian zolitor's moving tribute to gene on the 
									folk show, the sunday night following his 
									death, made that abundantly clear. hearing 
									tom rush's guitar doing 'mole's moan' during 
									the intro brought that clenched feeling back 
									to your throat all over again because you 
									knew gene's friendly voice wouldn't be 
									breaking in at any moment to welcome us all 
									around the crackling tribal campfire of a 
									radio program that we've all warmed our 
									hearts by for so many decades. so, yeah, 
									history was part of it. 

									but more than that, gene was like family. my 
									kids had grown up around him. when they were 
									little they'd crowd around the radio in our 
									dining room to hear him occasionally play 
									one of my songs. the whole family had once 
									spent a day mugging for his film crew at the 
									philadelphia zoo for a commercial he was 
									producing for the local tourism board. sean 
									and sarah had even done his radio show at 
									wxpn a couple times with me. yep, gene was 
									like family. but even that didn't quite 
									explain what i was feeling. maybe there was 
									a selfish aspect'

									gene always believed in me. indeed, i 
									remember thinking after the premature report 
									of gene's passing (arlo texted me that he 
									had laughed when he'd found out that gene 
									had actually outlived his own obituary. i 
									texted back that only gene could pull it 
									off...) that after my grandmother died, i 
									had a sense that there would never be 
									another person in this world who thought 
									quite so highly of me. when it came to my 
									music, gene was that person for me. 

									when i was just starting out, gene had given 
									me my first radio exposure by inviting me on 
									his show. (that is, if you don't count 
									playing into a telephone receiver on don 
									cannon's morning show on wibg when i was in 
									high school!) in those years the experience 
									was always a bit daunting. i loved 
									performing live' a staple on gene's 
									programs' but i must admit that i always 
									felt kind of vulnerable at the end of the 
									song' just as that final guitar chord faded 
									to silence. there'd always be this moment of 
									wondering. would gene like the song' and if 
									so, what adjectives of praise might ensue 
									from that authoritative and storied voice' 
									what quotable gems for your press kit might 
									you catch as they spilled forth into a 
									microphone that might shape the perceptions 
									of the entire folk community' but praise 
									wasn't really what gene was about. i 
									realized years later that he wouldn't have 
									had you on the show in the first place if 
									you weren't any good. that was already 
									understood. so, mostly gene's response to 
									your composition would be something along 
									the lines of, 'ehh' new song, huh'' 

									oh, the excruciating agony of a public 
									damning by faint chronology! yes, it was 
									new! c'mon dude! throw the kid a bone here! 
									did you like it' but nothing ever came back 
									then except' the best possible thing. 'let's 
									hear another', he'd say. 

									i always wondered about this reaction. that 
									is until i first heard a replay of gene 
									interviewing joni mitchell in which joni 
									plays the (then) three-day-old masterpiece, 
									'clouds' for the first time ' live on the 
									radio. you hear that last exquisite guitar 
									chord decay and you sit, stunned by the 
									craft, the beauty, the sheer brilliance! and 
									then gene responds (i kid you not!), 'ehh' 
									new song, huh'' wow! gene treated us all as 
									equals! no big stars, no local schlubs, just 
									songwriters. 

									his egalitarian approach to the artist would 
									become even more evident later on. in the 
									mid-90s, gene paid me the honor of asking me 
									to do a series of songwriting workshops with 
									him throughout the tri-state area. this was 
									a big deal for me as i was only beginning to 
									become known for my own stuff. having been 
									judged too much of a 'folkie' for nashville, 
									i'd built my living' and a good-sized 
									following' on the philly and jersey shore 
									cover bar circuit.
gene led the workshops and would open 
									them by speaking knowledgeably about what 
									made a good song. he would then use my 
									material to illustrate his points, asking me 
									to perform live and then questioning me 
									about the choices i had made in a particular 
									construction, lyric or melody. (i never 
									admitted to either him or the audience that 
									i felt like anything i'd done right was 
									purely accidental.) i must confess that i 
									learned a lot about the craft of 
									songwriting' and even about my own songs' 
									from doing these workshops with him. i was, 
									and remain to this day, a rather intuitive 
									writer and gene helped me understand some 
									things in new ways. he was a great teacher.
									at the end of our workshops gene would 
									encourage the audience' who generally came 
									armed with guitars, banjos or some other 
									'implements of distraction'' to share their 
									latest compositions. as you might expect, 
									the songs they regaled us with were of 
									varying quality. some were pretty good. 
									others were clearly written by folks just 
									starting out. some were' well' bad. back 
									then, my mind would almost always hear these 
									new songs from a critical perspective. i 
									remember arlo's great story about steve 
									goodman bribing him with a beer to get him 
									to listen to 'city of new orleans'. 
									according to the story, ag had initially 
									declined steve's request to listen, saying, 
									'songs' i hate songs!' that always made me 
									laugh and there were more than a few moments 
									back in those days where i'm embarrassed to 
									admit that i related to the sentiment.
not that i would necessarily share my 
									negative reactions. but my first instinct 
									was generally to notice what was 'wrong' 
									with what i was hearing. my thoughts would 
									automatically race to how the song could be 
									improved. it was a problem-solving 
									mentality. gene's response, however, was 
									always completely different. it was a 
									celebration mentality. it always began with 
									delight.
									the first thing gene would notice and 
									respond to about your song in these settings 
									was what was good about it. he'd point out 
									what you had done well. the songs 
									originality, evocation, enthusiasm, or even 
									the spirit behind the attempt were of just 
									as much interest to gene as the final 
									execution of the piece. and he was genuinely 
									excited that you had decided to join the 
									family of artists and composers that kept 
									our music community alive. this wasn't to 
									say that gene wouldn't give you constructive 
									criticism. after he had bestowed some of the 
									biggest smiles i had ever seen on the faces 
									of our fledgling writers, gene would gently 
									lead the composers into a discussion about 
									how to improve their work. his suggestions 
									were always valid and right on the money.
									

									gene's approach to songs mirrored his 
									approach to everything. he could say 'no' if 
									he had to, but his instinct was to begin 
									with 'yes'. it's a lesson i still try draw 
									upon. not that gene didn't also have a very 
									funny as hell edge. once, when i thanked 
									gene at a folk music convention for asking 
									me to run a high-profile workshop called 
									'secrets of the emerging artist', he said, 
									'john, no one's been emerging longer than 
									you.' 

									sometime after the songwriting workshop 
									period, gene signed me to my first recording 
									contract on sliced bread records, a label he 
									and his friend carl apter had started. 
									that's when i first encountered gene's 
									indefatigable sense of optimism. it was back 
									in the late 90s. gene was tasked with lining 
									up the producer for my project. i was 
									excited about his suggestion that we use ben 
									wisch, who had received a grammy for his 
									work on marc cohn's recent album. gene told 
									me that ben was up for producing me, 
									providing he and i hit it off personally, 
									and he advised me to drive up to new york 
									city and hang out with ben. the next night i 
									was standing with my guitar case in the 
									lobby of red house music. 

									ben was clearly at a loss to see me and 
									explained uncomfortably that he had actually 
									declined gene's offer to produce my record. 
									after some really awkward silence, i asked 
									him why he'd said no. ben responded that, 
									though he liked my singing, he didn't feel 
									the material on the demo cassette gene had 
									sent him was strong enough. a couple hours 
									later i had played ben a batch of new songs 
									and he had signed on as my new producer. 
									when i called gene at home the next day, he 
									explained that that was exactly what he had 
									envisioned happening. he said he had known i 
									was better live than on my demos, and that 
									if ben got to know me and hear my stuff in 
									person, he'd change his mind. gene also knew 
									me well enough to strongly suspect that if 
									i'd had a chance to stew on ben's initial 
									rejection, i would have never gone along 
									with the plan. gene was definitely an 
									optimist. plus, i remember thinking, that 
									was some serious jedi-level mind stuff going 
									on there. 'this is not the droid whose 
									recording project you declined''
throughout my career gene was probably my 
									biggest, most consistent supporter. 
									sometimes i think he even believed in me 
									more than i did. so, yeah. that would 
									account for some of the sadness i was 
									experiencing. but there was more to it. 
									there was just a plain old sense of loss.

									there was the loss of all that voluminous 
									knowledge and (to me anyway) old school 
									savoir-faire. i'm not exaggerating when i 
									say that i was never in gene's company that 
									i didn't learn something. and not only was 
									his grasp of music and culture encyclopedic, 
									it was always conveyed in a way that could 
									make even a sometimes incurious and often 
									self-involved student like me want to know 
									more. kris kristofferson once joked that no 
									one could hold you completely spellbound' on 
									a topic on which you had no interest 
									whatsoever' like ramblin' jack elliott. 
									(this is true. i once listened fascinated as 
									jack talked about his new sleeping bag for 
									forty-five minutes!) well, just imagine 
									jack's preternatural ability as a raconteur 
									rolled into a guy who held forth on subjects 
									you really cared about! plus, i honestly 
									don't think i ever knew anyone as 
									sophisticated as gene who had managed to so 
									completely avoid the joyless tinge of 
									cynicism. it's what made being around him so 
									much fun.
									but beyond all of this, beyond the sense of 
									kin and kindred, beyond the generous career 
									cheerleader and sherpa, and beyond the 
									bottomless font of musical and cultural 
									erudition, my world had lost something even 
									more precious. it had lost a source of 
									sweetness.

									gene almost always exuded a simple and 
									effortless cheerfulness; a natural 
									good-heartedness. and that dependable source 
									of agenda less affability was now gone. when 
									my mind searches to find archetypes to 
									compare, a few imprecise examples flash 
									unbidden: fred rogers, et, the dalai lama, 
									winnie-the-pooh. none of these are exactly 
									right of course. gene was far hipper than 
									these iconic figures (although the image of 
									pooh wearing dennis rodman style wrap-around 
									sunglasses did bring a smile to my face.) 
									still, my friend gene shared with them that 
									same simple quality of unpretentious 
									kindness. i'll miss that the most.

									so, for these and many other reasons, this 
									one stings, and will go on stinging for a 
									while. but scribbling out these thoughts 
									today helped me realize that the sadness 
									isn't near as big as the gratitude i feel 
									for the chance to have called gene a friend. 
									and it is certainly nowhere near as deep as 
									the affection for him that remains and will 
									abide. so, we'll continue to remember our 
									friend gene shay in our ways. we'll make and 
									love music. we'll look out for and take care 
									of each other. we'll hold each other in our 
									hearts until we can once again hold each 
									other in our arms. we'll laugh at (or in 
									spite of) awful jokes. and we'll raise 
									glasses to our absent friend. 

									i'll end with some lyrics from the song 
									'standing ovation' which i wrote for gene's 
									80th birthday:
									you stood with me in the driving rain 
									in the howling wind and the hurricane 
									and your soul was kind and your heart was 
									true 
									and you stood with me now i stand with you
									

									you stood with me when few others did 
									back when i was not much more than a kid 
									you showed me faith i had never known 
									and i knew that i'd never stand alone 

									when my hammer rang on that hard cement 
									you showed me what standing for something 
									meant 
									when i'd hear your voice on the laughing 
									wind 
									i would smile knowing i had a friend 

									who stood with me when the battles raged 
									when the lines were drawn from another age
									
									and our songs would try to say something 
									true 
									you stood with me 
									now i stand with you 

									as your hammer rings on this hard cement 
									when they ask where standing for something 
									went 
									i will hear your voice laughing on the wind
									
									and i will smile knowing i have a friend 

									i'll stand with you in the driving rain 
									in the howling wind and the hurricane 
									for your soul is kind and your heart is true
									
									and you stood with me 
									now i stand for you

									probably the last show for a while' 
									sussex correctional institution, georgetown, 
									de

									hi friends,

									so quite a bit has happened since i last 
									checked in. i pray you guys are all well and 
									taking care of yourselves. as for me, life's 
									going on pretty much the same with a few 
									minor adjustments here and there. of course, 
									any shows i've written to you of have been 
									postponed.

									our next step returning citizens support 
									group meetings are on hiatus since we didn't 
									want to risk either the health of our 
									volunteers (who are even older than me), or 
									that of our economically vulnerable members 
									who can ill-afford any wage loss due to 
									prolonged illness. we are reaching out to 
									the guys by phone each week and making our 
									weekly bus passes and grocery store gift 
									cards available through the mail. as things 
									evolve, we will certainly try to help when 
									we can 'and as we can 'with the resources 
									you've kindly made available to me through 
									your donations at my concerts and paypal 
									offerings at newbeginnings-nextstep.org. 
									(please don't see this as a solicitation 
									right now. i know many have been adversely 
									affected by the economic implications of the 
									virus. just know that i'm grateful for your 
									support!) as far as the prisons, although 
									they have been closed to all visitors in 
									delaware, they have remained open to new 
									beginnings, and i will continue to run 
									groups for as long as i'm permitted inside.

									offenders are incredibly worried about 
									coivd-19; some because they're trapped in a 
									problematic (in the best of times) 
									healthcare situation, some because they're 
									seriously immune-compromised, many because 
									their loved ones are among the most 
									vulnerable, and a few because they bear the 
									weight of the nascent stages of spiritual 
									awakening to the point that they fear being 
									deprived of the chance to go home and try to 
									make amends to those whose lives they have 
									wounded. (this last fear seems to be the 
									worst and was shared with tears last week by 
									one of the toughest looking men i've ever 
									seen.)

									i know this social distancing stuff 'and 
									what looks to me like an impending and 
									inevitable national lockdown 'has a lot of 
									folks freaked out, especially those who live 
									alone. a long time ago the good sisters 
									taught us about 'the mystical body of 
									christ' and what they called 'the communion 
									of saints'. my buddhist friends use 
									different language but talk about the same 
									kind of thing. quantum physics now tells us 
									this real and vital interrelationship of all 
									things goes beyond mere space and time, 
									beyond religious dogma, and certainly beyond 
									temporary shelter-in-place policies. we are 
									all connected. no one is alone. not really. 
									feel me'

									when i got home from prison the other day, i 
									wrote to new beginnings founder, brother 
									david schlatter ofm, and asked him to point 
									me to something in scripture i could take 
									back into my guys. brother david sent me a 
									couple things which i'll copy below. people 
									read the bible in different ways and at many 
									levels. some literal. some symbolic. i don't 
									wish to get into a hermeneutical discussion 
									here. i simply offer these ancient and 
									inspired words in the hope that taking them 
									into the silence of your heart and mediating 
									on them brings some comfort in these trying 
									days:

									you who dwell in the shelter of the most 
									high,
									who abide in the shade of the almighty,
									say to the lord, 'my refuge and fortress,
									my god in whom i trust.'
									he will rescue you from the fowler's snare,
									from the destroying plague,
									he will shelter you with his pinions,
									and under his wings you may take refuge;
									his faithfulness is a protecting shield.
									you shall not fear the terror of the night
									nor the arrow that flies by day,
									nor the pestilence that roams in darkness,
									nor the plague that ravages at noon.
									though a thousand fall at your side
									ten thousand at your right hand,
									near you it shall not come.
									you need simply watch;
									the punishment of the wicked you will see.
									because you have the lord for your refuge
									and have made the most high your stronghold,
									no evil shall befall you,
									no affliction come near your tent.
									for he commands his angels with regard to 
									you,
									to guard you wherever you go.
									with their hands they shall support you,
									lest you strike your foot against a stone.
									you can tread upon the asp and the viper,
									trample the lion and the dragon.
									-psalm 91
									and...

									but now, thus says the lord,
									who created you, jacob, and formed you, 
									israel:
									do not fear, for i have redeemed you;
									i have called you by name: you are mine.
									when you pass through waters, i will be with 
									you;
									through rivers, you shall not be swept away.
									when you walk through fire, you shall not be 
									burned,
									nor will flames consume you.
									for i, the lord, am your god,
									the holy one of israel, your savior...
									- isaiah 43:1-3.


									i hope to see you soon. 

									peace. 

									and much love,

									my kids joined me on stage to help with 
									vocals at our 
									camp dreamcatcher benefit concert
hi friends,
									we had a great time raising money for camp 
									dreamcatcher at the kennett flash last 
									month. thanks to all who came out to support 
									this annual event, especially my kids and my 
									special guests harvey, ken ulansey and 
									surprise guest, the amazing phyllis chapell. 
									this is always a special show and i hope 
									that, if you're in the area, you'll plan to 
									make it part of your holiday plans next 
									year. 

									some big news! i recently met with my 
									state's new commissioner of corrections, 
									claire dematteis and the chief of the bureau 
									of prisons, shane troxler. they have 
									approved my request to begin to introduce 
									new beginnings into delaware's remaining two 
									level-five prisons. (up until now we've been 
									confined to correctional and work-release 
									facilities in northern delaware only.) they 
									have also expressed a willingness to allow 
									me to use some of my formerly incarcerated 
									guys as group facilitators in the new 
									prisons. this has long been a dream of mine 
									and has met with resistance from the doc for 
									years. i believe it will allow our little 
									program to grow beyond my limited time, 
									experience, and abilities. although i've 
									been visiting prisons for fifteen years and 
									gotten to know and care for hundreds of 
									inmates and returning citizens, i remain 
									clear on the fact that i still have no real 
									idea what it's like to be incarcerated or 
									understand at a gut level the lethal sense 
									of hopelessness with which so many of our 
									members have had to live. (as i put it to 
									the commissioner, which aa meeting would you 
									rather attend 'the one being led by folks in 
									recovery, or the one being run by a bunch of 
									well-meaning people who've never had a 
									drink') i think this new development could 
									eventually change the power and scope of 
									nbns in profound ways!

									in a few weeks i'll be meeting with the 
									warden of the sussex correctional 
									institution to schedule a concert at his 
									prison which will allow me to introduce 
									myself ' and our new beginnings program- to 
									the inmates down in georgetown. this will 
									likely mean an even greater investment of my 
									time in nbns, but i honestly feel it's where 
									i'm called to put my energy these days as we 
									try grow this program up to a place where it 
									no longer relies so heavily on me and our 
									small, god-sent core of dedicated 
									volunteers. 

									the new downstate prison groups will 
									eventually present even greater financial 
									challenges for us as well, since at some 
									point, we'll begin to face the prospect of 
									providing weekly next step meetings and 
									transitional assistance for the men who are 
									released from these facilities. i know i 
									just have to trust that the answers will 
									become evident as i go. as my friend nbns 
									volunteer and board member sandy stefanowicz 
									is fond of saying, 'jump off the cliff and 
									build your wings on the way down.' i'll 
									check in from time to time and let you know 
									how the pinion construction is going.

									i get to restring my guitar next week for a 
									show at a new venue in havertown, pa. on 
									friday, january 24th, i'll be performing at 
									the kelly center (https://kellycenter.ticketleap.com/john-flynn-012420/). 
									on saturday, february 1st, i head north for 
									a show in bridgewater, ma (http://www.offthecommon.org/). 
									and the following day, i get to visit my 
									dear friend sonny ochs in middlburg, ny 
									where i'll do a concert at the public 
									library at 4pm. for info call (518) 
									827-4953. then on february 9th i'll be 
									returning to bel air, md (https://liriodendron.com/category/music-at-the-mansion/).

									hope to see you soon. thanks for always 
									having my back.

									peace,

biggest crowd ever for this year's annual
									
									new beginnings - next step thanksgiving 
									feast!

									hi friends,

									i'm typing quick as we just got a surprise 
									visit from the grandkids! more reasons to be 
									thankful as we head into my favorite 
									holiday.

									i had a great time out in the midwest last 
									month. just missed the snow and didn't (i 
									don't think) show too much rust for spending 
									more time in prisons than on stages this 
									past year. one of the best parts of the trip 
									for me was trying out a new song. the 
									wonderful audience reaction inspired me to 
									record 'the circle of love' and we just 
									finished vocals last night. i plan to 
									release the track as a digital single for 
									the new year. 

									lyrics included below.

									my gratitude seems to increase as the years 
									go by, in no small part due to the 
									extraordinary people i've been blessed to 
									get to know through my work. i'm including a 
									little story that illustrates my point. this 
									tale has a happy ending as the individual in 
									question is doing well in a shelter that our 
									nbns board member was able to get him 
									admitted to. more than this however, the 
									extraordinary kindness of our returning 
									citizen members in opening up their very 
									crowded house to a homeless stranger on the 
									strength of his association with nbns is 
									something i won't soon forget. (and this was 
									not the only time our guys have stepped up 
									this way.) it fills me with awe how the 
									folks with the least in this world are often 
									the ones willing to give the most. 

									here's what happened '

									he called me late wednesday night to say 
									that the prison had discharged him six 
									months early without so much as a dollar in 
									his pocket or a place to lay his head. he 
									told me he knew of a couch he could stay on 
									for the evening but he was going to take me 
									up on my promise that no new beginnings 
									member would have to sleep on the street 
									when they came out of prison. i told him i 
									would meet up with him the next day and help 
									him come up with a plan.

									when we met, he looked like hell frozen 
									over. it was 30 degrees and he'd been 
									outside all night. apparently the 'friend' 
									he'd planned to stay with had other people 
									crashing there as well. when these folks 
									began drinking and smoking crack, he knew 
									that his recovery- let alone his probation- 
									was in real jeopardy, so he left and walked 
									the streets of wilmington in the bitter 
									cold. (i later asked him why he didn't call 
									me and he said, 'john, you have a family and 
									i didn't want to bother you in the middle of 
									the night.' these are the kind of men in 
									work with.)

									little did he know that i hadn't slept very 
									well anyway, as i was tossing and turning 
									trying to think of place for him to stay. 
									now that the weather is turning colder, the 
									shelters are full. our go-to shelter last 
									year, the rvrc, has been closed for months, 
									and we learned just last week that the ymca 
									was not taking in any more men.

									i took him out for some food and used my new 
									beginnings-next step debit card to get him 
									some underwear and socks and a bath towel. 
									he was wearing a coat that he had pulled out 
									of a trashcan during the night-and it 
									smelled like it-so i gave him one of mine 
									that i had tossed in the car just in case. i 
									have been making calls all morning and had 
									not made much progress. but, by end of day, 
									one of the members of my board of directors 
									was able to come up with a bed that might 
									become available next week at a shelter she 
									was associated with down in bear, delaware.

									this man's recovery was on my mind and i 
									didn't want to place him in a motel by 
									himself just now, so i called one of our 
									next step members who owns a small house in 
									wilmington and has several fellow returning 
									citizens as housemates to help with 
									expenses. our next step homeowner agreed 
									with me that putting our brother in a motel 
									might not be the best move for his sobriety. 
									he told me that, although he had no empty 
									rooms or beds, if i could come up with an 
									air mattress, he would make a place on the 
									floor for our homeless brother. my daughter 
									donated the inflatable along with a quilt 
									and some sheets, and i dropped our newest 
									next step member off at a warm house where 
									men who have struggled with exactly the type 
									of challenges he's facing now live together, 
									successfully facing life on life's terms. 
									one of them whispered to me that, although 
									the initial offer was for a couple nights, i 
									shouldn't worry because as long as he 
									remained clean, the new guy could stay until 
									he found something else. one of the guys 
									will even drive him to bear on monday 
									morning for his intake interview.

									i saw our new brother at the next step 
									meeting this afternoon, where he spoke of 
									the things he saw as walked alone on the 
									streets his first night home. 'that was my 
									neighborhood, he said. i walked right 
									through the jungle. lots of people 
									recognized me and offered me drugs. they 
									called my name from porches and corners. 
									they were high. they were stoned. with snot 
									running down their faces. no coats. 
									freezing. living in 'abandominiums'. dying 
									and not even knowing it.' his eyes filled 
									with tears. 'that's what i always went back 
									to. that's why i've let so many people down 
									so many times. not this time', he said. 'not 
									this time.'

									not this time, indeed!

									no one can make it alone in this world. i'm 
									so thankful to be part of a small but 
									growing family that is willing to be the 
									difference between healing or breaking; 
									standing or falling. 

									in other news'

									just a reminder that i'm doing my annual 
									benefit concert for camp dreamcatcher in on 
									december 13th. we're in dreamcatcher's 
									backyard this year as the show moves to 
									kennett square, pa. you can save a bit by 
									buying these tickets early. please come out 
									and support this special show:




									here's the new lyric:



									the circle of love by john flynn

									chorus:
									ain't no love without freedom
									ain't no freedom without justice
									ain't no justice without mercy
									ain't no mercy without love

									fat man talking about bootstraps
									while he's hitting out of sand traps
									thin man scrounging round for food scraps
									while the car he's sleeping in's
									leaking oil from its valve seals
									as the banker's doing cartwheels 
									and the da's scoring plea deals
									as the choir sings amen! chorus

									politicians flash incisors 
									as the cops pull down their visors
									and we're sadder but no wiser
									as the world we're watching burn
									will growing harder just to live in 
									and to find a damn to give in
									'til we wake up to what we've been
									taking much too long to learn chorus

									bridge
									it's the circle of love, may it grow ever 
									wide
									until no one is standing outside

									there won't be no either or then
									we'll say both and maybe more when
									what was lost has been restored when
									what is torn has been made whole
									i can feel it every day in
									my old bones and my archaic
									deoxyribonucleic 
									yeah, i know it in my soul chorus

									' 2019 flying stone music



									i hope you're thanksgiving is filled with 
									the warmth of love.

									peace,

									john


 

									11/1/19

the best part of my job as executive 
									director of new beginnings-next step is 
									welcoming home men i've worked with while 
									they were in prison and watching them set 
									sail into their new lives. these two are 
									ready for whatever the voyage holds. 
									welcome home, mike and alphonso!
hi friends,
 
i've been so 
									blessed in my life -- with family, friends, 
									and work i care about -- that i didn't know 
									i could feel more grateful. but the deep 
									community i've stumbled into helping create 
									simply by continuing to show up for a 
									volunteer gig i had no business doing (and 
									no apparent aptitude for) has changed my 
									life in profound ways. 
the lesson that 
									keeps coming home again and again is one 
									that greg boyle at homeboy industries 
									imparted to me some years ago when i wrote 
									to him seeking advice about helping one of 
									my returning citizens who seemed to be 
									slipping back into old patterns and placing 
									his freedom in jeopardy. father g, as the 
									homies refer to him, assured me that i'm not 
									here to fix or save anyone. i'm just here to 
									be the tender glance of god. and that by 
									creating the context for the expression of 
									that tenderness'by continuing to show up and 
									stand with the marginalized- they would fix 
									and save me. 
i'm not sure 
									i'm either fixed or saved. but i know for 
									sure that i continue to get more than i 
									give. let me provide a couple examples of 
									the kind of psychic/spiritual remuneration 
									i've been receiving recently' first, a 
									letter that was forwarded to me by the 
									warden's secretary from a currently 
									incarcerated new beginnings member --

									september 9, 2019
after 
									attending several months of group settings 
									in the new beginnings group, i can without 
									reservations state that the overall impact 
									of the program is one of healing. on 
									numerous occasions i have witnessed men 
									confronting their own past behaviors and the 
									behaviors of others and eventually arriving 
									at a place of peace.
truth, 
									compassion and understanding are the 
									hallmarks of the program and more 
									importantly the volunteers who show up 
									without fail. the volunteers never seem to 
									judge program participants but do provide 
									frank and thoughtful feedback.
one of the 
									most amazing aspects of the program is how 
									gradually every participant lowers their 
									'protective wall' and allows themselves to 
									be vulnerable. opening up to what amounts to 
									a room full of strangers is not an easy 
									exercise, but because care and concern are 
									espoused by the staff members from day 1, 
									every participant i've known has eventually 
									gotten 'gut level' honest and shared true 
									feelings. on many occasions there is not a 
									dry eye in the room. please understand that 
									the tears are not only part of the process 
									as the staff and participants lift up and 
									support everyone in the room.
in this 
									concrete and steel fortress of destroyed and 
									interrupted lives, new beginnings is an 
									oasis of peace. every time i leave to return 
									to my housing unit i am uplifted and 
									inspired.
looking at 
									what new beginnings and next step actually 
									accomplishes is more impactful than what is 
									seen at first glance. while the group 
									meetings refresh and inspire those of us who 
									participate, the tangible benefits are even 
									greater. many of us take what we experience 
									and learn in our group sessions and transmit 
									it to other inmates and our family members. 
									i call this the spider web effect. twice 
									weekly, we absorb positive thoughts and 
									emotionally charged support and it carries 
									us through the entire week.
respectfully,
									eric harris
									howard r. young correctional institution

									pretty amazing, right' and no sooner had i 
									caught my breath for eric's beautiful 
									letter, a second wave of gratitude knocked 
									me off my feet.

									a few days ago i went to the nbns post 
									office box and picked up the mail. among the 
									envelopes waiting for me were two that had 
									been sent from the state prison containing 
									$75 in checks drawn on the account of an 
									incarcerated man named michael who's been 
									attending new beginnings groups for about a 
									year. michael has very little money, and, if 
									and when he can get a prison job, he earns 
									approximately 30 cents an hour with which he 
									can pay for phone calls and his commissary ' 
									which i won't say is expensive, but, trust 
									me, the same economic principle that allows 
									vendors to charge $10 for a hotdog at major 
									league baseball game is not altogether 
									absent in prisons. i was absolutely stunned 
									to see these checks.

									before depositing them in the bank, i 
									contacted the prison since there are strict 
									rules against any kind of extra-curricular 
									relationships between prison volunteers and 
									offenders. no contact ' visits, mail, etc.- 
									is permitted whatsoever, and any 
									transgression could result in the loss of 
									your security clearance. in effect, ending 
									my ability to do what i've been doing for 
									the last fifteen years, and possibly ending 
									the ability of our other volunteers to 
									continue as well. 

									the checks were not addressed to me, i 
									explained to the volunteer coordinator when 
									she picked up the phone. they were written 
									and mailed to my non-profit, which is a 501 
									c3 and recognized as a legitimate charity by 
									the irs. she too was amazed at my story and 
									told me that there were no rules covering my 
									situation since it had never occurred 
									before. i told her that i believed it was 
									important for my organization to accept this 
									generous gift, and that to decline it could 
									possibly be seen as a slight by our 
									incarcerated benefactor. part of what we do 
									is try to help men come to see how good they 
									actually are. how can we then go and deny 
									the expression of that goodness'

									i deposited the checks and thanked michael 
									in group yesterday. he explained that, when 
									he can, he tries to send some money to those 
									less fortunate. he mentioned st. jude's 
									hospital as a charity he also supports when 
									he can. he told me that weekly bus passes 
									and grocery assistance we give to returning 
									citizens could mean the difference between 
									their success and their failure when they 
									finally leave prison, and that he believed 
									in what we trying to do. then he sheepishly 
									added, 'besides, i might need you guys to 
									help me when i get out'. 

									my sincere thanks to michael and eric, and 
									all who support my work, music and 
									otherwise. 

									speaking of music, i'll be heading to the 
									midwest next week for a few shows:

									on friday, november 8th i'll be in 
									ferdinand, indiana--

																																				hi friends,

																																				some very special shows this weekend! 

																																				this friday night, october 4th, i hope my delco, pennsylvania peeps will come out and support my annual concert to raise money for my non-profit, new beginnings-next step. several of our returning citizens will speak about what this work has meant to their journeys both during and after prison. this year our guys will say thanks to ridley high school for allowing us to use their auditorium for the event by visiting with the students a few days early for some workshops dealing with a wide gamut of topics including the dangers of toxic culture, peer pressure, addiction, and the power of early choices. i'm very excited about this chance for our guys to work with some young people. i'll let you know how it goes! 


																																				then this saturday night, october 5th, i'll be doing a multi-artist event in ewing, nj as part of the concerts across america to end gun violence series. hoping my garden state fans will come out and support this important show.


																																				work in the prisons and with our returning citizens has been going well and, recently, it seems we're welcoming a new member of the nb-ns family home every few weeks. 

																																				one of the special groups we've been asked to work with over the past year is composed of men who've been providing information to the state concerning the prison riot, hostage taking, and murder of a correctional officer in smyrna a couple years back. i never mentioned this particular group before because these men are potentially under threat for their cooperation and therefore are being held in administrative segregation. any thought of confidentiality regarding their location vanished as their residence was made public by some recent high-profile newspaper articles. (see several front-page stories in the delaware papers last week.) 

																																				new beginnings was originally intended to be a group to help folks transition from incarceration to freedom, but, when the warden asked me to take on this new group, it quickly became clear to me that some of these men might never even leave prison. as i often do, i went to my guys, both incarcerated and recently home, for advice. i asked if they believed new beginnings could provide anything of value for a man facing a long - or even life - sentence. (i've always told then it was 'their' group, so i generally try to approach big decisions only after i understand them from perspectives to which i simply can't presume access. 

																																				the guys told me that there are different kinds of freedom. there's the 'walking around, go anywhere, eat at mcdonalds anytime you want' kind that you dream of when you're incarcerated. and then there's the inside kind. freedom in the heart, mind, and spirit. of the two kinds, they told me, this 'inside freedom' is the more important. the guys believed strongly that new beginnings was a great vehicle for achieving some measure of this kind of freedom, and in a dark place, any taste of freedom could be a priceless gift. i told the warden 'yes' ' but only if we could meet with the men without correctional officers being present. (one of new beginnings very few non-negotiable conditions is the ability to meet in privacy.) to my surprise, the warden consented, and i've never regretted the decision for a moment. i've simply never worked with men who were more grateful just to be listened to deeply, and to be seen, not for the worst things they've done, but for the awe-inspiring humility, compassion and courage they possess. please keep these, and all incarcerated and returning citizens in your prayers. 

																																				i'll be playing in ferdinand, indiana and chicago, illinois next month. hope to see you soon.

																																				peace,

																																				john

																																				hi friends, 

																																				i hope this note finds you and your loved ones safe and well in the midst of all this week's heart-break. my friend kim harris recently posted a quote from the talmud which i pass on here in the hopes that it will help you as much as it's helped me:

"do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. do justly now, love mercy now, walk humbly now. you are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it.'

																																				these words resonate very strongly in me and remind me of how gandhi once counseled that although whatever we do may seem insignificant, it is very important that we do it.' 

																																				it may (and probably will) get worse before it gets better, but, if we stand with each other, it will get better. how's that old song go' 'deep in my heart, i do believe''

																																				one of the best things for me to do in times like these is play, so i feel very fortunate to have some gigs coming up. 

																																				thursday evening, august 15th, i'll be doing an outdoor concert at bellevue state park. 
https://www.delawarescene.com/event/24543/

																																				and on saturday evening, august 17th, i'll be at the one world coffeehouse in columbia, md.
https://uucolumbia.net/events/coffeehouse-john-flynn/


																																				i was honored to be receive some very generous and very public pats on the back recently (links above); first by the national association of criminal defense lawyers, and, then, by my home state of delaware. every nbns volunteer will back me up when i say that we all feel we get much more than we can ever give in our work with incarcerated and returning citizens. there are truly so many people, without whom, i couldn't do of this; my volunteers, my board, my fans and friends, who donate from the kindness of their hearts to support our work, even the prison staffs have been a part of an important team that seems to be making a real difference.

most especially, i need to thank my best friend and wife of 35 years, beth, for being my 'peer support group' through so many ups and downs on this journey.

with beth at the franklin institute after the 
																																				national foundation for criminal justice awards gala. 
in other news, my new single 'an american cage' has just been released digitally on itunes, amazon, spotify etc. here's a link to one of the song's two youtube videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch'v=59fnuuqnwge
i'd really like this song to be heard, so hope you will not only share, but urge others to do the same.

																																				i had a great time singing at the ballpark last week when we got to take a bus load of our returning citizens and their guests to citizens bank park to see the phillies take on the san francisco giants.


																																				new beginnings-next step is in the house!

																																				my thanks to the phillies for continuing this special tradition with us, as well as for allowing me to sing. 


leading the crowd in 'take me out to the ballgame' during the seventh inning stretch.
my two annual benefit concerts this year are still a ways off, but i figure it's never too early to mark your calendars. on october 4th, i'll be raising money for new beginnings-next step with a concert at ridley high school, in folsom, pa, and on december 13th, i'll be doing my annual (23 years') holiday fundraiser for camp dreamcatcher. this year we're moving the dreamcatcher benefit onto their home turf, and will be holding the show at the kennett flash in kennett square, pa. 

																																				believe it or not, there's more news to tell, but i think i'll leave some for next time.

																																				stay strong.
																																				peace,

																																				john

																																				may 30, 2019

																																				hi friends,

																																				i'm writing on the morning of my 62nd birthday. that plus the fact that i haven't written in a while has provided me with an opportunity to step back and reflect a bit. mostly at this stage of the game, i guess the main thing i feel is gratitude. 

																																				i've been so lucky to earn a living doing things i care about, and so blessed to have four great kids and a woman i'm crazy about by my side. and now, on top of everything else, grandkids are starting to arrive. honestly, if i'd known how much fun being a grandpop was, i'd have gotten older sooner!



with 'the kid' at pop-pop's house
i continue having fun making new friends and hanging with old ones.

																																				 

with kris k. on the bus
i enjoyed catching up with my buddy kris kristofferson recently. kris is touring with merle haggard's old band, the strangers, and continues to inspire me as i contemplate continuing to strive in the pursuit of a creative and honest life. 

																																				a few weeks back i (almost) passed an old timer named ronnie wong at the 21-mile mark of the delaware marathon.

with ronnie w. at the finish line
i had seen this little guy up ahead of me all morning but had been unable to close the gap. i had run a pretty conservative (for once) race so i'd have a little gas in the tank during the final miles for a change. at the 20-mile mark i decided to pick up the pace a bit. when i finally reeled the old fella in, i gasped, 'i'm glad i'm not the only crazy old timer out here today!' the elderly runner cheerfully informed me that his name was ronnie wong, his age was 72, and that he was famous for having completed over 300 marathons. (this gave him ten years and at least 270 marathons on me!) 

																																				i quickly discovered that ronnie is supernaturally affable and a natural and gifted raconteur. since i had no pr (personal record) on the line, i decided to throttle back and spend a few miles letting him regale me with stories from a lifetime of running. actually, i don't think anyone passed us during these miles since the conversation took our minds off our mutual and growing fatigue, and we actually began to pick up the pace slightly.

																																				the stories were interspersed with sage advice and hard-earned wisdom of the road. at one point, ronnie asked me where i was looking. 'looking'' i asked. 'what do you mean' 'with your eyes', he replied, 'where are you looking with your eyes' 'down the road', i said. 'big mistake', he chided. 'look down at the road right in front of you. the marathon is a game of the mind. you get discouraged thinking how far you have left to run. but you can always take a few more steps, so just concentrate on the next few yards or so. the rest will take care of itself.' great advice, huh' i've begun to use it in my prison work. 

																																				when the headwind picked up, ronnie ducked in behind me and began to draft, explaining that at 115 pounds he was likely to get blown away. "damn," i exclaimed, "i've got 45 pounds on you! no wonder i'm so much more tired". he laughed and said, "you should run more! you wouldn't be so fat any more!" that's when i decided to leave him in my dust. (but he drafted behind me all the way to the finish line.)


																																				work in the prisons and with our returning citizens continues to go well. we are all instructed to love our neighbors. and of course, this doesn't mean just the folks who think and look like we do (which can be something akin to admiring our own reflections in a mirror). but how do we love the other' the immigrant, the marginalized' the people who are different and may even challenge our assumptions about our world' is this kind of love of neighbor just something you do with your mind' a feeling that you cultivate in your heart' i think we are, for our own sakes, called to let it be more than this. i am increasingly aware that new beginnings-next step actually provides me with a context for this 'more'. it allows me to be in relationship with incredibly courageous, diverse, and inspiring men and women whom i would never otherwise have known. to come to see as brothers and sisters, folks who've led lives and endured things i'm not sure i personally would have had the strength to survive. these folks change, and perhaps in a very real sense, save my life. 

																																				i spent a good deal of time with one of them last week. 

																																				a devout muslim brother of ours who has spent most of his adult life in prison for a series of very serious crimes that began at a young age when, with his father locked up, his grandmother rescued him from foster care and explained to him that his biological mother didn't want him. most of this man's life has been driven by the pain of that revelation. indeed, he's only now beginning to struggle to let go of the rage and self-hatred caused by his inability to understand or deal with the foundational wound it inflicted. he spoke last night of what i've come to know as the 'hour of the wolf'. that time between 3 and 5 am when our minds and spirits are prey to our darkest fears and deepest doubts. it is during this time each night, he told us, when he slides from his bunk to his knees and 'tears fall on my prayer rug'. he looked me straight in the eye and asked me to help him. i probably said many things in the final
																																				minutes of group. about how honored i was by his trust, about how proud i was of his courage, about my strong belief that real freedom lay on the difficult path of self-discovery and vulnerability he had undertaken. and about my personal understanding of a god called by many names, who suffers with us in a kind of radical solidarity. i'm honestly not sure if any of it helped, but i do know that everything i said essentially boiled down to me telling him that i loved him. i'm spending today in prayer for our brother. if you have a moment today, please say one as well. for all the wounded ones.

																																				i'm heading to chicago for a live concert on wfmt fm's folk stage at 8pm saturday, june 1st. i'll also be doing a house concert in oak park, il on june 2nd. i believe these shows are sold out but you can email me through my web page to be placed on a waiting list in case there are any cancellations.

																																				i'm looking forward to getting up north next month when i return to the guthrie center in great barrington, ma (june 14) and the omega institute in rhinebeck, ny (june 15). other than that, i've got an easy performance schedule this summer. i was honored to be asked to perform for the foundation for criminal justice's annual fundraiser in philadelphia on august 2nd. and i'll be in columbia, md at the one world coffeehouse on august 17th.

																																				i'm not sure what this next lap around the sun will bring, but i'm very glad to be given the chance and grateful to have your support and friendship on the journey.

																																				peace,

																																				john

what freedom looks like


																																				hi friends,
someone recently asked another successful returning citizen why he kept coming to our weekly new beginnings-next step meetings after four years out of prison. his response was to ask, 'why would you not go home to your mom's for sunday dinner''
what a perfect answer! i couldn't have put it better myself! that sense of family, of community, is probably the most important part of what we try to provide with nb-ns. forming trust relationships that allow us the freedom to be ourselves and risk being truly vulnerable. and i've come to understand that this vulnerability is the first step on the road to the healing we all need in order to grow and evolve in productive and creative ways.

																																				with the legendary dick kniss at a house concert in his home
speaking of creative vulnerability, my old friend dick kniss once told me it was a big responsibility being in john denver's band because john would try out material on you and gauge your initial response when deciding whether or not to share the new song with the rest of the world. anything less than an extremely enthusiastic response could effectively doom a composition to oblivion. this always endeared john denver to me. for
																																				though he was one of the most successful recording artists in the world, he still struggled with the same doubts and insecurities we all do when it comes to artistic and self expression. i can completely identify with that sense of vulnerability, especially during the final stage of the creative process. it also illustrates how important it is to trust the first ears (and hearts) you share your song with. that's why i'm debuting a new one (lyrics below) next thursday night, march 21st, at baldwin's station in sykesville, md. i started writing 'the song of my becoming' for my year-old granddaughter taylor, but it kind of ended up being for me as well.
i love trying out new stuff on audiences and have come to really trust those experiences and the feedback i get. so if next week's crowd likes 'the song of my becoming', the rest of you will probably get a chance to hear it sometime down the road. to be part of the "jury" call (410) 795-1041 for tickets.
i'm looking forward to getting back to the michigan in early april when i'll
																																				be in hudson and ann arbor. information on these and other upcoming
																																				shows can be found on my web site at johnflyn.net
much love,
																																				john

2/13/2019

																																				greg became the first one of my guys to return to prison 
																																				through the front door when he visited gander hill 
																																				as a guest speaker for new beginnings - next step!


 
hi everybody' 
 
i've run somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty marathons over the years and i can attest to the fact that those 26.2 mile races can seem to be only half over at the twenty mile mark. that's how challenging the final six miles can be. the streets of those races are often filled with spectators who cheer you on and tell you how great you're doing. in the early parts of the race, their support really carries you along. but in the final stages, when the pain and exhaustion set in, when you hit what runners call 'the wall', and the voices of self doubt begin to gnaw at your will and confidence, it isn't the well meaning folks shouting from the sidewalks that get you through. it's the voices of those who run beside you. those are the voices that carry the most weight. when the man or woman running next to you says 'don't give up! we can do this!', you tend to believe them because you know they've come down that same long road with you. you know that they know how you feel. 
 
this understanding has always informed how i've viewed my role facilitating our new beginnings support groups in the prisons. for, when it comes down to it, i'm really just a well meaning spectator, braving the elements, handing out some power bars or gatorade, at times hollering myself hoarse, maybe even playing the rocky theme on my boom box. and although i know the guys i've worked 



with 

over the years, both in prison and afterwards, have truly appreciated what i've tried to do, in the end, it's what they say to each other that really makes the difference. that's where the real heavy lifting occurs! that's when the magic happens!

 
that's why this week was such a special one for us at new beginnings - next step. greg, the young man pictured above, is someone i met when he was serving a six year sentence in the state prison. his nickname inside was superman, mainly given to him by inmates who thought he resembled clark kent. (he has since abandoned his trademark the plastic frames.) greg has been out three and a half years now, and in that time he has done amazing things with his life. he started from scratch, having never so much as put together a resume, let alone fill out a w2. he started small by chasing hours with landscape and construction companies, but, a lifelong car nut, he decided to be near his passion and applied for a job detailing automobiles at a large local dealership.  he parlayed that interview into an entry level sales job and a couple years and a lot of hard work later, he is now the manager of that entire dealership! 
 
greg accompanied me back into gander hill yesterday to share his remarkable story, so that other men might begin to hope and plan for their own future success! 
to have one of my guys go back inside with me has long been a dream of mine, for no one can speak to the experiences of an incarcerated or returning citizen like someone who's looked into and wrestled with those particular demons, with those sometimes overpowering moments of fear, shame and despair. therefore no one can bring more hope!
 
this kind of thing was never permitted before and i'm deeply grateful to warden akinbayo for the chance to bring a former prisoner back inside with me. greg spoke eloquently and powerfully about his decision - made early in his incarceration - not to waste the experience. he vowed not to leave prison the same man he had been when he entered. and he dedicated himself to his own transformation. it was a privilege to accompany him on a small part of that journey.
 
greg addressed a large and rapt group of our new beginnings members, as well as - for this special occasion and by invitation from our guys- prison staff including warden ak himself. 
 
it took an enormous amount of courage for greg to go back there this week. (other men have turned me down when i approached them about this.) what he shared touched many and will truly help prepare men for the hard work that lies ahead when they're released. the response to his testimony was tremendous!  he was treated like a rockstar after group was over, with men pressing in to thank him and shake his hand. lunch afterward at panera didn't even begin to pay the debt i owe him.
 
i guess you've noticed that most of my posts spend more time talking about my reentry work than my music these days. i suppose this is partly due to the fact that my time is increasingly taken up with my duties for new beginnings-next step. 
the ironic part of this however is that the majority of the funding for the transitional assistance (weekly bus passes and grocery store gift cards, transitional housing assistance, etc.) that we give to our members when they're released from prison comes from the folks who support my music and attend my shows. 

 

that's why i'm even more excited than usual to have a few special performances coming up next week. 
 
i'll be in sykesville, md on thursday february 21st at baldwins station:
https://uptownconcerts.com/baldwins-station/shows/
 

at musical lairs

in villanova, pa on saturday february 23rd:
http://www.musicallairs.org

																																				and in bel air, md on sunday afternoon february 24th:

in april i'll be returning to hudson and ann arbor michigan. info on these and other shows can be found on my website at www.johnflynn.net 

																																				as i wrote last time, our newbeginnings-nextstep.org website now has a link to paypal through which you can donate directly to our nonprofit. some of you wrote to me following that news and explained that you are more comfortable sending something through the mail.  if that's the case you can send checks made out to new beginnings-next step. our mailing address is po box 7211, wilmington, de 19803. a receipt with our ein will be furnished. 

																																				we are also now participating in the amazon smile program by which you can designate new beginnings-next step inc as your charity. that way we will receive a a small percentage of each of your amazon smile purchases. the link is: https://smile.amazon.com/ch/82-2795965


 
																																			thanks 
for your continuing support of my work. 
 
i hope to see you soon!

 
																																			peace,

																																			john

happy holidays from new beginnings-next step! 


																																		 
																																		hi friends, 
																																		as the year draws quickly to its close i'm filled with a sense of gratitude for the opportunities i continue to receive to both touch and be touched by the lives of so many inspiring and courageous people. as a wise young man i worked with for several years both during and after his incarceration said to me recently, the question we need to ask each other isn't, 'what's wrong with you'' it's 'what happened to you'' he is of course absolutely right. it's our stories that connect us. our stories that create communion and understanding. i'm so blessed and honored to be continually entrusted with these stories, to carry and share them, both on the dark prison tier and the bright stage. here's an example of one such story.

in group we often talk about what it means to be free. not just released from the penitentiary or the often overbearing strictures of probation, but really free in our hearts, minds and spirits. often this means going inward to the place of that original wound. there and only there can the long process of healing begin to take place. it's often hard and scary work. recently in our next step (after prison) group a man talked of living in such extreme poverty that, as a little boy, the entire school bus would laugh when he got dropped o. in front of his family's shabby house. he spoke of how he felt when the prettiest girl in the third grade laughed at his dirty coat. he traced the choices he made that eventually took him to prison directly back to the burning shame that little boy swore never to feel again. a shame that lay dormant but was rediscovered decades later in a prison cell. he's been out a few years now, is working a good job (saying with a huge smile, 'i have benefits!') rebuilding his life and helping his four kids attend college. i'm so inspired, not only by the resilience he has shown in so successfully moving on in life , but by the incredible courage he has exhibited in going back and wrestling with his own foundational wounded-ness. i'm so proud of the good man he is and always was. and i'm honored to know yet another human being committed to being truly free. 

as nb-ns finishes its first year as a registered 501 c3 non-profit, we are confronted with some important choices about how to grow our efforts to reach out to the most vulnerable members of our community. if you'd like to support our work to help the incarcerated and returning citizen discover hope and dignity, please consider making a donation to us via paypal. you can find a link on our homepage at newbeginnings-nextstep.org.

now some music news. my new cd, vintage, has been receiving an unprecedented (for me) amount of airplay from folk djs across the company. i was their third most played artist in october and 'she persisted' was actually the number one song for that entire month. although, like stevie said, 'the landslide (of new music) brings you down', we've been out over nine weeks and the cd is still hanging in at 12th on their airplay chart. you can find vintage on all major digital distribution services. or if you'd like to see your favorite neighborhood folksinger receive even more than the .0036 cents that spotify will generously pay him if you stream all all twelve songs, you can purchase an actual physical cd at www.johnflynn.net. 

my producer harvey recently surprised me with a video of a song we released a few years back. the video includes some great cell phone footage captured by lisa kristofferson as kris and i rehearsed my song 'malala ' backstage at the birchmere in virginia. you can check out 'malala' here: https://m.youtube.com/watch'reload=9&v=vihucxjmy_u 

i'll be doing my annual holiday benefit concert for camp dreamcatcher, a therapeutic summer camp for kids dealing with aids/hiv on wednesday, december 12th. the show will feature my friends harvey and reggie harris , along with my kids, and will take place again this year at the beautiful sellersville theater in sellersville, pa. here's a link for info and tickets- https://www.etix.com/ticket/p/6910467/john-flynn-family-friends-holiday-concert-sellersville-sellersville-theater-1894'language=en&country=us&cobrand=sellersville&searchtype=organization&

a wonderful show to put on your radar for the start of 2019 will take place in silver spring, md on january 18th. i'll be part of the third annual unnaugural concert, playing it forward, voices for social justice. info here: https://www.unnaugural.org

on stage with my producer harvey at the cd release concert at the kennett flash... thanks to everyone who came out!

 

																																	 


 

hi friends,


 

the heartbreaking news these days seems to be coming in waves, one after another; each one capable of knocking you down before you can fully recover or catch your breath from the last. in these situations, i find it even more important to take time to notice -and thank- the truly good, loving, and courageous people in our world. i'm not talking about the big famous one's either. (lord knows we have our share of these                   !) i'm referring to the regular folks going about their work and lives quietly, without much notice or reward. the world is held together by folks like these and they're truly all around us. 


 

these are the same people fred rogers was talking about when he said 'when i was a boy and i would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, look for the helpers. you will always find people helping.'
 

just today in gander hill prison, one of our guys shared that last night he was going through something pretty difficult and 'feeling some kind of way'.  dealing with anger has been a stumbling block for this young man, and he was out over is skis a bit and in danger of making choices that could have potentially extended his stay with the department of corrections. a corrections officer who had been observing not only the situation, but how hard the young man had been trying to make positive changes in his life, pulled him aside and talked to him, radically deescalating the moment emotionally. the officer spoke to my new beginnings younger brother for several minutes, helping the young man pull back and get some perspective on the tense situation. he shared with the young man how impressed he'd been with him, and encouraged him not to throw away all he'd worked so hard to achieve in the last couple years by acting out in the heat of a volatile and vulnerable moment. the guard's words helped. a lot. 
 

corrections officers in my state may well be the most overworked and underpaid public servants we have. i know all the preconceptions about prison guards, and i'd be lying if i said i'd never met some that lived up (or down) to the stereotype. add to the chronic staffing problems of an already very tough gig the regular mandatory overtime in which shifts are 'frozen' (which essentially means... we know you were scheduled to work until midnight, but it turns out that you have to stay until 8am...) and you can see that an already stressed workforce has had their jobs made much more difficult. it's against this backdrop - one in which it would be so easy to do no more than the bare minimum the job requires - that the aware and consciously 'human' being truly shines. and i've known many who wear badges. 
 

the officer last night went the extra mile and potentially changed the course of an inmate (and friend of mine's) life.  i know a conversation with an emotional kid seems like a little thing when viewed against the enormity of the events of the day.  but little things -expressions of care and compassion- like this are being done all around us all the time. and in the end, the kind of world we live in may well end up being the sum total of these little things. (hmmm... i may be plagiarizing gary cooper's character in that frank capra movie here! oh well, if you're gonna steal, steal from the best!!!) anyway, pay attention to them. they're the best pdfs (personal flotation devices) we've got when the waves threaten to take us under. 
 

i'll be at focus in sterling, virginia this saturday evening, november 3rd -http://www.focusmusic.org/concert-s


 

this year, my annual holiday benefit concert for camp dreamcatcher will take place at the sellersville, theater on december 12th. my special guests this year will include reggie harris, harvey, and my kids! here's a link for more info: https://theater.st94.com/events/john-flynn-family-friends-holiday-concert/

hope you can join us!


 

the new cd has been getting a great reception from folk djs around the country.  it's available at all major digital outlets (itunes, amazon, spotify etc.) but the actual cds are only available at my shows or through my website. 
 

see you out there!
 

peace,
 

john

great time performing with my buddy, josh white jr., at uncle calvin's
																																 in dallas last week!


																																hi friends,

																																as i type the date, i can't believe it's been 17 years. let our thoughts today be with those who still struggle with the life changing losses and wounds they sustained on that terrible morning. when the philadelphia phillies resumed play a week later they asked me to sing 'god bless america' at veterans stadium during the seventh inning stretch of their game with the atlanta braves. the sound- the spirit- of 40,000 people singing along with me under the open sky lifted my heart and gave me the first glimpse of something that could reasonably called healing. it had to do with the sense of courage i felt in the presence of my neighbors that night. i'm not sure this country held on to that spirit in the months and years that followed. but here's a song that moment inspired: https://www.youtube.com/watch'v=g0tsc8x3v9e&feature=youtu.be

																																i had an amazing time at the global homeboy network out in los angeles a couple weeks ago. close to 400 people, from all over the world, came together to share their ideas and experiences in helping folks reintegrate into society and rebuild their lives after incarceration and gang involvement. i was especially honored to attend the conference with a friend and hero of mine, new beginnings-next step participant and (now) advisor, quincey thomas. i met q when he was serving time in gander hill prison and have been so proud of the successful life he's built since his release three plus years ago.


with the author of 'tatoos on the heart', father greg boyle 
																																of homeboy industries, and quincey thomas
on the flight back from l.a. quincey reflected on all the wonderful people and organizations we'd encountered at the conference. we were both deeply affected by the hundreds of people from across the planet, all of whom were dedicated to striking some kind of a meaningful blow for restorative justice. somewhere over arizona q said, 'you know, mr. john (personal note: i will never get this man to call me just plain john! believe me i've tried!) all those people, homeboy industries included, are doing great stuff! but no one is doing what new beginnings does. (except for some gospel sharing ministries') no one is really going into the prisons where the need is the greatest. new beginnings-next step is really doing something special!' i had to agree with q and it strengthened my resolve to continue and grow this effort.

																																of course the la trip wasn't all business!
i'm heading to new england this weekend'

																																i'll be doing a house concert in east bridgewater, ma on saturday night, september 15th. email jeff at i42golf3@yahoo.com, or call (508) 345-3682 for information.

																																i'll also be playing the joe davies folk festival in middleborough, ma on sunday afternoon, september 16th. here's a link: http://www.soulehomestead.com/upcoming-events/joe-davies-folk-festival/

																																i'm doing a private event in west chester, pa on september 23rd, and then i'll close out the month in schenectady, new york doing a concert for my dear friend sonny ochs: on september 30th: http://schenectadyhistorical.org/upcoming-events/'mc_id=1174

																																final bit of news' my new cd, vintage, will be out on october 5th! the local release concert will take place in kennett square, pa at the flash later that month.

																																hope to see you soon.

john flynn is as close as we come these days to a live phil ochs!

																																closing the new beginnings-next step benefit concert with some of my guys...


																																hi friends,

																																we had an amazing time and turnout at the nb-ns benefit concert this year! i was so proud of the four returning citizens who got up and spoke about the work we do. i know i surprised a lot of the guys in attendance by inviting them all on stage to close the show, but, as i'm sure anyone who was in the auditorium will attest, it was a moving and powerful experience hearing them sing the spontaneously rewritten third verse of my song 'benediction' with the words, 'may your days bring you freedom and peace'. (there's some video here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch'v=kaukgo1eqzs&feature=youtu.be

																																my thanks to nb-ns board member, volunteer facilitator and chief meditation instructor, sandy stefanowicz, for helping produce the concert. and a big thanks to my alma mater, ridley high school for welcoming me home and hosting the event.

																																the prison work grows and i've been asked to start yet another 'inside' group in a new part of a prison. after i explained that new beginnings would need to hold to our foundational principle that participation could not be induced or mandated, i met with the offenders on the new tier last week and explained what we are and what we do. i spent about a half hour with the men and told them that if this was to work it had to be their decision and their group. i departed after telling them i would leave it to them to decide whether i show up next thursday morning at 10am. i'll let you know how the vote comes out...

																																this past week i was also allowed to do a concert inside gander hill prison. i joked with members of the audience that i was honored to be there because no one had ever paid so much to see one of my shows before. the reactions of the men to my songs were some of the most powerful i've experienced in going on four decades of sharing my music. my song, 'just like merle haggard said (sing me back home)', contains the lines 'please sing me back to a place in the sun, where men can be more than the worst things they've done...' at hearing those words, a man in the audience left his seat, turned his back to the stage and disappeared completely from my view. i later learned that he had dropped to his knees and buried his face in his hands for the duration of the song. sandy stefanowicz was in attendance and seated nearby. she wrote on facebook afterwards that, 'one of our guys fell to his knees crying and praying... the next night at our thursday meeting in the prison, one of the men told john that the words to his songs expressed everything he has ever felt and experienced in prison'.

																																i'm sure you'll believe me when i write that no award or review from a professional critic could ever mean as much to a performer or songwriter. 

																																thank you all for your support and prayers as i continue to be uplifted and astonished to encounter brothers and sisters, beautiful children of god, and indeed, our lord himself, in the faces of strangers who have often endured things i fear i may never have had the strength to survive personally. at least not intact.

																																i'm increasingly certain that we can all experience these (for me) life changing recognitions if we give ourselves the chance to create a context in which they can occur. as far as i can tell, for a person comfortably ensconced in what our society thinks of as the middle class, this often requires moving dramatically beyond our respective comfort zones. i guess that's often to a place they call the "margins". i doubt i would have had the courage to do this personally unless i was asked. i'll always be grateful for this invitation. at first, i believed that brother david, the franciscan friar who stared new beginnings, had seen something in me that i didn't see in myself. now i'm coming to understand that everyone in possession of a beating heart ' hence, a heart that can be broken- is not only able to make this journey, but is perhaps duty bound!

																																i was on a panel with my friend mary gauthier at a conference in kansas city last year and we were addressing this very idea. a man in the audience asked how to begin and mary said, 'go towards what breaks your heart.' best advice i ever heard.

																																i had a great time seeing and hearing friends at the philadelphia folk festival this past weekend. the best part was getting to introduce my granddaughter to everybody. there's a wonderful new book called "smiling banjo" about the festival which includes amazing photos of folks who've performed there over the years. (there are even two shots of my kids!) in the back of the book is a list of all the performers who've played there and the years they appeared. it blew me away to see that in the past 25 years i've played pff thirteen times! i'll never be able to thank the folk song society (and head honcho, andy braunfeld) enough for all their support has meant to me.

"john flynn isn't the only artist i admire that my kids discovered on their own. but there are similarities between him and the others. two of the best writers i ever knew - roger miller and shel silverstein - had, in common with john, fertile imaginations, a shakespearean love of words, and the ability to see funny things with a child's eyes. their art, like john prine's, is a wonderful combination of humor and heart that can move kids and grownups to laughter, tears, or both... the truth is in the details; the gifts are an ear for accurate dialogue, an eye for powerful imagery and anything funny, and a heart open to surprises and the possibilities of moving the emotions. john flynn is one of a special breed of good-hearted artists whose reaction to the human condition finds kind, humorous expression. god bless them.' - kris kristofferson

hi friends 

																																i hope this note finds you well. i'm sorry i haven't written in a while but things have been conspiring to keep me from the keyboard recently. 


my summer chore list included a lot of firewood to split and stack

																																a lot going on'. i finally finished up what will be my next cd, vintage. i'm anxious for you to hear the songs which include 10 new compositions and two older ones. one of the new songs, sing me on my way, includes vocals by heroes, friends and loved ones including my kids, my brother michael, arlo guthrie, kris kristofferson, kathy mattea, billy swan, and many others. it is very special to have so many voices from my musical journey brought together in one place. i'll let you know when the cd is to be released, but i'm shooting for sometime this fall. 

our new beginnings-next step picnic was a great success!
john talks more about new beginnings-next step here:
https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/offering-new-beginnings-interview-musician-social-activist-john-flynn-lbkr/
my continued thanks to those who support new beginnings-next step, inc through donations at my shows and in the mail. as executive director my time and efforts have been increasingly monopolized by this work but in a very real way i feel it is exactly what i've been doing all along with my music. i know that as a young parent when one of my kids was sick, though i loved all my children equally, my ear was always turned to the cry of that sick child. there were nights where beth or i slept by that ailing child's door, or held it in our arms. i often feel that the lord is like a young parent and i feel god most keenly in the presence of those who are asked to suffer greatly, as in the case of our incarcerated brothers and sisters. 

																																or with returning citizens as they summon the courage to take on the enormous challenges of starting a new life - often without a dollar in their pocket or a possession to their name. 

																																rather than cost my music, i believe this experience over the past thirteen years has profoundly enriched it. and i will continue to try to share what i learn in my songs and stories. 

																																i'll get to sing some of those songs in great barrington, massachusetts on saturday, july 14th, at the guthrie center. the 14th is woody's birthday and it is no small honor to have been selected to appear on this particular evening in this particular place. i will be of course including a few of my favorite woody songs in the show--

https://guthriecenter.org/troubadour-series/ 

																																i will also be performing a show perkiomenville, pennsylvania on july 26, and i'll be back in wilmington, delaware at bellevue state park on august 2. 

																																my annual benefit concert for new beginnings next step will take place at my alma mater, ridley high school in folsom, pennsylvania on august 10th.

																																later that month i will be flying out to california for a house concert in culver city as well as attending the homeboy global network conference in l.a. father greg boyle, author of tattoos on the heart, calls this conference a 'finishing school for compassion'. i'll be taking one of our nbns returning citizens along with me on this trip to speak about the work we're doing here in wilmington, delaware.

																																stay strong, 
john

"john's songs reach deep and he has a way of touching an audience in ways that few can match. reviewers often write that flynn 'follows in the footsteps of woody guthrie and pete seeger,' yet john's work for justice and fairness is something he weaves seamlessly into his concerts. he truly inspires his audience. his most recent concert here ranks among our favorites and we look forward to the next time."

mike is one of many new beginnings members making good in the world! he is the manager of a kfc and writes that new beginnings 'kept me humble and grounded. the next step here! integrity is number one (in) my rehabilitation!... thanks for believing in me... no looking back... love freedom!'




																																hi friends,
i hope this note finds you well! i'm packing for a couple shows in florida this weekend. i'm looking forward to seeing some old friends and- after a long snowy winter her in the midatlantic- having a chance to get out and run in the warm sunshine. links and information regarding upcoming shows are below.

																																the new album is going great! last night we finished cutting vocals on a song called sing me on my way which features the voices of family, friends and heroes i've worked with throughout my career. singing on the track are folks like kris kristofferson, arlo guthrie, kathy mattea, and billy swan, jane kelly williams, lizanne knott, and ben wisch. even my kids and my brother mike (my first singing partner) join me at the microphone. i can't wait for you to hear it!
the work in prison and with returning citizens continues to teach and amaze me. an example:
someone in one of our men's prison groups recently complained about a new transgender inmate named wheeler. (not using real names here.) although wheeler identified as a woman, doc classifies people solely on the basis of anatomy. being new to prison, wheeler was - quite understandably -having a difficult time adjusting. and she wasn't the only one.
'i ain't looking for trouble, but that stuff really freaks me out.' martinez said with almost practiced disgust. plus, if you're seen with people like that, then other people start wondering about you! all i know is he... she... it... better steer clear of me.'
before i could say a word, another member of our circle came back at him hard. 'knock off the bull!' he said. 'don't use that kind of language here. you're talking about another human being! what about what we talk about in new beginnings' what about working on your own shit and not judging other people' none of us in here is perfect or has all the answers. if you think you do, maybe this isn't the group for you.'
the room was momentarily filled with a charged tension but the disagreement that ensued was talked out and worked through-as is our way- with measured and respectful words. i saw each man, guided by his brothers in the circle, really attempt to listen to the other. and within minutes a truly amazing discussion evolved. by the time we began our closing meditation ninety minutes later, the group was in general agreement on several points.
one: though part of martinez's discomfort grew from simply not knowing what to say (and then covering his embarrassment), people can usually tell what's in your heart. even a dog knows the difference between being accidentally stepped on and being kicked. so we should just do our best but not worry so much about slipping up and saying the wrong thing occasionally. we're all trying to figure this stuff out at some level. if there's no malice in your intent there will seldom be a real problem in using the wrong words. especially if you bring to the moment an open heart. so if you don't know how a person prefers to be referred to or addressed, just ask them. (regarding misgenedering, i've since been challenged on this point, but although i realize context isn't a magic wand, i remain comfortable with my position.)
two: prison is a place that, by its very nature, deprives an individual of a large measure of their dignity.
three: prison can be, for the toughest, but especially for newcomer, a very lonely and frightening place. (so how much more so for a new transgender individual!)
and finally: regardless of whether or not you're comfortable with another inmate's sexual preferences or identification, a subversive way to fight for your own (probably) damaged sense of self-worth might be to do what you can to let each and every person you come into contact with (correctional officers included) know that you recognize them as being possessors of basic and inherent dignity as human beings. it may be something as simple as saying hello.
i walked out that evening both marveling at the arc and honesty of the guys' discussion and wondering if anything would come of it.
a week later i found out that martinez had, a few days later, invited wheeler to join his afternoon card game. i simply can not express how profound a gesture this was.  such a simple thing. and yet so very powerful. and what inherent risk it entailed for someone who has struggled with what others might think of him. i told martinez how proud i was of him and asked if he'd received any blow-back. 'hell yeah!' he said. 'there are always gonna be haters. jokers call you 'faggot' and shit! i don't care. i thought about what we talked about and decided that no one gets to tell me who i can and can't hang around with." 
																																"besides', he added, 'she's a good dude!' 
she's a good dude! talk about getting to the heart of things!
but the story doesn't end there.
several weeks later, wheeler was actually invited to join our new beginnings group. although she didn't say much during her first meeting with us, afterwards, before going back to her pod, she said something to one of my volunteers that i will never forget. she said 'thank you for making eye contact with me.' i don't think i had ever truly considered a world where this simple acknowledgment of your very existence was something to take notice of and be grateful for. 
if you want to have your faith in the human heart restored, simply stand for a while with the ones whose hearts have been broken.

																																andrea and sylvester, two of the wonderful volunteers who help with our weekly new beginnings-next step community clothing closet february 6, 2018

																																hi friends,

																																i realize that my notes deal more with my prison work than my music these days. please don't take that as a sign that i'm sticking my guitar case in the closet. aside from releasing several digital singles in 2017 (these were topical songs which probably comes as a surprise to no one), i've been writing and recording material for an album that i'm planning to bring out by late summer. one track- a new song which i've taken to closing my shows with these days is called sing me on my way and features an entire choir of old friends, including kris kristofferson, arlo guthrie and billy swan. (the list is still growing!) so don't count me out you guys. i've got some more songs in me. i'm gonna keep singing them and will be relying on you to help me spread the word.

																																i'm excited to be heading to kansas city next week to perform an official showcase at the international folk alliance. the list of showcase artists draws from all over the world and is actually quite impressive. (http://www.folk.org/news/372317/announcing-2018-official-showcase-artists.htm) i'm proud to be on it.

																																on the summer horizon, i was recently honored to be booked by the guthrie center in great barrington, ma to do a show on july 14, 2018 for woody's birthday celebration! of all the artists they had at their disposal, i was very touched to have bee selected for this special performance. and yes, you'll be hearing me sing some woody that night!

																																in the mean time there's a gig this coming weekend i'm hoping to get a few of you in the dc area out to. on sunday, february 11th, i'll be in alexandria va doing a show with the wonderful anne hills at the george washington masonic national memorial'

http://www.focusmusic.org/hills-and-flynn.  

																																although i haven't been performing as much as i'd like these past few months, i've been kept incredibly busy with my prison and returning citizen work. yesterday we actually held our second weekly new beginning's group at baylor women's correctional institution. this is the sixth group i've taken on (with the help of a great team of volunteers! it's also my first in a women's prison. we have about 20 women in the new group and their appreciation and level of participation has been very moving. (it literally took me years to reach this level of openness and courage with the men's group!) although i went into this situation knowing that i'd be dealing with some new and different dynamics and issues, my sense that we're not there to solve or fix each other, but simply stand with and listen deeply to one another seems to be being borne out. i'm grateful that i have a terrific group of female volunteers who accompany me into baylor as the talk is- just as with the men's prison- open and frank. (i think yesterday was the first time i ever blushed in a prison.)

																																sex remains such a huge stumbling block for us as a society. my friends donald and barbara olsen, counselors from the locus of hope addiction treatment center, recently gave a wonderful workshop on sexual addiction to our returning citizen group. they helped us find language and begin to openly address the underlying reasons for which sex and sexuality can be misused and are often so deeply misunderstood. seeing how our guys responded, both their reticence to speak and their hunger for the information being shared made me more aware of how we so often live as strangers to ourselves, let alone other people. 

																																it also reinforced for me the value of what we do in trying to provide a circle of trust and compassion where we can begin to risk opening up to other human beings. 

																																someone in one of our men's prison groups recently complained about a new transgender inmate named wheeler. (not using real names here.) although wheeler identified as a woman, doc classifies people solely on the basis of anatomy. being new to prison, wheeler was- quite understandably-having a difficult time adjusting. and she wasn't the only one.

																																'i ain't looking for trouble, but that stuff really freaks me out.' martinez said with almost practiced disdain. plus, if you're seen with people like that, then other people start wondering about you! all i know is he... she... it... better steer clear of me.' 

																																before i could say a word, another member of our circle came back at him hard. 'knock off the 'it' crap! don't use that kind of language here. you're talking about another human being! what about what we talk about in new beginnings' what about working on your own shit and not judging other people' none of us in here is perfect or has all the answers. if you think you do, maybe this isn't the group for you.' 

																																the room was momentarily filled with a charged tension but the disagreement that ensued was talked out and worked through-as is our way- with measured and respectful words. i saw each man, guided by his brothers in the circle, really attempt to listen to the other. and within minutes a truly amazing discussion evolved. by the time we began our closing meditation ninety minutes later, the group was in general agreement on several points. 

																																one- though part of martinez's discomfort grew from simply not knowing what to say (and then covering his embarrassment), people can usually tell what's in your heart. even a dog knows the difference between being accidentally stepped on and kicked. so we should just do our best but not worry so much about slipping up and saying the wrong thing occasionally. we're all trying to figure this stuff out at some level. if there's no malice in your intent there will seldom be a real problem in using the wrong words. especially if you express an openness to learning. so if you don't know how a person prefers to be referred to or addressed, just ask them.

																																two- prison is a place that, by its very nature, deprives an individual of a large measure of their dignity. 

																																three- prison can be, for the toughest, but especially for newcomer, a very lonely and frightening place. (so how much more so for a new transgender individual!)

																																and finally- regardless of whether or not you're comfortable with another inmate's sexual preferences or identification- a subversive way to buttress and fight for your own (probably) damaged sense of self worth might be to do what you can to let each and every person you come into contact with (correctional officers included) know that you recognize them as being possessors of basic and inherent dignity as human beings. it may be something as simple as saying hello.

																																i walked out that evening both marveling at the arc and honesty of the guys' discussion and wondering if anything would come of it.

																																a week later i found out that a few days later martinez had invited wheeler to join his afternoon card game. 

																																i simply can not express how profound a gesture this was.

																																such a simple thing. and yet so very powerful. and what inherent risk it entailed for someone who has struggled with what others might think of him.

																																i told martinez how proud i was of him and asked if he'd received any blowback. 'hell yeah!' he said. 'there are always gonna be haters. folks call you 'faggott' and shit! i don't care. i thought about what we talked about and decided that no one gets to tell me who i can and can't hang around with... besides', he added, 'she's a good dude!'

																																if you want to have your faith in the human heart restored, simply stand with the ones whose hearts have been broken. it works every time!

																																peace,

																																john

																		happy 
																		new year 
																		friends!






																		i went 
																		over to 
																		the 
																		brandywine 
																		ymca to 
																		swim 
																		some 
																		laps 
																		this 
																		morning 
																		(you can 
																		only run 
																		so far 
																		when its 
																		8 
																		degrees 
																		outside) 
																		and i 
																		noticed 
																		a sign 
																		on the 
																		wall 
																		that 
																		read 'be 
																		awesome 
																		today!' 
																		it 
																		occurred 
																		to me 
																		that 
																		better 
																		advice 
																		might 
																		actually 
																		be 'see 
																		awesome 
																		today!'



																		i know 
																		lots of 
																		stuff 
																		sucks in 
																		our 
																		country 
																		these 
																		days. (i 
																		think 
																		i'm safe 
																		with 
																		this 
																		statement 
																		no 
																		matter 
																		which 
																		side of 
																		the 
																		political 
																		spectrum 
																		you call 
																		home!) 
																		i've 
																		shared 
																		quite a 
																		few 
																		songs 
																		documenting 
																		my 
																		personal 
																		takes on 
																		much of 
																		what 
																		transpired 
																		in 2017. 
																		but 
																		despite 
																		the 
																		disagreeable 
																		trolls, 
																		bots and 
																		seemingly 
																		ceaseless 
																		fusilade 
																		of 
																		outrageous, 
																		often 
																		alarming  
																		tweets 
																		and 
																		soul-concussing 
																		news, i 
																		am more 
																		and more 
																		knocked 
																		out by 
																		the 
																		spirit 
																		of the 
																		people i 
																		see 
																		around 
																		me each 
																		and 
																		every 
																		day.



																		as 
																		father 
																		greg 
																		boyle, 
																		founder 
																		of 
																		homeboy 
																		industries 
																		and 
																		author 
																		of 
																		'tatoos 
																		on the 
																		heart' 
																		points 
																		out, we 
																		should 
																		stand in 
																		awe that 
																		the poor 
																		and 
																		marginalized 
																		manage 
																		to carry 
																		the 
																		burdens 
																		they do, 
																		rather 
																		than 
																		stand in 
																		judgment 
																		of how 
																		they 
																		carry 
																		them. 
																		this is 
																		a lesson 
																		brought 
																		home 
																		again 
																		and 
																		again in 
																		my work 
																		with new 
																		beginnings 
																		and new 
																		beginning-next 
																		step.



																		just a 
																		small 
																		illustration. 
																		elliott* 
																		(*not 
																		real 
																		name), a 
																		long 
																		time 
																		member 
																		of our 
																		gander 
																		hill 
																		prison 
																		group, 
																		is being 
																		transferred 
																		to 
																		another 
																		facility 
																		this 
																		week. in 
																		his 
																		final 
																		session 
																		with new 
																		beginnings 
																		he 
																		looked 
																		across 
																		the 
																		circle 
																		at a man 
																		named 
																		claude* 
																		who'd 
																		only 
																		been 
																		attending 
																		our 
																		meetings 
																		for a 
																		few 
																		months. 
																		claude 
																		had come 
																		to us 
																		with 
																		more 
																		than the 
																		normal 
																		share of 
																		inmate 
																		challenges 
																		(and i 
																		remember 
																		wondering 
																		if we'd 
																		be able 
																		to help 
																		him 
																		much) 
																		but week 
																		by week, 
																		we'd 
																		seen him 
																		grow in 
																		confidence 
																		and self 
																		awareness. 
																		he was 
																		visibly 
																		buoyed 
																		by the 
																		trust 
																		and 
																		affection 
																		he 
																		experienced 
																		in 
																		group, 
																		and 
																		instead 
																		of 
																		continuing 
																		to be 
																		held 
																		captive 
																		by a 
																		long 
																		list of 
																		anxieties 
																		about 
																		the 
																		future, 
																		claude 
																		had 
																		begun to 
																		'eat the 
																		elephant 
																		one bite 
																		at a 
																		time'', 
																		breaking 
																		down 
																		big, 
																		seemingly 
																		insurmountable 
																		problems 
																		into 
																		smaller, 
																		more 
																		manageable 
																		portions. 
																		each 
																		week, 
																		claude 
																		would 
																		confide 
																		in the 
																		group, 
																		discussing 
																		troubling 
																		issues, 
																		weighing 
																		advice, 
																		and 
																		ultimately 
																		making 
																		simple, 
																		reasonable 
																		decisions. 
																		as a 
																		result 
																		of this 
																		claude 
																		was 
																		seeing, 
																		maybe be 
																		for the 
																		first 
																		time in 
																		his 
																		life, 
																		some 
																		things 
																		starting 
																		to turn 
																		around 
																		and go 
																		his way. 
																		he was 
																		experiencing 
																		what 
																		psychologists 
																		call 
																		agency; 
																		the 
																		realization 
																		that he 
																		had the 
																		power to 
																		affect 
																		his own 
																		life in 
																		positive 
																		productive 
																		ways.



																		elliott 
																		addressed 
																		claude 
																		saying, 
																		'brother, 
																		before i 
																		leave 
																		here i 
																		want you 
																		to know 
																		how 
																		proud i 
																		am of 
																		you, and 
																		how far 
																		i've 
																		watched 
																		you come 
																		in a 
																		short 
																		time. i 
																		know you 
																		have 
																		many 
																		doubts 
																		about 
																		yourself, 
																		but i've 
																		been 
																		privileged 
																		to see 
																		you grow 
																		so 
																		much!' 
																		at this 
																		point 
																		elliott 
																		unstrapped 
																		a large 
																		rugged 
																		black 
																		digital 
																		watch 
																		from his 
																		wrist. 
																		(being 
																		paid 32 
																		cents an 
																		hour, if 
																		they're 
																		fortunate 
																		enough 
																		to have 
																		jobs, 
																		very few 
																		inmates 
																		can save 
																		enough 
																		money to 
																		purchase 
																		watches 
																		from the 
																		prison 
																		commissary.) 
																		elliott 
																		presented 
																		the 
																		watch to 
																		claude 
																		and 
																		said, 'i 
																		want you 
																		to have 
																		this. 
																		you told 
																		me once 
																		how much 
																		you 
																		admired 
																		it. so 
																		please 
																		accept 
																		it as a 
																		gift 
																		from me, 
																		and 
																		every 
																		time you 
																		look at 
																		it, 
																		remember 
																		how much 
																		i 
																		believe 
																		in you". 
																		claude's 
																		eyes 
																		brimmed 
																		with 
																		tears as 
																		he 
																		struggled 
																		to find 
																		and give 
																		voice to 
																		words of 
																		the most 
																		profound 
																		gratitude 
																		you can 
																		imagine. 
																		other 
																		guys in 
																		the 
																		group 
																		saw him 
																		losing 
																		the 
																		fight 
																		for 
																		composure 
																		and 
																		said, 
																		"it's 
																		ok, 
																		man... 
																		tears 
																		are 
																		ok.... 
																		let 'em 
																		come.' 
																		they 
																		did. (i 
																		personally 
																		hadn't 
																		waited 
																		for 
																		permission.)



																		in a 
																		place 
																		where 
																		men have 
																		next to 
																		nothing, 
																		i 
																		witnessed 
																		one of 
																		the most 
																		beautiful 
																		acts of 
																		kindness 
																		i've 
																		ever 
																		seen.


																		so bring 
																		on the 
																		nightly 
																		news, i 
																		can 
																		handle 
																		it! i 
																		saw a 
																		hell of 
																		a lot of 
																		awesome 
																		today! 
																		







																		i'll be 
																		in new 
																		york 
																		this 
																		month 
																		for a 
																		few 
																		shows:


																		friday, 
																		january 
																		12, i'll

																		and 
																		sunday,
