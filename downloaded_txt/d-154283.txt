the church of god international (cgi) traces its origins to the church that jesus founded in the early first century. membership in the cgi consists of "called out ones" from around the world practicing christianity as initiated by jesus and furthered by the early apostles. the church begun by jesus, the very one he promised would survive through the centuries, is alive and well. today, disciples live the faith "once delivered to the saints" in this twenty-first century (jude 3). they obey the same message taught by jesus christ, and they proclaim the same gospel taken to the world by the disciples. members value the witness and teachings of jesus christ as the church's work.the cgi home office is in tyler, texas. incorporated in 1978, cgi has ministers and congregations scattered throughout the united states and canada . we also have churches in kenya,  jamaica, the philippines, australia, the united kingdom and a growing number of countries around the world.

the story of nadab and abihu highlights the importance of having a holy heart in service to god, as their carelessness in offering "strange fire" resulted in immediate judgment. while aaron's failure to eat the sin offering was also a ritual violation, his heart's grief over the loss of his sons led to god's mercy, showing that god values the condition of the heart over ritual observance. ultimately, jesus, as the perfect high priest, fulfills the law's requirements with a holy, pure heart, allowing believers to approach god's holiness with confidence and offering a model of true worship that transcends mere rituals.














jesus carried out many remarkable deeds in public, from captivating the crowds with his teachings to healing the sick and even bringing the dead back to life. however, none of his actions were as shrouded in mystery as his dramatic overturning of the money changers' tables in the temple. why was this act so significant, and what can we learn from it? these are the questions we’ll explore in this episode of truth unveiled.














do you need to speak in tongues to be saved? is this the only evidence that we have god's holy spirit? watch this week’s armor of god with tony buchert to learn more.














the official newspaper of the church of god international is published quarterly. this publication covers a wide variety of topics. read the international news and see how the church of god international is impacting the globe for christ.

resolving conflict (part two)



feb 14, 2025



mike james


in our last blog, we discussed some ideas to help us resolve conflict. due to a presentation i am giving this month, i was able to do some research on this subject—so much so that i have enough data for another blog on conflict resolution.another popular conflict resolution method is the interest based relational (ibr) approach to conflict management. roger fisher and william ury developed the ibr approach and wrote about it in their book, getting to yes. they focus on resolving conflicts by separating people and their emotions from the problem. their approach also focuses on building mutual respect and understanding. in this approach, there are five primary principles.

resolving conflict



jan 31, 2025



mike james


later this month, i will be working with a ministry in the jamaican church to discuss conflict resolution in marriage. in doing the research on this presentation, i decided to write this blog to offer some data that may help us in resolving all kinds of conflict. perhaps i will provide more data in my next blog.there are a number of different books and theories on how to resolve conflict. in this blog i will cite a theory developed in the 1970s by kenneth thomas and ralph kilmann. these two men identified five main styles of dealing with conflict.

fire



jan 16, 2025



mike james


on january 7, two major fires began in the suburbs of los angeles. one of the fires began in pacific palisades, and later that day a second fire began to decimate altadena. as i watched the reports on the news that night, i was amazed by what i was seeing. i saw a fire truck trying to shoot water at a building with a powerful hose, and the wind was blowing the water back to the fire truck. the primary reason these fires raged was because of the unusual power of the winds that night.my home is in fontana, california, about 40 miles east of los angeles. we are known for getting powerful winds through this area in late fall and winter. those same santa anna winds can come through all over southern california, but on this night some of those wind speeds were hurricane force. the wind blew embers for miles which was evidenced by many homes and businesses on the pacific coast highway in malibu burning to the ground despite the fact they were across a road on the ocean side of the iconic road.
