kemah.com: your gateway to galveston bay



















visiting the houston area?  then make a point to visit spectacular kemah and seabrook, texas!
 originally a small fishing town, kemah has recently become a robust tourist destination due to the area's restaurants and attractions, contained within the kemah entertainment district. during the 1970s, in part as a result of the establishment of the johnson space center on clear lake, tourism began to re-emerge as pleasure boats began to fill the lake. kemah has significantly revived as a tourist and recreation destination, especially since the kemah boardwalk was developed in the late 90s. 
nearby,   seabrook is known for its fish markets on waterfront drive where resident shrimpers and fishermen bring in their catches daily. besides bordering the bay, the city encompasses marshes though which runoff from inland fields drain to the bay.â     seabrook is in the center of the third largest boating community in the country.  seabrook is also a bird sanctuary, located on one of the largest migratory paths in north america.
and only 30 minutes south? galveston island offers 32 miles of relaxingâ beaches, superbâ restaurants, top resortâ hotels, marvelous downtownâ shopping, numerous antique stores, incredible art galleries, fabulousâ entertainmentâ and one of the largest and well-preserved concentrations of victorianâ architectureâ in the country. at 32 miles long and two and a half miles wide, most residents can't remember the last time they visited the mainland and, if circumstances permitted, they would never leave.
