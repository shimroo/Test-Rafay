 why choose spain & portugal 

events in spain. events in portugal



spain and portugal are spectacular and diverse countries, both intensely regionalist but yet bound together in a common passion for living life to the full, giving rein to their emotions and exuding ‘joie de vivre’. the entire iberian peninsula has a long, rich and varied history reflected in everything from prehistoric cave paintings, roman ruins, moorish palaces, imposing mediaeval castles, gothic cathedrals, renaissance masterpieces and jewels of modernism. the spanish and portuguese embrace their past while always looking to the future with an infectious, go-ahead enthusiasm.
the contemporary avant-garde chefs, designers and architects in both countries have unleashed a formidable wave of uninhibited innovation that place spain and portugal at the forefront of europe’s most exciting countries.
