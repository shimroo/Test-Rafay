everything you need to know about pawn shops



patricia white 

november 27, 2020




 
pawn shops make money by giving personal loans and by reselling retail items. 
 
personal loans  
pawn shops make money from interest on loans. pawn shops offer loans that are secured by something of value.  
 
you take in something you own, and then the pawnbroker gives you a loan according to its value. you will get your valued item back after you pay back the loan and its interest. if the debtor defaults, the pawnshop owner sells the item offered as security. 
 
conditions of a pawnshop loan 

they usually have higher interest rates than banks usually charge for personal loans. the risk of loan default is, therefore, much higher.  

 
most of the people who want a loan from a pawn shop usually have a low credit score. pawn shops have high-interest rates of up to 25% 
 

the loans offered are short-term. at the month-end, the debtor gets their collateral back after paying the loan and interest. if the individual wants more time, he services the loan by paying the monthly interest. 

 
 pawnbrokers usually willingly extend the repayment period upon payment of interest. 
 

typically, the pawnbroker offers up to 25% of the estimated resale price given as collateral. the pawnbroker also considers other costs like repair and storage. 

 
sales  
the second way in which pawn shops make money is through sales. the catalog of items sold include things that the pawnbroker has bought from individuals and items given as loan security, but the debtors defaulted.  
 
pawn shops offer to lend up to 15% more on directly purchased items than on collateral items. because they can sell these items as soon as possible, and they can also estimate their profit after selling the items more precisely. unlike collateral items because when held for long periods, they deteriorate in value. 
 
benefits of pawnshops 
 

 loans are instant

 
the most significant advantage of getting a pawn loan is the processing speed. 
 
the pawnbroker finds the collateral value; then immediately tells you how much more he is willing to offer. upon agreement, you receive the cash instantly. 
 

 no credit checks

pawnbrokers do not care about your credit score, whether positive or negative. the only requirement is a valuable item. 
 

 no impact on your credit rating

defaulting on a pawn loan or late payment will not affect your credit performance.  
4.get numerous loans 
unlike in banks where you can borrow a limited number of loans, you can get unlimited loans in pawnshops as long as you have valuable items.

how to use decontamination in cleaning up contaminated garden soil



patricia white 

september 19, 2018



many people are turning to garden farming due to the issues of contamination that are associated with many of the types sold in some stores. however before you embark on this method, there are various factors to consider. one of them is soil contamination. when you realize that your soil is no longer productive, it is important to decontaminate it. but the first and essential step before carrying out any decontamination procedure is to ensure that you know what is contaminating your soil. soils that are contaminated have very high levels of volatile organic compounds. the soil is considered as highly contaminated when its voc is greater than 50. there are various methods of decontaminating your soil as explained here below:

use of organic solvent– this method is effective in cleaning the soil. the solvent dissolves the contaminants and other soil destroying materials. after weakening the volatile compounds, bacteria will destroy them and help to restore soil fertility. a number of chemicals may be used to make these solvents including amines, esters, ethers and ketenes.
usage of organic nutrient– this helps quicken the process of decomposition. you apply the organic nutrient directly on the soil and you do not need to extract the affected soil. after application of the organic nutrient, you allow the bacteria sometime before they start working on your soil. once the soil is restored, you start using it directly.
thermal soil remediation– this is a procedure that destroys oil-based soil contaminants.

 the soil is exposed to very high heat. this procedure requires a professional from the relevant state organs.
use of mild solvents-you can put together soil and agitate it to see whether it separates the contaminants from it. for example, iron remediation takes the affected soil and removes the contaminants from it. a specific amount of iron is used to clean up the soil which breaks down the contaminants. you can remove soil from the affected sections and replaced it with a different one which is not contaminated.
soaking of contaminants– you can do this by planting genetically changed poplar trees. they remove mercury from soil and release it into air. you can also use various plants like sunflower and ferns that can be pulled from soil and come up with the contaminants.
spreading of tarpaulin over the soil- you dampen the ground and allow it to stay for a number of months.
use of activated charcoal– this can be used if you are dealing with a small are. the charcoal has the same role as a sponge and has the ability to absorb the chemical if it is recent
adding of fish bones– they remove lead contaminants from the soil
