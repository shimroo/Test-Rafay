r.i.p. lucie brock-broido, 1956-2018





lucie brock-broido

that same vagabond sweetness

odd i cannot remember a time
when there was no world. i am

at home, at callow home
worshipping the train, the elsewhere's 

metallic sweetness, scissoring. a pack
of blessings lights upon my back.

there are thou happy.
the noise of the world's tracks

made magical alarms me. there
are thou happy too. and the half

blown catweed & the vagrant
sky & the vacant apoplectic

bed shiftless in its vacancy, i stop.


[from verse, volume 12, number 3]

new! poem by natalie lyalin






natalie lyalin



so what, the clouds



so what, the clouds

with a piercing gold haze

so a red feather stuck to my foot

the gull’s squawk, so what

mother, father, horseshoe crab

i thought i spotted them all in

the glare of sunset

so what, the smudge of life

sooting bleached branches,

disinfecting the parts that need it

so what, until we say goodbye

we had a weekend together

and i helped pick out your dress

what does it matter

the tin chandelier pocked with holes

so what the rain

i never visited or cared too much

the bottles and woven baskets full of sea glass

hair grit, white towel snapping in the wind

birds circling their condos

an abundance of banana bread

celebrating america not on the fourth of july

but on the 16th, when nothing is happening

surprisingly i am somebody’s mother

i have no council 

i turn on the lights 

the sun crests the bank of pines pushing on the
dusk

while overhead a group of rockets take off from
cape canaveral 

making an arc toward heaven

new! review of elizabeth powell






willy
loman’s reckless daughter or living truthfully under imaginary
circumstances by elizabeth powell. anhinga,
2016.



reviewed by
nancy mitchell



elizabeth
powell’s compelling new volume of poems, willy loman’s reckless daughter or
living truthfully under imaginary circumstances, winner of the 2015 robert
dana-anhinga prize for poetry and published by anhinga press, is the saga of one psyche’s circuitous, courageous evolution to wholeness
as it reclaims and integrates the fragments of its shattered self. like a
classic epic, the book is
substantial; its 109 pages are divided into four distinct, yet integrated
parts, and the arc of each furthers the narrative arc of the collection, the
tension of which lies in “the tug of war between what you are and what you want
to be.” in lines barely held in check by semi-formal constraints of rhyme and
rhythm, the poems pellmell the reader through poems like “a toboggan threshing
me down a hill.” the wrangle of this struggle is underscored by erratically
shifting tones via inventive syntax and humorous, original
neologisms/verbalizations: “i lollygagged and sofatized as i proceeded with the
cnn-induced lobotomy dream of life,” and



            the
world, violent full of sex,

            the
movie’s zeitgeist, era
after era, a new bond

            double-o-sevening
in

            (care package, with riddle as
missive)



as well as with startling enjambments:



            …this
poem is made of me and i it. it doesn’t worry

            about
irony
or stance and only odd incidence and fact and doesn’t care

            if
it tells the truth about what will happen to my face

            or
behind my back….



part one, the heftiest section, worthy to stand on its
own as a separate volume, serves as the genesis, the creation story of the
collection, as it introduces the origin of the book’s structure along which
uncanny parallels to the speaker’s life
are plotted:



     around then, i read
my father’s 1960s compass copy of arthur miller's 

     "death
of a salesman" and began to understand why his sister called

     him willy loman. he had eaten the dream and it
made him sick...but

     my
father’s sister never stopped with the willy loman talk, and so we

     seemed
to be acting that play as our family drama.

(“autocorrecting the lyric i”)



from
a longstanding intimacy with
the american drama—“this entire book is in love with death of a salesman
by arthur miller, and has been in conversation with it for a good, long time,”
according to powell’s notes—and subsequent internalization, a world is created
into which the title character is called forth from the a shadowy subterranean
of unconsciousness, or “my doppelgänger under the bed, snoring and talking and
laughing in her sleep,” to inhabit this world with full autonomy: “i read it
again and again, until the doppelgänger moved from under the bed to the top
bunk.”



powell’s doppelgänger is an alchemic tour de force, deftly
echoing plath: “and then i knew what to do. / i made a model of you,” claims a
poem also titled “daddy.” willy loman’s daughter, paradoxically whole and black
hole, becomes the self into which other selves, shattered “the way the rolling
stones sing about” by seismic psychological pressures, are absorbed. because
the doppelgänger can successfully assimilate undifferentiated cultural
identities—



            let’s say i’m fusion of cold borscht and finger
sandwiches on white. i'm

            matzo
ball jew bagel and thrifty campbell’s soup with dried parsley

            don’t-worry-about-me
luncheon. i’m noodle
kugel and i’m turkey divan

            casserole. i’m
bubbeleh and i’m dearie. i’m ma and i’m mummy. i’m

            the episcojew, and
i am strong and not strong! i have a family tartan

            and a silence in
the vilnius ghetto. i cannot be buried in the holy land

            but i cannot be cremated. i am
passing and have passed, heard the

            murmurs of lovely & also
... dirty jews, fucking gentiles.



—as well as the trauma of sexual
abuse—



                                                …small
child who is taken into a room with

             an ex-convict and made to drink peppermint
schnapps and lie on his

            polyester
orange and yellow bed and black out until she walks from

            the
room and is shown his medals of valor from a war she doesn't

            understand. she didn’t
know peppermint that way until she came

            to dislike the sunniest days. (“sense
 memory: (re)-experiencing time travel”)



she
becomes the trustworthy, although admittedly imaginary confidant, sister in pasternak’s “sister life,”
the ma souer
of the speaker. both protective mediator and arbiter of memory, the
doppelgänger will become the the reliable narrator, even as she speaks as a
foil to other characters throughout the book, but only with the speaker’s
complicity or permission: 



            my
retinal flashes made no sense until i realized they were someone

            else’s story trying to
live through me. that sweet doppleganger, brother-

            sister, evil other, good girl! the
story kept banging at my red front door…



“someone
else’s story” is also the speaker’s; by opening the “red front door” she
intuitively and courageously allows the necessary psychic split into a stronger
double who, acting as a “second,” descends into the hell of the past and faces
down the demons of abandonment and estrangement, before assimilating them and
returning whole to tell the whole story.



in the poem “living truthfully under
imaginary circumstances,” the speaker speaks for “both of them” with, “we both want to be whole, so the
story can be told.” in my notes i’ve written, “or maybe:
we want the story to be told so we can both be whole.” elizabeth powell’s stunning,
evocative willy loman’s
reckless daughter or living truthfully under imaginary circumstances, is, like any
odyssey, to be read in parts, slowly, carefully, and reflectively, like a
psyche recovering the shattered parts of herself.

new! from stella vinitchi radulescu's journal with closed eyes








stella vinitchi radulescu



from journal with closed eyes



translated from the french by luke hankins







the august heat pierces me to the core. the flies too. and his patched-up pajamas. he had to sell his gold watch to some neighbors . . . soon, very soon, his life will be over. sitting on the edge of the bed, his breathing shallow . . . he asks me for a cigarette.



first i stand up, then i find the pack, next . . . but is there really an order to things? i’ve made and repeated these motions for such a long time, always the same, backwards and forwards, i extend my hand, i find the pack, i light the cigarette, i know it won’t burn to the end.



the sun through the windows is already making me sweat. the next room over, the children are waking up. the lapping of their little voices.



you could begin a book this way. or end one.



~



the pages have scattered on the beach. letters fall off, wrap around rocks, fray, twist, attach to the roots of plants, strange organisms, writhing seaweed . . .


a melody rises from the earth. suddenly i recognize it, it’s the one i put on in the car sometimes. then it changes. i hear footsteps underground . . .



untangle these letters, gather them from the sand, it’s my job, i’m the one who has to do it, i know it.



i’m the one who invented them, drew them with colored pencils in my notebook.



and i can’t move, my feet, my steps . . . 



this seaweed that grows out of me . . .



~



the nights are very long and the days pass unnoticed. i hear thoughts like little motors whirring in the air. others’ thoughts and my own. living, keeping me company, more alive than those to whom they belong.



over the years some have grown hard with rust; others, weakening, falling apart, still delight me. so i wind them up, set the little motors going, and i listen to them . . .  



i’d have a hard time waking tomorrow to find only silence.



~



it’s three in the morning, the dead in their graves. i think of them. thought is alive, warm, it gathers itself, forms a kernel that attaches itself to the world, and it begins to move, to shift.



i give the dead this gift, the only one possible.




the dead—a formless mass on which we walk.

the nocturnal biennial

the prisoners are allowed



to escape it is a folk tradition

e.c. belli / 2015 tomaž šalamun prize finalist





e.c. belli

[2015 tomaž šalamun prize finalist]


apology



another battering, brown

grass. it’s hives, you see, not the sky

i want to talk about. clean 

sleep. sundown is a musing 

ruin, a tired gaze. do you

know it by any other name?

i am supremely content— 

though i despise board games

and sunday afternoons.

put on a decent face, i’d like to say 

some days. we’re all crushed 

with longing. last week, 

i left the dog with someone 

who almost let him die. it didn’t matter

to her—his trench-deep eyes,

four sturdy legs, a trodden heart

endless with hope; all the 

little things that make you

you. one person in the world

loved him, you see—made him

less wretched, which is to say

easier to maim without remorse. 

love is always a good cause 


for injury.

todd melicker



[2015 tomaž šalamun prize finalist]



though not to love, yet love to tell me so



list rain as an

accomplishment



list a bird tucked

in the lip



list sorrow, patience,

list spoons



list tongue-tied

lift, ill-wresting love



the people of the 

tongue—why



i should grow

pressed fog



spills in the 

valley



i should grow


hinges
