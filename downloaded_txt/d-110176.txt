          long history, strong future
        

          the electronic scholarly publishing project (www.esp.org) was one
          of the very first scientific websites and 
          has been
          operating continuously longer than 99.999% of websites on earth. 
        

          although today there are nearly 2,000,000,000 named websites, 
          in 1994 there were only 2,500 and esp was one of them, albeit as 
          a subdirectory on the 
          genome data base site (www.gdb.org) hosted at johns hopkins
          university. in 1996, the esp project, with support from the 
          us department of energy, became a fully independent online
          source of classic scientific literature, operating with its
          own domain name: esp.org.
        

          over time, esp expanded its offerings to include 
        

classical works in genetics,
        

full-text digital books,
        

timelines (to put scientific advances into a larger context),
        

real-time-updated bibliographies,
        

brief biographical sketches of key scientists, 
        

a true report of a six-legged mouse, 
        

an explanation of how a single mutation changed world history, 
        

getting published 
            in ripley's believe it ot not!, 
        

even some humor (an old web tradition), 
        

          and more.

              foundations classical genetics:
              the electronic scholarly publishing project was originally created
              to provide access to important works associated with the
              foundations of classical genetics. the site has now been extended
              to provide access to other materials as well. this page has now
              become the root page for the foundations of classical genetics
              section. 
            











              classical genetics literature 
            







              publications in classical genetics:
              at the esp project we believe that continued access to the
              foundational literature of classical genetics is critically
              important. providing a collection of the full-text literature of
              classical genetics was the initial, primary offering of the
              electronic scholarly publishing project.

              now available over a longer time period) and to give the user more
              control over the timeline display.

          the electronic scholarly publishing project
        

          the original goal of the esp project was simple — we wished to
          provide free, world-wide access to materials that make it easier to
          appreciate and understand the field of classical genetics. 
        

          why classical genetics?
        

          for several reasons:
        

•
          a real understanding of classical genetics provides a strong (and
          necessary) foundation for understanding molecular genetics. that is,
          classical genetics provides the question for which molecular genetics
          is the answer.
        

•
          understanding the logic of classical genetics is still necessary to
          understand the many ways that genetics affects our everyday lives.
        

•
          the rapid, logical unfolding of classical genetic knowledge
          (from the rediscovery of mendel's work to the development of the
          chromosomal model of heredity in less than twenty years) provides a
          nearly perfect example of the scientific method in action.
        

          if science is taught primarily as a collection of facts, the
          process becomes virtually indistinguishable from any other faith-based
          catechism. if science education is to produce scientific
          literacy, then science education must emphasize the process
          by which scientific beliefs are acquired, not merely the beliefs
          themselves.
        

          detailed presentations of molecular biological findings only show
          what we scientists believe. why we believe remains
          inaccessible to students, unless we help them grasp the process of
          scientific investigation and reasoning. textbooks and monographs offer
          excellent summaries of what we know, but really understanding
          why we believe requires contact with original literature.
        

          the example of classical genetics provides powerful pedagogical tools
          for helping students understand the process of scientific
          investigation and the basis of scientific belief. basic experiments in
          classical genetics can be appreciated by students with little or no
          formal scientific training. in these experiments, one crosses two
          individuals that differ in a single trait, counts the progeny, then
          draws inferences regarding the possible mechanisms of heredity.
          although the first works are intellectually accessible to all, as the
          evidence mounts, the model becomes more complex, drawing one
          inexorably toward molecular explanations.
        

          although historical treatments run the risk of being seen as dry and
          dusty (especially if the "historical" treatment is merely a
          chronologically ordered recitation of facts), in my experience, if the
          foundations of classical genetics are presented with an eye on both
          the process and the excitement of discovery, students follow the
          material with great interest. soon, they find themselves not only
          ready for, but demanding molecular explanations for genetic models
          they now are prepared both to understand and to believe.
        

          for example, by 1950, classical genetic analysis had shown that the
          chemical gene, if there was such a thing, would have to possess two
          traits that seemed to be mutually exclusive:
        

1. the gene must be heterocatalytic — that is, it
          must be able to control the synthesis of other molecules of arbitrary
          complexity and detail.
        

2. the gene must be autocatalytic — that is, it
          must be able to control the synthesis of its own descendants with
          perfect fidelity.
        

          most surprisingly, the heterocatalylic function was known to be
          readily susceptible to mutation, yet the autocatalytic function was
          wholly resistant to mutation. genes whose heterocatalytic function had
          been profoundly altered by mutation replicated as well as any normal
          gene.
        

          these almost paradoxical requirements defined the necessary attributes 
          of the chemical gene on the eve of the molecular revolution. by the
          early 1950's, evidence suggested that dna might be the hereditary
          substance, but the current tetranucleotide model for the structure of
          dna (a dull polymer of repeating identical tetramers) seemed to rule
          it out. then, watson and crick proposed a model for dna structure
          (watson and crick, 1953a) that transformed our thinking about
          biological molecules.
        

          the significance of the watson-crick model for dna structure can only
          be fully appreciated by someone familiar with the apparent paradox in
          the simultaneous requirement for hetero- and autocatalysis.
          watson-crick dna is wholly unconstrained in one dimension (where four
          different nucleotides may be arrayed in any possible order along one
          strand), but totally constrained in another dimension (where base
          pairs in one strand must be perfectly complementary to their partners
          in the other strand).
        

          clearly, the heterocatalytic function must reside in the unconstrained
          linear ordering of nucleotides, while the autocatalytic function must
          reside in the totally constrained base-pairing between strands. watson
          and crick (1953b) explicitly noted this in their second paper:
        

          the phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is completely regular, but
          any sequence of the pairs of bases can fit into the structure. it
          follows that in a long molecule many different permutations are
          possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of
          the bases is the code which carries the genetical information. if the
          actual order of the bases on one of the pair of chains were given, one
          could write down the exact order of the bases on the other one,
          because of the specific pairing. thus one chain is, as it were, the
          complement of the other, and it is this feature which suggests how the
          deoxyribonucleic acid molecule might duplicate itself.
        

          watson jd and crick fhc. 1953. genetical implications of the
          structure
          of deoxyribonucleic acid. nature 171:964-967.
        

          the point of this aside on the structure of dna is to show that a
          grounding in classical genetics provides an excellent foundation for
          an appreciation of molecular genetics. and, the best way to gain a
          true scientific grounding in classical genetics is through reading and
          understanding the early literature.
        

          hence, the focus of the electronic scholarly publishing project.
        

          this
          analysis and more is presented in the
          
          narrative of the 1996 esp proposal — the proposal that
          resulted in the original funding for esp.
        



          esp quick facts
        




          esp origins
          

            in the early 1990's,
            
            robert robbins
            
            was a faculty member at johns
            hopkins, where he directed the informatics core of gdb
            — the human gene-mapping database of the international human
            genome project. to share papers with colleagues around the world, he
            set up a small paper-sharing section on his personal web page. this
            small project evolved into the electronic scholarly
            publishing project.
          



          esp support
          

            in 1995, robbins became the vp/it of the fred hutchinson cancer research
            center in seattle, wa. soon after arriving in seattle, robbins secured
            funding, through the elsi component of the us human genome project, to
            create the original esp.org web site, with the formal goal of
            providing free, world-wide access to the literature of classical genetics. 
          



          esp rationale
          

            although the methods of molecular biology can seem almost
            magical to the uninitiated, the original
            techniques of classical genetics are readily appreciated by one and
            all: cross individuals that differ in some inherited trait, collect
            all of the progeny, score their attributes, and propose mechanisms
            to explain the patterns of inheritance observed.
          



          esp goal
          

            in reading the early works of classical genetics, one is drawn, almost
            inexorably, into ever more complex models, until molecular explanations
            begin to seem both necessary and natural. at that point, the tools
            for understanding genome research are at hand. assisting readers reach
            this point was the original goal of the electronic scholarly publishing
            project.
          



          esp usage
          

            usage of the site grew rapidly and has remained high. faculty began
            to use the site for their assigned readings. other on-line
            publishers, ranging from the new york times to nature
            referenced esp materials in their own publications. nobel laureates
            (e.g., joshua lederberg) regularly used the
            site and even wrote to suggest changes and improvements.
          



          esp content
          

            when the site began, no journals
            were making their early content available in
            digital format. as a result, esp was obliged to digitize classic
            literature before it could be made available. for many important
            papers — such as
            
            mendel's original paper
            
            or the
            
            first genetic map
            
            — esp had to produce entirely new typeset versions of the works,
            if they were to be available in a high-quality format.
          



          esp help
          

            early support from the doe component of the human genome project was
            critically important for getting the esp project on a firm foundation.
            since that funding ended (nearly 20 years ago), the project has been
            operated as a purely volunteer effort.
            anyone wishing to assist in these efforts should send an 
            
            email to robbins.
          



          esp plans
          

            with the development of methods for
            
            adding typeset
            side notes to pdf files, the esp project now
            plans to add annotated versions of some classical papers to
            its holdings. we also plan to add
            new reference and pedagogical material.
            we have already started providing
            
            regularly updated, comprehensive
            bibliographies
            to the esp.org site.
