oak-tree sanctuary
1990 -2017


70 acres devoted to natural living, 
for humans, animals (wild and 
domestic), birds and aquatic life. 

located in beautiful 
south dansville new york. 
celebrating 27 years 
of living  wild and free!

the homestead is heated by wood,
 and our electricity comes from the 
wind and the sun. we have our own  
well, for us and the animals
 that live here to drink from. 
no chemicals added! 

we have gardens, a berry patch, 
mini vineyard, and a small orchard, 
in which we grow food for both 
ourselves and the animals.

 in back of the main pasture 
is a pond full of fish, frogs, 
turtles, and salamanders.
 the pond also provides water
 for both farm livestock and the 
wild animals who live in  
our forest beyond the field.

the new barn is shelter 
for a few horses, cows, pigs,
 sheep, goats and barnyard fowl.
several were placed here by 
their owners, others were
 rescued and in need of a home.
over the years a few were 
born here, as breeding is 
as natural as it gets!


spiritually we are in tune 
with nature, personally i 
worship the goddess gaia, 
our mother earth.

 the sun shines down on 
her and makes her fertile,
 together they give us all we need.
 i follow the path of the old 
ones, they were wise and cared
 for the earth and so do i!

 n.y.s. not for profit
