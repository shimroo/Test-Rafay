chronic kidney disease — common in older adults and a “silent killer”


march is national kidney month. most adults with chronic kidney disease (ckd) do not know they have it — with many missing the opportunity to avoid irreversible loss of kidney function and ultimately kidney failure. on march 13, 9-11 a.m., we will share findings from a new research brief from the state of aging in central indiana report that explains what ckd is and how common it is. panelists will discuss local services and support for discovering whether you or your loved ones have ckd and how to maximize quality of life with the disease.

												metropolitan police dept. use of force report											



												when officers respond to emergencies that put them and the public in high-stress environments, they must make quick decisions that are in the best interests of everyone involved. officers must rely on training, morale, and guidance from their agencies to determine the best, most appropriate response. multiple factors play into the officer’s decisions on how to react, including cultural instincts, systemic culture, and organizational culture, which all guide quick decision-making. the “use of force” becomes necessary only as a last resource for police officers, although no universally agreed-upon definition exists. more specifically, how does the frequency and perception of the indianapolis metropolitan police department using force impact community trust and cooperation in diverse communities?
