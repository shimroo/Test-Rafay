why become a member of the nhaa? our organization provides educational workshops for our members to keep them current with arboricultural research.
we also maintain an arborist certification program.



nhaa certified arborists are up-to-date on the latest in arboricultural technology and knowledgeable of acceptable arborist practices. they must pass a comprehensive exam and then maintain their certification through continuing education.
we also encourage them to seek membership and certification in other professional arborist organizations such as the international society of arboriculture (isa) and the american society of consulting arborists (asca).
if you are interested in becoming a part of our organization, you may reach us at treesforus@nharborists.org.
