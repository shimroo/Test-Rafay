mutual fund investing involves risk; loss of principal is possible.
permanent portfolio invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. the fund will be affected by changes in the prices of gold, silver, swiss franc assets and u.s. and foreign aggressive growth, real estate and natural resource stocks.  the fund is non-diversified and thus may be able to invest more of its assets in fewer issuers and types of investments than a diversified fund.   investing a higher percentage of its assets in any one or a few issuers could increase the fundâs risk of loss and its share price volatility.  the fund may invest in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.
aggressive growth portfolio's stocks may appreciate in value more rapidly than the stock market, but they are also subject to greater risk, especially during periods when the prices of u.s. stock market investments, in general, are declining. the portfolio invests in smaller companies, which will involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. the portfolio also invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater   volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods.
short-term treasury portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. the risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. the federal deposit insurance corporation, or any other government agency, does not guarantee an investment in the short-term treasury portfolio. therefore, you may lose money by investing in the portfolio.
versatile bond portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. the risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. investments in below investment grade bonds (also referred to as “high yield” or “junk” bonds) present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. these risks are greater in emerging markets. in addition, certain investments may be illiquid and may be difficult to purchase, sell, or value. 
diversification does not assure a profit, nor does it protect against a loss in a declining market. earnings growth is not a measure of the fund's future performance.
