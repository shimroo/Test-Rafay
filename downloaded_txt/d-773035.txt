philanthropy






















the restoration of the idl lake is a true testament to the power of collective effort and the positive impact that can be created through csr initiatives. 
							thanks to the commendable work of gocl and hinduja foundation, the lake, once classified as a dry lake as per the 1975 toposheet, has been transformed into 
							a perennial water body, with water available throughout the year.
eliminating the seasonal water spread, shrinking, and the swelling phenomenon has significantly benefited the environment. however, there is still much 
							work to be done, as the built-up area in the catchment has significantly increased, leading to the disappearance of the natural drainage system and its 
							conversion to open or underground sewage drains that carry sewage to the idl lake.
this has resulted in a surge in flooding incidents, especially with the variable rainfall pattern that brings high-intensity rainfalls.






















the study recommends exploring eco-friendly technologies, such as vision earthcare's 'camus-sbt,' which can help manage sewage and recycle 
							wastewater at various sources. this is particularly crucial, given that 68% of the catchment area is covered by built-up areas that generate a 
							vast amount of wastewater. implementing such eco-friendly measures can mitigate the impact of sudden water flow and flooding incidents, ensuring a 
							safer and healthier environment for all. this restoration project is a reminder that we have the power to make a significant difference, and we must 
							continue to work together towards a sustainable future.
the telangana government has handed over the project to gocl and is delighted with the results demonstrating the effectiveness of collective effort 
							and csr initiatives. overall, the beautification of the lake is a crucial aspect from an aesthetic point of view that is not overlooked while restoration. 
							by creating a beautiful and attractive environment, we can ensure that the lake is enjoyed by both locals and tourists, contributing to its sustainability 
							and promoting the local economy.
