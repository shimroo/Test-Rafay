in addition, there is a comprehensive overview of the
biology worthy of
life project, and also a
detailed index
to all the project content.
finally, stephen talbottâs latest book â organisms and their evolution:
agency and meaning in the drama of life â is freely available online

what is the new content about?


netfuture was for many years focused on technology and its social
implications.  newer writings (on the âbiology worthy of lifeâ â
https://bwo.life website)
are directed more toward the problems of a
science influenced by visions of technology, as when biologists conceive
organisms on the model of the machine.  in particular, most articles
are currently dealing with issues in genetics, molecular biology,
evolution, and the nature of the organism.  the aim is to overcome the
limitations of the naã¯ve nineteenth-century materialism that still dominates
biological thinking.


the aim, in other words, is to find a more living approach to the
dynamism, plasticity, and intentionality of the organism.  organisms are
creatures of directed striving â agents pursuing their own meaningful ways
of being â and their activity is a kind of speaking.  but while these
central features are often implicit in biological descriptions, a
recognition of them has yet to transform the deeply-rooted, mechanistic
thought habits of the biologist.


the editor of netfuture since its beginning has been stephen l. talbott
(stevet@netfuture.org),
currently a senior researcher at the nature institute.  for a guide to all
his writings, you can visit his

stephen talbott's 2007 book, based on writings in netfuture, is devices
of the soul: battling for our selves in an age of machines.
michael pollan (author of the botany of desire and the
omnivore's dilemma) has written of this book: "nothing is as
rare or sorely needed in our tech-enchanted culture right now as
intelligent criticism of technology, and steve talbott is exactly the
critic we've been waiting for: trenchant, sophisticated, and completely
original. devices of the soul is an urgent and important book."
you will find more information about the book (and can order it)
here,
and can read the introduction here.


netfuture editor stephen talbott is deeply indebted to the work of the
british philologist and semantic historian, owen barfield.  you'll find an
introduction to some of barfield's thought in an
appendix to stephen's
earlier book, the future does not compute: transcending the machines in
our midst.  (the book itself is
fully available online.)
