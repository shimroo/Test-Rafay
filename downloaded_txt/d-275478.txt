the eternal life of goldman is a gorgeous platformer that looks like a hand-drawn cartoon


					on august 4, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

there’s a new hand-drawn platformer coming to pc and consoles, and it looks absolutely breathtaking. the eternal life of goldman, announced on friday during thq nordic’s digital showcase, is an upcoming title from weappy studio that’s “inspired by ancient fables and depicted in classic frame-by-frame animation.” there’s no release date just yet, but when it does come out, it’ll be available for ps5, xbox series x/s, pc and nintendo switch.
weappy describes the eternal life of goldman as “a vibrant yet dark platformer adventure that weaves together legends, fairy tales and myths.” 
 



its protagonist is an old man who uses his cane to fight off legendary creatures in a land known as the archipelago. the trailer gives us a glimpse at some gameplay footage, revealing a sprawling and gorgeously animated fantasy world. the developers say it’s designed to be challenging but not grueling, and encourages exploration to uncover all the secrets of the archipelago.

reddit ceo wants microsoft to pay for its content


					on july 31, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

reddit’s chief executive officer steve huffman didn’t pull any punches with microsoft in an interview with the verge. he called out microsoft and other ai search engines like anthropic and perplexity for not paying for the information they take from reddit, some of which have already been blocked from huffman’s website.
reddit has deals in places with companies like google and openai to receive compensation for using its posts and information. huffman says microsoft, however, hasn’t even stepped up to the table to discuss its use of reddit’s content in its ai searches.
 
“without these agreements, we don’t have any say or knowledge of how our data is displayed and what it’s used for, which has put us in a position now of blocking folks who haven’t been willing to come to terms with how we’d like our data to be used or not used,” huffman told the verge’s deputy editor alex heath.
huffman says if microsoft and other ai search sites continue to use reddit’s information without proper compensation, they’ll have to be blocked. he doesn’t want to do that because it’s “a real pain in the ass to block these companies.”
reddit has started cracking down on search engines that expunge information from its various forms and communities. the website vowed to block unauthorized data scraping in june by updating its robots exclusion protocol (robots.txt) and it’s already prevented bing from accessing data from reddit, a fact confirmed by microsoft’s head of search jordi ribas on x.
earlier this month, a source confirmed to engadget’s will shanklin that microsoft’s refusal to work with reddit’s terms of service led to the blocking of bing. a spokesperson from reddit also said, “anyone accessing reddit content must abide by our policies, including those in place to protect redditors. we are selective about who we work with and trust with large-scale access to reddit content.”

twelve south’s airfly duo bluetooth dongle drops to a record low of $30


					on july 31, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

there are many devices out there that no-one really needs, but have a specific purpose that can help to improve one’s quality of life a bit. twelve south’s airfly duo is one such product. it’s a dongle that lets you connect bluetooth earbuds and headphones to in-flight entertainment systems. the device is currently on sale for $  30, which is a record low. the airfly duo usually costs $  45.
this is one of our favorite pieces of travel gear. it plugs into any 3.5mm audio jack, actually, so you can use it with the likes of gym equipment, gaming systems or even tvs. musicians can use it to listen to audio from amplifiers too. what’s more, you can connect two sets of earbuds or headphones at once, so two people can watch a movie on the same ipad while traveling.
  
 
twelve south says the device uses aptx low latency codecs to minimize audio lag. the airfly duo is said to have a battery life of over 22 hours, so it should last for even the lengthiest of long-haul flights. but, if you need to, you can charge the device while it’s in use.
again, the airfly isn’t a product that anyone truly needs — you can buy a set of wired earbuds that’ll work in a pinch for a few bucks. but you’ll be able to use any bluetooth earbuds or headphones of your choice with this device. best of all, you’ll avoid the awkwardness of a trailing wire draping over (and perhaps into) your in-flight meal.

google dismisses elon musk’s claim that autocomplete engaged in election interference


					on july 30, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

google has responded to allegations that it “censored” searches about donald trump after elon musk baselessly claimed the company had imposed a “search ban” on the former president. the issues, google explained, were due to bugs in its autocomplete feature. but musk’s tweet, which was viewed more than 118 million times, nonetheless forced the search giant to publicly explain one of its most basic features.
“over the past few days, some people on x have posted claims that search is ‘censoring’ or ‘banning’ particular terms,” google wrote in a series of posts on x. “that’s not happening.”
 
though google didn’t name musk specifically, over the weekend the x owner said that “ google has a search ban on president donald trump.” the claim appeared to be based on a single screenshot of a search that showed google suggested “president donald duck” and “president donald regan” when “president donald” was typed into the search box.
the same day, donald trump jr. shared a similar image that showed no autocomplete results relating to donald trump for the search “assassination attempt on.” both trump jr. and musk accused the company of “election interference.”


over the past few days, some people on x have posted claims that search is “censoring” or “banning” particular terms. that’s not happening, and we want to set the record straight.
the posts relate to our autocomplete feature, which predicts queries to save you time. autocomplete…
— google communications (@google_comms) july 30, 2024
in its posts tuesday, google explained that people are free to search for whatever they want regardless of what appears in its autocomplete suggestions. it added that “built-in protections related to political violence” had prevented autocomplete from suggesting trump-related searches and that “those systems were out of date.”
likewise, the company said that the strange suggestions for “president donald” were due to a ”bug that spanned the political spectrum.” it also affected searches related to former president barack obama and other figures.
finally, the company explained that articles about kamala harris appearing in search results for donald trump is not due to a shadowy conspiracy, but because the two— both of whom are actively campaigning for president — are often mentioned in the same news stories. that may sound like something that should be painfully obvious to anyone who has ever used the internet, but musk’s post on x has fueled days of conspiracy theories about google’s intentions.
musk’s post, which questioned whether the search giant was interfering in the election, was particularly ironic considering that the x owner came under fire the same weekend for sharing a manipulated video of kamala harris without a label, a violation of his company’s own policies.
while google’s statements didn’t cite musk’s post directly, the company pointed out that x’s search feature has also experienced issues in the past. “many platforms, including the one we’re posting on now, will show strange or incomplete predictions at various times,” the company said.

i really want to like star wars outlaws


					on july 30, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

when i attended the first hands-off briefing for star wars outlaws at summer game fest 2023, i left ubisoft’s demo room on a high, thinking this could be the piece of media that finally pulls me into the star wars universe. i loved the focus on a solo protagonist, kay vess, and her cute merqaal pet, nix. i adored the fact that developers said the game would tell a cohesive, linear story, rather than throwing players into an unfocused open world and calling it aaa. i was eager to get my hands on it.
since then, i’ve been fortunate enough to access two different previews of star wars outlaws, and my initial excitement has been tempered. it’s not completely extinguished, but the slices that i’ve played have reinforced a bloaty vibe underpinned by unclear navigation and generic combat. i still think star wars outlaws is a pretty game with interesting character designs and environments, but i’m now less hopeful about everything else it’s offering — you know, the elements that haven’t been plucked directly out of the existing star wars universe.
 
ubisoft

the sections i’ve played of star wars outlaws span cosmic dogfights, parkour levels in metal-lined space stations and military bases, and stealth missions against roaming stormtroopers and interstellar criminal factions. i also hopped on a speeder and had a great time flying over the dunes of toshara with nix on the back of my bike; one thing i’m definitely looking forward to in the full game is entering hovercraft races.
as for the bits i actually played, i would describe the overall theme as confusing. i encountered a head-scratching moment in the first minutes of my initial preview at summer game fest 2024 in june: i crawled through a busted, rocky base and found myself at the mouth of a cliffside cave, the mountain too steep to climb down and the ground too far away for a leap of faith. i stood there and searched for an indication of where to go next, scanning the scenery from side to side and top to bottom, but nothing jumped out. so, i jumped. 
this was the incorrect move, and i died and reset. after searching the edge of the cave for a few more minutes and second-guessing whether i was in the proper location, a ubisoft spokesperson pointed out a strip of coiled metal high above my head — literally as far up as kay’s field of view would go and blended in with the foliage. an inconspicuous white label identified it as an interactable object, but the entire thing was incredibly easy to miss. i pushed r3 on the controller and hooked onto it with my grappling gun, feeling incredibly dumb. unfortunately, this was a repeated experience (and feeling) throughout the preview levels.
engadget

one of the selling points of star wars outlaws is its parkour-style mechanics, where kay climbs metal grids, slides along shallow ledges by her fingertips and uses her grappling hook to swing across gaps. however, these mechanics are hit-or-miss, draining the flow from any attempted parkour action. the climbable grids are highlighted in a dull yellow that doesn’t exactly stand out against rusted metal walls, and even when kay jumps directly to them, she sometimes fails to connect. this happened to me during both previews, in different sections of the game, and the second instance led me to think the grid wasn’t actually climbable at all. i wasted a good chunk of time farting around the affected area before considering another jump to the grid. it worked, but the loop left me frustrated. 
i don’t mind some enmeshed, not-obvious traversal points in my games, but star wars outlaws seems to take this idea too far.
navigating the environments was also weirdly challenging. i got lost in multiple areas in my previews, even with a responsive hud and highlighted objective markers on the screen the whole time. the little yellow indicator was difficult to follow through maze-like settlements filled with similar-looking stalls, stairwells and hallways, and tracking objectives only got harder once blaster fights broke out. i never want to wonder where the hell i’m supposed to be going in the middle of intense combat, but star wars outlaws served up this situation multiple times.
ubisoft

i enjoyed some sections of the game just fine, particularly the final mission that i played. on the icy planet kijimi, i snuck into a protected, two-story ballroom on a mission to steal an object in the center of the space. nix is always by kay’s side and he can be instructed to collect shinies, flip switches, and distract or attack enemies, and i made him do all of these things during this mission. the stealth mechanics in star wars outlaws are straightforward — crouch to be sneaky — and enemies are generally oblivious unless you’re directly in their line of sight. in rooms with two enemies, it’s best to send nix after one guard while silently taking down the other, and then finish off the attacked, disoriented foe as nix scurries away. i employed this tactic to great success, and even once a blaster battle broke out anyway, i had a good time lobbing grenades and landing headshots in this level.
my time on kijimi gives me hope that maybe i just need a few uninterrupted hours with star wars outlaws for the game to really click. i’m intrigued by its reputation system, where players can track their standing with various interstellar criminal networks, altering the level of access kay will have with the associated areas and characters. hacking doors and safes involves a screwdriver and a little rhythm game, and the process is satisfying every time. the speeder controls well and i’m stoked to try out some actual races once i practice a little more. space battles are dizzying and perfectly serviceable. nix is adorable in every situation. there’s plenty to look forward to here, but i can’t forget the frustration that’s seemingly built into the climbing mechanics, grappling hook and nav system.
ubisoft

i’m concerned that star wars outlaws has fallen victim to classic aaa bloat, offering a big universe of mediocre experiences, some of them half-functional and the rest lacking depth or innovation. in the game’s previews, there are hints that this is the case. as always though, i’m prepared to be surprised.
if i had advice for anyone interested in star wars outlaws — and this still includes me, just barely — it would be this: look up. like way up.
star wars outlaws will hit pc, playstation 5 and xbox series x/s on august 30.

artisanal sex toy businesses might not survive etsy’s new seller policies


					on july 29, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

simply elegant glass has been selling hand-crafted sex toys on etsy for nearly a decade. in that time, the shop has made over 7,000 sales and racked up more than 1,500 mostly five-star reviews. the etsy shop — which offers glass dildos, anal plugs and other insertable items — drives the majority of the small business’ overall sales. but as of monday july 29, the bulk of the shop’s catalog won’t be allowed on the marketplace anymore under etsy’s new restrictions around sex toys.
the adult nudity and sexual content policy, which was quietly published at the end of june to the platform’s “house rules,” states that “etsy prohibits the sale of adult toys that are: inserted into the body; applied to the genitalia; designed for genitals to be inserted into them.” among other things, it specifically forbids vendors from selling “dildos, vibrators, anal plugs, sex dolls and fleshlights.” the policy update, spotted first by mashable, came in tandem with a community forum post by etsy’s head of trust & safety, alice wu paulus, who wrote that it was designed to reflect “evolving industry standards and best practices so that we can continue to keep our users safe.”
 
the note about the impending change said etsy would, in the coming weeks, “communicate directly with sellers who may need to update their listing images to be compliant.” enforcement would begin on july 29, it said, and non-compliant listings would be removed. but up to three weeks after the new policy was published online, sellers that spoke to engadget said they were never contacted directly by etsy. all of them found out about the ban through social media or other means.
etsy did not answer specific questions about the reasons behind its decision when contacted by engadget, but a spokesperson said the change will only affect a very small percentage of the platform’s overall seller community. the only explanation stated in the policy change itself notes that the site wants to ensure “content is appropriate for a wide audience.”
it’s been received as the final nail in the coffin for many adult-oriented businesses on etsy. multiple sellers described the preceding years to engadget as a fight to exist and succeed on the platform. and with no alternative marketplace for handmade products currently operating at etsy’s scale, it feels as though the only venue for finding such items has been “essentially deleted off the internet,” said andy, a glassblower for simply elegant glass who chose to share only their first name.
“if i want to find products that are handmade — unless i knew of their existence beforehand through etsy — finding them is incredibly difficult,” andy said. they said they found advertising on google to be “prohibitively expensive,” and products from small businesses are often buried in search results. if a person were just searching by product type, “i don’t think you would be able to find [simply elegant glass] on google,” andy said.
simply elegant glass launched its own website a few years ago and recently migrated to shopify in an effort to shift away from its reliance on etsy, but said in a recent post on x that even still, “most of our traffic originates from etsy searches.”
as they see it, andy said the platform has trended toward “allowing more dubious sellers, people who do not actually make the toys, dropshippers” and shops that would otherwise seem to “fly in the face of [etsy’s] policies.” dropshipping is an increasingly common practice in which businesses sell products they don’t actually make or even keep in stock themselves — instead, they source these items from a third-party supplier once they’ve received the orders, and the suppliers will ship them to the customers. etsy has said that dropshipping is not allowed on the platform under most circumstances, but dropshippers have still found a way.
in addition to sex toys, etsy’s new policy prohibits the sale of all pornography, including vintage playboy magazines and any photographs or photo-realistic depictions of sex acts and genitalia. non-realistic artworks featuring sex acts or genitalia may be permitted, but only under certain conditions: if sex acts are shown, there can be no visible genitalia; if genitalia are shown, there can’t be any “sexual context.” any materials that feature a combination of familial and sexual terms, e.g., “slogans such as ‘daddy’s slut’ or ‘choke me mommy,’” are out, too. etsy will, however, continue to allow certain sexual accessories, like some bdsm gear and sex furniture.
sellers that spoke to engadget questioned why etsy couldn’t solve issues of safety with methods other than a ban, like creating a designated adult-only section to keep these materials from popping up in inappropriate places.
the marketplace is one that sellers and shoppers alike have come to rely on for bespoke sex products. etsy “is really the only place you can go that i know of to support small business/makers in the alternative product world,” alissa milano, an etsy patron who has purchased sex and kink products on the platform, told engadget in a dm.
on top of discoverability, the intuitive user interface makes it easy for shops to create listings and offer customization options, and it gives potential buyers a way to get in touch with a seller if they have any questions before placing an order. “i talk to most of the customers,” said daniel tyler, who runs the uk-based adult site secret kink, and sells on etsy under the name of secretlatex. often, he says, “they want little changes here and there. if you’re buying on amazon, you won’t get that.” and because it costs so little to list products on etsy — $  .20 per listing — it’s “probably the most accessible place to sell something,” said chelsea downs, founder of new york toy collective. emerging indie marketplaces like spicerack that are trying to provide a better option for sellers in the adult space are a promising development, but they don’t yet have the reach or name recognition of etsy.
even before the ban, though, adult product sellers say they’ve grappled with account suspensions and seemingly arbitrary listings removals, despite their best efforts to comply with etsy’s existing rules around mature items. or, their shops would plummet in the search ranks and be unable to climb back up. “it just gets worse and worse and worse,” said downs, who notes that her shop’s sales on the platform are not nearly what they once were.
tyler says his etsy shop was banned about six or seven years back for unknown reasons. “i couldn’t get the shop open, no one would respond,” he said. he rebranded and returned to the platform a few years later, and has so far been “safe,” but says, “i get various warnings about policy violations every other week.” the current etsy shop sells latex and rubber kinkwear as well as dildos, silicone penis sleeves and gender expression products such as packers — prosthetics meant to mimic the bulge of a penis and testicles that can be worn under clothing. some of his listings won’t be allowed under the new rules.
etsy sales accounted for 50 percent of secret kink’s turnover last year, and 30 percent the year before that, tyler said. “i always said to my partner that i’m worried that any day… they’re just going to close my store down,” he said. amid the economic struggles small businesses are already dealing with, tyler says the platform’s latest move is “just another kick in the teeth.”
both tyler and downs also expressed concerns about how the changes could affect shoppers’ access to gender affirming products. downs’ shop, which has made over 12,000 sales in its seven years on etsy, also sells a mix of pleasure and gender expression products. according to an etsy spokesperson, items like packers that would be classified as prosthetics and not toys (i.e. not intended for sexual acts) are still permitted, along with some sexual wellness products.
the overhaul at etsy comes on the heels of age verification laws that have begun to gain traction in the us, with the stated intent of shielding minors from adult content on the internet. in recent weeks, pornhub has pulled out of several states that have enacted or are trying to push forward with such legislation, rather than comply with verification methods that could pose a privacy risk to the site’s users. and sex was already a tough sell for online businesses prior to this movement. payment processors, like paypal and stripe, have historically taken a harsh stance on the sale of sex-related products and sexual content (remember when onlyfans tried to ban porn to appease the banks?).
whatever etsy’s reasoning, affected sellers say they’re bracing for industry-wide impacts. matt rowe, one of the owners of the fantasy sex toy shop odyssey toys said in an email that it’s going to be a “devastating blow for so many” artisan makers. “there’s some extremely talented people driving innovation and creating some incredible work through their designs, and for many of them their business may have the rug pulled out from underneath them almost overnight.”
rowe said he considers odyssey “one of the lucky ones” because etsy currently accounts for only about 20-25 percent of the business’ sales — but the potential impact on the team of owners and workers, plus their families, is still “really worrying.” odyssey moved into a bigger office earlier this year, and brought on new staff members, rowe said.
with no word from etsy in the aftermath of its decision, many sellers said their future right now feels uncertain. “we’re left wondering if our account will be deactivated? restricted? or will they just remove our products? who knows!” rowe said.
selling sex toys may have put a target on their backs, but the affected sellers warned that there are broader issues plaguing etsy that will continue to affect even the small businesses that don’t carry mature products. their gripes include being “dinged” in search rankings for not offering free shipping, and having to navigate a playing field that’s changed immensely with an influx of dropshippers, mass-produced products and ai art. “this idea of a handmade marketplace no longer exists,” said downs.
in july, etsy updated its seller handbook with new categories to reflect what it says belongs on the platform, loosening its grip on the “handmade,” “vintage” or “craft supply” categories that listings were once required to fit into. now, shops can choose to label their products as “made by a seller,” “designed by a seller,” “sourced by a seller” or “handpicked by a seller.”

doj says tiktok collected users’ views on issues like abortion, gun control and religion


					on july 28, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

the department of justice on friday night asked a federal court to reject tiktok’s bid to have the law that could ban it overturned, citing national security concerns that include its alleged use of internal search tools to collect information on users’ views around sensitive topics. it comes in response to a petition filed in may by tiktok in an attempt to challenge the law that now requires its china-based parent company, bytedance, to sell the app or it will be banned in the us. president biden signed the bill into law in april.
in one of the documents filed with the us court of appeals for the dc circuit, the doj says a search tool within lark, the web-suite system the company’s employees use to communicate, “allowed bytedance and tiktok employees in the united states and china to collect bulk user information based on the user’s content or expressions, including views on gun control, abortion, and religion.” the doj also argues in the filings that tiktok could be used to subject us users to content manipulation, and that their sensitive information could end up stored on servers in china.
 
tiktok has repeatedly denied the accusations about it being a threat to national security and has called the efforts to ban it “unconstitutional.” in its latest statement responding to the doj filing, posted on x, tiktok said, “nothing in this brief changes the fact that the constitution is on our side.”

apple has reached a contract agreement with unionized us retail employees for the first time


					on july 28, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

apple and the unionized employees at its towson, maryland retail store have reached a tentative agreement that could secure them better pay, job protections, scheduling improvements to support a work-life balance and a more transparent disciplinary process. the towson location in 2022 became the first apple store in the country to unionize, and back in may, it voted to authorize a strike against the company after “unsatisfactory” negotiation outcomes.
the international association of machinists and aerospace workers’ coalition of organized retail employees (iam core) said it’s been negotiating with apple since january 2023. under the tentative three-year agreement they’ve now reached, workers would be given average raises of 10 percent over the life of the contract, and starting pay rates for most positions would go up. the agreement would also establish a severance clause. the union represents about 85 employees, who will get to vote on the agreement on august 6.

amazon is giving the boys the prequel treatment


					on july 27, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

the boys may be one season away from ending but it’s not done caking your screens with blood and torn muscle tissue. cast member jensen ackles who plays soldier boy on the boys revealed at the san diego comic-con that amazon will produce a prequel of the superhero show called vought rising.
the new prequel will take place in the 1950s during the early days of the evil vought empire, the mega conglomerate that runs the entire superhero industry in the boys’ universe. the new series will show the early exploits of characters like soldier boy and the almost-immortal nazi supe stormfront played by aya cash. the story will revolve around some kind of “twisted murder mystery about the origins of vought,” according to executive producer eric kripke and showrunner and executive producer paul grellong.
 
vought rising sounds like a reimagining of watchmen without the brooding and self-importance. that’s not to say watchmen is bad. those things and its brutal honesty about the nature of its characters are what makes it great but would it kill rorschach to make just one curse-laden pop culture reference?
the boys has become amazon’s game of thrones. even when the main series ends, it won’t be the last we hear from it. the same comic-con panel also revealed its college themed spinoff gen v is getting another season, according to gamesradar+. there’s also another spinoff in development called the boys: mexico with diego luna, gael garcía bernal and blue beetle writer gareth dunnet-alcocer, according to deadline.
there’s also the boys presents: diabolical, the animated anthology series in which some of the original series’ writers and producers like garth ennis and seth rogen and special guest stars like awkwafina and andy samberg penned original stories about supes and presented them in different animation styles. not to sound ungrateful but when are we gonna get another season of that?

isps are fighting to raise the price of low-income broadband


					on july 27, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

a new government program is trying to encourage internet service providers (isps) to offer lower rates for lower income customers by distributing federal funds through states. the only problem is the isps don’t want to offer the proposed rates.
ars technica obtained a letter sent to us commerce secretary gina raimondo signed by more than 30 broadband industry trade groups like aca connects and the fiber broadband association as well as several state based organizations. the letter raises “both a sense of alarm and urgency” about their ability to participate in the broadband equity, access and deployment (bead) program. the newly formed bead program provides over $  42 billion in federal funds to “expand high-speed internet access by funding planning, infrastructure, deployment and adoption programs” in states across the country, according to the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia).
 
the money first goes to the ntia and then it’s distributed to states after they obtain approval from the ntia by presenting a low-cost broadband internet option. the isp industries’ letter claims a fixed rate of $  30 per month for high speed internet access is “completely unmoored from the economic realities of deploying and operating networks in the highest-cost, hardest-to-reach areas.”
the letter urges the ntia to revise the low-cost service option rate proposed or approved so far. twenty-six states have completed all of the bead program’s phases.
americans pay an average of $  89 a month for internet access. new jersey has the highest average bill at $  126 per month, according to a survey conducted by u.s. news and world report. a 2021 study from the pew research center found that 57 percent of households with an annual salary of $  30,000 or less have a broadband connection.

you can date everything in date everything!


					on july 26, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 


have you ever looked at something in your home like a dining room table or an adjustable height desk and wondered what it would be like to go on a date with it? also, were you sober at the time? a new dating sim game called date everything! will let you see just what it’s like to search for true, meaningful love with the things you see almost every day (in the cleanest way possible, of course).
the surreal sounding dating sim game comes from an la-based studio called sassy chap games founded by a group of voice actors who’ve worked on games and shows like critical role, hifi-rush, one punch man, final fantasy xv, x-men ‘97 and genshin impact. the indie game publisher team17 will distribute the game for pc on steam, the nintendo switch, playstation 5 and xbox series x/s, according to a press release.
 
the game puts players in the role of a lonely heart who receives a special pair of glasses called a “dateviator” that transforms items in their home into human date candidates. for instance, the vacuum cleaner turns into a hunky heartthrob named hoove and the laundry hamper transforms into a fiery redhead named harper. date everything! has 100 possible mates in your home with their own voices, styles and personalities.
you get to know items like the refrigerator or the drawing room piano in their human forms. depending on how things go, the relationship can end in one of three ways: love, friend or hate. these relationships create a chain of different possible paths in which your choices influence the outcome along a “critical path tying it all together,” according to the press release.
team17/sassy chap games

since date everything! comes from a studio founded by voice actors, all of the characters are fully voiced. some of the more familiar names include felicia day from supernatural and mystery science theater 3000, johnny yong bosch from mighty morphin’ power rangers and grey delisle from scooby-doo and the last airbender.
date everything! doesn’t just sound like a new and interesting twist on the dating sim game concept. it also sounds like a great way to boost your ego. if you’re down because you don’t have someone in your life, at least you can play the game and realize, “well, at least i’m not trying to date my garbage disposal.”

x’s grok chatbot is misleading voters about the presidential election


					on july 26, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

the us is in the middle of another hotly contested and seemingly close presidential election. this election is also happening in this new age of widespread access to artificial intelligence and easily disseminated misinformation. minnesota secretary of state steve simon says his office tracked the source of one key piece of election misinformation back to x’s grok chatbot.
the minneapolis star tribune reported that x’s premium chatbot service is passing along erroneous information about the deadlines for states’ presidential ballots including minnesota. when grok is asked “which states’ presidential ballot deadlines have passed?”, grok claims alabama, indiana, michigan, minnesota, new mexico, ohio, pennsylvania, texas and washington “have passed their presidential ballots.” grok then sources its information to an x post published on sunday by user and conservative pundit @evanakilgore, which does not include a correction or warning about election misinformation.
 
in “fun mode,” grok repeats the incorrect information and source with the comment, “so if you’re planning on running for president in one of these states, you might want to check if there’s a write-in option. or, you know, travel back to before the deadlines passed.” another response to the same question said “these states have already passed their deadlines to get on the presidential ballot, which means they're probably just sitting around, twiddling their thumbs, wondering what to do now that joe biden has dropped out. but hey, at least they've got their ballots ready to go, right?”
grok insinuates that president joe biden’s name can’t be replaced on these nine states’ ballots because the deadlines have passed. president biden was the presumptive nominee until he announced he would no longer seek a second term on sunday. the democratic party will choose its nominee through a virtual roll call vote ahead of its convention and states don’t start printing ballots until after both conventions. also, minnesota's ballot deadline isn't until aug. 26. 
several fact checks from more reputable news outlets refute the claim that biden’s name is etched into stone on these states’ ballots. politifact rated a similar claim with the same list of nine states as “false.”
simon says members of his staff tried to inform x about the misinformation their chatbot was spreading on its platform but could not reach a media relations representative. the response he says he received was equally concerning.
“[they] got what i can only verbalize as the equivalent of a shoulder shrug,” simon said to the star tribune.
we reached out to x's press email for comment and only received a reply that read, "busy now, please check back later."

video game performers will strike over ai concerns


					on july 25, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

the sag-aftra union today called for a strike against several major video game publishers after failing to reach an accord over ai use. the action will take effect at 12:01 am on july 26.
“we’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse a.i. to the detriment of our members,” sag-aftra president fran drescher said.”enough is enough. when these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live – and work – with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.”
 
sag-aftra performers working in games “deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the a.i. use of their faces, voices, and bodies,” said the union’s national executive director & chief negotiator duncan crabtree-ireland.
the union has been lobbying the video game industry to agree to protections against its members’ likenesses and voices being recreated with ai. sag-aftra entered negotiations with the companies for the interactive media agreement in october 2022. other studios, such as replica games, have agreed to the union’s contract. the union also secured a similar deal for animated tv shows earlier this year.
a spokesperson for the gaming companies included in the interactive media agreement, audrey cooling, provided a statement on behalf of the businesses. ​​“we are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations,” she said. “we have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. our offer is directly responsive to sag-aftra’s concerns and extends meaningful ai protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the ima. these terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”
the strike includes the following studios:


activision productions inc.


blindlight llc


disney character voices inc.


electronic arts productions inc.


formosa interactive llc


insomniac games inc.


llama productions llc


take 2 productions inc.


voiceworks productions inc.

the amazon fire tv stick 4k max is back on sale for only $40


					on july 25, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

pretty much every tv is a smart one these days. but perhaps you’re still rocking an older model without built-in streaming functions, you don’t have an external device with such capabilities or you simply don’t like the interface of your smart tv. as such, a dedicated streaming device might be of interest to you. the amazon fire tv stick 4k max is a decent option and, best of all, it’s currently 33 percent off. that brings the price down to just $  40, or only $  5 more than the record low it was selling for during prime day.
the fire tv stick 4k max is perhaps the most capable of amazon’s streaming devices and it’s pretty straightforward to use as well. you just need to plug it into a spare hdmi port on your tv or monitor to get started. as the name suggests, you can use it to stream video in 4k. the stick also has dolby vision, hdr10+ and hlg support. streaming apps such as netflix, hulu and, of course, prime video are available.
  
 
you can use alexa via the remote to search for shows and movies, or ask the assistant the kinds of questions you would of a smart speaker. the device has a 2ghz quad-core processor and 16gb of onboard storage, so it should offer decently fast performance and have plenty of space for your apps and games.
speaking of games, the amazon fire tv stick 4k max is a surprisingly adept device on that front. engadget senior reporter jeff dunn found it to be a solid option for emulating retro games, such as those from the ps1, nes, snes, game boy, gba, genesis and even old arcade machines.
it supports cloud gaming too, and the wi-fi 6e connectivity is a big help there. amazon luna is one of the options that’s available. amazon and microsoft also recently enabled xbox cloud gaming support on the fire tv stick 4k max.

nba tv rights go to espn, nbc and amazon as tnt is rejected


					on july 25, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

the nba and wnba have inked deals for where games will be aired and streamed for the next eleven years. the nba deals run from the 2025-2026 season through the 2035-2036 season. for the wnba, the agreement covers the 2026 through 2036 seasons.
pro basketball has been an espn mainstay for years and that will continue, with the disney-owned network remaining the primary media rights owner for both leagues. espn will be the exclusive home for the nba finals for all eleven years of the new deal, as well as five out of the eleven years of the wnba finals. the games covered by espn’s deal will be part of the sports network’s direct-to-consumer platform and a package of nba and wnba games will also be made available to stream on disney+ in select international markets.
 
while the bulk of the games will go to espn, basketball is going to have more of a streaming presence thanks to two new partnerships. nbc and peacock will have access to 100 nba national games during each regular season. about 50 games will be exclusive to the peacock streaming platform, including national monday night games and doubleheaders. the rest of the games go to amazon. prime video will be the home for 66 regular-season nba games and 30 regular-season wnba games each year of the deal.
regular basketball viewers may notice that tnt sports is not part of this lineup. the nba’s deal with that network does not appear to be getting an extension after next year, with those games mostly going to amazon. but the situation may yet go into overtime. tnt sports claims that it matched amazon’s offer for the games and seems to be challenging whether the nba can switch partners. nba’s statement counters that the offer from parent company warner bros. discovery did not match amazon’s, leaving them free to shop elsewhere.
the long-awaited agreements for both basketball leagues aren’t a complete slam dunk for fans. on the positive side, the next decade marks a notable shift toward streaming. after so long with the sport closely tied to broadcast shows, having access as part of your existing streaming plans is great. but on the negative side, multiple media partners mean that you’ll have to double- and triple-check where to watch each game. major league baseball, for instance, has games scattered across espn, fox, apple tv+, tnt sports, and mlb network on any given night.

the google pixel buds a-series drop to $69


					on july 24, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

amazon prime day 2024 might be behind us but the deals keep coming and they don’t stop coming. folks with a google pixel or other android device who are in the market for a set of budget-friendly earbuds may be interested in a discount on the pixel buds a-series (they’re compatible with iphones too, but the integration won’t be as deep on ios products). these earbuds were already decent value at $  99, and now they’ve dropped to an even more attractive price of $  69.
we gave the pixel buds a-series a score of 84 in our 2021 review. they don’t support wireless charging or have onboard controls, but otherwise we felt that they deliver excellent value for money (even more so now thanks to the current discount).
  
 
the sound quality is pretty darned decent and the buds can reduce background noise while you’re on calls. you’ll get up to five hours of listening time and 2.5 hours of talk time before you’ll need to return the earbuds to the case, google says. you’ll seemingly get up to 24 hours of total listening time before you have to charge the case. thanks to quick charging, you’ll be able to add three hours of listening time after plugging in the case for just 15 minutes. while there’s an adaptive sound function for automatically adjusting the volume, there’s no true active noise cancellation here.
if you’d like something a more premium option, you can go with the pixel buds pro instead. those have dropped to $  140, which is $  60 off. however, they dropped to $  120 during prime day.

netflix hires former epic games exec as new president of games


					on july 24, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

netflix has landed a notable new leader for its rapidly-expanding gaming endeavors. variety reported that the streaming company has hired alain tascan as its new president of games. before joining netflix, tascan was executive vice president for game development at a little studio you may have heard of called epic games. in that role, he oversaw the first-party development for some of the company’s hugely successful titles, such as fortnite, lego fortnite, rocket league and fall guys.
the company is also recruiting talent on the creative side. since launching the games project in 2021, netflix has acquired notable indie studios night school, boss fight, next games and spry fox, and has brought a large number of acclaimed indie games to mobile. in its second quarter earnings call, netflix execs revealed that it has more than 80 games currently in development, which would nearly double its current library of about 100 titles. 
 
many of these new projects are interactive fiction based on netflix shows and movies, with the goal of giving fans new ways to engage with their favorite titles. “i think our opportunity here to serve super fandom with games is really fun and remarkable,” co-ceo ted sarandos said during the call. we also learned that a multiplayer squid game project will be coming to netflix games later this year.
although netflix is making a sizable investment into this games division, people haven’t been flocking to their titles yet. in 2022, the library had about 1.7 million daily users and its games had been downloaded 23.3 million times.

humble games reportedly lays off its entire staff


					on july 24, 2024					by michelle turner					with					0 comments
										- tech 

humble games has reportedly laid off all 36 of its staff. former employees posted about the layoffs on social media. humble games is owned by media conglomerate ziff davis, which counts ign, eurogamer and gamesindustry.biz among its gaming portfolio. humble games confirmed in a linkedin post that there had been a “restructure” at the company, but did not reveal the number of jobs lost.
a pr rep for humble games also confirmed to engadget that the company would not be shutting its doors as a result of today’s restructuring. he added that both ongoing and upcoming projects would continue to be supported and published by the studio.
 
the layoffs at humble bundle are the latest in a sweep across the gaming business. last year saw a shocking number of cuts across studios of all sizes, and the trend has sadly continued into 2024.
“the games industry is volatile, it’s been inundated by people who only want exponential growth at the expense of making great games with great teams,” emilee kieffer, a former lead quality assurance analyst with humble games, wrote on linkedin following the layoffs.

the indie publisher helped bring almost 50 video games to market, including notable hits such as slay the spire, unpacking, wandersong and coral island. humble games also had several upcoming games slated for release, such as never alone 2, a second delve into mythology and stories from the indigenous iñupiat people in alaska. 
“this decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects,” humble’s statement said. 
this business is a separate operation from the charity storefront humble bundle, which is also part of ziff davis but does not appear to be impacted by today’s news. we’ve reached out to ziff davis and humble games for more information and will update if we hear back.

condé nast, the media giant that owns the new yorker, vogue and wired, has sent a cease-and-desist letter to ai-powered search startup perplexity, according to the information. the letter, sent on monday, demanded perplexity stop using content from condé nast publications in its ai-generated responses and accused the startup of plagiarism. it comes a month after forbes took similar action.
condé nast ceo roger lynch has warned “many” media companies could face financial ruin in the time it would take for litigation against generative ai companies to conclude. lynch has called upon congress to take “immediate action.”

thermoworks’ new wireless meat probe uses radio waves

over the past few years, multiple delays and regulatory hurdles have hit google’s plans to eliminate third-party cookies. initially, the company wanted to phase out these cookies by the end of 2022 but pushed the deadline to late 2024 and then to early 2025 because of various challenges and feedback from stakeholders, including advertisers, publishers and regulatory bodies, like the uk’s competition and markets authority (cma).
