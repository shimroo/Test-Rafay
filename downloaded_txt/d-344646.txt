the way home: season 3
starring: andie macdowell, chyler leigh, sadie laflamme-snow and evan williams

from the moment kat landry returned to the family homestead after a seventeen-year absence, with her teenage daughter, alice, in tow, we have been hooked on this time-traveling, family drama. twenty episodes later, we couldn't be more invested in the stories, relationships and mysteries that surround this family and their property. originally stating that season 3 would only air on their streaming service, hallmark fans adamantly voiced their disdain with that plan. the channel quickly revised the plan and the new episodes  
will air every friday, beginning january 3.
this season's previews hint at more drama, more romance and a new mystery possibly involving new people time-traveling that we didn't know could travel. all we know is that we can't wait to watch this season unfold! 
stream season one and two on hallmark plus before tuning in to the season 3 premiere episode (titled you ain't seen nothing yet") at 9pm est on hallmark channel.

starring: laci j. mailey and marco grazzini 

betty was about to experience her first kiss when a jealous classmate "cursed" her with the fate of never finding true love.  after a long series of calamitous relationships that always ended in disaster for her boyfriends, betty stopped dating entirely.  now working as an actuary, she plays everything safe, preferring to focus on her career while she helps to plan her best friend mya's wedding.  understandably, betty is cautious when alex, a danger-seeking news photographer asks her out on a date.  after a great deal of encouragement from mya, betty decides to fight her fears and give love another chance.  she joins alex on his adventures with the goal of keeping him out of harm's way.  as their relationship blossoms, betty begins to relax and wonder whether the curse is real after all - until alex unexpectedly trips and falls down a staircase, leading betty to blame herself for his accident.  heartbroken, she frantically tries to find her childhood friend to lift the curse.  while in pursuit of tracking down her old friend, betty starts to realize that perhaps the curse was only a series of random accidents, and she shouldn't let fear lead her in life or in love.

when calls the heart
it's hard to believe that we are already to the season 10 finale of "when calls the heart!" for true fans (called hearties), the last 12 weeks have flown by so quickly! admittedly, we are in a place in hope valley that no one saw coming. 
we're all on the edge of our seat wondering where this episode will leave our favorite characters. our only consulation is knowing that the cast and crew are hard at work on season 11 now. we just don't know which cast members are back next season. 

in the 12th (and final) episode of the season, titled "starry nights," elizabeth is at lucas' side, as is the entire town... supporting him on election day, hoping he will be the one to save the valley.  meanwhile, rosemary and lee discuss who should be their baby's godfather.   
this new episode premieres october 15 at 9pm est on the hallmark channel!

during the coup, red and new acquaintance, "chloe," (cinderella's daughter) end up magically being sent back in time to when their parents were students at the prestigious school. these new frenemies must team up to stop the event that turned good people bad and then figure out how to get back to their place in the time. their journey causes both girls to view their parents in whole new lights!
