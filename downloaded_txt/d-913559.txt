where we work
grasslands are the unheralded counterparts of the rainforest. comprising over 250 million hectares, they are home to countless plants and animals, sustain fisheries, and provide water to millions of people.
yet they are highly threatened.
ngc is dedicated to promoting grassland conservation by empowering local people and launching careers in conservation.
