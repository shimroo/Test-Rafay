about scrmvisit the railway museumthe south carolina railroad museum, inc. was established in 1973 by a group of dedicated railroad enthusiasts from the columbia and charleston, south carolina areas. in october 1983, the museum received by way of donation the former rockton and rion railway located in fairfield county, south carolina from martin marietta aggregates. then began the long and difficult process of reconstruction. the museum named the line the rockton, rion and western railroad (rr&w).

from our visitors










this is a hidden gem! friendly people with fun facts. we went on a whim and were not disappointed. i loved the train ride and the museum with historic train cars to explore!






fantastic exhibit and great staff. you can tell that the volunteers care greatly about the museum. the train ride was awesome. a must-do!






friendly & knowledgeable staff! fun learning environment with many options to choose from for children or adults. events are well put together and well worth your money!






the staff and volunteers are wonderful and very friendly! please visit this wonderful place that preserves a historical railroad you & your family can ride.






so much fun riding on the 90-minute ride. the train is run completely by volunteers in train station attire who pointed out interesting things along the way. great social distancing efforts. a really nice day!






a great experience at this local attraction! they offer seasonally specific rides on some of their train cars and boast a significant collection!






great place with an awesome staff! i took my great-nephew to the pumpkin express and it was fun. he loved it and wants to go back!






we went for the pumpkin patch ride and it was a great experience. we will certainly be going back again!






i can truly say that i really enjoyed this! it was very easy to find, had plenty of parking, and accommodated small and large groups.  the staff was very friendly and helpful when we arrived!
