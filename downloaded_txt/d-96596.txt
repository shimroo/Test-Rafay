henry iv



feb 17, 2025




the actor dakin matthews won a special drama desk award in 2003 when he adapted both parts of shakespeare’s king henry iv into a single, albeit lengthy, version produced at lincoln center. his edit allowed regional theaters to present the histories of henry iv; his son prince hal; and the roguish falstaff in one production, lessening the expense of mounting two separate ones. the adaptation removes lesser characters, such as mouldy and rumour in part 2, and trims extended metaphors and a lot of obscure elizabethan humor. but the famous scenes and lines remain—“i am not only witty in myself, but the cause of wit in other men,” “uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,” “we have heard the chimes at midnight.”

b*tchcraft



feb 16, 2025




of all the productions opening off-broadway this season, b*tchcraft may well be the most bewitching. with music and lyrics written by bitch, and book by her and margie zohn, who also directs, it’s a wild journey into how bitch, a quiet girl from suburban michigan, shed her chrysalis to become the queer icon that she is today.

after endgame



feb 16, 2025




kevin james doyle has a good story to tell in his solo show after endgame—along with several engaging digressions. but none of it has to do with performing in the play endgame by samuel beckett. the endgame of the title is the last third of a chess match, doyle explains. “blunders typically happen in the endgame,” he warns, when only a few pieces remain on the board.

night sings its songs



feb 14, 2025




night sings its songs is a rare opportunity to see a play by jon fosse, the norwegian winner of the 2023 nobel prize in literature. fosse’s 1997 play is centered on a married couple, named only young man and young woman. from the outset it’s clear they are having marital difficulties. young man (kyle cameron) is unhappy and apathetic, while young woman is dissatisfied in her marriage and feeling stuck. they have a baby who periodically cries.

my man kono



feb 13, 2025




with my man kono, now premiering at pan asian repertory, playwright philip w. chung has an interesting story to tell. he tells it dutifully, thoroughly, and for the most part clearly. but not excitingly. chung has done his research. his title character, toraichi kono (brian lee huynh), was a japanese immigrant who made it to the united states in the early 20th century and rose to a position of relative wealth and importance, then saw his fortunes dramatically reverse.

gil scott-heron’s bluesology



feb 13, 2025




playing at the soho playhouse as part of the fringe encore series, gil scott-heron’s bluesology is a heartfelt tribute of spoken-word and musical performance full of angst and warmth, lovingly hosted by his daughter gia scott-heron. gil scott-heron, who died in 2011, was a spoken-word artist and musician, and the show presents 17 of his works from a career that extended from 1970 through 2010. bluesology is how he described his work—he saw himself as “a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues.”
