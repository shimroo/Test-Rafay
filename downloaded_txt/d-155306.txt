native americans thrived until columbus and the white settlers came over
	  from europe, bringing their ideals and diseases with them. native americans
	  were more prone to the diseases and many of them died because of the wide
	  spread epidemics they faced. at first the settlers were friendly towards
	  the american indians, but they soon turned against them and pushed them
	  from their native lands. the american indians were fierce warriors and
	  fighters and used tactics that the white settlers were not accustomed to.
	  the american indians had a sense for everything around them and they could
	  track the movements of the white men. there were many historical battles fought
	  between the american indians and the europeans, including the american revolutionary
	  war, chickamauga wars, north west indian war, and many other battles. the
	  wounded knee massacre followed by the killing of sitting bull led to the
	  final battle of indian wars. americans indians have since been forced to live
	  on indian reservations, stripped of their native lands.
this website is dedicated to the native american indians  and other indigenous peoples and their rich culture
	  and history. please feel free to send in any suggestions or share articles
