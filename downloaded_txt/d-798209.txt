about


        “during a 25-year recording career, travis became known  as the epitome of 
        what country music should
        sound like.”
    
–billy dukes, taste of country, july 2020




            with lifetime sales in excess of 25 million, randy travis is one of the biggest multi-genre record sellers
            of all time and a recent inductee into the country music hall of fame class of 2016. his honors include
            seven grammy awards, 11 academy of country music statuettes, 10 american music awards, two people’s choice
            awards, seven music city news awards, eight dove awards from the gospel music association and five country
            music association honors. in addition, three of his performances earned cma song of the year honors: “on the
            other hand” (1986), “forever and ever amen” (1987) and “three wooden crosses” (2002). to date, he has 23 no.
            1 singles, 31 top-10 smashes and more than 40 appearances in feature films and television shows to his
            credit.
        



            four of his albums are gold records. four are platinum. one has gone double platinum. one is triple platinum
            and another is quintuple platinum. in 2004, randy was honored with his own star in the hollywood walk of
            fame and is honored on the music city walk of fame in nashville, tn. he has been a member of the cast of the
            grand ole opry since 1986. in 2017, randy was honored with a wax figure at madame tussauds™ nashville. since
            his near fatal stroke in 2013, with the help of his wife mary and rigorous physical therapy, randy continues
            to make improvements in his speaking, walking, and yes, singing. with the help of author ken abraham, he
            released his critically-acclaimed memoir in 2019, forever and ever, amen.
