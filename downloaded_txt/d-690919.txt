god’s grand finale 
a god-centered overview of revelation the bible’s last book is god’s final word to mankind—and the breathtaking revelation of our lord jesus christ. though this letter describes depravity, devils, and destruction, it also provides an incredible portrait of our almighty god, delivering profound insights into who he really is.jeff kinley examines the 13 characteristics of god that revelation uniquely and vividly illustrates through its foretelling of earth’s last days. when the dust of revelation settles, we behold the lamb standing and ruling in triumphant, sovereign, and indescribable glory.















during these troubling times, we encourage you to stand with us as we call america to turn and seek the lord. while we take every human precaution, he is the only one who ultimately can protect and deliver us. please join with us in prayer for god’s grace, mercy and protection for believers everywhere. pray also for his mercy toward unbelievers who need to come to faith now more than ever before while there is still time and opportunity to seek the lord.currently, our website has more than 50 messages. these contain teaching straight from god's word! we encourage you to view these messages and share them with family and friends.
