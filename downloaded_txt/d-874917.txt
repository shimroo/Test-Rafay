in today’s digital age, visual content plays a crucial role in capturing attention and conveying messages effectively. whether you’re a blogger, marketer, or simply someone who loves to create, having access to a wide array of free, legal photos can be a game-changer. but how do you navigate the vast sea of online images while staying on the right side of copyright laws?
understanding legal free photo downloads
what are stock photos?
stock photos are pre-shot images available for licensing and use in various projects. these photos cover a wide range of subjects and are created by professional photographers or artists. stock photos provide a convenient and cost-effective solution for individuals and businesses needing high-quality visuals without the expense of custom photoshoots.
types of licenses for free photos
when downloading free photos legally, you encounter different license types:

public domain: images with no copyright restrictions


use freely for any purpose without attribution


creative commons (cc) licenses: flexible copyright licenses


cc0: no rights reserved, use without restrictions
cc by: requires attribution to the creator
cc by-sa: requires attribution and sharing under the same license


royalty-free: one-time payment for unlimited use


often found on stock photo websites
may have some restrictions on commercial use


free for personal use: limited to non-commercial projects


typically requires attribution
commercial use may require purchasing a license


free stock photo websites: offer images under various licenses


unsplash: free for commercial and non-commercial use
pexels: free for personal and commercial use
pixabay: most images free for commercial use without attribution

understanding these license types ensures you use free photo downloads legally in your projects. always check the specific terms of each license before using an image to avoid copyright infringement.
finding free photo sources
search engines and image databases
utilize search engines like google images to find free photos. apply filters such as “usage rights” and select “creative commons licenses” to narrow your results. image databases like wikimedia commons offer a vast collection of free-to-use images. these platforms provide advanced search options to refine your queries based on specific license types.
free stock photo websites
popular free stock photo websites include unsplash, pexels, and pixabay. these platforms offer high-quality, royalty-free images for personal and commercial use. unsplash features a diverse range of professional photographs, while pexels specializes in lifestyle and business imagery. pixabay provides a mix of photos, vectors, and illustrations. each site offers a free photo download option, allowing you to access thousands of images without cost.
public domain resources
explore public domain resources for copyright-free images. the new york public library digital collections and the library of congress offer extensive archives of historical photographs and artworks. nasa’s image gallery provides stunning space-related visuals available for public use. these sources often include vintage illustrations, maps, and scientific images that can add unique visual elements to your projects.
how to download free photos legally
checking license terms
before downloading free photos, carefully review the license terms associated with each image. look for specific usage rights, attribution requirements, and any restrictions on commercial use. many free photo websites display license information directly beneath the images or provide a link to the full license terms. familiarize yourself with common license types such as creative commons, public domain, and royalty-free to ensure compliance with copyright laws when using free photo downloads.
understanding usage rights
understand the usage rights granted by the license to avoid potential legal issues. some licenses allow unrestricted use, while others may require attribution or limit commercial applications. pay attention to:

commercial vs. non-commercial use
modification permissions
attribution requirements
redistribution restrictions

ensure your intended use aligns with the specified usage rights to maintain legal compliance when using free photo downloads.
verifying image quality
assess the quality of free photos before downloading to ensure they meet your project requirements:

check resolution: download high-resolution images suitable for your intended use.
examine clarity: look for sharp, well-focused photos without visible pixelation.
evaluate lighting: choose images with proper exposure and balanced lighting.
consider composition: select photos with visually appealing arrangements and framing.
inspect for watermarks: avoid images with visible watermarks or logos.

download several options to compare quality and select the best-suited image for your project. remember that while free photo downloads offer cost-effective solutions, maintaining high standards for image quality enhances the overall impact of your visual content.
using free photos correctly

properly using free photos involves understanding and adhering to license terms. here’s how to ensure you’re using free images correctly:
giving proper credit
when using free photos, always check the attribution requirements. some licenses mandate crediting the photographer or source. include the photographer’s name, the website, and any specific attribution text required by the license. place this information near the image or in your project’s credits section. for example:
“photo by john doe on unsplash”
failing to provide proper credit can lead to copyright infringement, even if the image is free to use.
commercial vs. personal use
understand the distinction between commercial and personal use when downloading free photos:

personal use: using images for non-profit purposes, such as personal blogs or school projects
commercial use: utilizing images for business or profit-generating activities

some free photo licenses restrict usage to personal projects only. before using a free photo download for commercial purposes, verify that the license allows it. many stock photo websites offer filters to search for commercially licensed images.
modifying free images
some free photo licenses allow modifications, while others prohibit alterations. when modifying free images:

check the license terms for modification permissions
respect the integrity of the original work
consider mentioning any modifications in your attribution

if you need to extensively modify images, look for free vector files, which are easier to edit. some websites offer free vector downloads alongside their photo collections.
remember, even with modification rights, you must still adhere to other license terms, such as attribution requirements or usage restrictions.
best practices for free photo downloads
keeping records of sources
document the source of each free photo download. create a spreadsheet with columns for the image file name, website url, photographer’s name, and license type. include the date of download and any specific attribution requirements. this practice ensures you can easily reference the source and comply with license terms if questioned about image usage.
avoiding copyright infringement
verify the license terms before using any free photo download. read the full license agreement, not just the summary. understand the difference between commercial and non-commercial use. some images labeled “free” may have restrictions on commercial applications. respect any attribution requirements specified in the license. when in doubt, contact the photographer or website administrator for clarification.
using reverse image search
employ reverse image search tools to verify the authenticity of free photo downloads. upload the image to google images or tineye to check if it appears on other websites. this process helps identify potential copyright issues or misattributed images. if you find conflicting information about the image’s origin or licensing, avoid using it to prevent legal complications.
troubleshooting common issues
dealing with watermarked images
when encountering watermarked images during your free photo download search, verify the image’s license terms. some free stock photo sites use watermarks to protect their content. if you find a watermarked image:

check if a non-watermarked version is available for download
look for alternative sources offering similar images without watermarks
consider using advanced search filters to exclude watermarked results
explore free vector options as they often come without watermarks

if you need high-quality, watermark-free images for commercial use, consider using a shutterstock coupon to access premium content at a reduced cost.
handling copyright infringement notices
if you receive a copyright infringement notice for an image you believed to be free:

remove the image immediately from your website or project
review your records of the image source and license terms
contact the copyright holder to explain the situation and seek resolution
verify the authenticity of the notice to ensure it’s not a scam
consult legal advice if needed, especially for commercial projects


double-check license terms before using any free photo download
keep detailed records of image sources and licenses
use reputable free stock photo sites with clear licensing information
implement a system to regularly review and update image usage on your projects

conclusion
downloading free photos legally opens up a world of creative possibilities for your projects. by following the guidelines outlined in this article you’ll be able to find high-quality images while respecting copyright laws. remember to always check license terms verify image quality and give proper credit when required. with the wealth of resources available from stock photo sites to public domain collections you’re now equipped to enhance your visual content legally and ethically. so go ahead and start exploring the vast world of free photos to bring your ideas to life!

everything you need to know about the new istock credits

although there are some changed with the istock pricing, the stock photo agency still allows you to purchase royalty-free images and illustrations in two ways: subscription plans and credits. you can either pay per download with credits or subscribe and save with a plan. the new pricing still allow you to download images, vectors and video clips with istock credits, but there are some significant changes. let us consider some of them.


when you buy more, you save more. this is an old feature, but one that does not need to be changed. many photo buyers are happy about this feature. that’s why the stock photo website decide to retain it.
the credits never expire. this is another feature that we all love about the istock credits. they do not expire, which means you can download images whenever you need. you do not have to worry about expiration dates.
the base package contain 1 credit. with one credit, you can purchase one essential image. on the other hand, a signature image takes 3 credits. so if you purchase 18 credits, you have the option to purchase 18 essential images, 6 signature images or anything in between.
the discount starts steep but buying more offers a better deal. you can purchase credits by 1, 3, 6, 18, 36, 60, 150, and 300. if you need a larger package, you can contact the stock site. the discounts start at 10% but increases as the size of the package also increase.
it is more affordable than shutterstock. the minimum credit package is more affordable at istock. shutterstock offers the smallest package with 2 images at $29, you can get a 1 credit package for only $15.
credit balances are changing. if you have remaining credits on your account, they will be adjusted at a 5:1 conversion rate, rounding up in your favor. for instance you have 18 credits left on your account. it will be divided into 5, so 18 divided by 5 equals 3. the remainder 3 credits will be round up. ultimately, you will get 4.
pricing will no longer be based on size. contrary to now, there will be no size-based pricing. you can choose any size that fits your creative project for the same prize. you can also upgrade your downloads from small to large after the change.

the changes on istock credits are now on effect. it gives you a better value, even for a higher price. you will be able to download any image size at the same price. the only difference in prices will happen in the kind of collection. whatever you choose, always go back to the ultimate rule in buying stock images: choose and purchase a package that fits your creative needs and budget.

dollar photo club closed now, what’s the best alternative?

 march 18, 2016 markdollar photo club no comments  



on april 15, 2016, the dollar photo club will no longer be up for business. it will have terminated all its services, taking away members’ access to their collection, member area and purchase history. with only less than a month to operate, the stock site no longer allows updating of billing information which means no renewals are being processed. thus, you should not expect any bill charged on your payment method.
with the dollar photo club closed, it is time to sign up with a better alternative. surely, there are a number of stock photo websites in the market. but, do all of them suit your creative needs? while most of them offer millions of high quality images, not all have affordable image on demand and subscription rates. only 99 club by stock photo secrets offers the same kind of product as dpc: premium quality images at a very low price.
here are some similarities and differences between the dpc and 99 club:

the dollar photo club has over 25 million stock images in its library, while the 99 club has over 4 million. however, the latter is continually growing by adding 60,000 to 80,000 new images to its collection.
the dollar photo club is known to offer $1 per image, which means you get 100 images for $100. on the other hand, 99 club offers 200 premium quality images for only $99 which is double the number of image downloads of dpc. furthermore, you can get extra images for only $0.99 per image if you exceed the yearly subscription limit.
with the 99 club, you do not need to worry about cancelling your subscription before it ends. the stock has no auto-renew feature.
sadly, the dollar photo club is closing due to adobe stock’s acquisition of the website. the 99 club is not related to it or fotolia. it is associated with stock photo secrets, which has been around for over 10 years – meaning 99 club is here to stay.
both offers high quality images with royalty-free license and the appropriate licenses so you can use them in any project, commercially and non-commercially, for as long as you like.
they also have everlasting feature, which means your downloads will never expire.
they also let you choose any image size from small to xxl, whichever fits your creative projects.
they both offer images at a straightforward price. there are no additional fees or commitments to worry of.



in conclusion, the dollar photo club and 99 club are alike in many great things, but the latter offers more value for your money. with twice the number of downloads and a cheaper rate, 99 club is the perfect dollar photo club alternative for expired members. sign up now before the limited offer ends.
