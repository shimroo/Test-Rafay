vbuzzer messenger



vbuzzer is an unique instant messenger that combines voip, internet fax, rss, and multi protocol with windows live, yahoo, aol, icq instant messengers. while we all know a few other "all-in-ones" out there, none offers the same "all-in-one" to the extent vbuzzer offers (voip+fax+rss+multi protocol).i like vbuzzer's robustness, stability and clearness. noticing it didn't embed the gips engine as everyone else have done, vbuzzer still achieves great voice quality in all network conditions that can rival skype, if not better. the multi-protocol imfunction is also my favorite daily tool.you can download vbuzzer here.
