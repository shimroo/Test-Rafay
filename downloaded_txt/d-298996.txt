mathe-magical possums üíôyears: 3 and 4teacher: mrs uttingstudents have been focusing on developing their mathematical fluency skills. to support this, we incorporate a variety of physical tools, such as dice, cards, whiteboards (especially our ever popular whiteboard table!), dominoes, counters, and timers. these resources help reinforce key concepts and make learning interactive and fun.students work independently or collaborate with a partner to play educational games like 10's go fish, race to 100, and timed calculation races. these activities allow students to practice and strengthen their basic skills in a hands-on, dynamic way. by enhancing their fluency with these foundational concepts, students will be better prepared for success as they tackle more complex and exciting mathematical challenges in the coming lessons.
