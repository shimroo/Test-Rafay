i made sure to catch a picture of the 24 hour security guard at the hotel, some of the graffiti and beach vendors and their ships to try and give a tiny glimpse of the poverty there, though these photos don't really convey it.most the pictures are of people attending, and some glimpses of beautiful beaches and settings.bali photoslabels: bali photos

  				saturday, december 08, 2007 |


at bali numerous researchers and investigators from germany's axel michaelowa towalden bello to larry lohmann and beyond have made the case that the unfccc's clean development mechanism or cdm has not only failed but is harming communities and fostering underdevelopment in the developing world; thereby directly contravening its mission: "to assist the developing country host parties in achieving sustainable                           development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the convention."as the climate action network or can increasingly becomes a rest-stop for ngo-reps en route to climate market finance and consulting jobs, the network is now backing a proposal of piecemeal cdm reforms. see the full memo: "can cdm position paper for cop13/ copmop3, bali 2007"
