summer mix iii
  this is the opposite of sa's mix from last week. too big, too disjointed, no flow, and no theme other than "stuff i like". not much of it is from 2011, either. but i am a noted arbiter of taste* and so you can trust me and whatever future mixes i might endeavor to make. 1. z factor - i am the deejay!2. milk music - beyond living3. cuffs - archer4. home - my friend maurice5. mountains - sequel6. crystal stilts - sycamore tree7. nrbq - i want you bad8. reading rainbow - always on my mind9. further - quiet riot grrrl10. ultimate spinach - mind flowers11. iceage - you're blessed12. thomas jefferson slave apartments - cheater's heaven13. times new viking - fuck her tears14. reports - arrows15. cinema red and blue - you're gonna screw my head off16. the chills - rolling moon17. archers of loaf - telepathic traffic18. 18th dye - easy (& how we got there 1st) download it here. *: noted by me, of course.

summer mix ii
 here's mine. sorry for the brevity - i was really limiting the sound palette.  really going for a theme.  really going for a mean cohesion.  striving for the mix. all of these songs are from 2011. 1. roommates - elsie dormer2. cut/copy - take me over3. dominant legs - hoop of love4. geoffrey o'connor - whatever leads me to you5. blue harvest - the follow through6. melted toys - come on7. crush - i need you8. summer camp - better off without you9. hooray for earth & twin shadow - a place we like download herelabels: songs
