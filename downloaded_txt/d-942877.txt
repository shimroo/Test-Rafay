 things i am doing to remain sane:1). finished the second edition of my saloon book (reformatted, read twice for typos, new index).2). working on my next book, food in territorial tucson. finishing it, researching odds and ends.3). watching dark shadows. during covid i purchased the complete box set. at the moment it is the phoenix storyline.4). playing with my pets and doug's new puppy.5). spending as much time as possible with my husband matt, attempting to distract him from the awful things are happening.^). wishing every day that the orange monster and the south african nazi would just drop dead.

we went to new orleans in january so that i could present a poster at the sha conference. i saw two people i knew there, including ralph who i worked with in 2009-2010. i carried along 13 pounds of historical archaeological material, which i was able to get rid of.ralph watching me hand out things.matt had gone days earlier than me to visit with his sister lorie and her family, as well as friend amy. lorie, j. o., and oliver had attended our wedding. it was nice to see them and meet amy. outside of the conference we went to a history museum, walked through very expensive antique stores, and went to the horse races on lorie's birthday. we also took the ferry across the river and went to the aquarium, i was very impressed by that. fishes! also penguins. fish.jellyfish.doug got a puppy, a mix between a pug and a chihuahua. his name is rowan but i call him doug jr. he is very cute. ruby is terrified of him, perhaps because he runs around like crazy.doug jr.january 20th happened and it has been a shit-show ever since. watching white, christian nationalism envelope our government. so far it has not affected my job, but i know that environmental laws will be targeted next after they eliminate all protections for lgbt, black, native american, and other minorities. i have been pretty depressed. i have avoided all traditional news media, just read the headlines of what joemygod posts. facebook and instagram are run by a homophobic piece of shit, so no fun to go on there. to keep my sanity i have focused on my next book- food in territorial tucson. have managed to put together over 400 pages since november 18.

i used to be nice, at least i thought so. i felt that americans mostly got along, they we shared common goals. i thought when obama was elected in 2008 that the united states had turned a corner.wrong. obama's election opened a floodgate of white rage. the boomers and their parents mostly hated the idea that an african american was president. here in arizona the hate was directed towards mexican americans. i remember when tom horne and the legislature banned history books that talked about the experience of mexican americans in tucson.and so 70 million americans voted for the orange rapist. he is insane. a racist. they keep handing him pieces of paper to sign. who knows if he understands what he is signing.ten of the last 11 recessions have been under republican presidents. the likelihood that a fucking piece of shit who went bankrupt six times despite being handed $400 million will cause another? almost certain. they have been going after dei and trans people. and immigrants. lgb people are next. they non-christians. the nazi parallels are out there in the open for everyone to see. elon musk and orange felon both admire hitler.wonder how bad things are going to get.

well it is new year's eve and i need to post photos. whenever we go to joann's or that home store i make matt pose for a picture.wreath.matt and i hosted a cookie decorating party on the 15th. i got up and locked the kittens in the cat bathroom so that i could finish decorating. i set out the ceramic trees and the plastic canvas village on the former tv stand.tv stand.    on the coffee table i put the ikea tree with hand-made ornaments. childhood toys were placed around it.i had the black gi joe. mother saved the box.i had four trees in the dining room. the real tree smelled so nice and was covered with figurative ornaments.real tree.in the corner was the red tree with crocheted snowflakes. next to it was the flocked tree with shiny brite ornaments from the 1950s and 1960s.shiny brite tree.a bunch of new ornaments from target were on top of the china cabinet.a big crowd showed up for the party. i had made better homes and garden sugar and gingerbread cookies. also had finger foods- potato chips with onion dip, corn chips with salsa, deviled eggs (got eaten up quickly), crudite and ranch dressing (don't bother next year), little pickles and garlic-stuffed olives, cheese platter, and eggnog (don't bother with non-alcohol next year).this year i bought squeeze bottles at the dollar store. made about 8 or 9 colors of icing. it worked so much better than using sandwich bags.decorating.most of the cookies got decorated. they looked nice on my antique platters.after the party ended we moved all of the living room decorations into the dining room. i have been going in there and just looking at all of the pretty things. matt and i had gone to the 22nd street ace hardware early in december and a staff person told me santa had stopped by. matt was dubious about us posing, but i insisted. it was the first time i had a formal santa photo.homer, santa, and matt.it was a nice holiday. we opened presents and i got matt a pair of bridegroom ornaments, one brunette (me!) and one blonde (matt!). he laughed when i told him i paid full price for the brunette and the blonde was on sale.

so the day after the election matt and i got married. we had decided a few months ago that we needed to be married before the supreme court made some vile decision. having an existing marriage contract would hopefully prevent our civil rights being taken away.we invited a small number of people to the presidio museum and were married in the territorial courtyard in front of the arbor. i only cried a little as i read my vows. it was a sweet ceremony.i had patrick as my witness and matt had his sister laurie. other folks there: doug, jeffrey, john g., paul, david, john, oliver, juan, lynn, lisa, amy, kate, ginger, and wolf.getting hitched.afterwards we went to la indita for lunch (i  had the usual). matt had ordered a cake from nadine's/cake.it was white cake with the top layer having lemon filling and the bottom raspberry. it was sweet and delicious.homer and matt cutting the cake.we are planning a big reception on the first of march.

recording my thoughts. well the election was weeks ago. and the shit show is going full force. incompetent sycophants being put in positions of power. the project 2025 fever dream coming true. fucking evil christians will be telling the rest of us how to live.i was given a bottle of champagne. i am saving it for the day that orange monster dies. hope to drink it sooner rather than later.two weeks ago an archaeologist i knew, not very well, died unexpectedly. he was 56. life is cruel, he was a very nice man. deserved to have a long life.my kittens are now huge. how did that happen? puff likes to knock things over. he also likes to watch birds on the computer. he is friendlier than smokey bear, who is pretty shy. i have had to modify my holiday decoration scheme because they would destroy whatever i put up. the day of the cookie decorating party they will be locked up in the cat bathroom and the last few decorations put out, to be taken down immediately after the party.puff in the window.matt and i went to world market, michael's, and joanns, as well as the gather market and bought ornaments. it was good to think about other things than politics.new ornaments.i make matt pose for ridiculous pictures when we go to those stores.matt and homer.

so the orange piece of fucking shit won. i don't think i have ever hated someone as much as i hate him.when bad things happen to his supporters in the next four years, i hope they suffer. really suffer. anyone who voted for him, they deserve everything that is coming their way.the last 12 recessions have all started under republican presidents. i imagine another one will be here soon, because republicans are only good at stirring up hatred towards minorities and giving rich people more money.so anyways, end of rant.

i took matt back to traverse city to meet the family. the leaves were changing and everyone said that they were better the week before, but they were still spectacular.homer and matt in front of a red bush.we took susan and lee to a horrible mexican restaurant the first night.the next day we went to sleeping bear national lakeshore. this park service lakeshore has massive sand dunes dumped there by glaciers. plus pretty woods. matt wanted to climb up one of the dunes. it was chilly.matt climbs.matt stuck his i phone out the window and took this fancy photograph. i said it looked like a puzzle picture.covered bridge.we finally found the place where you could stand on a deck overlooking lake michigan and see the crazy steep 400-ft dune, which ends at the lake. we did not go down it.matt, susan, and homer.the next day we to the amish produce market where my brother works. he was working at the butcher plant. we also dropped off some enormous bags of cat food and dog food for the many cats living in his barn. people dropped off two boxes of kittens at the produce market and my brother took them home. matt said no! when he saw me holding a couple.squash and pumpkins.that afternoon we went to visit elizabeth and jeff and their dog bowser. on saturday there was a family lunch at lee's house. my two aunts and my uncle on my father's side came. i made a fruit salad and a cheese and cracker dish. lots of food. lee made two pies- delicious.afterward matt got to go on an amish buggy ride with lee while i visited with my aunts.the horse and buggy.but first we went out into the pasture to see jemima and jean.jemina and jean and matt. after the buggy ride it was time for matt to collect eggs from the chicken coop. i caught one of the hens.matt, hen, and homer.nice to meet you.matt collecting eggs.then matt took a family photo, minus lee who is amish.uncle bill, jeff, aunt harriet, elizabeth, aunt louann, susan, and homer.we went to a couple of antique stores and i bought a bunch of photos (pricey!).the next day we returned to tucson and i started preparing for the all soul's procession cocktail party.we wore masks on the airplanes and did not catch covid.i'm writing this on election day. back in traverse city and the countryside you saw a lot of campaign signs. mostly for trump out in the country (including some flags) and mostly for harris in downtown traverse city. we saw a pride flag at a cheese shop and that was where i bought the cheese for the party, making sure the staff knew that was why. there were numerous other pride flags hanging from front porches in the downtown area. and a "gays for harris" sign where you turn to go to susan's house.i think matt has a really good time and my family all really liked him, so yeah!

this is the third year in a row that i have taught a paper flower and floral crown making workshop. i do it as a fund raiser for the presidio museum. i teach four easy ways to make a paper flower using tissue paper and pipe cleaners. the people have a really fun time and at the end they attach the flowers to a head band and create a crown. this year i was asked to pose in the picture. look at the smiles!i gave my flowers to the ladies.i also gave a lecture and two tours of the court street cemetery this weekend. in all i raised over $800 for the museum.next month i will have another lecture and a book signing. then things cool off for a while.

 25 years and one month. i paid off my mortgage today. four years and 11 months early. i guess paying $400 or $500 extra the last couple of years was worth it.all paid for.now time to start saving up to fix some things. a new bathroom for the guest house. new electricity. floors worked on. ac for the two houses. paint for both (maybe stucco for the guest house).so strange to think i will have about $850 each month to do other things with.

i drove across town for this amazing estate sale. just jam-packed with antiques, the kind of stuff you never see in tucson. i bought a painting, cookie cutters, and two transferprint dishes.a winter painting.antique cookie cutters. the kittens are allowed full access to the house. clyde has decided that they are okay to hang out with, just don't get too close! they are busy being naught. library books are apparently delicious. plants had to be taken outside or put way up since leaves were so much fun to pull off. yesterday i came home and discovered the large front window broken, the glass lying outside. i am guessing ruby chased one of the kittens into the window. $79 to replace. sigh.smokey bear, clyde, and puff j. junior.matt and i went down to the pima county courthouse to get a marriage license.matt and homer.for the presidio museum's annual meeting i made two cakes. a gluten-free hummingbird cake and a chocolate mayonnaise cake with lingonberry filling. both were delicious, i liked the chocolate cake more.and i turned 61. how did that happen? i celebrated by staying home from work, gave myself a haircut, did some genealogy, played with the cats. matt took me to zemam's for ethiopian food last night. it was delicious.version 61.

 two weeks ago warren sent me a message to tell me his husband paul had died unexpectedly. paul was one of the early group of gay bloggers and podcasters. i visited with him several times when i was in the dc area. we made a lemon meringue pie together one time, i well remember his worry about cleanup (his place was immaculate). during a podcast he ate a blueberry for charity (paul had arfid, an avoidant food intake disorder). he screamed when he discovered blueberries had seeds inside. we had a good time with that.the last time i saw him in person was in 2006. we went to the us botanical gardens together and then to a winery with his then boyfriend, later husband warren. at the wineries i pretended to know more about wine than i actually did. we followed each other on social media and i always sent him a homer-made holiday card (he requested no glitter).paul and homer.he was one of the nicest men i have ever met, a real pleasure to be around. i feel so sad for warren, i hope he finds some comfort in the memories they had together.
