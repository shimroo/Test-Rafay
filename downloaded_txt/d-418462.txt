on the ross campuses in east hampton and bridgehampton, buildings and classrooms are intentionally and systematically designed based upon research in how students learn and how our brains develop. the curriculum is woven into the design of spaces through the use of art and artifacts, which act as a visual and experiential text and are a core component of students’ educational experiences at ross.



















integration





interdisciplinarity and integration are central to the ross model



students integrate concepts, theories, and methods from multiple disciplines, deepening their understanding of a topic. students acquire discipline-specific understandings and produce a synthesis across disciplines that allows them to explain concepts and solve problems of greater complexity.

student & alumni testimonials










“having access to amazing teachers and amazing professionals makes such a difference in letting students find their voice.”
— kinara flaggross school '02columbia law school '11






“to have this perspective and mode of thinking really sheds new light onto topics that we’ve looked at in the same way for a very long time.”
— kate nelsonross school '13stanford university '17






“ross was really the greatest factor in who i am now. there’s really no other way to put it. i’ve been places, i’ve met people, experienced things, seen technology, done things that i just never would have been exposed to. i hope that the message, the community, and the vision continue to grow and inspire people worldwide.”
— martial toussaintross school '01brown university '05






“if ross school was not in my life, i would be a completely different person. it taught me how to be independent; it taught me how to go after things that i believe in. i don’t think i would have had those things in my life if it wasn’t for the school.”
— nicole mabeyross school '01new york university '05






"ross provides a system of education that provides students with the tools to make their own convictions rather than teaching a finite set of rules. this allows students to foster their interests and develop as intellectuals—and more importantly, as people. through an emphasis on the continuum of learning, ross provides students with the tools to be successful and innovative thinkers wherever they go.”
— max g.ross school ‘25






"attending ross was an experience that shaped my respect for other cultures and differences and cultivated my fascination with geopolitics and languages. i have carried these lessons forward at yale as i communicate with friends in chinese, share my perspectives in my international relations of the middle east class, and conduct research on sunni-shia tensions with yidds. ross’s interactive, integrated, and international curriculum was both my foundation and launch board to  a future as an emissary between nations."
— sienna galesi-grantross school '24yale university class of '28
