through 
				my practice i have found that reiki can accelerate

              one's

              	natural ability to heal; balance

              mind, body and spirit; relax,

              energize and renew; calm

              emotions and ease the mind; stimulate

              spiritual equilibrium; relieve

              stress and tension; support

              and catalyze change; and complement

              medical treatments and other methods of healing.  reiki
              training propels an

 individual onto a path of self-discovery and
              mastery.  first degree training is offered regularly, with
              second degree, third degree, and master training scheduled as needed.

for
        maximum holistic health benefits, it is recommended that if an
        individual is experiencing dis-ease,
        
        four
        treatments be received over a period of one week, or less.  each reiki
        treatment lasts about one hour.  




					 




 


"...within
        the infinity of the many is always the signature of the all"

david

"in forgiveness lies the stoppage 
		of the wheel of action, or what you call karma."

"...the
        cosmic calling we humans have will not be denied forever,
        despite the ignorance of religious institutions.
        the holy spirit will simply move on to new forms,
        leaving fossils behind."

"know
        whatever comes to you unexpected to be a gift from god,

which
        will surely serve you if you use it to the fullest.

 it
        is only that which you strive for out of your own imagination,

that
        gives you trouble."

brandon
        bays


"the
        eye, with which i see god, sees me;
        my eye and god's eye is one eye, one seeing
        one realizing and one love"

johannes
        eckhart (c.
        1260-1327)
german mystic
        and dominican monk


reiki
        is "... universal life energy.  it is not a religion.... 
 this
        great source which surrounds us - the universe.
 there is endless
        and enormous energy.  it is universal....
        its ultimate source is
        the creator.... it is nature.
        it is god, the power he makes
        available to his children"

hawayo
        takata
"reiki
        news" - 1975


"we
        can make our mind so like still water that beings
        gather about us to see their own images, and so for a moment
        live a clearer, perhaps even fiercer, life because of our quiet."

w.
        b. yeats
 


"men
        grind and grind in the mill of a truism, and nothing comes out but what
        was put in.  but the moment they desert the tradition for a
        spontaneous thought, then poetry, wit, hope, virtue, learning, anecdote,
        all flock to their aid."

ralph
        waldo emerson





"this is one way of designating in 
		your own consciousness who is of christ force and who is of the 
		anti-christ force.  you will see many, who will cry out that there 
		is no god, come and fight shoulder to shoulder with you for peace and 
		love and brotherhood equally for all men for all time.  this is 
		truly one who is of the christ force.  yet you will see others, who 
		profess to be of god, speaking words of god, who will say that some are 
		to be saved and some are to be damned.  these you will know are not 
		of the christ light, for the christ light speaks of brotherhood first 
		and foremost and will defend the right of all men everywhere to share 
		equally with their brothers."








nada-yolanda,

"our
            deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.  our deepest fear
            is that we are powerful beyond measure.  it is our light, not
            our darkness that most frightens us.  we ask ourselves, 'who am
            i to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?'  actually,
            who are you not to be?

you
            are a child of god.  your playing small doesn't serve the
            world.  there's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that
            people won't feel insecure around you.  we are meant to shine,
            as children do.  we were born to make manifest the glory of god
            that is within us.  it's not just in some of us: it's in
            everyone.  and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously
            give other people permission to do the same.  as we're
            liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates
            others."

"an
        authentically empowered personality naturally creates
        harmony, cooperation, sharing and reverence for life."
