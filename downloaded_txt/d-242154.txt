welcome to the cat fanciers’ federation’s website.   the cat fanciers’ federation, also known as cff,  is one of the oldest feline registries in the united states.  cff does stand for cat fanciers’ federation, but in our case we are happy that it can also stand for cats, family and friends, because that is what we are all about – our cats, being good friends, and being one big family!  we hope you enjoy your visit.  if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us.
the office staff is ready to assist you regarding any questions concerning the registration of cats, competitive status of any cat, etc. you can reach cff at cffinc@live.com
