newer stuff
july of 2020 a scan showed cancer in the pancreas. unexpectedly i retired jan of 2021. having never thought about retirement, i found myself looking for stuff to do. i spent the past 20+ years working on an assortment of websites. i spent the most time on brentwoodhigh.com followed by kedigh.com. 
what i'm doing now.
1. programming a dice baseball game from childhood.
	    2. convert family super 8 videos and vhs to digital format.
	    3. work on my websites.
