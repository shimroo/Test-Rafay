royal filled pauses
 
				february 16, 2025 @ 5:24 am 
· filed by mark liberman under phonetics and phonology, sociolinguistics


in a comment on "yair" (2/14/2025), philip taylor asserted that he routinely pronounces the orthographic "r" in the typical british filled-pause spelling "er":
« some americans adopt a mistaken spelling pronunciation, rendering "er" with a final [r] » — well, speaking as a briton, my "er" pauses, if prolonged, also end with an phoneme, although where exactly in the mouth i produce it i cannot be sure. certainly it is totally unlike the trilled/r/ with which i might say "run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run run run", but i think that it might be fairly close to the phoneme in my maigret or rien de rien.
if philip actually trills the /r/'s in "run, rabbit, run", and he's not from scotland, this is a big dialectological surprise. and it's equally unexpected if he produces something like a french uvular /r/ at the end of his filled pauses. more likely, this is an extreme example of why sociolinguists are skeptical of how people think they talk.
still, it's worth a bit of time to confirm the oed's r-less assertion (audio) about british filled-pause pronunciation. this would be a big task, overall,  given the wide range of british speech across geographical, social, ethnic, and temporal variables, so i thought i'd start with the royal family. (and i'll also end there, unless philip's peculiar perceptions return in another form…)

"thanks" in hakka and other sinitic topolects
 
				february 15, 2025 @ 9:26 pm 
· filed by victor mair under translation


i forget who it was and for what reason, but a week or two ago, someone said "thank you" in hakka to me.
that got me thinking about all the different ways to say "thanks" in sinitic languages.
here's a map of sinitic topolectal equivalents for msm (modern standard mandarin) "xièxie 謝謝 / 谢谢" (“thank you”).  if you click on the place names in characters at the bottom of the map, pinyin romanizations will be supplied.
bear in mind that european-style  words of etiquette such as "hello" and "thanks" did not exist in china before the 20th century.  for the impact of english on the development of such spoken mandarin civilities, see mary s. erbaugh, "china expands its courtesy:  saying 'hello' to strangers," the journal of asian studies, 67.2 (may, 2008), 621-652.

having just a couple of months ago burrowed my way into the center of one of the world's most famous neolithic barrows, more specifically a passage tomb at newgrange (ca. 3200 bc, older than stonehenge, which i had visited the previous week, and the egyptian pyramids, which i have yet to behold in person) in county meath, ireland with j. p. mallory, indo-european archeolinguist and author of in search of the irish dreamtime:  archaeology and early irish literature (london: thames & hudson, 2016), all 6'7" of him and 6'2" of me, making it a difficult crawl / squeeze for the two of us, i was keen to read this article:

"måke califørnia great ægain"

in response to the initiative for the u,s.  to buy (or otherwise acquire) greenland from denmark, some danes have started a petition to buy california from the u.s.
have you ever looked at a map and thought, "you know what denmark needs? more sunshine, palm trees, and roller skates." well, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make that dream a reality.
let’s buy california from donald trump!
yes, you heard that right.
california could be ours, and we need your help to make it happen.

greece without the greek alphabet
 
				february 13, 2025 @ 7:56 am 
· filed by victor mair under alphabets, phonetics and phonology


heaven forbid!
"when greece was about to swap the greek alphabet for latin", philip chrysopoulos, greek reporter (1/17/25)
it seems unthinkable.
in the mid 1970s when prime minister konstantinos karamanlis proposed changing the greek alphabet to latin and making the greek language phonetic, the minister of culture and a parliament member threatened to resign.
i don't know why anyone would say the greek alphabet is not phonetic.  in general, its letters correspond to consistent sounds, making pronunciation of its words relatively predictable.  both in ancient greek and in modern greek, most letters of the alphabet have a stable symbol-to-sound relationship.
the unusual idea of the conservative pm came as a shock to those who learned of his proposal. it was quite unexpected coming from him.

"steak the first"
 
				february 11, 2025 @ 9:11 pm 
· filed by victor mair under borrowing, grammar, syntax


[an essay i wrote a year and a half ago, but whose posting was interrupted by a long run.]
enlightening article by peter backhaus in the japan times (6/9/23):
"za grammar notes: how to properly handle the 'the' in japanese"
japanese seems to be able to assimilate any english word, including the ubiquitous definite article "the", which is unlike anything in japanese itself.

if there’s something like a murphy’s law for syntax, the name of this restaurant near my school is a pretty good example of it. reading “steak the first,” it always makes me wonder how these three words came to be aligned in just that order. “the first steak,” “first the steak,” “the steak first” — all of these seem safe for consumption. but “steak the first”?

prc foreign minister wang yi's not-so-subtle reprimand falls on deaf ears
 
				february 10, 2025 @ 8:52 am 
· filed by victor mair under idioms, language and politics, lost in translation


seldom does a matter of correct / precise translation go viral the way these words of chinese foreign minister wang yi to american secretary of state marco rubio did:  "hǎo zì wéi zhī 好自为之".  the set phrase ("chéngyǔ 成語") has been rendered scores of different ways, most of them dismissive or pejorative.
why wang yi’s message to marco rubio may have been lost in translation:
there has been much discussion about how to interpret an idiom used by china’s foreign minister in talks with the us secretary of state

insidious and invidious
 
				february 9, 2025 @ 4:47 pm 
· filed by victor mair under etymology, usage, vocabulary


i've lost a considerable amount of sleep over these two words, not just because they both have nine letters and look almost the same, differing only by a single consonant, but even more so because, while they both signify something bad or undesirable about the way situations unfold or how people behave toward others, they imply the opposite in the manner these odious actions are carried out, but have no obvious clues about their usage.

kiddo slang at warp speed
 
				february 7, 2025 @ 11:04 am 
· filed by victor mair under changing times, language change, slang


"mewing, beta maxing, gigachad, baddie: parents are drowning in new lingo", katherine bindley, wsj (2/5/25)
slang is sprouting at a dizzying speed, leaving adults constantly unsure if they’re being insulted; ‘omega is like the lowest rate you can get’
the article includes many examples of parents from diverse backgrounds and various locations confronting this flood of juvenile jargon.  here i give only one instance:
cecilia hermawan has text chains going with other parents to stay up to speed on the words and phrases catching on among their children. still, the boston-area resident was taken aback after hearing the word “mewing” come out of her 9-year-old’s mouth.
“i didn’t know what it meant so i had to google it, and i had to ask my friend emily to reference check,” said hermawan, 41.
the startup founder was relieved her daughter and her friend were referring to a type of facial exercise and not something inappropriate. “you look at yourself in the mirror and you mew,” she said. “it’s supposed to enhance your jawline.”
incidentally, out of the half a dozen or so cases of confused guardians cited by bindley, two are identified as a "startup founder", a designation i had heard of before and had an idea of what it meant, but recognized it as representing a certain type of person who is full of aspiration and audacity.  maybe the environment and mentality fostered by such individuals would be conducive to speedily mutating hip parlance on the part of their offspring.
