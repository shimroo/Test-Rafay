  47 children are diagnosed with cancer every day in the usa and only 4% of federal research dollars goes towards research for childhood cancers.
in 1981 at age 10, bonnie realized the word "cancer" was not only traumatic but terrifying.
she wanted to make a difference by creating an organization raising money to help other families! today, her family, friends, and community continue her dream and vision. stop children’s cancer was created to fill a critical need by funding directly to research for cures of childhood cancers. stop children's cancer impacts outcomes! when bonnie was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all), the cure rate was about 35%.
today, the cure rate is over 90%!
