numero uno





my first blog post on blogger.com.  we'll see how long this lasts. today was pretty dang good.  sun was shining (in the afternoon anyway),  people were talking, life is good.  actually, today rocked!  due to a book sale at a homeschool co-op that i was sent to for work i got to see several friends that i really haven't seen enough of since graduation almost 2 years ago!  mel and i talked for about 3 hours!  i was kind of working at the time.  i managed to sell $350 worth of stuff during that time.  more than i would have made had i really been working at the store!   reconnecting is awesome!  good times, good times.anyway, i should probably be getting to bed as i must work in the morning.  g'night!
