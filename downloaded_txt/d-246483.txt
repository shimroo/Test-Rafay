great views and perfect private beach entrance716 lakeview ave, south lake tahoe, ca, 96150, united states date of stay aug 9, 2018 helpful votes: 0/0 we had a great time!! the views were perfect which gave us a nice scene for morning yoga. the yard was a great size which made morning boot camp easy to setup. the location was setup wjth enough supplies to give you the feeling of home. the private beach entrance was just a short walk from the house. fun for all in this beautiful home.
