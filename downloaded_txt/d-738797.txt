saraâs daughters ministry 

    1 peter 3:1, âlikewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; 
    that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the 
    conversation of the wives.â


planting of the seed


god planted the seed in my heart 
back in 1982.  there were ten years of wilderness experiences where god 
dealt with me mightily, teaching me biblical principles and giving me opportunities 
to apply those principles to my life daily.  there was also a time of preparation, 
going through nationalâs ministerial internship program and the national bible 
college.  finally, a period of separation and development when god sent 
me to rhema bible training center to gain the practical ministry i needed to 
fulfill the vision and purpose he had given to me.  now, i am ready to 
go forth and i solicit prayers from all of you, my church family.

vision of the ministry
god showed me in 
a vision a harvest full of unsaved men.  all of these men were married.  
many were married to saved, holy ghost filled women that god wants to use in 
these last and evil days to draw lost husbands into the kingdom. 
âthe harvest is truly plenteous, but the laborers 
are few.â  (matthew 9:37)
god desires that 
none should perish but that all should come to repentance.  
âpray ye therefore the lord of the harvest, that he will send 
forth laborers into his harvest.â  (matthew 9:38)

my prayer is that god will 
raise up, in these last days, more first peter three wives who will stand on 
his word and believe, too, that their husbands may be won by their conversation.

the believing women of the old 
testament who hoped to be the human channel for the messiah to come into the 
world made themselves beautiful by being in subjection to their own husbands.  
this is supremely illustrated in the relationship between sara and abraham.  
wives are exhorted to do what sara did, to be in subjection to their husbands, 
letting the consequences rest with god and, thus, become saraâs daughters.

this may not be difficult for 
wives who are married to believers.  even though you may have problems 
and donât always see things eye to eye, thatâs to be expected.  the one 
thing you both have in common is the word of god and with that, you can 
work through your differences.  for the wife who is married to an unbeliever, 
however, this can be a very awkward and difficult responsibility.  as a believer, 
god commands her to submit to her husband who is not obeying the 
word.  this is where the test begins.

the scriptural support for the 
ministry is 1 peter 3:1, which reads âlikewise, ye wives, 
be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they 
also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives.â

while saraâs daughters is directed 
predominantly to women whose husbands are unbelievers, it can also be beneficial 
to single women contemplating marriage, 
and to women who are married to believers. 

purpose of the ministry 


1.  
to provide a setting where women can share and interact, without embarrassment, 
with christian sisters of like circumstances.




2.  
to minister to the special needs of wives who are believing god for their husbands 
salvation.

3.  
to provide a base for initial biblical instruction.

  first peter three wives.

  understand their role and spiritual responsibilities.



receive 
  practical instruction in the application of scripture.



4.  to give participants 
an opportunity to give advice about problems they face.

5.  to be a source of prayer 
support. 

6.  to help the wife direct 
her attention toward jesus christ and his plan for her life, and away from her 
problems and marriage situation.

goal and objectives of the ministry

1.  the goal of the ministry 
is to encourage women who are believing god for their husbandâs salvation to 
look at their behavior in the marriage to ensure that they are not a hindrance 
to godâs plan for their husbandâs lives. 


2.  the objectives of the 
ministry are threefold.



for wives to look at 
their behavior in the marriage and through a systematic study in the word, 
allow god to bring their will in line with his will.

with others, providing strength and support to one another.
