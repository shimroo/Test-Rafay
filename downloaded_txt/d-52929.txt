leslie kerxton
may 7, 1941 – january 21, 2025

it is with profound sadness that i inform you of the passing of our beloved leslie kerxton. leslie and i started working together in 1988 and she was my first employee when i opened visions marketing in november of 1990.
over the next 30+ years leslie was instrumental in guiding the visions team into a multi-million-dollar organization. from the days of mci, the nba and apple computer to countless other companies, it was leslie who kept us grounded and fueled the excitement of coming to work each day. the day would start with her grandé americano as we reviewed what was on the agenda and would often end with a tito’s on the rocks, with extra olives, to discuss “what’s next”. for 8 continuous years, wednesday evenings were capped off with me trying to explain (during every commercial break) exactly what was happening on the west wing. she would say, “well they’re talking too fast”. to which my response was, “try listening slow!”.
my dad nicknamed us “the dynamic duo” and there was nothing that was going to stop us from achieving the “vision” we set out to accomplish. i would often wonder, who exactly worked for whom??? but deep down we all knew (employee’s and client’s alike) …
leslie was the real boss!
at our pinnacle, we had 22 employees and occupied over 10,000 square feet of office and warehouse space. through all of the inevitable ups and downs over the last 35 years, leslie stood resolute with me. even last week when i visited with her, she asked how business was going and what kind of projects i was working on. for 30 years, we traveled to dallas, atlantic city and las vegas for our annual industry trade shows. and for 30 years, each time we walked through the doors and onto the show floor i would put my arm around her, kiss her cheek and say, “thanks for helping us get here”.
through marriage, the birth of my son, divorce, marriage again, the births of grandchildren and all the laughter and tears in between, leslie was by my side. she was so much more then my business partner … she was truly my best friend.
