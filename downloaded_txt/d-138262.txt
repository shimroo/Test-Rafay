making financial services meet the needs of the world’s most vulnerable
people living in poverty constantly juggle an evolving set of risks and crises in their daily lives. climate change, the pandemic, and the ongoing food crisis, among others, have increased these risks substantially, contributing to a rise in global poverty and inequality. meanwhile, a third of the world’s adult population lacks the financial services they could use to significantly improve their lives. cgap is working to change this, and we believe that positive trends in inclusive finance offer hope for a green, resilient, and inclusive future.
