taralli napoletani: neapolitan salty ring cookiesin  southern italy, taralli come in many sizes and flavors. these are  typical neapolitan ones sometimes referred to in neapolitan dialect as scaldatelli – little boiled things.makes about 30 taralli













3/4 cup warm water, about 110˚f2 1/2 teaspoons (1 envelope) active dry yeast1/4 cup olive oil3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (spoon flour into dry-measure cup and level off)2 teaspoons salt1 tablespoon fennel seeds1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper2 large rectangular cooling racks, turned upside down and lightly oiledfor the dough, pour the water into a bowl and whisk in the yeast. whisk in the oil.put the remaining ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. pulse several times to mix. add the liquid and pulse again until the dough forms a ball. let the processor run continuously for about 10 seconds to knead the dough.invert the dough to an oiled bowl and carefully remove the blade. turn the dough over so that the top is oiled and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. let the dough rise at room temperature until it doubles in bulk, about 1 hour.after the dough has risen, scrape it out of the bowl to a lightly floured work surface and use a bench scraper or knife to cut it into 2 equal pieces. roll each piece of dough under the palms of your hand to a 6-inch cylinder. roll one of the cylinders to a 5-inch length and cut into 1-inch pieces. repeat with the remaining pieces of dough to make 30 equal pieces in all.one at a time, roll each piece of dough under the palms of your hands to make an 8-inch strand. join the ends together to make a circle, pressing firmly to seal. line up the formed taralli on a lightly floured work surface or floured jelly-roll pans, making sure they do not touch each other.set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375˚f.fill a large pot (such as one in which you would cook pasta) 3/4 full of water. bring the water to a full rolling boil. set one of the oiled cooling racks on the stovetop (put a pan under it to catch drips) next to the pan of boiling water. drop the taralli, 6 or 8 at a time, into the boiling water and remove them with a skimmer as soon as they float to the surface. arrange the taralli about 1 inch apart in all directions, on the prepared rack. repeat until all of the taralli have been boiled and arranged on the racks.bake the taralli until they are golden and crispy, about 30 minutes. about halfway through baking, move the rack from the upper third of the oven to the lower third, and the rack from the lower third to the upper third. cool the taralli on the racks they baked on.serving: the traditional accompaniment to taralli is a glass of wine. you may serve them as hors d’oeuvres or as a snack.storage:  after the taralli have cooled completely, store them in a tin or  plastic container with a tight-fitting cover. they last almost  indefinitely.sicilian semolina breadpane di semolina rimacinatathis bread cannot be made using granular semolina which is too coarse.  the correct ingredient is durum flour called semolina rimacinata (re-milled semolina) in italian.  durum flour and semolina rimacinata are both available online.one 15-inch long loaf













400 grams tepid water2 teaspoons/6 grams instant yeast1 teaspoon honey or malt syrup500 grams durum flour1 1/2 teaspoons/9 grams additive free fine sea saltsesame seeds for finishing.a cookie sheet or jellyroll pan cover with parchment whisk the water, yeast and honey together in the bowl of a stand mixer.  use a silicon spatula to stir in the flour, making sure to scrape away any flour clinging to the side of the bowl. place the bowl on the mixer with the dough hook and mix on low speed for 5 minutes.  increase the speed to medium and sprinkle in the salt; continue mixing for 2 minutes longer. scrape the dough to an oiled bowl and turn it over so that the top is oiled.  cover with plastic wrap or a towel and let the dough ferment for 1 hour. scrape the dough to a floured surface and give it a turn:  flatten the dough and fold one side over the middle and the other side over both; roll down from the top.  turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat.  return the dough smooth side upward to the bowl and cover. let ferment until fully double, about 45 minutes. invert smooth side downward to a lightly floured surface and gently press the dough to deflate.  roll down from the top to form a classic batard shape.  before reaching the end, fold the flap upward and pinch it into place.  invert the loaf, smooth side down, and keeping the middle the tallest point, roll gently with both hands toward the ends, gently pointing the ends.  carefully lift the loaf to the prepared pan and cover it; let the loaf proof until it is almost double, about 40 minutes. about 15 minutes before the loaf is fully risen, set racks in the middle and lower level of the oven and preheat to 550 degrees.  place a small pan (to hold water and make steam) on the bottom rack. use the blade to cut a slash down the length of the loaf.  spray the dough with water and carefully sprinkle the sesame seeds on the loaf, avoiding letting any fall into the scored area. place the pan in the oven, also adding water (avert your face) to the bottom pan. wait 5 minutes and spray again.  continue baking for 15 minutes. open the oven and decrease the temperature to 425 degrees.  continue baking until the loaf is dark golden and the internal temperature is 200 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes longer.  cool the loaf on a rack and serve the same day or wrap and freeze for longer storage.  reheat at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and cool before serving. focaccia alla barese, a typical seaside snack in bari almost everyone in bari has “the one and only really authentic and true” recipe for this:  some use a mix of all-purpose and durum flours, others use warm pureed potatoes in the dough, and some even suggest that the dough has to be leavened by sourdough starter. this is a delicious version with no claims to authenticity.one 10-inch diameter focaccia, about 6 servingsdough













200 grams warm water1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast255 grams unbleached bread flour1 teaspoon fine sea salttoppings1/3 cup thick tomato pureefine sea salt and dried oregano for sprinkling1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, rinsed and halved across the equator3/4 cup green castelvetrano olives, pitted and halved“emulsion”1/4 cup water3 tablespoons olive oilone 10-inch round pan, 2 inches deep, seasoned (see below) and generously oiled for the dough, whisk the yeast and water together in a mixing bowl; sprinkle the flour and salt over the water. use a rubber spatula to beat the dough for a minute, and then cover with plastic wrap. let the dough ferment until it is fully double.set a rack in the lowest level of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees.without deflating it too much, scrape the dough into the prepared pan. turn the dough over and press it into the pan.spread the tomato puree on the dough. sprinkle with salt and oregano.arrange the cherry tomato halves on the dough, squashing them slightly between your fingers before gently pressing them on the dough. make a couple of concentric circles with the tomatoes. make a couple of rows of olives in between.use a fork to beat the water and oil together and pour it just inside the pan and on all the perimeter of the focaccia.place the pan in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. decrease heat to 425 degrees, move the focaccia to the middle level, and continue baking until the focaccia is well done on the bottom and until some of the tomatoes have slightly charred, about 20 minutes longer.slide the focaccia from the pan to a rack to cool and serve at room temperature or reheat. nb:  generously brush the pan with olive oil and bake at 350 for 10 minutes to season.  cool the pan, wipe it well, and oil it again.checkerboard cookies these are as intriguing looking as they are easy to prepare.  use even light pressure when rolling the doughs and perfect checkerboards will be your reward.makes about 100 cookies1 batch vanilla sablé dough, below1 batch chocolate sablé dough, below1 large egg white, beaten with a fork until very liquid3 or 4 cookie sheets or jellyroll pans lined with parchment or foil 













prepare and chill the doughs.roll each dough to an 8 x 12-inch rectangle, slide it onto a cookie sheet and chill until firm again.remove the vanilla dough from the refrigerator, paint it with the egg white and slide the chocolate dough onto it.  place a cookie sheet on the stacked dough and press gently to make them adhere.cut the layered stack of dough in half to make two 8 x 6-inch rectangles.  paint with egg white, stack, and press as above.chill the striped dough again.cut across the 6-inch side of the dough to make 3/8-inch slices.  set one of the slices on the work surface, stripes facing upward and paint with the egg white.  arrange another slice on it, making sure the colors of the dough alternate, as in the illustration.  repeat with 2 more slices of dough.  repeat with the remaining slices of dough, stacking them 4 layers high as the first one – you will have 4 stacks of dough when you are finished.  wrap and chill the formed checkerboards until you are ready to bake them.  slice, bake, and store as for either of the recipes above.vanilla sablés these versatile cookies may be baked plain, with any of the variations listed at the end of the recipe, or as a component of checkerboard cookies, the last recipe.makes about 40 cookies12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened1/3 cup sugar1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 large egg yolk1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (spoon flour into dry-measure cup and level off)2 cookie sheets or jellyroll pans lined with parchment or foilcombine the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer.  beat with the paddle on medium speed until lightened, about 5 minutes.  beat in the vanilla and egg yolk and continue beating another 2 minutes.remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in the flour by hand.scrape the dough to a floured surface and roll it under the palms of your hands to a cylinder, about 10 inches long and 2 inches in diameter.  wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill it until firm, an hour or two or up to several days.  (if you intend to make the checkerboard cookies, shape the dough into a square, wrap it in plastic, and chill.)when you are ready to bake the cookies, set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  place the roll of cookie dough on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut it into 1/4-inch slices.  arrange them on the prepared pans about an inch apart in all directions.bake the cookies for about 12 to 15 minutes, until they are firm and very light golden.cool the cookies in the pans on racks and pack them between sheets of wax paper in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting cover.variationslightly beat the leftover egg white with a fork and paint the outside of the chilled roll of dough with it.  roll the cylinder of dough in sugar, or coarse colored sugar before slicing and bakingadd 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped walnut or pecan pieces to the dough along with the flour.chocolate sablés these are made from slightly different proportions from the vanilla ones to make up for the drying effect of the cocoa powder.makes about 40 cookies1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (spoon flour into dry-measure cup and level off)1/3 cup alkalized (dutch process) cocoa powder, sifted after measuring1/2 teaspoon baking soda1/8 teaspoon salt8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened1/2

the cookies in the pans on racks and pack them between sheets of wax paper in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting cover.roman almond and pine nut tarttarts like this one are available in many pastry shops in southern italy in one or another form.  this one derives from a tart i tasted in the late eighties at giolitti, an elegant roman pastry shop mostly known for its exquisite gelati.  though the roman version is baked in a deeper pan, i like a removable bottom tart pan for this – it’s only an inch high, about half the size of a typical roman one, but it conveys the flavor and texture of the filling perfectly without being cloying.makes one 10 or 11-inch tart, about 10 servings

the other day i decided to try a recipe from my bread book (nick malgieri’s bread: kyle books, 2012—it may or may not be still in print). before looking for ingredients i started thinking about the six months or so that i spent working on this book almost full time. working out and adapting recipes in baker’s percentages, cups, pounds and ounces, and metric sometimes took hours at the calculator before i even started writing.  once i wrote a recipe, i tested it multiple times, sometimes having to go back to the calculator to change the quantity of an ingredient. when the writing and testing were finished, i realized that it was the single most difficult thing i’ve ever done. and i even made every bit of bread that’s pictured in the book—even the breadcrumbs!i’ve made many of the recipes in the book since it was published, but i never got into the habit of frequently baking bread. so i took out the book and followed the recipe exactly. eureka! i finally realized why all the people who make these bread recipes turn out loaves that look better than mine.  i’m guilty of skimming an ingredient list and then running to the kitchen without reading the instructions. this time i followed my own instructions to the letter. the process was enjoyable, mood elevating, and delicious. try this recipe, or as an old friend frequently used to say, “bake something; you’ll feel better.”  comfort bakingwho isn’t a little on-edge these days as a health crisis looms and we are all staying in to avoid it? we need a distraction, or else we’ll have to get back to working on our taxes…i don’t know about you, but i always feel better both during and after baking something. measuring ingredients and carefully mixing them, followed by pleasant anticipation while the recipe is baking, all contribute to a general sense of wellbeing. 















 here are a couple of recipes that i turn to often. the first, a real scottish shortbread cookie, is a recipe i’ve been making since the late eighties. i had gone for the first time to teach at a lovely kitchenware store and cooking school called the parisian pantry in springfield, missouri. peggy, the owner, a native of scotland, brought me to her home, where i would be staying with her and her husband. as soon as i was settled, we had afternoon tea with some exquisite shortbread cookies. peggy was kind enough to share the recipe, which i hurriedly wrote down about three minutes after tasting the first cookie.  















the second is by far my most requested recipe of all time, supernatural brownies. in case you haven’t read the story elsewhere, here goes: a friend asked me to prepare a couple of chocolate desserts for a large party she was having. i decided to make a brownie recipe that i had adapted from a large-quantity commercial recipe. when i broke it down to a home baking quantity, the brownie batter fit perfectly in a 10 x 15-inch jellyroll pan. for my friend’s party, though, i needed to make two half-sheet pans, so i doubled the recipe and increased it further by 50% for the larger pans. the batter was safely in the pans and in the oven for about 10 minutes when i looked back at my notes and realized i had doubled the flour but failed to make the 50% increase. ugh—too late to take the pans out of the oven. i decided to bake them and nothing short of a miracle occurred: i tasted a bit of the baked batter after it had cooled and it was even better then the original.latest book

bittersweet chocolate tart






nothing could be simpler—or better—than this tart.the flavor of the filling is of course entirely dependent on the quality of the chocolate you use, so hang the budget and get the best available—you only need a single pound.

italian kale pie (torta di cavolo nero) 






in italy, where they make savory pies from almost every vegetable imaginable, kale is a popular choice, especially in tuscany where it’s known as cavolo nero or black cabbage. teamed up with pancetta, onion, garlic, ricotta, eggs, and grated pecorino, its slightly bitter flavor is complemented rather than hidden. this is a great solo dish or delicious accompaniment to plain grilled meat or fish.

chocolate and coffee buche de noel






the traditional french christmas log exists in many variations of flavor and presentation. i like this one because the chocolate cake and coffee buttercream are not an excessively sweet combination. also, the marzipan decorations can be prepared well in advance.

butter rosettes






these are fragile and buttery and easy to pipe because the dough is rather firm. the dough is also fine for putting through a cookie press if you have one. these cookies don’t need to be finished off with anything before or after baking, but you can dust them lightly with cocoa powder, sprinkle them with sprinkles, or place a quarter of a candied cherry, an almond slice, or a chocolate chip (flat side up) in the center of each before baking.
