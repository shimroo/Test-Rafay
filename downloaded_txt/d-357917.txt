“i finally got to see the jewelry mirrors and frames in person. they are spectacular! my client wanted me to let you know that she absolutely loves them. she looks at the one in the master bath several times a day and, even though she never uses the powder room, she goes in there every day just to look at the mirror. i see them as beautiful and she sees them as beautiful - and also a piece of her mother. thank you so much. ”

“i want to thank you for such a wonderful experience this past weekend... i love my mirror and hung it in a very special place in my home.  i hope to learn more about mosaics and develop my skills. thank you for your generosity and sharing.  it means so much to spread such beauty in the world.  i know beauty heals...”
