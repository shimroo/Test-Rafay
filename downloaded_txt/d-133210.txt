what is underwater archaeology?
underwater archaeology is a branch of archaeology that focuses on the study of human interaction with, and development of, the underwater environment. itâs an exciting field to be in, but it can also be a tricky one. with so little visibility, it can be hard to know where to begin looking for archaeological sites.luckily there are plenty of intrepid researchers out there who have discovered ways to explore this hidden world and bring its secrets to light. here are six of the most important discoveries in underwater archaeology.another discovery: economical car insurance!why do so many people pay too much for their car insurance, when price comparison sites like this affordable car insurance site can perhaps save them a lot of money by comparing quotations from up to 100 different insurers?



the answer is that most people don't really know what they are paying for, or how to compare the different insurance policies on offer. they just go with the renewal quote, or the first quote they are offered, without thinking about whether it's the best deal for them.



        in this article we'll look at how to find cheap car insurance and what you need to consider when comparing quotes from different insurers.
how much car insurance do i need?
before you start shopping around for car insurance quotes, it's a good idea to work out how much cover you actually need. this will help you decide which of the many types of policy on offer is right for you.
for example, if your car is worth less than â£1,000 then third party fire and theft cover will be enough; that is the most you'll get back if it's written off anyway, and with a comprehensive policy your compulsory excess may exceed that!there are lots of different types of car insurance policy on offer, but they all fall into one of three categories: third party only, third party fire and theft, or comprehensive. each of these types of policy has different levels of cover and will therefore cost you more or less money depending on the level of cover you choose. for example, third party only is the cheapest option but it won't pay out if your own car is damaged in an accident; comprehensive is the most expensive option but it will pay out if your own car is damaged in an accident as well as paying out for damage to other people's cars and property.do bear in mind though that sometimes comprehensive cover is actually cheaper than third party. however if that comprehensive cover involves a high excess, which you have to pay before the insurance company pay anything, then third party (or third party fire and theft) could still be your best bet.
the discovery of the wreck of the hms orphan
hms orphan was a british frigate that sank in 1833 while en route to jamaica. it was carrying copper ingots to be used to create coins for the british empire, and the loss of the ship and its cargo was a significant economic loss for the british government. the wreck was eventually rediscovered by marine archaeologist e. charles adams in 1967, thanks to his careful research of old documents, including logs of ships that had passed the area of the wreck in the days after the ship sank. adams used this information to identify a patch of the ocean floor that was littered with coins and ingots, which he correctly assumed would be the long-lost hms orphan. the discovery was significant because it was the first time marine archaeologists had found a shipwreck by using proper archaeological evidence.
the remains of a roman bathhouse in caesarea
the remains of a roman bathhouse were discovered off the coast of caesarea, israel. most roman bathhouses were built away from the water, but this one was found submerged, which was a real mystery. when the researchers began excavating, they found that a natural underwater sandbar had slowly covered the bathhouse over time â and then the sandbar itself had been filled in with a layer of silt. so it was actually a natural process that caused this bathhouse to become submerged. the team was able to look inside the structure, which was in pretty good shape considering it had been underwater for 1,800 years. they found a bench and a shelf that had been used for storing vessels, a furnace for heating water, and a few other remains suggesting that this was a typical roman bathhouse. to build a bathhouse that can survive at least 1,800 years under the sea is no small feat!
the 10,000-year-old underwater forest in shicheng, china
in 2011, archaeologists discovered an ancient forest of pine and cypress trees in shicheng, china, that had been underwater for 10,000 years. these trees are thought to have grown near a large freshwater lake that was behind a sandbar, but they were submerged when the regionâs climate changed and the sea level rose. the trees have been preserved by the lack of oxygen in the water, and they have been remarkably well-preserved. researchers have been able to identify that some of the trees were already dead when they were submerged and other trees were still alive when they were buried. the treesâ dna has also been sequenced, and it is hoped that this will help scientists understand how the species have evolved over time.
the exploration of cleopatraâs palace and its blue crystal pool
in 2000, underwater archaeologists discovered the remains of what is believed to be cleopatraâs palace submerged off the coast of egypt. the palace was built around 100 bc and was a large, lavish structure. it had a large courtyard and a beautiful blue crystal pool. the blue crystal pool was a focal point of the palace. experts believe that the pool was used to reflect light, creating a beautiful and dramatic setting. the palace was also important because it revealed a lot about the cultural and political climate of the time. itâs estimated that the palace was about 2,000 square meters and could have held up to 200 people.
a 2,300-year-old greek shipwreck
a 2,300-year-old greek shipwreck, discovered by marine archaeologists in 2011, contained one of the most impressive finds in underwater archaeology. the ship was discovered off the coast of the greek island antikythera. it was buried in the sand at a depth of 50 meters (164 feet) below the surface, and archaeologists think it was probably a roman ship that sailed too close to the island and was caught in a storm that drove it onto the sandbar.the ship contained many fascinating artefacts and discoveries, but the most important was a small marble statue that was built to honour and worship the greek god of the sea, poseidon. there were also many other impressive finds on the ship, including marble and bronze statues, jewellery, an incredibly rare sacrificial tablet, and a wooden wheel.
a boat from 2200 bc with copper tools and an olive press
in 2018, a team of researchers found a boat from 2200 bc off the coast of abu al-qu ships. the boat is believed to have been abandoned during a storm and has been buried in silt for thousands of years. the boat had a lot of interesting things on it. there were many copper tools, an olive press, and even some bags of lentils. the discovery of the boat and its cargo was significant because it allowed researchers to get a better understanding of how the ancient egyptians made their goods and transported them. it also gave archaeologists a rare glimpse into the daily life of the ancient egyptians, as well as their long-distance trade networks.
conclusion
underwater archaeology is an exciting branch of archaeology. it allows us to explore and discover new things about the past that would otherwise be lost to the world. these discoveries are important because they reveal a lot about the past. they shed light on the daily lives of ancient people, how they built things, and how they interacted with their environment. they also offer a unique perspective on the past that land-based archaeology often does not.
