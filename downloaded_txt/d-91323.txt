iâm working on my next company, in defi. we are hiring. stay tuned.
iâm the retired cofounder, cto and ciso at 
handle financial
(aka paynearme). 
iâm a fintech entrepreneur who has designed
and launched numerous payment systems and companies.
i love flying, especially gliders. soaring takes me hundreds of miles up and
down the mountains of california and over the deserts of the american west.
hours of deep concentration, while experiencing the beauty of some of the most
wonderful and hostile terrain in the world. flow at its finest. flight in its
purest form.
