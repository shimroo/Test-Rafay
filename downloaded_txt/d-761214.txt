global information networks in education
the ginie  project creates on-line learning communities for education professionals working internationally on the front lines of civilization : next generation
introduction
about ginie: introduction
problems of chronic educational and economic stress threaten basic education in many parts of the world. the good work that has been accomplished over the last few decades needs to be strengthened to build stable democracies, generate innovative market economies and prevent civil crises. educational professionals within and across countries need rapid access to professional counterparts' knowledge and expertise. they need to be able to construct and maintain a professional 'community memory' through archives and dialogue.
the global information networks in education (ginie) serve as a 'virtual learning community' for education innovation in nations in crisis and transition. they use internet-based technology to build a capacity for rapid access to information and expertise for education professionals working internationally in nations in crisis and at risk to disruption. the ginie networks help education policymakers, donor/investors, researchers and practitioners to work collaboratively, to learn from each other, and to inform the public about studio harry potter londres prix. they place particular emphasis on the development of long term professional networks within and across regions. these networks are intended to share locally created materials and expertise with counterparts for policy dialogue, professional development and classroom exchange.
about ginie: what we do
ginie has developed, in participation with professionals in the field, an internet-based network with the following capacities:

web pages that with a click of a mouse, can provide rapid access to full-text documents that users can review, save to disk or print
web pages that provide organized links to ginie partner and associate sites, as well as other high quality links to content related to education in nations in crisis and at risk
an on-line searchable database which focuses on documents and materials created by education professionals working internationally
uploadable website-based document transfer protocols which allow field professionals to conveniently send their materials to the ginie database
on-line conferences on topics requested by field professionals designed around specific themes to encourage professional collaboration and contribution to the ginie database
secured websites that allow limited access to internal documents and dialogue for working groups
ginie's mailing list that acts as an on-going information distribution system for busy professionals
customized technical support and training for ginie partners interested in learning how to use these capacities more effectively.

ginie uses these new and increasingly important capacities to support local professional decision-making by providing rapid access to high quality knowledge and expertise about 'what works out there in: a) policy; planning and evaluation; b) teaching and learning; c) access, equity and diversity; and d) workforce education and community economic development.
these new technological capacities, while still in their infancy, are of rapidly growing importance to the continuing successful contribution of international development education to democracy building and sustained economic innovation. they provide new opportunities for field professionals to collaborate on common educational problems and to learn from each other's experience.
accessing ginie materials
emphasis is on provision of a full description of materials available. many of these materials can be downloaded as files over the internet.
information on where and how to obtain hard copy is available. as the system develops, we will give priority to materials that do not have copyright restrictions.

ginie solicits high quality educational materials related to education in nations in crisis and/or in transition.
you can contribute to ginie, (with full authorial/organizational credit) and share the good work done by you or your organization. using past efforts to inform future initiatives saves time and precious resources in situations of crisis and rapid change, helping governments, donor and relief agencies and field practitioners to provide high quality educational services to adults and children caught in the midst of crisis and change.

ginie outreach
ginie's outreach efforts support nonpolitical 'educational diplomacy.' education diplomacy is based on the idea that teachers around the world are on the front lines of civilization: the next generation. children inherit civilizations.
teachers have a responsibility to help create opportunities for a successful inheritance. they and other members of this generation need to invest in their own professional quality, as a legacy for the next one. teachers need a lot of help in this monumental task from parents, community members and each other.
ginie focuses on the improvement of the quality of the education profession internationally. one way of achieving this long-term goal is through the development of longer-term professional networks of collegial teaching and learning, both within and across regions. these networks improve the quality of the education profession internationally by creating opportunities for education professionals to share their experiences, materials and policies with each other.
ginie outreach efforts include bosnia and herzegovina, china and egypt.
one simple way of participating in these networks is through an annual investment of a professional development book or a journal subscription for a professional library in one of these countries. many bright, well-educated colleagues face terrible costs for their own professional renewal. a single professional development book or journal subscription can cost a week's salary. in many countries, the need for teachers is so great that almost no money is available for continuing education, not even books for the library, once small salaries have been paid.
