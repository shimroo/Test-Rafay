welcome to bourne scenic park 



serving the community since 1951 



the bourne scenic park was founded in 1951 as an area for picnics and camping, withapproximately 200 sites. from its inception, the park has more than doubled in size to itscurrent 439 sites, 408 of which are electric with newly added cabins & lodges. the bourne scenic park is owned and operated by the bourne recreation authority on land leased from the u.s. army corps of engineers.
while campers at bourne scenic park have a variety of options to plan their day around,(fishing, hiking, biking and rollerblading along the banks of the canal, scheduled activities forboth children and adults, rec. hall with video games and movies, park store featuringgroceries, ice cream, clothing, and camping supplies, or enjoying our pools and recreationareas) it seems to be the scenic views of the canal and the laid back atmosphere that leavethe biggest impression.
