mercedes-benz c-class


















 



















though not quite as sporty as 
                    its bavarian competitor, the bmw 3-series, the c-class offers 
                    mercedes-benz quality, technology, comfort, and prestige wrapped 
                    in handsome skin.

                    the mercedes-benz clk combines the sportiness of a coupe with 
                    the luxurious comfort and space of mercedes-benz's sedans.

mercedes-benz e-class


















 



















packed with a host of technology-upgrades 
                    from the mercedes stable, the e-class has always been the 
                    benchmark for comfort in its class, though it doesn't match 
                    the bmw 5-series for sportiness.
