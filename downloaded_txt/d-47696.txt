 the venue











town of tellurideit is a place of legend, nestled at the end of a lush canyon and surrounded by waterfalls flowing from some of the most rugged peaks in the rocky mountains. the natural beauty of telluride is unmatched by anywhere in the country and perhaps the world. the town stretches eight blocks wide and twelve blocks long and boasts 300 days of sunshine each year. with colorful victorian-era homes, clapboard storefronts, boutiques, art galleries, gourmet restaurants, historic buildings and more, telluride is truly a delight to explore. the friendly locals are embraced for our authentic mountain character, unpretentious attitude, and celebration of adventure. our town is committed to preserving telluride's historically significant architecture, open space, traditional design elements and, most of all, telluride’s small-town mountain lifestyle.because of its significant role in the history of the american west, the core area of telluride was designated a national historic landmark district in 1964. this listing is the highest level of historic status available from the united states secretary of the interior. these sites are so special that they are eligible for consideration to become national parks.the festival site, telluride town park, is a beautiful open space strategically located at the end of our town’s main street. anchored by the state-of-the-art main stage and complimented by the comfortable, indoor blues stage and forested festival campground, the festival venue ranks as one of the most scenic music locations in the world. the towering mountain peaks and glowing aspen trees that dot the hillsides provide the perfect amphitheater for music to resonate through the mountain canyon.when b.b. king first performed here in 2004, he sat on the stage, looked out at the mountains before him, and said, "out of the 90 different countries i've been to, i've never seen anything more beautiful than what you have here." it's not the altitude that'll take your breath away. it's the views.
