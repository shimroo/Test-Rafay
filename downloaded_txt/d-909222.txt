"she has the sort of east tennessee accent that seems to keep your coffee 
        warm. her decidedly uncatchy signature line — 'well, there you have 
        it folks' — has become a lazy weekend mantra for her fans. and over 
        the last six years, her noon-to-3-p.m. show, 'the radio thrift shop' on 
        wfmu, the famously eclectic new jersey radio station, has made her one 
        of the city's best-known deejays among music lovers with a country-and-western 
        bent." — the new york times
