home offices
a home office has become the most desired room since the outbreak of the covid 19. having a dedicated workspace is a must these days when juggling with childrenâs home schooling and working from home.
while the larger homes may have spare rooms available or already have an office within the home, most of us have had to get creative in using an existing space as a work station. changing the use of an existing room is the easiest method such as a spare bedroom or the second reception or the formal dining room into an office, homes with little space are now converting the loft into a home office, the garage into a home office or extending the home with a house extension for a dedicated home office. some want to be able to work away from the noise and interruptions and spend some time concentrating on the task at hand. some want to be able to close up the office at the end of the day without it spilling into family life.


loft conversions

if your family is outgrowing your home or simply want more room. a loft conversion allows you to add space without having to move. some lofts are more easily converted than others. a full assessment requires professional help, but you can often work out the basics yourself. make sure you have a torch and a tape measure. access the loft space and have a look around. standing under the ridge check the clear height of the roof. you will need 8ft clearance but you may be able to get a useful room from as little as 7ft. read more...


sun lounges

sun lounges / sun room are one of the most popular home improvement choice and with good reason. a room with a thousand uses, any time, day or night, winter or summer.when formed to make a junction between the outdoor garden area and the indoor living area, it is ideal for extending the use of the garden during the summer months. providing shade during the day and warmth during the evenings makes it perfect for family gatherings, entertaining, holiday celebrations or just plain quiet time. lay back and enjoy the great outdoors...indoors! read more... 


domestic extensions

the careful consideration of the external appearance of an extension must not be ignored if a sympathetic addition to your dwelling is to be achieved. it is usually easier and more successful to copy the appearance of the existing house, however, a contrasting design using different materials can achieve satisfactory results when the effect is to change the overall appearance of the dwelling. read more... 


kitchen design

planning your kitchen takes care, forethought, and a little imagination. it can also be an exciting and enjoyable challenge. the work triangle, still basic to kitchen design today as it was in the early half of the 20th century, when it was first defined, is the arrangement of the three primary work centres in the kitchen: the storage/preparation centre (refrigerator) the cooking centre, and the clean-up centre (sink and dishwasher).but before starting on the design of the kitchen we must understand how the kitchen space is used. kitchens are busy places, with frequent cooking and where many other household activities are carried out. so what do you do in your kitchen? how do you cook in your kitchen, what do you have in your kitchen and what do you want in your kitchen. these questions and many more need to be considered when designing that perfect kitchen. read more... 


bathroom design

probably the greatest challenge in remodelling a bathroom is how to achieve the style and features you want within the limits of the smallest room in the house. the location of the plumbing affects everything, so this must be decided first. retaining the location of existing plumbing and drainage pipes will save you money.remodelling a bathroom is relatively easy if you don't have to move them. if you make radical changes in the existing layout, you'll need to investigate whether or not you can build what you want without making structural changes. read more...

garage conversions

for many of the house owners in uk, the garage conversion is one of the most economical ways to add a new habitable room to your property and it also increases the house value. convert a garage and enjoy the extra space on the ground floor without reducing the natural daylight into other rooms. building an extension is proving much more popular than moving home. the cost of building an extension is much more than garage conversions. modern living with more people working from home, children with computers and gaming machines makes a home extension very attractive. moving the dining room into the garage conversion allows you to have a kitchen extension in both existing kitchen and dining room.


building regulations
the building regulations are the corner stone's to the standards that we all build to. some consider them a burden while others maintain that they are not stringent enough. whatever the case we have to know and understand them. full copies of the regulations for scotland england and northern ireland are available for downloading
