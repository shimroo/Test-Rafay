ibm ring 21’s history
from the beginning, hollywood has been a mecca for top-quality talent in all areas of show business — including magicians. when such notable names as floyd g. thayer, the great leon, william larsen, sr., chester morris and caryl s. fleming found their way to tinseltown in search of fame and recognition, they gathered in local eateries and nightspots for fellowship, shop talk and general camaraderie. finally, someone must have suggested forming a local ring similar to one back home, and so began hollywood’s ring #21 of the international brotherhood of magicians in the spring of 1938.
today we continue that same proud tradition of sharing our mutual love, enthusiasm, and affection for the ancient art of magic through performance, theme nights, seminars, workshops, lectures, swap meets and shared fellowship. our namesake, the great caryl fleming was one of the area’s finest.
when in los angeles, please stop in to one of our regular monthly meetings and introduce yourself to some of your fellow prestidigitators.
our open door policy will ensure that you will be most welcome!
