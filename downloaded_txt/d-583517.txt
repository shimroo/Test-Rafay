radzilow population statistics (compilation of data from many sources):














assuming the general population grew steadily from 1857 to 1921, and 
            taking into account that jews started to emigrate in much larger numbers during the early 1900's (there 
      		was a huge drop in their percentage of the population after wwi, 
		    from 55% to 34%, and therefore, they accounted for a large drop in the overall population as well), one can extrapolate that, at its high point, 
		    from 1905-1914, there were over 2,000 persons living in radzilow, with jews making up over 1,000 of those. take note that these figures 
		    do not include surrounding farms and villages right outside of the town itself (see note for 1885).













additional notes:
            - invading swedish armies sacked the town in the 1650's. in 1708 
            poland became the scene of a war between russia and sweden. swedish 
            armies, commanded by king charles xii, occupied the radzilow area 
            and built a fort to command the biebrza crossings, about 15 km. 
            upstream from radzilow.
            - in 1885, the parish of radzilow, belonging to the dekanate [deanery 
            of the catholic church] of szczuczyn, numbered 2,435 "souls" 
            [believers]. the community of radzilow, including the town and 
            nearby villages, numbered 4,497 inhabitants.

search this site:
		take note that this method only finds exact spellings. 
		many surnames are mentioned throughout the web page with many different spellings,
		from the original polish spellings, to yiddish variants, to transliterated 
		english versions. surnames in pages like the ellis island records 
		can be completely off. while most town name references are standardized to the current polish spellings,
		in certain cases some towns can be found using different spellings, depending on the context.

  		if you enter a certain spelling for a given surname and don't find anything, 
		that doesn't mean it can't be found under alternate spellings. not 
		to mention the fact that less than a quarter of my material is online, and i don't put 
		a single vital record (birth/death/marriage) on the web page. so, if you 
		believe your family came from radzilow or any nearby town in lomza gubernia, 
		please 
		contact me and i will be glad to help you.


important note: it doesn't matter if the search result comes up empty 
  		because of alternate spellings or because it's not on the web page itself. if 
		your family came from radzilow or nearby, i almost certainly have more 
		information, so please 
		contact me regardless.
