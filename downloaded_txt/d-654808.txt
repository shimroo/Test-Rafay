welcome to owwg



the ohio wind working group is a forum on wind energy development information in the state of ohio. drawing from the manufacturing, government, development and research sectors, as well as local landowners. owwg members work collaboratively to address obstacles in wind energy development and educate the public on the benefits of wind energy. owwg is funded through the united states department of energy’s wind powering america program.
ohioans have a responsibility to find a practical solution for clean, renewable energy to avoid further environmental damage and secure the state’s energy future. the ohio wind working group believes wind development is that solution. click the above web page link for more information on all aspects of wind energy!
