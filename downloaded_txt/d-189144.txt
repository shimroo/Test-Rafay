general information about this site 


 note: if we have missed any historical 
        churches, or if the information contained herein is inaccurate, we will be happy to add to or update the site upon request. effective 2009, the managers of this site have relocated outside of the new orelans area. churches wishing to add or update information should contact the steeplechasers at jdemajo (at) demajo.net to coordinate those requests.  


 


the story of the steeplechasers and new orleans churches.com 



neworleanschurches.com was begun in 2001 by kathleen demajo at the time that she was a freshman at a cabrini high school in new orleans. ms. demajo was given an  assignment to document the history, and provide photographs of several parish churches in her immediate neighborhood in new orleans. her father, engineer and programmer john demajo, placed her report on-line on a web server that he operated in conjunction with his engineering and construction company. through log records from that site, her family soon realized that kathleen's photos and data  were being viewed by a multitude of users including visitors to the new orleans area, cruise lines based in new orleans, and by the congregations of the featured churches. 

when it became apparent  that the site was providing a needed service to the community, mr. demajo and his daughter became known as the "steeplechasers"  and they set out to improve and upgrade the site in order to provide information on as many churches as possible in southern louisiana and mississippi. as musicians and members of the american guild of organists, john and kathleen also decided to extend the site's resources to include information on the  pipe organs that were housed in many of the churches that they featured. with efforts extending over several years, they  were able to photograph most major churches in the gulf south. later, friends jonathan fox and ellyn orth-meier teamed up with john and kathleen, providing additional coverage for the site. 
following hurricane katrina, and the loss of our new orleans facilities, the demajo family relocated outside of the gulf south area. we have pledged, however, to keep neworleanschurches.com operating as a continuing service to our friends and viewers. we wish to acknowledge the dedication of ms. ellyn orth-meier who has worked closely with us in gathering updated information and photographs, as well as mr. eric ordoyne, and others who have helped to keep the organ information on the site updated. 
both neworleanschurches.com and our sister site www.churchesofvirginia.org, are privately owned and managed, non-commerical sites that operate strictly as a free service to the cities and the various congregations that are featured. the operations are funded entirely by  the demajo family, and listings on the site are provided, free-of-charge and upon request, to any legitimate church or institution of worship in the coverage area.
