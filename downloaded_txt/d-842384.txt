	welcome to the tribute to the sound machine of the inland empire youth band website.  
	it was an independent marching band that served music and pageantry students in southern california.  
	the band was based in upland from 1984 to 1994 and then in chino until 1999.  the band went 
	inactive in the spring of 1999 unfortunately, due to the very busy schedules pursued the local 
	academic music programs.  the band used to function from october through the first week in 
	august.  the band performed in parades other events thoughout southern california.  the 
	band also toured for up to two weeks during the summer months performing in field show competitions 
	and parades up and down the west coast of the united states.  for over 1000 past members, the 
	band was educational and exciting experience.
