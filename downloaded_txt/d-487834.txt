finish the race strong: help us complete the diaconia christian hospital in romania



bring hope and healing to eastern europewe are nearing the finish line in building the diaconia christian hospital in romania, the first christian hospital in eastern europe. this vital project will provide hope and healing while drawing people closer to jesus christ.we need your support to complete this mission. as construction is completed, we will need to equip and staff the hospital. your prayers and financial contributions will help us fulfill this vision and serve those in need. as matthew 25:40 says, “whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.”romania's strategic location—bordering ukraine, moldova, hungary, serbia, and bulgaria—makes this hospital essential for delivering christ-centered care to eastern europe.

servinghim is a 501c(3) nonprofit organization that is dedicated to serving others worldwide by ministering to both physical and spiritual needs. for 26 years, our mission has been making disciples through jesus christ, bringing hope and healing worldwide. luke 9:2 says, “he sent his disciples out to proclaim the kingdom of god and to heal the sick.” we send mission teams to impoverished areas in eastern europe and central america, to provide quality care to those in need both through our medical/dental clinics and through community health fairs. our evangelism team ministers to each person that comes through our clinics. our community outreach team distributes goats, pigs, or chickens, food baskets, and bibles to families living in very poor villages; as well as building stoves and latrines for families in central american villages. we send teams to do home-to-home evangelism in local villages. our children's ministry team teaches a healthy habits presentation in public schools and works in the local village churches to put on a vacation bible school for their children.
