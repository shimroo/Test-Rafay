discovery owners association, inc.

welcome to the home of the premiere organization for owners of discovery motorhomes.

the discovery owners association, inc. (doai) is a social organization consisting of members who own fleetwood discovery motorhomes. doai was formed in 1998 to promote the sharing of information and fostering friendships with fellow discovery motorcoach owners.

we are a non-profit group and are not affiliated with fleetwood/rev, fma, fmca or any other group. we are an organization that has dedicated volunteers that help to ensure the club runs smoothly.

doai is a great way to make new friends, learn about your discovery coach, and enhance your ownership experience and enjoyment of the rv lifestyle. we invite you to join this great group of like-minded discovery owners by clicking the button below.

comment from a member about one of the benefits of being a doai member:

i'll take this opportunity to say how much i appreciate you folks and this forum.

i've been rving for many years and in the past was pretty ignorant about the workings of my rigs.

…the advice and knowledge i have gained just by reading this forum has already saved me many hours of paying for someone else to do it.

that is both satisfying and thrifty and i thank you all.
