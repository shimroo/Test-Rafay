hello fans of paco's las vegas arts and culture blog,


please forgive me but we have had a few technical issues with the blog. i am inÂ  the process of migrating all this historic content to a new and exciting platform. after all this blog is quite vintage and dates back to 2003. we definitely do not want to lose this historic content. if all goes well we will be up and running in no time.

as always thank you for your amazing support!

yours truly - paco

	 twitterverse. you are invited! the new abstraction digital art via twitter and american artist jim briare
	 
    




ever want to own your own artwork? you are in luck. all you have to do is tweet.

award winning american artist jim briare is thrilled to announce the return of an exciting interactive digital art project, tweet to art. joining the ranks of the leagues of digital and digitally inspired artists, briare invites all twitter users to take part in the art project which will be exhibited at the art motel inside the life is beautiful music & art festival on september 25-27, 2015 in downtown las vegas. to take part in an interactive art exhibit, include the hashtags #briare_art and #lifeisbeautiful in your tweet. briare will be on hand to create an abstract digital painting with your message!

using briareâs patent pending process to transform tweets into digital art, twitter collaborators can create unique and visually compelling source material. then the artist enhances color, changes, form, composition and other elements to give each piece a personal touch. interactive collaborators are assured an original piece displayed at the art motel via lcd projector and re-tweeted back to its originator.

digital art is one of the most important mediums today and reflects a novel consciousness and aesthetic reality. wade guyton and stephen prina have wooed the art world with their experiments, while mark bradford has explored the âsurfaceâ of the virtual world. briare belongs to this new class of artists who transform and reinterpret digital modes. formally, briareâs art echoes the structure of the post abstract expressionist compositions of american artist richard garet and the neoâgeometric painter peter haley.

in a perceptive essay on abstraction and contemporary art in artnews, curator pepe karmel points to the resurgence of large scale shows at key museums devoted to abstraction, and posits that abstraction shares much with traditional art and divides abstraction into various types, useful to us in terms of understanding briareâs place in this contemporary digital movement. karmel points to constellations, exemplified by works by david row and chris martin. another form is identified as landscape seen in the digital works by jennifer steinkamp, yet another category is architecture, which along with landscape resonates the most with briareâs practice; the artist shares his inclusively poetic vision:

âthe creation of any art in any media is a process. tweet to art, allows anyone, the joyous opportunity to collaborate - creating a unique and special abstract art piece that can be shared at the moment where it is created, and shared with the twitterverse on a universal scale.â

abstraction has always been valued for its expressive quality and today it has a new muse, the public. interactions between artists and the public has become a key dialogue, and twitter as a medium for art has been used by art world pioneers such as the chinese artist and dissident ai weiwei who says of the mediumâs importance and unique character: âit is so intimate but, at the same time, so broadly connects us to others. humans have never had this in our history. (http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/ai-weiwei-says-twitter-is-art)

be a part of this inventive medium, create, collaborate and collect with briare.

collect some art on twitter.

about the artistbriare holds his bfa, university of nevada, and has worked in the creative arts for many years including film, photography, performance and design. his work has been featured in usa today; life is beautiful festival, las vegas (2014), and brian enoâs lux-day of light. in addition to this innovative project, briare makes brightly graphic drawings high-resolution photographic works and abstract film projects that verge on surrealism. the artist began his foray in advertising at the riviera hotel and casino. it was there he developed what would become the award winning and iconographic, crazy girls no ifs, ands or â¦ cab back and billboard campaign.jim then moved his artistic endeavors to creative support for the retail division at mandalay resort group, one of the largest resort casino companies in the world. work included photography, video production, site-specific installations, and graphic design. he also oversaw the purchase of all the fine art for the companyâs galleries and public space retail displays.when mgm resorts international merged with mandalay resort group, jimâs imaginative skills were again sought out for the oversight of the innovative and creative processes of corporate communications, where he leads the creative development of all internal communications platforms including momentum, the companyâs award-winning daily news and information source.this creator is constantly reinventing himself and discovering new ways to communicate with the world. more information may be viewed at http://www.jimbriareart.com.instagram: @jbriaretwitter: @briare_artfacebook: jim briare art

	 seductive simplicity - francois dubeau - september 3 - october 24
	 
    




sin city gallery is delighted to present an exhibition of new pieces by franÃ§ois dubeau whose finely rendered artworks are an achievement of skill and imagination. always well made, dubeauâs art is sought after by collectors of contemporary and modern art as well as those who love historic prints.the artistâs subject matter is quite diverse, from lyrical pictures of instruments, linear asiatic style animals, views of graceful nudes like femme au chignon, and edgy works like top picturing a stunningly retro brunette garnishing a whip.the popularity of dubeauâs work is found in the graceful simplicity of his calligraphic style. many of the line drawings like catwalk 672 are so effortlessly gestural that one can imagine the artistâs hand holding a fountain pen, poised above the paper.however, one might be surprised to know that artistâs captivating pictures are in fact, first conceived using a digital stylus, the virtual canvas allowing an unparalleled range of motion and artistry. the drawing is transferred to paper or canvas, the latter enhanced with traditional painting techniques creating lyrical scenes.the simple elegance of shapely line against negative space is a motif of greats such as henri matisse who also depicted the body of woman with graceful curving gesture, creating a tension between form and emptiness, sensuality and plainness such the french masterâs famous reclining nude (1927).dubeauâs oeuvre is often alluringly erotic and sometimes delightfully daring, and yet his range is both impressive and expansive as other pieces seems pensive and draw on traditions of calligraphy. still others are whimsical and play on prototypes of sex appeal sexiness, such as the timeless pin up girl. a tribute to the naturally sensuous and beauty of the feminine form dubeauâs work incorporates digital technology, engraving, illustration and painting to create memorable work that has a calm allure.in addition to the private demand for his work, dubeauâs artistry has premiered in numerous exhibits and events such as art@large (new york); gallery by the bay, stanwood, washington; circuit des arts memphrÃ©magog, magog, quÃ©bec, an artistâs workshop open house; la maison blanche montreal; the seattle erotic arts festival; the dirty show, detroit and los angeles; unclad, portland, oregon; and the ehm, las vegas. dubeauâs work can also be found in the permanent collections of the exodus trust and the kinsey institute, indiana university. in addition to honors such as second place in the publicâs choice, seattle erotic art festival, and honorable mention in art @ large, going underground, new york, dubeau has been featured in various publications including erotic signature and hors sÃ©rie dÃ©coration. the artist will give a talk on october 1st, 2015 at 7:00pm.  www.sincitygallery.combrian paco alvarez enculturating las vegas into the millennium...

12 inches of sin is the largest international juried exhibition of contemporary provocative art in nevada. as an exploration of sensuality and the erotic, this show has a twist: every piece submitted for consideration must be one foot square or less. judges such as former las vegas mayor oscar goodman, christine fey, resource development and cultural affairs manager at city of reno, and will roger peterson, co-founder of burning man, evaluate the tension within the art itself, challenging each artist to produce an image that is deeply expressive, provocative, sensory and daring on such a small scale.  sin city gallery, las vegas will hold the competition for its fifth year and is accepting art submissions thru october 31, 2015 at www.12ofsin.com.

	 artrageous vegas returns!!!
	 
    


for 11 years the lgbt center of southern nevada has been celebrating the arts with its annual fete artrageous. the celebration continues this year with art, fashion, entertainment and a bit of history as the event is held at the historic tropicana resort. the tropicana was once called the tiffany of the strip because of its progressive design and unrivaled class. today the newly remodeled resort will beckon the las vegas arts intelligentsia for an evening that celebrates the arts. of course i am very excited to be returning to co-curate the event with my friend and fellow arts cohort melissa petersen, president of the contemporary arts center of las vegas.

so come out and get your art on at artrageous this saturday night! 7pm!
