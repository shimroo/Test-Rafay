biomedical imaging group



  			    the biomedical imaging group pursues research on the development of new algorithms and mathematical tools for the advanced processing of medical and biological images. topics of interest are image reconstruction, multi-modal imaging, image analysis and visualization. research efforts are taking place at two complementary levels:
  		 		1) the fundamental and mathematical aspects of imaging, 
				and 2) application-oriented projects in collaboration with researchers in medicine and biology.
