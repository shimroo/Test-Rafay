welcome to the diamond grillepast. present. perfect. established in 1935, the diamond grille is akron’s iconic, landmark destination for flame-broiled steaks, fresh-caught seafood, and hand-crafted cocktails. since 1935, it’s where friends gather and everyone who comes in through the back entrance is family. in a sea of chain restaurants, the diamond grille is a true original. it embraces its uniqueness and its reluctance to change. and why should it? when you’ve been in business since the roosevelt administration, there are no apologies to make. only new friends and new generation of loyal customers.a message from the owners“john and i are committed to offering a memorable experience at the diamond grille. we take pride in knowing many of our customers by name, and look forward to meeting the ever growing group of new guests. having been born and raised in akron, i have always had a special place in my heart for the diamond grille. owning this historic and iconic restaurant is truly an honor, and i look forward to many great times to come!”-owner, katie stack

classic traditiondiscover why the diamond grille has been a destination restaurant for celebrities, athletes and gourmands for decades... for decades, downtown akron’s oldest restaurant has hosted some of the sports world’s glitterati for dinner. with the wgc-bridgestone invitational at firestone country club and the canton pro football hall of fame’s induction both this weekend, there’s a good chance there will be a big name or two at the diamond grille once again.     - akron beacon journal
