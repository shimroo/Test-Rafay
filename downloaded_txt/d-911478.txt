miracle toe jam






get god's wealth in your pocket

these late night tv commercials for televangelist peter popoff's "miracle spring water" kill me



the testimonials of all of these lovely people saying how they paid this charlatan for their tiny tube of "miracle spring water" and the next day or week or month god sent them a new benz and $400,000 makes me start thinking about how i can get in on some of this action.



so this morning, ladies and gentlemens, i present for the first time on the internet this new product designed ...for your consumption and my enrichment....

here's a first look and my "miracle toe jam"...








...available for two easy payments of $19.99 plus s and h.




get yours today, smear it all over your chest and body, and then just wait sittin' there palpitating while you let god's riches embolden your existence...


my upcoming trip to aruba is depending on your faith and contributions...

adult mac & cheese

better than that crap made with velveta...

here...cook this recipe i made up myself based on several i found on the internet and cooked for the second time last night.

 i call it "adult mac & cheese", and you'll need:

1 lb spiral rotini pasta... 1/2 medium head of cauliflower, cut into florets


for the béchamel sauce:

1/4 stick of butter 1/4 cup all purpose flour 2 cups half & half 3/4 cup heavy cream 1/4 water

2 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese 
1 cup crumbled stinky blue cheese

panko bread crumbs

now as to putting it all together:

 steam your cauliflower until tender. 

bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil, add your pasta, and cook until it's al dente.

meanwhile, you make a light roux... 

melt the butter in a large deep heavy bottom skillet on medium heat. 

stir in the flour a little at a time and stir continuously  for 3 to 5 minutes. 

slowly add your half&half, heavy cream, and water stirring continuously until it thickens slightly.

now reduce the heat to low and add first the cheddar, then the blue cheese a little at a time allowing it to melt evenly.

cook and stir until well blended.

evenly spread the steamed cauliflower on the bottom of a greased 9"x13" casserole dish.

add your drained pasta to the sauce and turn to evenly coat, then evenly spread the mixture over the cauliflower and sprinkle a nice even coat of bread crumbs over the top of everything.

toss in all in a 350 degree f oven for 25 to 30 minutes, finishing under the broiler for a couple minutes to brown.

now pull that smoldering dish of goodness out and sit it aside to cool, waiting long enough to not burn your tongue and the skin off of the roof of your mouth...

...put generous portions on a plate ....

and eat!!!


 regards y'all

"rogers words 'o advice






ideas to live bytoday's topics... "mattresses and toilet paper"... this advice isn't needed by everyone i know, but some of you out there  (and you know you are) need to hear this stuff.so here we go... you spend approximately 1/3 of your life on your mattress, you know? don't go down to big lots or somewhere and get a $350 king size (or whatever size).  get yourself a sealy pillow top or tempur-pedic or memory foam with a good set of box springs. we've had our king mattress for 8 years and we're looking at a new one. the bad thing about a pillow top is you can flip it end to end but ours can't be flipped all the way over so there's a slight depression shaped like me in it on my side. just do it...treat yourself to a good nights sleep! next topic... toilet paper. i've gone over to people's houses and found that they were either really cheep else they're stealing their toilet paper out of motel six or an indian gas station. you could sand the finish off of a chest of drawers with this stuff. don't you respect yourself? buy good toilet paper. we prefer plain old charmin two ply unsented. charmin..aahh. it's strong too... you could make a suit out of it. i'm walking around in my  suit and people ask versace? no...charmin!!! i love it, saves money in the end too. instead of paying for dry cleaning i just flush it you understand? ok, that will be all...for now...

still alive and breathing





but sometimes just barely...


it's been a few years since i posted here on my original blog after writing a zillion words in the mid and late 2000's.



being in a corporate job out here in tulsa, oklahoma i honestly the hr or it idiots would find my rants and i'd get fired so i walked away.



we'll...things have changed and...



i'm baaaaaaakkkkkkkkkk!



facebook is driving me crazy and i'm pretty much the only one in my friends group that does anything but cut and paste crap or post baby pictures.



i'm coming back again but it definitely won't be "trump trump trump russia russia russia"



i have a full head of steam up...what used to call "having my head spinning at orbital rotational velocity" about senator mcmcain needing to resign immediately to open up his seat after his brain cancer diagnosis was announced yesterday...



and a bunch of other stuff.



until then...

new halloween project





i just can't help myself...


i was driving back home to the turbopup's & izzy's new skiatook lake compound from tulsa yesterday afternoon when i spotted this sitting beside the road at a local nursery/garden supply...




....and as you can see i bought it and had it hoisted into the back of the cadillac.......

...yes ladies and gentlemen...




that would be a 93 pound pumpkin.  

historically gourds of this size are very hard to find in my experience unless you live in a rural area, and that basically describes our new location now.

and  of course my long time blog readers may remember that i had a near-death experience back 6 or 8 years ago wrestling with carving an even larger pumpkin...one weighing...get this...

...near one hundred and twenty pounds.

so any way, i'm on a mission now to carve this sucker and display it somewhere for halloween.

maybe in the lobby of my new office building, or possibly at the chamber of commerce or the foyer of some local school.

i don't need it on my front porch because just like the last three places we've lived there are hardly any children...just old people.

regardless, i'll keep you up to date on my progress...probably starting a week or ten days before halloween.

regard's y'all...

a slippery oily question





energy insanity continues to fund our citizens daily peril

a headline on drudge report this morning about world oil production got me to do a little research.

us consumption  is presently about 18.5 billion barrels per day, and this year we've increased production to 11.15 billion barrels per day (bb/day).

just across our northern border canada produces 3.9 bb/day and to our south mexico outputs another 2.9 bb/day.

do the math...( and you can verify the numbers here at the us energy information administration)

that adds up to 18.3 billion barrels of oil per day produced right here on our continent.

i say if the freaking epa and congress and the wild eyed tiedyed, patchouli stinking tree hugging hippie environmentalists would get the f**k out of the oil industry's way we'd never have to send another us dollar half way around the world to line the pockets of these assholes:




 

 

...who just turn around and use our money to buy weapons and train angry, ignorant, wild eyed islamofashist assholes to kill westerrners overseas or worse yet blow up buildings in ny city and foot races in boston.

 

is it just me?????????

endangered indigenous  feces species





we're all livin' on tulsa time...





missy and lizzy and i saw this out on the driveway this week...





...yes..that is an earthworm spanning 10 inches and they are everywhere out here.

we find them curled up and dried up and laying around after it rains on the driveway and sidewalks and the worst part is elizabeth...aka...lizzy...aka izzy wants to eat them...

and then come and sit in your lap and kiss you on the mouth.

what did i do to deserve this...ladies and gentlemen?

(only an injuneer would get out a tape measure and take a picture of the offending animal/vegetable/mineral...you know?)

it's that time of the year again?





let me reminisce....


a long, long time ago, in a place far, far away from me and my little world in atlanta, georgia, you could see something that looked like this if you went there...





meanwhile, on the other side of the universe political planet, there lurked supposedly well intended and all knowing yet bumbling ideological boobs like this who wanted to run things and second guess all military and security decisions...
 






they had a long history of listening to people like this...



















who are all really these...when the dust settles...at heart... 





and thirteen years have dulled these so called "leaders" memories and a generation of children have been born which did not watch tv that horrible tuesday morning in 2001 like i and millions of other did around the world seeing these kind of images:









but meanwhile...soon...we'll have this as a replacement





yet this morning i ask you this...

are we going to let the wild eyed, muslim islamofaschist assholes do it to us again?

i sure hope i wake up later this morning and every one is safe here in the good old by god us of a and our territories and there aren't any more buildings falling down or smoking craters in the ground full of melted airliner and body parts...

(and it won't be for the efforts of obamarama and the obama administration and shrillary clinton either...)


regard's y'all...keep your powder dry...

sunset at our house






﻿

pinch me...are we really living here?﻿

 

 

well, the end of yet another summer is upon us as the labor day holiday rolls into north eastern oklahoma...

 

and god has certainly proven that he has a sense of humor as he continues to move me and my family around on the "chess/checker board" of life.

 

 

every single time i think i know what is best for me personally and the loved ones around me...

 

 

every single time i think "i've got things handled" and i'm in control...

 

 

everything seems to turn dark and disturbing and the impulse is to panic and start cursing and complaining and worrying about "taking back control"...

 

 

historically that's how i handled adversity and life's difficulties...you know?

 

 

but since being laid off from a fancy job in a "foreign city" west of the mississippi river in april, and having a over extended real estate project turn sour with our "satanic devil's beast insane drug/alcohol fevered lease/purchase seller"...

 

 

i held my normally venomous tongue and bided my time and put my resume back out there on the internet and replaced my lost income and now we live here lakefront where i see this view from my back deck every afternoon (weather permitting)﻿

 

﻿



happy labor day...and regards y'all

so we moved to a lake front house on a freekin' oklahoma injun reservation???





i lost my mind and then found it here...


don't ask...

...i can't really explain it ladies and gentlemen...

ever heard of a city in oklahoma called skiatook?

...it's on the eastern edge of the osage indian reservation north of tulsa, oklahoma, and the osage indian reservation also encompasses the entire boundrys of osage county, ok.

any wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...

we're here as of yesterday with the last haul from the tulsa estate onto the lakefront house overlooking the lake and crystal bay marina, and since june 10th i have a new job as the lead structural injuneer at a local company designing stuff for boiler plants.

my soul is cleansed and renewed and i feel a torrent of new writing coming on.

sunset photos and societal/political commentary to follow here again shortly.

ed and roy and rusty...i think i'm back...

retarded tardy new years reflections





i'm severely pre-occupied these days...


hello ladies and gentlemen...long time no see i guess...

this afternoon i decided to stop by here at my severely neglected blog to mention a few things that have been going on out here in tulsa and in my life in general.

first of all, i'm busy as heck professionally since i decided to end my former beach bum ways and go back to work full time.

the difference between this latest adventure and the disaster that occurred when i moved us away from our little island on the georgia coast to knoxville, tennessee is this...

...unlike the coal fired boiler plant business i was in over there, out here the oil refining business is freaking booming and even that big eared socialist idiot  dictator president obama knows it would be suicide to kill the oil/gas business like he's killing the coal business.

i think that we're safe--safe at least until the day when they can make a car and a tractor trailer operate using power generated by solar panels and a windmill mounted on their roofs.

being an injuneer i can tell you we're a good way off on the calendar from that happening as i see it.

in other news, pat and missy the turbo pup have settled into our new/old house and tulsa in general and the new little monster dachshund puppy lizzy turns eight months old shortly and is growing like a weed still.

her and missy have finally bonded and the house is a lively place all day, especially when i come in from work in the evening.




 

lizzy in her favorite pose...




 

missy remembering the days when she was a solo dog...

meanwhile, when not doing structural design of giant oil heaters i'm still trying to finish some work on the house in the evenings and on the weekends but we're so busy at work and i've been traveling a good deal (i made southwest airlines "a list" for this year) and then on december 6th i had to have planned surgery to fuse three vertebrae in my neck...a situation which was contributing to slowing of my renovation progress and my life in general...but everything went well and i continuing to improve each day.

the variation of the weather out here continues to amaze me...as of a couple of weeks ago i've seen the temperature swing from a summer high of 117 deg f to this winter's record low of -2 degrees f.

it's just mid january and we've had substantial snow/ice events four or five times now already...i think there's a lot more 

and even if you are not freezing or frying you have to hang on to cars and nearby structure and sometimes complete strangers to keep from being blown over by the incessant winds we're so blessed with. 

other than the weather extremes, we were really surprised how nice it is out here and we've really grown to love the area as we learn our way around town and find new restaurants and things to do.

pat's still getting to do her old job from out here telecommuting and we put her in a nice office off the upstairs kitchen that has lots of windows.  she has a bunch of bird feeders right outside she can watch and she's cultivating exotic african violets inside and all in all she has a good situation.

i can honestly say here early in 2014 that we are truly blessed to have the opportunities we have and be able to live the life we're living in the midwest.

it's just about perfect except for the weather extremes and if we just had a beach nearby... 

regards y'all...

an "older blogger's" surprising comments on a new year....





i'm back from a self imposed blogging "hibernation" (and this isn't the sermon that it might first appear)

i'd like to open this posting with the following comment (while as a side note mentioning that my shadow rarely passes into a sanctuary of any brick and mortar "house of worship" these days):

i...personally... believe in a living god that sustains all of us...

all of us...

all of us...

us...you know?

us...

..."all of us" meaning all of us human beings--the species homo sapiens--and all of the creatures living under the sea and on the surface of the earth and in the skies under the heavans

all of the fair...

and the unfair...

the people described in the biblical  terms of "richeous"

and the "unricheous"

those civil

and yet the uncivil

the stupid

the just plain stupid

and even the dumb freaking f**king stupid that are out there acting against your own (and sometimes my) best interest and the best interests of your family and/or friends and/or company and/or career...

there is a god out there that loves all of us because he created us and gave us the ultimate power to in the most part determine our own path to the destination he has set for us from our birth.

but in the end, you know what?

in the end...

...when it is all said and done...

...we all...

all

we all...

...end up dead.









(que here the sound of crickets and night bugs chirping)






still with me?












ok...

all of that said, now let me add that i say that the difference between meeting our inevitable end of being dead and ending up being hated and useless and despised...

...or as an alternative living some kind of life and ending out mortal existence being dead and loved and missed and revered...

...isn't by living a life and managing to compile a bucket list of magnamious, philanthropic accomplishments affecting millions/zillions like mother teresa or ghandi (or name another historical figure.) 

i say that in the end it is all about standing up for yourself and your family, living your values, and

150 years ago today





they don't make them like this any more...


four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a  new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men  are created equal. 

 now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any  nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. we are met on a great  battle-field of that war.  we have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a  final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might  live. it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  but, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not  hallow -- this ground.  the brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have  consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.  the world will  little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what  they did here.  it is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the  unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. it  is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us --  that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for  which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve  that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under god, shall  have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people,  for the people, shall not perish from the earth. 
abraham lincoln november 19, 1863 

re-published from here 

(btw...and in the new video released today our shit head african american liberal asshole president chose to omit the words "under god" from his portion of the recitation http://www.learntheaddress.org/?page=2 )

9/11/2003





never forget...







i started to post of photo from that day twelve years ago today when the islamofaschist arab pinheads crashed into these two buildings...

...then i decided instead to post an image of them here as i and hundreds of millions of other people remember them after seeing them and their residents/workers while driving or flying or floating on a boat past until that horrible day.

the ny city skyline and our country and it's people are forever changed from the events which happened mid morning not so long ago...

...and i pray to my god that we not only recover and survive from the effects of that day but use that strength to overcome the idiocy coming at us from our congress, our courts, and our presidency.

i want my country back...

how about you???????????????

growing things





it's hit or miss with oklahoma summer weather...

as i mentioned here earlier, i had good intentions to grow a whole bunch of stuff here in my back yard garden this summer.

i got the ground all plowed up in march and everything looked good until we kept having frost into the second week in may, and by waiting i managed to let the grass and weeds i didn't kill before plowing come roaring back and it's been a battle trying to tame the areas where the corn, tomatoes, potatoes and melons were planted.

the corn has been pretty much a bust after coming up strong...with the wind in a thunderstorm virtually leveling a nearly 8 foot tall row of colored corn and the raccoons and deer knocking the rest of the rows over and eating what the bugs and worms didn't get.

the water melons have prospered and the cantaloupes grew well but something has been getting the ripe ones and eating them leaving nothing but piles of rind and seeds in their wake.

the potatoes were and are a success...we haven't had to buy any in over a month.

the tomatoes were planted late so they are just now starting to produce ripe fruit and i have to get out there and get some stakes and twine around a bunch of them that have laid over on the ground.

meanwhile, i also planted a few things in a large vacant flower bed upstairs next to the kitchen.
 





 

 

there is a single giant squash plant in the center there surrounded by three kinds of sweet potatoes and a single cucumber vine.  i made the mistake of only planting one cucumber and i think you have to have at least two in order for them to cross pollenate and produce fruit.

 

here's the squash plant:

 

   ﻿


it's a monster about three feet high...and it's constantly produced a large number of squash for the past three weeks or so.


then those two whisky barrels have an assortment of herbs and one has a couple of "better boy" tomatoes which have been a disappointment.  i bought them in big pots from home depot for over $10.00 each and they were giant and healthy and already bearing fruit when i got them and they've just proceeded to shrivel and wilt no matter what i do.

i have tons of dusts and poisons and fertilizers but nothing visible seems to be eating them unless i have nematodes or something working on them under ground.

in other news...we had vip tickets to see comedian ron white friday night at the hard rock casino.

the package included getting to spend about a half hour up on stage with ron after the show and to ask him questions.  

some people as usual were shy and/or stupid--one idiot ask him his political views on the us bombing of japan in wwii--but i got to ask him several things.  



i asked if there were any plans to do another blue collar comedy tour with jeff foxworthy and the gang and he said not at this time and probably only as a charity event if it did happen.  



i also asked what his longer term plans were...to keep touring at the present pace or pack up shop at some point and retire.


he replied that he was never going to quit unless his health stopped him or he died.
  


any way...here's what things looked like from row two center stage...






i'll put the vip website here and identify the specific photo of pat and i when it is posted later.

until then...regards y'all...

there's a fungus amoung us...





at least i can make something grow.....



so even though we are still over 6" behind in total rainfall here in 2013 at the turbo pup compound west out here on the not so mighty banks of the arkansas river...




i was wandering out to my garden yesterday to take a look at the corn crop the mold and raccoons and deer hadn't already destroyed when i found these lovely items...




yes...that would be a lovely crop of mushrooms which had sprouted up over the past couple of cool days and nights...that one there on the right beside the soda water can measuring over 9" in diameter...




...and there they all are this afternoon after fully developing.  the original 9" sized guy on the far right is now over 11" in diameter.

the good news is my water melons and cantaloupe are coming in nicely, and a bunch of different varieties of potatoes are coming in, and i have this one giant squash plant i put out next to the upstairs kitchen door which is the size of a volkswagen beetle.

i'll try to get out and get some more photos and post them to show you my successes and failures this season as a neophyte oklahoma farmer.

regards y'all...

notice to all you punk ass" "niggers negros african americans"





at some point in time (like now) you need to stop yelling racism...

four of you "punk ass niggers negros african americans" robbed a pizza hut while i was trying to have dinner in atlanta back in 1979.

one of you "punk ass niggers negros african americans" beat my head in with a pistol for no reason and broke the barrel of the piece of shit gun you were holding off the frame causing me to have a few dozen stitches as a result.

you threatened my life and the safety of a dozen other people.

that said...the jury verdict in the george zimmerman/trayvon martin "incident" was correct, and i'm happy because if that day in 1979 when you were beating me in my head i would have shot your stupid  "punk ass nigger negro african american" ass dead...

i wouldn't have shot you in the knee.

i wouldn't have shot you in the shoulder.

i would have shot you in the head or in your heart...

because i...like george zimmerman...

don't give a flying fuck what color you are when you are assaulting me.

skin color be dammed...in the heat of the moment when i am being assaulted like i was that day and george zimmerman was in that moment...

i say that it is only fair that no other human or government should be able to second guess the actions we take to protect ourselves.

when seconds count???

...the police and the ambulance and the fire department and the rest of the fucking government is only...

minutes away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

most liberals and our shit head president obamarama and eric holder don't understand this equation because in spite of them inspiring/evoking passionate emotions against them and their agendii they have an armed security force to protect their stupid lives.

they simply don't have to worry about their safety...while they threaten law abiding citizens like me and george zimmerman with jail (or the excessive cost of a lawsuit) for legally defending ourselves

heeerrrrrrrrrrrrrssss....






lizzy...

well ladies and gentlemen...

it took all weekend--from flying to denver last friday after work...

then a round trip suv drive to the "hard scrabble" highlands south and west of colorado springs...

and a ten mile drive off road up into a canyon full of ranches...

but ... 




we got her home about 11:30 yesterday morning.

then there was learning the yard and playing in the pool with missy the turbo pup and a night spent in her crate yowling and singing songs no one else knows how to sing...

we have ourselves a fine little mini dachshund puppy right there ladies and gentlemen...

stay tuned to this channel for additional antics and photos.

new puppy





little missy the turbo pup's gonna be an aunt...

i've failed thus far to mention the big change that's coming out here to the tulsa turbo pup compound because i've been waiting for updated photos from colorado.

we finally got them this week...here's our new little girl...







her american kennel club name is "elizabeth mccourt tabor fick" and we're going to call her lizzy.








she's a chocolate and tan, miniature long haired dachshund and she's only six weeks old...still living at the kennel with her mother outside of colorado springs, colorado.  she's from show quality parents and we hope to raise her to show competatively and breed at least one litter out of her.



we're flying up to denver in a couple of weeks and driving up into the mountains to let missy the turbo pup meet her and bring her home.



pat's about to bust she's so excited.



next it's my turn to get some miniature goats and a few chickens to make our 5 acre mini-farm complete.



wish us luck... 



regards y'all.

two plus two equals ???????????





i'm just sayin'....

not much to say here this evening because pretty much these days if i open my mouth the screaming is unintelligible and generally when i try to stay quiet when i try to pound on a computer keyboard th k3ys s10p w0rkin5 and i loose my m1nd....


4 instance...th3r3s this:

michael douglas can't decide if it was  "oral sex, smoking, or drinking that  gave me throat cancer" 

then as a juxta-position...

glenn close would play "fatal-attraction differently now...

hell yeah miss glenn...i never liked your liberal stupid hollywood ass when you still had your middle aged looks, and playing a "mea culpa" scene now doesn't change my opinion of most of you bitches and bastards populating the "movie industry" in california spewing poison to the young minds full of mush voting for communists like obamarama in my country and watching the crap you produce on the movie and tv and iphone screen every second of every minute of every day of every week of every month of every year of every now century plus!

you speak words written by others because the words inside your freaking head mean nothing to me.

and the damage your do to our citizens and out country and our world are only recently to be tabulated and in the sum total may very well directly be the core of our world downfall.

i'm really tired of the drama





oklahoma's not kansas alabama...totto...

i really don't want to come across here this morning as an angry, insensitive, asshole, but then again this is my blog and with friends and readers asking me to get back to business...


this morning i bring you this from an article on the recent tornadoes here in
oklahoma…


“of the 60 ef5 tornadoes since 1950, oklahoma and alabama (emphasis mine) have been struck the most, seven times
each. more than half of these top-of-the-scale twisters have occurred in just
five states: alabama, iowa, kansas, oklahoma and texas. fewer than 1 percent of
all u.s. tornadoes are this violent -- only about 10 a year, according to
research meteorologist harold brooks at the national severe storms laboratory
in norman.”


as i’ve been saying out loud and on line here for years …

 

having grown up in alabama in the
1960’s and 1970’s, i’m not that concerned about the weather out here in oklahoma being that
bad because i’ve lived with it all along in the southeast…

 

oklahoma  just
has the reputation and the media coverage.

and another thing...

the guy that built the house we currently call the "mid-west turbo pup compound" situated on the banks of the less than "mighty arkansas river" was from post wwii italy.

he built what is now our house during the "cold war" with the communists in russia and eastern europe.

you know what we have in our basement...a basement blasted out of the slope of solid granite rock when he started his home construction project?

a bomb shelter!

not a tornado shelter...i mean a freaking solid concrete sitting on solid rock with a steel door bomb shelter.

a bomb shelter.............................

it took a while for that to sink in the day i first looked at this house last july.

it's a room which can be accessed off of one of the bedrooms in our basement which has 12" thick concrete filled cinder block (also called cmu's--concrete masonry units) walls, a concrete floor sitting on solid rock, and a 12" thick solid concrete roof with a vent system which connects with the crawl space under pat's office upstairs over the area.

we've been told that the room also originally had a "pee trench" which was filled in with concrete back in the late 1980's because it sometimes backed up because our septic tank is undersized for a family of 10 (yes...previous owners of our home had 8 kids and 2 adults in this household.)

so any way...

today i find myself...while dodging our current tornadic storms...planning the outfitting this wonderful "safe room" with a new gun safe for my soon to be illegal firearms and a reasonable quantity of provisions like some water and other food staples.

the other thing i want to do is replace the commercial steel door which swings "out" with a steel door which swings "in" so that in the event that we actually take a hit from a storm and there is debris outside that door we are not trapped inside as a result.

but any wayyyyyyyyyyy...

i just think that it's more than a bit retarded how the media coverage of normal spring/early summer weather has swooned into the hysterical fits and burps and farts that it is today.

nothing has changed!

it's just weather...as it has been for the past zillion years and it will be day in and day out for the next zillion...

no matter what the tree hugging, tie died, kumbaya singing, patchouli stinking hippy owl gore following "global warming" "climate change" zealots tell you

you know?

regards y'all...

i'm through "holding my breath"





the whole holder thing stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!


just a quick note here this evening ladies and gentlemen--after spending most of the past week and more recently the past quarter day dodging hail and tornadoes out here at the new oklahoma turbo pup compound...

i predict that sometime tomorrow afternoon that there will be a press release out of the cessepool we call the "whitehouse" indicating that the shithead attorney general of ours eric holder will have offered else have been asked by the obamarama "administration" for his resignation.

here's a college photo of this dangerous "useful idiot" from 1973:




(at least he wore a belt and didn't walk around showing 12" of boxer shorts and a zillion tattoos all over his body back then...)

meanwhile, back to the resignation announcement...

you know that they routinely do that sort of thing on friday's so that the leftist, socialist, obama-adoring "lamestream media"--nbc, cbs, abc, cnn, msnbc eta. al.--can proceed to ignore it for as long as possible while most of the low information voters (and some good, nice, innocent people) are not paying attention) are busy attending softball games else washing their cars and laying around their bar-b-que grills.

that said, all i say now is this...

whether it was "asked for" or offered freely under duress...

i say that in the end if things work out the way i hope that when the sun rises on the first monday in june 2013 that there could be one less corrupt, contemptible, useless anti-american half-breed working from inside the imperial by-god gummerntment of the united states of 'merica screwing the folks on the street like you and me that not only pay their bloated salaries but see their money pissed away every day of every week of every year.

what bothers me most is that in earlier times the citizens would have taken things into their own hands with torches and pitch forks and that this bastard would have been already relegated to joining bobby kennedy to an early grave but the chicago thug security details they have protecting his stupid mustache have kept him at the helm of screwing up everything from "fast and furious" to this latest bs we've all had to pay him to orchestrate."

regarless of the method and the timing, i say his departure is a good thing  as he moves on into thee anus of history.

new garden plot





my back hurts just thinking about planting this thing...

i'm not going to apologize again for my absence here on the www...

but i will offer this photo of ways i've been too busy to write. 

this one is of little missy the turbo pup inspecting our new garden plot i got tilled up this week. 



it's 36 feet wide and 102 feet long (don't ask me how i came up with the dimensions) and the tiller bottomed out about 10 inches deep. 

that right there is a lot of area and dirt to work...you know? 

stay tuned to this channel for ongoing progress reports. 

and until then...

 regard's y'all..

head nigger what be in charge





crazy on a godless ship of fools...

it occurs to me this morning--the first day of the year 2013--that i and everyone like me that grew up in the 1960's and 1970's is pretty much screwed...

...because if we actually care about our country and our planet we are still pretty much forced to sit around watching useless lying idiots run the show and decide how to spend all the money stolen from the aforementioned i and everyone like me and how it is being spent operating this place...

...the place i once fondly refered to as the by god united states of 'merica...

...and that would be because we live in a nation oday occupied now by primarily godless, useless, snivelling, booger eating, tree hugging fornicating aborting dope smoking government subsidized tobacco using idiots.

and these same feckless, useless idiots vote to empower the government and government representatives to come to my office and my house with the possible use of deadly force, and steal money from me and my family in order to pay for their inane, feckless, lifestyles and hobbies and kim kardaschian and dancing with the stars adoring habits.

the good news for me personally is that i am 53 years old rather than 23 years old and thus i will probably only have to hang around to see another couple of two or three decades of this soap opera representing america's demise at the hands of "illegal immigrants" and jessie jackson/al sharpton following idiot negros/african americans/nigras/niggers that have been handed and squandered bizillions of taxpayer $$$ since the 1960's to correct their problems supposedly induced by 1700's/1800's slavery.

all i have to say is this about that:

screw obama and screw all you assholes that voted for him and the commie/socialistic democrats...

and screw all of you assholes that run around campaigning for political office as so called republicans.

imagine this...as i sit here helplessly watching your idiot ways...

it is i indeed that has the last laugh because i will end my days here on this planet while you wake up and realize what you have stolen from and done financially to your children and grandchildren and their grandchildren.

you pissed and shit in everyone's drinking water...you fucking selfish idiots.

you took a great, unbelievable country that had survived the fucking british empire and the french and the god damn russians/ussr, and you screwed it up in the name of "womans rights (abortion and fee government supplied contraception) and helping all of the tatooed, pierced, sluts and whores and whore mongers you call your granddaughters and grandsons "feel better" and "have self respect" when you know what?

self repect is earned you fucking idiots...it is not a government mandeted right or entitlement.

and you idiots...you smile in public as you walk around with your half breed negro/mulatto darling little  chirrun children which erupted from diseased viginas and out of wedlock births resulting from copulation between your daughters and ignorant, useless fucking nigger men which posses no morals or job skills.

can you say nba and national football league "athletes" and rapper punks?

here's an idea i like for dinghy harry reid and nasty pelosi and dopey joe biden and head nigger obama to champion...
how about starting a tax that will pay for guns so eric holder can give them away on this side of the border and even more of these black bastards will shoot and kill themselves and each other before they can stick their penises in any more of the women of other races which they are intent on impregnating and then not supporting?

and perhaps these pants dragging the ground home boy rapper wanna be's will be dead  before they can come to beat my head in at a pizza hut or come to my house so i will have to shoot their stupid nigger asses and end up in jail for two years like that poor guy 
i'll give half my income to a tax like that.

you know?

my thoughts on the election?





i defer to quoting other men's words... 

"...democracy is the theory that the people know what they want—and deserve to get it good and hard."

“the people have spoken . . . and they must be punished.”

strange women lying in ponds





government we all can't afford to own... 


i'm up early this morning in order to go stand in line before my polling place opens and cast my vote and get to work hopefully by 8 am. oklahoman's are quite determined about this election with early voting lines stretching for five or six hours over the weekend. 

i really don't give a darn how long it takes...i'm speaking out against the insanity i've witnessed over the past four years regardless of if it costs me a half vacation day. 

and you need to get off of your ass and go vote yourself (unless you are an idiot obamamaniac then head on over to the food stamp office or the disibility office and check in...they miss you over there.)
