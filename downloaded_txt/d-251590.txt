 online resource for single parents

nobody understands the single parenting life as well as other single parents do! here at singleparents.org we want to bring together all those parents out there willing to share, ask, laugh and learn about the often adventurous times-good and bad- singleparents just like you are experiencing. 
this one-stop resource will help you with practicalities. thinking about further education for example? while you may have your heart set on college, the piggy bank might not be exactly overflowing with spare cash. don't give up! we'll help you find scholarships for single dads that will get your foot on that first rung towards success.  it makes sense to take advantage of continuing education opportunities. the older our children get, the more we think about the ever increasing cost of raising them.
and ladies, we'll also include places that offer scholarships for single moms too of course. be assured you weren't forgotten! we recognize that single parents come from different walks of life and are all individuals - moms, dads and even grandparents are fulfilling the single parent role nowadays, just like our ancestor before us. not everyone is interested in college for example. we can all appreciate that our beloved children, much as we love them all dearly, are expensive though!
we understand money can be a major worry. being a sole provider isn't easy, especially when your finances are already stretched. we'll provide you with financial resources, tips and articles to help you save money or spend more creatively and make the most of every penny. every tip will be tailored towards your circumstances, such as how to find insurance for a single parent specifically or affordable vacations designed for you and your children. need advice on managing your rent, mortgage or utility bills? we're on it. perhaps your needs lean more towards matters of the heart than the wallet. it can be a lonely job raising a child by yourself. you can find friendship, support and companionship in our community. share your life, seek advice or just let off steam! there's no need to feel isolated a moment longer.
ready to take the next step and discover if single parent dating is really that much different?  we're here for you, whether you want to ask questions or find that special someone. because let's face it, conversing with your five year old on that topic isn't going to get you far! :) when you're flying solo, grownups aren't always on hand to talk to. we're the next best thing.
of course to keep up with your kids and busy lifestyle, you need to be healthy. we'll share how to keep your mind, body and spirit at optimal levels. want to boost your energy reserves? be more organized? know where to find babysitters and nannies you can trust? we'll cover topics like this and more to give you excellent tools for a healthier, more contented life. 
thanks for coming! we’d like to extend you a warm welcome and are confident you’ll love our site as much as we do.
