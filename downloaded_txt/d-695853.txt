our philosophy









our philosophy



la cabaña sugar mill began with the desire to take advantage of the natural wealth of the surrounding area to supply the sugar market of the time and, eventually, the market for its subproducts.
 
but beyond wanting to enrich the landscape, the mill becomes the seed that germinates a large community of committed individuals.
 


our mill is a place where each worker plays an essential role in the process; each person has the freedom to propose, innovate, and excel. everyone is important, they feel like part of a family and are happy to work in this magical place.

our history









our history



1920 - 1930
we began as a cane grinder that eventually became a sugar mill that competed with 28 other mills operating in the country. it was a family business that began to give back to the surrounding community, developing its philanthropic side. at that moment, the spirit of la cabaña was forged, from which, in turn, a great community was born.
 
1960 - 1980
market demand grew, and we grew with it. we brought our technology and machinery up to date.


1990 - 2010
we raised the level of efficiency and productivity, planting new seeds in the form of values, which began to grow in the heart of our collaborators. the industry went from being ruled by volume to being measured by its quality, and the demands of the international market pushed the mill to specialize and to look for diversification.
 
today
now we are constantly growing and learning, ready to face the changes of the future and conscious of our commitment to our neighbors.

agroindustrial services



in 1998, agroindustrial services was created as a subsidiary of la cabaña sugar mill, with the objective of leasing, managing, and acquiring properties for the cultivation of sugarcane and thus guaranteeing a stable supply of raw material to the sugar mill during strategic moments of the harvest.
 
in the beginning, the company leased properties close to the sugar mill, planting the most suitable varieties of sugarcane for the area, considering variables such as climate, soil type, nutrient absorption, etc., looking for the highest productivity, with production models based on the best agricultural, environmental, and social practices, generating progress and welfare for the neighboring communities.
 


in later years, the area of influence of the subsidiary was extended from northern zone to the southern zone of the country, incorporating property management schemes that offer such services as control and monitoring of crops, agricultural advising, and programming for fieldwork, cane maintenance, and irrigation.
 
timely support in providing solutions for our sugarcane farmers, contributing to the strengthening of the national sugar agroindustry, through better agricultural practices, process certifications and a continuous improvement approach, these are the raison d'être of agroindustrial services.
