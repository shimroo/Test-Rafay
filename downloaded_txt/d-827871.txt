right to work (for less)






unions









false claims, false promises:  why âright to workâ is wrong for everyone






 
wrong for workers
â¢these laws drive down wages for all workers, including non-union members, women, and people of color.
workers living in right-to-work states earn about $1,500 less per year than workers in states without these laws. the wage penalty is even higher for women and workers of color.
 
â¢workers in right-to-work states are less likely to have health insurance.
the rate of employer-sponsored health insurance for workers in right-to-work states is 2.6 percentage points lower than in states without these restrictions.
 
â¢right to work makes workplaces more dangerous.
 according to data from the bureau of labor statistics, the rate of workplace deaths is higher in right-to-work states.
